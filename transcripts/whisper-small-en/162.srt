00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:16,200
Hey, Sarah. Welcome to the show. I'm super excited to be speaking with you today. This

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,760
has the potential, of course, to be a 10-hour podcast, which it won't be, but I think that

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,780
speaks to the depth of insight that you've got into so many topics that I actually want

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,300
to talk about. Thank you. It's great to be here.

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,940
In thinking long and hard about how to navigate all the threads I want to pull on, I figured

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,540
we would just start with the nerdiest of all topics, which is something that I know you're

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:51,580
so passionate about, and yet I don't think gets nearly enough attention. That is basically

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:59,620
the role of dietary intake of both carbohydrate and fats and the relationship that has on

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,740
the distribution of fatty acids within the body. Let me just start by asking, why is

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,380
that even of interest to you? Well, it's significant interest because it

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:19,660
really hits at one of the things people criticize a low-carb, high-fat diet about is, oh my

13
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:27,700
goodness, you'll get more fat in your muscles, in your liver, and it's going to lead to increased

14
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,060
insulin resistance, and thereby default going to lead to increased cardiovascular disease.

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:44,140
We know that a therapeutic carbohydrate restricted diet brings down so many cardiovascular risk

16
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:50,300
biomarkers that we're all used to hearing about. Okay, it decreases triglycerides. Okay,

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:58,500
it actually can reverse type 2 diabetes in most cases, and certainly significantly improve

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:07,740
glycemic control in all. But fatty acids, that's not something that's talked about all that

19
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,460
often. And what is talked about all that often is this idea of you are what you eat, right? We

20
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:23,500
hear that still every day. Remember, you are what you eat. And this example of what happens when you

21
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:34,620
consume saturated fat in the matrix of a diet that includes carbohydrate restriction is so against

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:45,180
that long worn out idea of you are what you eat. And so fatty acids play a critical role. Study after

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:54,380
study will show us in cardiovascular risk and in future diabetes risk as well. But again, it's not

24
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,660
discussed because fatty acids are confusing, let's face it, okay? And most people would rather just

25
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:10,380
fall back on this idea, you are what you eat, which just really flies counter to what the

26
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:19,020
evidence in the peer reviewed published literature says. So maybe taking even a greater step back

27
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:27,020
from that, Sarah, what is it that attracted you personally as a physician towards the management

28
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,740
of type 2 diabetes? Because, I mean, that's how you and I got to know each other was through a

29
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,020
company that you're a big part of called Virta Health, which I'm sure at some point today we

30
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:46,620
will talk about. But what attracted you to this patient population? And how is it that you stumbled

31
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:55,260
upon the idea that there was perhaps another way to treat patients with type 2 diabetes that was not

32
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,820
kind of the standard treatment, which was chasing glycemic control with insulin or

33
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:12,380
insulin increasing drugs? Well, I tell you, it's by accident. If you had told me 20 years ago that

34
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:21,340
I'd be playing this role in the healthcare system, I probably wouldn't have believed you. So it goes

35
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,540
back again to the fact that for a very long time, I mean, I've been in the world of obesity care

36
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:36,540
for well over 25 years now. And just the first half of that was telling people that the way to

37
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:44,380
fix everything was to eat a low calorie, low fat diet. I grew up as a product of the 80s,

38
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:51,100
like so many people where that was the dogma and there was no other way. And of course,

39
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:59,260
entering into college and grad school where I got both my bachelor's and master's in exercise

40
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,220
physiology, I mean, that's what we were taught. Moving on to med school, reaffirmed once again.

41
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,620
So when I went into practice as a primary care physician, I'm board certified in internal

42
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:20,540
medicine, it was more the same. But again, it was so frustrating to me, all along the way,

43
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,700
really to be continually giving this advice and then have people show up being worse.

44
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,940
I'm not making them healthier, I'm making them or I'm watching them become more unhealthy. And that

45
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,820
was depressing. And it was really quickly became just to the point where it was like, I can't

46
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,860
continue on with primary care for the rest of my life because I felt like a legal drug dealer.

47
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:56,060
I got really lucky here. Okay. I like to say a lot of my pivots are pivoted on anger, right?

48
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,540
Pivots in my career. And I was really angry at what was happening on the primary care level.

49
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:09,340
And as luck would have it at Indiana University Health, they knew about my background, knew about

50
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:16,140
my past work in obesity care and asked me to start a program, obesity program. And I jumped at the

51
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,940
opportunity and I was lucky to be able to take some time off over the next year, spend time

52
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:30,060
figuring out what was this going to look like? How are we going to tackle the untackable, if you will,

53
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,140
problem that is obesity? And I started sticking my nose in the literature, which is something that

54
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:45,180
every physician wants to do, but not every physician is afforded the time. Let's face it,

55
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,700
we are just boom, boom, boom, see patients. There's just such a busy lifestyle in everything

56
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:59,020
right now, but I was given a chance to step back some. So I had time to prepare for this. And in

57
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:08,300
that I discovered carbohydrate restriction as a means to weight loss initially. I listened to some

58
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:16,780
lectures by Dr. Steve Finney and Jeff Fullik. And I was like, whoa, that makes total physiologic

59
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:24,860
sense. And so boy, did I dig deeper into this. I read everything I could get my hands on and really

60
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:34,060
came to the conclusion, which required a lot of cognitive dissidents overcoming that what I had

61
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:40,220
been saying, you know, for well over a decade to so many people was really not founded on good

62
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:48,700
science. And that the field of carbohydrate restriction while still relatively in its

63
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:57,020
infancy at the time showed much more promise. And so we opened the clinic as a carbohydrate

64
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,580
restricted clinic. But the fact of the matter is, although people were losing weight, what we were

65
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:10,540
seeing that was so much more meaningful was that people's diabetes was like going away. They were

66
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,740
having normal blood sugar. We were pulling them off of insulin at rates that I could never have

67
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,860
believed had I not been the physician who was taking care of these patients. I was astronaut.

68
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,980
Sarah, just a couple of questions.

69
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,420
Hundreds of units of insulin.

70
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,220
Sorry, just to interject. Did you, first of all, there's two questions, I guess I want to ask you.

71
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,020
One, were these patients primarily patients with type 2 diabetes or was it primarily obesity

72
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,940
of which a subset had diabetes? And secondly, how much resistance did you have in your own institution

73
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,580
when you showed up and said, hey, I know you guys brought me in to do this thing. I'm going to do it.

74
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,940
But oh, by the way, my secret sauce is going to be this at the time, very unconventional approach.

75
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:59,500
Great question. So as you probably can imagine, when patients come into an obesity clinic,

76
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,380
most all of them, if not all of them, have some form of metabolic disease,

77
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,820
you know, the biggest being type 2 diabetes. So we were seeing type 2 diabetes all of the time,

78
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:19,980
consistently daily. And you're right. I had to take precautions because again, this was 10 years ago.

79
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:29,100
And not as much about carbohydrate restriction was known at that time, certainly among general

80
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:36,780
practicing physicians in any discipline, really. And so I knew that I had to head off the potential

81
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,700
resistance that was going to come. There was just no question of it. So I actually went about and

82
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:52,540
spent an entire summer meeting with all the departments in our local med center and giving

83
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:59,980
them a 15 minute slide presentation of when your patient comes back, says that Dr. Hallberg told

84
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,500
them to eat a lot of fat and not a lot of carbohydrates, that I wasn't crazy, that this

85
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,140
was actually based on evidence. And here it was. And you know, Peter, you'd be surprised. I didn't

86
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:18,540
get any pushback. I actually pushed it even to the next level. I was part at that time of the

87
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:26,700
ambulatory quality committee at our institution. And I actually brought up a amendment that all

88
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:35,420
patients with metabolic disease should at least be provided the option of trying this if they wanted.

89
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,660
And it passed unanimously. I mean, people got it. Once they had time to pause, take a look at the

90
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:49,020
physiology behind this and realize, okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it changed my life.

91
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,100
Right. And again, I like to always say my career is built of inflection points of anger.

92
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,700
And as we were seeing these huge changes of diabetes and patients just resolving their

93
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:09,020
diabetes, I became really angry because I was like, where is this? Where is this in the guidelines?

94
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,300
How come I've never heard of this before? I mean, this is, you know, I mean, I hate to be

95
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,740
like over dramatic, but it truly is quite miraculous for a disease that everyone thought

96
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,220
was chronic and progressive to see people recover from it. It's quite astounding.

97
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:34,620
And so I decided that I needed to get into research. So actually, to start off with,

98
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,860
I called Purdue University's nutrition program and asked one of the researchers there if they

99
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,180
wanted to help me on just an early unfunded pilot study to prove my point, looking at metabolic

100
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,420
improvements and looking at financial improvements too, because obviously, if people weren't taking

101
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,580
all this medicine, they weren't costing themselves and of course the healthcare system as a whole as

102
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,580
much money. And so I talked about that study presented at the National Lipid Association

103
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:14,620
quite a long time ago, talked about it actually in my TED talk, and then was speaking at the

104
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:21,740
Obesity Medicine Association quite a long time ago and actually met Dr. Steve Finney.

105
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,460
And that really changed the course of my life as well.

106
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,740
So all this time, you're sort of putting into practice what Steve and Jeff had been writing

107
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,900
about for a long time. And obviously, Steve is someone I've been dying to have on the podcast,

108
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,140
and we were actually supposed to do it at one point in time, and then scheduling got in the way.

109
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,420
But I didn't realize that you had already sort of gone down this path and yet hadn't actually

110
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,900
met him because I took the opposite approach, which was when I started kind of implementing some of

111
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,620
these treatments, I'm just a bull in a china shop. I just reached out to Steve right away.

112
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,220
I might have been one of the first people to get a copy of the book that he and Jeff wrote in 2011.

113
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,380
I think I got a pre-print of that book, which I still have by the way. The Art and Science.

114
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,420
The Art and Science book, which I have. It might have more highlights and

115
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,380
post-its in it than any book I own. Because I think like you, I was kind of going through the,

116
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:29,100
this can't be. There's something so counterintuitive to this that I need to read this over

117
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,660
and over and over, going to make sure I get it. So it's funny that that's the case. Now, tell me,

118
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,540
were you at this time going to ADA meetings, the American Diabetes Association meetings?

119
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,580
And when you would discuss what you were seeing in your practice with your peers,

120
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,020
who were also on the front lines, taking a more traditional approach,

121
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:58,300
how was your experience being, how was that met? Well, it's interesting. If someone,

122
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:10,380
if I was speaking with someone who took care of obesity patients for obesity, they were totally,

123
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,580
I get it. I'm doing the same thing to some varying degree. But when you moved out of that

124
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:25,980
space to other sub-specialists, the first thing was, oh yeah, their diabetes will go away, but

125
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:33,820
you're going to kill them with heart disease. Or, oh, we all know it works. I'll never forget one

126
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,260
of the leaders in the endocrine movement said, look, we all know it works. This is not a secret,

127
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,060
but nobody can stay with it. And I was like, I don't know here in my practice. I have thousands

128
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:53,340
of patients that would beg to differ with that. And so those are the feedback that I got. And so

129
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,180
one of the things was I knew that there had to be even more research done. I mean, we had wonderful

130
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:10,140
pioneers in Steve and Jeff and Eric from Duke, Westman. But we needed even more. They needed to

131
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,500
be larger trials. They needed to really specifically focus on patients with type 2 diabetes, because I

132
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,940
was convinced almost from the get-go that that is the target population here, because that's where

133
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:31,100
we see the biggest improvements. And so this CHANCE meeting with Steve at a obesity medicine

134
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:39,340
association conference led to a dinner and led to funding of the large clinical trial that

135
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,780
we're actually wrapping up in the next couple of months. Right now we're at the tail end of our

136
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:53,500
five-year data collection of the longest and largest trial looking at nutritional ketosis as

137
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:00,700
a means of reversing type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, which I'll just kind of stick in really quick here.

138
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:08,940
Today actually happens to be the day that the prediabetes paper was published. So I'm really

139
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,580
proud to say this is the eighth paper already that's come out of this large trial, started by

140
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:23,980
a CHANCE encounter at a conference. And we haven't published the prediabetes results until today. So

141
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:35,020
this was a paper that looks at the first two years of prediabetes utilizing remote continuous support

142
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:41,820
to help patients adhere to a diet aimed at nutritional ketosis. And Sarah, these are

143
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:53,900
patients defined as prediabetic by hemoglobin A1c? Correct. And that's being defined as 5.7 to 6.4,

144
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:00,380
is that the range? That's correct. Okay. Tell people what that means. I think most people

145
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,900
are aware of what a hemoglobin A1c is, but what does that translate to in an average glucose

146
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,660
approximately? Yeah. So we really start to get, for example, fasting. That's the one most people

147
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:18,380
are familiar with. And once you get a fasting glucose over 110, that's the worrisome

148
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:26,060
prediabetes range. And I do have to say here though, that doesn't mean normal glucoses

149
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:32,700
are okay for everyone. And I think you've had many people on here talking about the perils

150
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,980
of insulin resistance and how it starts to cause significant problems in people who still have

151
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,820
normal blood sugars. And I just think that's such an important point and can't be overstated again.

152
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:53,820
But in this study, we're looking at people who had insulin resistance long enough that their

153
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,980
pancreas and the beta cells could not keep up with the insulin that was needed to keep blood

154
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:08,700
sugar normal and their blood sugar started to rise. Not yet to the level where a diagnosis of

155
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:17,740
type 2 diabetes could be made, but once again where we see the impact of insulin resistance

156
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:26,540
affecting the body's ability to keep blood sugar normal due to pancreas being overworked

157
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,420
for far too long. And if we believe that, I mean, I don't know what the latest numbers are, but I'm

158
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:39,420
guessing it's still about 10% of the US population has type 2 diabetes. Is that approximately correct

159
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:47,500
or is it, are we more than 10% now? Approximately with also the caveat of much more concerning

160
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:54,780
levels in different minority populations, which of course hopefully we'll get a chance to talk

161
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:02,620
about later is just a huge goal with improving health equity in this country. So if it's 10%

162
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,780
in all comers, do you have a sense of what it is in Hispanic and African-American populations?

163
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,340
Yeah, it gets even higher. It's well into the teens and those and Pacific Islanders as well.

164
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,980
So these are populations that, you know, we need to be paying attention of course to everyone who

165
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,900
has type 2 diabetes, but we also need to be paying attention to who's at greater risk.

166
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:31,260
So what percentage of the population do we believe is in the pre-di-formally in the pre-diabetic

167
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,260
camp, which again, I think what you said a moment ago is very important for people to understand.

168
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,700
If we go back to the podcast with Jerry Shulman, which is one of my favorite discussions ever on

169
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:47,420
the topic of insulin resistance. I mean, Jerry really laid out elegantly the long time course

170
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:55,420
of this disease. And even, you know, even if you have normal fasting glucose and fasting insulin,

171
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,660
but that early sign of elevated postprandial insulin is really that early sign of insulin

172
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:07,260
resistance that will then lead to postprandial glucose elevations. And even that can still

173
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,500
exist in the presence of normal fasting glucose. So to your point, by the time someone registers

174
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,260
as a pre-diabetic, quote unquote, I mean, this has been a process that's been going on for 5 to

175
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:26,300
10 years. What is our belief about how many or what percentage of Americans just to make it,

176
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,300
you know, American centric for a moment, what percentage of Americans are in that bucket?

177
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:37,180
Well, I tell you, you know, studies, recent studies will show us that over 50% of Americans,

178
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:44,940
adult Americans have diabetes or prediabetes. And a study released a couple of years ago,

179
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:54,060
and I mean, this, this should shock everyone to its core based on NHANES data that 88%

180
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:00,620
of Americans are not in optimal metabolic health. I mean, let me say that again. 88%

181
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:07,820
of adult Americans are not in optimal metabolic health. And that is by looking at NHANES data

182
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:16,460
and taking a look at the criteria for metabolic syndrome. And so, you know, the 12% are those

183
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,340
who didn't meet any of the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Okay. I mean, that's frightening. Yeah,

184
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,500
so I was going to, I was going to ask you if that's exactly what it meant. So just let's state

185
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,220
for the, for the listener, what metabolic syndrome is. We've certainly discussed it on this podcast,

186
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,540
but it would be great to remind people, what are those 12% doing? They have none of the following

187
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,500
five, right? They have normal blood pressure, though they do not have elevated blood pressure.

188
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,980
And again, and they're not on medication, they're not taking medication to lower blood pressure.

189
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,580
And normal is now being much more stringently defined, but I believe the latest CDC definition

190
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:59,980
of normal is less than 130 over 80. In our practice, we advocate less than 120 over 80.

191
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,860
They have normal fasting glucose, and that's defined as less than 100. They have normal

192
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,940
triglycerides, which are being defined as less than 150. We argue in our practice, that's very

193
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:20,220
high. And anything over 100 is elevated. Totally agree. They have normal HDL cholesterol, which for

194
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,420
men is defined as greater than 40 milligrams per deciliter for women greater than 50 milligrams per

195
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,700
deciliter. And they do not have truncal obesity. And I forget, I think for men that's defined as

196
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,060
40 inches of waist circumference in women 36. I don't know if that's, if that's still the latest.

197
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,940
Well, yeah. And I will also point out one really important thing here when it comes to waist

198
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,020
circumference too. And the definition of metabolic syndrome, and it little bit goes back to what I

199
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:57,980
was saying before about the consideration of minorities in different ethnic populations,

200
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:08,620
which is we have to take the, that into account, even when we're defining metabolic syndrome.

201
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:17,420
Because for Southeast Asians, they are defined as having metabolic syndrome at a much lower

202
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,980
waist circumference. And for African Americans, we need to really consider as well because they tend,

203
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:32,940
even in the face of having insulin resistance, they tend to have normal triglycerides and HDL.

204
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:40,780
And so again, you know, we can't be treating everybody the same, but we often do.

205
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,740
Yeah, I'm glad you pointed that out. I still remember it was about 10 years ago when I

206
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,780
learned that lesson, which was, you know, taking care of an African American patient who had

207
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,620
about the most uncontrolled diabetes I'd ever seen, you know, hemoglobin A1C of 14%. This is

208
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,020
a person who's basically going to have their limbs amputated in the next hour. Triglycerides of 89.

209
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,300
Just, yeah, just totally normal. You look at their lipid panel, you wouldn't think anything is wrong.

210
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,580
Right. And so that's the thing is they can get missed. And so, you know, knowing this and

211
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,460
educating people on things like this, again, goes back to our working on health equities.

212
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:30,380
And it's so important and so often not something people take into account. And just going back to

213
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,700
prediabetes, you know, the most frustrating thing, I shouldn't say that it's one of the most

214
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,580
frustrating things. There are many things about our healthcare system I could enter into the most

215
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:51,260
frustrating. But one of them is patients coming in to see me whose lab showed prediabetes. And I

216
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,820
said, oh, you have prediabetes. Oh, no, no, no. My physician said I was fine. And so the, the fact

217
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:04,940
that we don't appreciate that by the time you get to prediabetes, there's some really serious things

218
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,340
going on here. You know, their, their vision is being impacted. You know, their nerves are being

219
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,340
impacted. You know, these are things we can't just say, oh, they haven't, they haven't gotten

220
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,900
bad enough to bother with because they're not at, you know, the criteria for type 2 diabetes yet.

221
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,980
I mean, we have to pay attention. And so if that's one thing, if there's any, you know, physicians

222
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:38,140
listening, which I know that there are, don't ignore any elevation in blood sugar. That means

223
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,060
there's been a problem for a long time already. And, and, and patients should be also hypervigilant

224
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,900
about this. I mean, I've seen patients in that prediabetic camp, and this is using an example

225
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,740
of a male patient when they're, when their insulin sensitivity is restored and their blood glucose,

226
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,620
you know, comes down by an average of 10 milligrams per deciliter, they'll say, wow,

227
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,900
I have better erections all of a sudden. And that speaks to even the microvascular damage that's

228
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,180
being done long before you get to diabetes. You know, I actually was exchanging emails with a

229
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:18,220
really good ophthalmologist recently and kind of trying to ask how far are we away from being able

230
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:26,380
to use retinal imaging as a screening tool for early, early, early microvascular disease? Because

231
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,300
I think the hemoglobin A1c is just far too crude a metric for this. And I actually have seen some

232
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,620
interesting literature, and I'm sure you've seen even more of it that suggests that this is, you

233
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,780
know, if you look at the microvascular in the eye, it might be one of the earliest warning signs of

234
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,380
when things go awry. And so in an ideal world, I would love it if, you know, we had, you know,

235
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,100
tech that basically allowed for quick and easy evaluation of that. So that to your point,

236
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,300
it doesn't really matter if your trigs are up or down and your waist is big or not, like let's

237
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,860
look at the actual place where the damage is taking place and make the assessment on an

238
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,860
individualized basis, as opposed to using these sort of population based metrics,

239
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,380
which move in the right direction, but for any one individual can be quite misleading.

240
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:19,260
Yeah. And then I love the eye discussion because, you know, one of the other, I think,

241
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:26,860
really important questions is once we do get to damage, can we make it better? Can we make it

242
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,020
better, you know, without and skip some of the horrors of having diabetic eye disease for

243
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:44,300
millions of patients? I mean, that is a really burning question for me. And one that I think we

244
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:53,100
need to really explore. Yeah, indeed. So with that background, let's kind of dive into some of this

245
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:01,340
nerdy, nerdy fatty acid stuff. And I got to tell you, I find this stuff really interesting in part

246
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:10,940
because I think it's complicated enough to make sense of just the eating side of this stuff. In

247
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,580
other words, you know, just for the listener, you know, I think people that have listened to this

248
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,220
podcast, we've done a number of shows that have dealt with fatty acids. People probably understand

249
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,060
that there are saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. The saturated

250
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:32,300
fats have no double bonds. So that means every carbon is fully saturated with hydrogen. The

251
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:41,260
monounsaturated have one and only one unsaturation. So one double bond and then the polys have at least

252
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:48,060
two of these double bonds. But it's the manner in which these things can be made from each other

253
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,580
that becomes quite interesting, isn't it? It's really the way that you can ingest one form and

254
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,300
it can be turned into another. So I'm wondering if the easiest place to begin this discussion

255
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:14,300
is to introduce what the fate of a very common fat in our body is, which is the C16 saturated fat. So

256
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:21,660
can you talk a little bit about how abundant that is and what our body's options are for? What it's

257
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,700
called? Let's start with the nomenclature. What does what does pure C16 look like? That's

258
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:35,420
palmitolytic acid. And so it's really interesting what happens. And do you mind if I jump on and

259
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,980
share screen here? Yes, please. A little bit more about it. Yeah, that would make it easier for

260
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:49,340
everybody, I'm sure. I want to start by talking about saturated fatty acids in general. Okay.

261
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,980
And what we know is that going back here to the basics and looking at the liver,

262
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,740
when we have incorporation of saturated fatty acids into our triglycerides,

263
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:11,500
okay, that is correlated with insulin resistance and adiposity, okay, likely reflecting accelerated

264
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:19,180
hepatic de novo lipogenesis, okay, or also it can be what is actually returned to the liver. So

265
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:27,580
really two. We certainly know that hepatic de novo lipogenesis is a big part of the problem

266
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,820
when it comes to elevated triglycerides, but we can also make these with some what is delivered

267
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:44,460
exactly back to the liver. And so when we see saturated fatty acids, okay, as a makeup of

268
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:51,820
triglycerides or maybe even the phospholipids there, we say, oh my goodness, that's a marker of

269
00:30:52,460 --> 00:31:00,140
increased saturated fatty acid consumption, right? These people are eating a high saturated fat diet.

270
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,620
And that seems to make sense. And this is the problem with a lot of things in science in general,

271
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:14,140
and nutrition science is no different, is that just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean

272
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:20,780
it's the way things actually work, okay? Sarah, can I explain a technical point on this slide that

273
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,260
you and I will take for granted, but I want to make sure that a listener understands. Absolutely,

274
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,020
please do. So when a patient goes and gets their blood drawn, let's just say they get a standard

275
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:38,220
lipid panel, it will spit out the following values. Total cholesterol equals 200 milligrams per

276
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:47,020
deciliter. LDL cholesterol equals 140 milligrams per deciliter. Triglycerides equal 150 milligrams

277
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:53,580
per deciliter. HDL cholesterol is 35 milligrams per deciliter. And VLDL cholesterol, if I remember

278
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,340
the numbers I just spit out, would be 25 milligrams per deciliter. In other words, the VLDL cholesterol,

279
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,020
HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol sum to the total, and then the triglycerides are independent.

280
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:13,260
What I want to make sure people understand is those are all found within the lipoproteins.

281
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:20,220
So VLDL cholesterol is the amount of cholesterol ester contained within the very low density

282
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:27,420
lipoprotein. LDL cholesterol is the total content of cholesterol ester found within the low density

283
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,900
lipoprotein, etc., for the HDL. Here's the part that's really interesting. We always check these

284
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:39,980
things fasting because when it comes to measuring the triglyceride, we want to eliminate what's in

285
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,900
the chylomicron. We want to eliminate the immediately absorbed triglyceride from the gut.

286
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:53,100
And by doing that, we basically capture what you have on this photo. When we measure a triglyceride,

287
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,660
for all intents and purposes, we are basically measuring the 90% of triglycerides that are

288
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:05,820
captured within the VLDL. Let me restate that because that was a bit rambling. When you go to

289
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,100
the doctor and get your blood tested, and it says your triglycerides are 150 milligrams per deciliter,

290
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:17,500
that's basically saying, look, 90% of that 150 milligrams per deciliter is within your VLDL

291
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,620
cholesterol. Some of that is in intermediate density lipoprotein, but that's virtually

292
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,700
non-existent. There's a trace of that in the LDL cholesterol and even a smaller trace in the HDL,

293
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:35,260
but it's the lion's share is in the VLDL cholesterol. And as you're going to explain to us,

294
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:42,220
this process of de novo lipogenesis, the conduit from fat being made in the liver and exported,

295
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,780
that conduit is the VLDL particle. That's going to become very important in this discussion.

296
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,140
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, and that's really important. Thank you for the precursor explanation

297
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,900
because this is technical stuff and that is really important for people to understand.

298
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:09,500
So then the next question really becomes, okay, so if we have a high saturated fatty acid content

299
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:20,060
within the VLDL, again, it's being in the triglycerides, the phospholipid membrane,

300
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:30,220
wherever we find it, where did the saturated fatty acids come from? Is it directly from

301
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:36,940
consumption? And I just want to first point out before we get into maybe more of the technical

302
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,300
stuff, some of the clinical trials that can help us understand this a little bit better.

303
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:51,660
And so this is one of my favorites by Dr. Brittany Volk that was published a while ago. And it's

304
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:57,900
really great because this was a feeding study. So, you know, they kept track of what the patients

305
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:04,220
were eating. It wasn't a free for all. Are they eating what they were telling them to eat or not?

306
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:10,300
They provided all of their food. And this was patients with metabolic syndrome. They went

307
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:19,020
through six feeding phases. And so they did a run-in with a very low carbohydrate diet for everyone,

308
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:26,700
less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day. And every three weeks they increased the carbohydrates

309
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:37,100
in the diet all the way up to 346 grams, which was C6 feeding phase. The other thing to note here

310
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:43,820
is the saturated fat content. So when we were at the low carbohydrate end here in C1,

311
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:54,620
they were consuming 84 grams of saturated fatty acids a day. Okay. So that blows away any guideline

312
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:03,180
on saturated fat. I mean, so far above what anyone would consider at goal. And then we get down to the

313
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:13,740
C6 and we're much less 32 grams. Again, what happens to the fatty acids as people are run

314
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:21,180
through these six phases? And Sarah, just to be clear, this is basically an isocaloric feeding

315
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:29,580
study, which means as you're ratcheting up the content of carbohydrate, you're commensurately

316
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:35,740
reducing at a caloric level, the amount of saturated fat, right? I believe this study did

317
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,420
not change the number of calories they were consuming or did it? Correct. They did not.

318
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:52,860
And so what happened to the saturated fatty acid levels in the blood and for that matter,

319
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:59,900
other fatty acid levels in the blood. So what happened over these six phases? Okay. So here we

320
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:07,900
have saturated fatty acid levels marked. Okay. So here's the baseline at that run-in. Okay. And we

321
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:16,220
see when we have the very high saturated fat level, very low carbohydrate. Okay. Here we go.

322
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:24,060
And what's really interesting is what happens as we march along here down to C6. And if you

323
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:32,300
remember, this is much lower saturated fatty acid content of the diet. Okay. Much higher

324
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:39,900
carbohydrate intake. What we see is that it's actually the saturated fatty acid content is

325
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:47,260
actually higher with the lower saturated fat intake. And we're going to come back and talk

326
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:53,020
to about the science behind that. But I think it's really important for people to see this clinically.

327
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:59,340
And then maybe when we get into a little bit more of the nitty gritty, it can make more sense. Okay.

328
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:05,980
I mean, it's actually statistically insignificant in terms of C16, right? Which is the dominant

329
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:14,940
saturated fatty acid. So, so palmitic acid, it trended towards an increase as saturated fat,

330
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:22,940
dietary saturated fat went down and carbohydrate went up, but it didn't reach significance. And

331
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:33,820
the only one that actually did significantly increase was C14, right? Yeah. Actually, C16,

332
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,820
one as well. And that one is we're going to send a little bit of time. Oh, yes. But, but, but,

333
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,020
but yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but as a saturated fat, it was really just, yeah.

334
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:49,180
Oh, as a saturated fat. Yes. Yeah. So. But the point of this is we didn't have these really high

335
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:56,380
levels of serum saturated fatty acids when we were consuming, when these participants were

336
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:03,180
consuming this very high saturated fat diet. Yeah. I mean, essentially, and this is important,

337
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:10,300
it stays the same. If anything, there's a trend, okay, to higher serum saturated fat

338
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:23,100
in the low fat arm. Okay. But certainly we do not see a rise in the high intake of saturated fat.

339
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:29,660
That's super important. And again, it goes against what I was saying earlier on, you know, you are

340
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,940
what you eat. Well, okay. If that's true, then when I consume a very high level of saturated

341
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:46,860
fatty acids, why am I not seeing that again in the blood in the serum? Why are we not seeing that?

342
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:55,340
And what's nice in this study is you've exhaustively looked at where the fatty acids are. So obviously

343
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:02,060
the most efficient place we store fatty acids is in the triglyceride, but you also store it within

344
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:10,460
the cholesterol ester and it's obviously in the phospholipid as well. But regardless of where you

345
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:18,700
look, you see no association between dietary saturated fat and fatty acid composition with

346
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:24,940
respect to saturated fat. That's right. That's right. And I want to really quick draw attention

347
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:35,420
here to one more that we are going to be talking more about and that's 16, one. That's palmitoleic

348
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,820
acid. And we're going to talk more about why that's important. But as we can see here, when we

349
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:51,100
follow that across, it significantly rises when we have less saturated fat and more carbohydrates.

350
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:57,260
And you can see that is statistically significantly different in every place that we're looking.

351
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:08,940
So moving on, when we take here a low saturated fat diet, low fat, low saturated fat diet,

352
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:17,260
and we compare it to a low carbohydrate, high saturated fat diet over 12 weeks. This is from

353
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:23,740
Jeff Volek's group from 2008. And what I like here is you can see very readily with these pie

354
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:32,620
charts exactly what the content of the two diets were. So again, we really have it flipped, you know,

355
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:41,820
high carbohydrate, low carbohydrate, low fat here on the left to a very high intake of fat on the

356
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:48,220
right. And again, below it, the two different levels of saturated fat that we're comparing,

357
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:58,380
12 grams to three times as high in the low carb diet at 36. So then these are both, these are both

358
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,220
really low calorie studies. Was this an ad lib feeding study or were these deliberately calorie

359
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:11,740
restricted? How was this study done? Yeah, these were both that wanted the calorie intake of

360
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,100
the two studies to be the same. So as you can see, there are about 1500 calories apiece. And were

361
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:25,580
they deliberately calorie restricted? Yes. Okay. So what we can see here is that what we have,

362
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:33,580
when we take a look at these two arms is taking a look on the right to the change in serum saturated

363
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:43,820
fatty acids. We can see in the carb restricted diet, you know, significant decrease versus the

364
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:51,260
low fat diet. So again, in the much higher saturated fatty acid arm, we see a significant

365
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:59,020
decrease down. Okay. Whereas we do see a drop in the saturated fatty low saturated fatty

366
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:06,780
acid intake group, but not nearly as much as we see with the carbohydrate restricted group.

367
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:14,380
Once again, you know, arguing against you are what you eat. And I want to now get in a little

368
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,860
bit more to this, what I think is actually even more important, which is the change in the

369
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:29,580
palmitic acid, excuse me, palmitoleic acid, get all these palm messed up when I try to talk about

370
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:37,180
it easier to just think of it as 16, one. Yeah. So, so palmitoleic acid is 16, zero. Palmitoleic

371
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:45,740
acid is 16, one. They look almost the same except that palmitoleic, the 16, one has that double bond

372
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:52,300
at the end seven position. And you're going to explain in a moment, which enzyme does that and

373
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:58,220
why that matters. Right. Right. Absolutely. You know, what is it about this? It's not a,

374
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:04,700
it's not a saturated fatty acid. So why do we care so much? What happens to 16, one,

375
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,260
but it's pretty evident here, what happens first of all. And then we'll talk about why

376
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:18,860
what happens is that with 16, one in the high saturated fatty acid group, it drops significantly

377
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:26,220
where in the low fat group, again, low saturated fatty acid group, it actually goes up. And this

378
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:33,660
is a statistically significant difference. Okay. Much more significant even as we look

379
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:41,420
than the change in the serum fatty acids. All right. So now I'm going to pull up a graph

380
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:47,420
of these results to look at it a little better. And then I want to get into the actual science of it.

381
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:55,900
This is the very low carbohydrate arm on the left and it is the low fat arm on the right.

382
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:05,020
And so what we see here, when we look at total saturated fatty acids, is that it has dropped,

383
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:17,100
okay, 5% between the low carbohydrate group and the low fat group, total saturated fatty acids.

384
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:26,300
What about the 16, one? And what we see here with the 16, one in much more significant

385
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:37,500
statistically is that we see between a low carbohydrate diet and a low fat diet,

386
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:49,740
that we have a more significant decrease in the 16, one with the low carbohydrate higher fat diet.

387
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,700
Now, so there's a couple of things going on here. Any questions or comments for there? Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,500
I think there's a couple of things going on for people that are going to be overwhelmed by this

389
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,900
table. And I apologize if you're just listening to this without watching it on video, I'll do my

390
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,980
best to explain what's going on here. So the first thing to notice here is both of these

391
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:17,020
groups of patients started out with quite elevated triglycerides. So in the first group, in the group

392
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:22,700
that was randomized to the very low carbohydrate diet, their average triglyceride at the start of

393
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:29,340
this study was 211 milligrams per deciliter. That's sky high. At the end of 12 weeks, it was down to

394
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:37,740
about 104 milligrams per deciliter. It fell by about 50%. Conversely, the group that started out

395
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:44,620
in the low fat arm, also very high triglycerides to start 187 milligrams per deciliter. By the end

396
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:51,900
of 12 weeks, they saw about a 20% reduction to about 150 milligrams per deciliter. Now this is

397
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:58,540
where these tables get a little bit confusing because the table is showing both the relative

398
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:07,180
and absolute reduction of the relative or constitutive fatty acid, in this case 16-0 and 16-1

399
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:13,420
and 7-2 we're talking about. What does that mean in English? It means that when you look at the total

400
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:21,260
amount of saturated fat reduction on a relative basis, both groups saw a slight reduction. But

401
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:27,180
it was statistically more significant in one group than the other. The low carb group was a 12%

402
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:34,460
reduction versus 5% in the low fat group. On an absolute basis, that difference was even greater

403
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:41,580
because the low carb group had such a significant reduction in total triglyceride as well. That's

404
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,380
the dominant source of where you're going to see these fatty acids. Of course, the reverse is true

405
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:56,940
when it comes to 16-1. Let's now ask the question, Sarah, what is it about palmitoleic acid

406
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,940
that you think is such an important biomarker? Because we wouldn't be having this discussion

407
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,580
if you didn't think we should be paying attention to this. Yeah, I think it's a really important

408
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:15,340
biomarker and if you would allow me, let me point out one other thing here regarding the triglycerides

409
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:24,940
because clearly the low carbohydrate arm decreased more in the triglycerides. The low fat arm

410
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:32,700
decreased too, which may come as a surprise to your listeners because we do associate low fat

411
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:39,980
with an increase in triglycerides. But I do want to remind everyone that this was a calorie

412
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:48,460
restricted. This was around 1500 calories. So that drop in the low fat diet arm, although maybe not

413
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:55,500
what we were expected, does make sense with the reduction in calories overall. Now, let's go back

414
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:04,620
and talk more about your question. I think palmitoleic acid, or again that's that 16-1,

415
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:17,740
is really not appreciated as the health predictor that it really is. So let's go through, I'm going

416
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:26,300
to just jump ahead a little bit here. So palmitoleic, or we like to call it POA, is a product of

417
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:37,020
something called sterile CoA desaturase. And sterile CoA desaturase is going to determine

418
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:45,900
what is going to happen with some of the fatty acids in our system. Specifically,

419
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:54,220
what's going to happen to POA? Now what we know ahead is that sterile CoA desaturase

420
00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:01,580
is actually an independent marker of triglyceridemia and abdominal adiposity. So in other words,

421
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:09,660
an independent marker of all those things that go along with insulin resistance. So if we have a

422
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:18,140
high levels of sterile CoA desaturase activity, right there we got to start thinking things may be

423
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:25,660
concerning even if someone has a normal blood sugar. Because right now I think one of the

424
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,900
important things based on the earlier part of our conversation where we say so many times these

425
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,820
things are missed, people can still have normal blood sugars, it's going to be really important.

426
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:43,900
You know, number one that we make everyone aware that a normal blood sugar doesn't mean that you

427
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:51,020
are healthy. But number two, what are some easy ways and some easy markers maybe that we can check

428
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:59,260
to know that we're headed for trouble even before we have blood sugar go up. Okay so plasma

429
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:09,740
triglycerides and let's take a look at again POA in those plasma triglycerides

430
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:19,980
in the way of looking at it in core tiles. So again low versus high and what we can see is the POA

431
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:31,660
all right the byproduct of sterile CoA desaturase is much higher the higher the triglycerides are.

432
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:40,620
Very important so if your triglycerides are really high again what's happening very likely

433
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:49,580
is that your POA is elevated as well okay brought about by increased activity of sterile

434
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:58,780
CoA desaturase. And this shouldn't be surprising right because if you look at the very you know

435
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:08,380
unfriendly diagrams of fatty acid metabolism one of the first steps we see in the conversion

436
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:21,580
of or elongation of fatty acids is the conversion of C16O palmitic acid into C161 palmitoleic acid

437
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:26,940
and seven through an enzyme that has two names I guess depending on the name of nomenclature right

438
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:33,980
so delta 9 desaturase desaturate the number nine carbon from the delta end also known as sterile

439
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:43,260
CoA desaturase which I think is the more popular name is SCD1 right. And if you go down that

440
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:50,060
pathway what you're basically doing is bundling and packaging fat to leave the liver right.

441
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:59,020
Yes and here is one of the that is an interesting point because the question is if we're trying to

442
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:08,300
change the serum saturated fats into something else okay I mean the body is obviously doing that

443
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:15,020
one would have to wonder is that a protection mechanism why do we want to do that?

444
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,500
Yeah to me that's a great question Sarah it seems counterintuitive if I'm going to be obvious because

445
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:28,380
we would think that a saturated fat is much safer it's inert there's no chance of reactive

446
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:34,380
oxygen species can be formed out of it. Why is it our body even if we wanted to export fat from

447
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,780
the liver which we could argue all the reasons that's not a great idea why would we go to the

448
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:44,860
trouble of this conversion? All right well let's go through it really quick and then get to answering

449
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:52,060
that question because I think it's really important and really sheds light on why we need to be paying

450
00:53:52,060 --> 00:54:03,180
more attention to the all-important POA and of course the precursors and enzymes that act in its

451
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:10,140
creation. So let's go through if you will this cartoon that I know looks really busy initially

452
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:18,300
but let me just kind of run through it starting here in the intestine and remember you know we'll

453
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:25,580
start off by saying our focus in healthcare and in nutrition recommendations for so long has been

454
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:30,780
low fat low fat more carbohydrates higher carbohydrates well let's take a look in the

455
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:38,140
intestine at those carbohydrates changing the focus for a minute. So they come in rapidly

456
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:46,940
absorbed carbohydrates or even are slowly absorbed carbohydrates are starches okay and what happens

457
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:54,620
when they come in right as glucose that feeds in again through glute two into the pancreas

458
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:05,820
pushing out more insulin insulin then feeds into the liver and what we get here okay is going

459
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:15,340
through it a big big part of this is SREBP1 okay and I don't know if we need to get that technical

460
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:25,740
but we'll lead here to that enzyme we were talking about the SCD1 or sterile coa desaturase

461
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:33,740
increasing okay very important and it comes about through other means as well fructose coming in

462
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:41,500
through glute five or glucose coming directly into the liver through glute two they're all

463
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:51,500
feeding into this by slightly different mechanisms to increase this SCD1. Now we're going to look

464
00:55:51,500 --> 00:56:02,060
more at the process in a different way so we have increased hepatic first of all saturated fat

465
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:10,300
okay here's our 16-0 the saturated fat all right increase hepatic levels of this

466
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:21,820
what gets turned on as from the past cartoon we get that SCD1 activity increasing that leads to

467
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:35,020
this increase in POA all right coming down here what's the end game here increased VLDL

468
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:46,140
all right same thing over here looking at it different we see again SCD1 if it's blocked

469
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:56,060
we won't see that all right we'll see a decrease in VLDL and this again has to do if this SCD

470
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:08,220
enzyme is blocked we're going to have an increase in the saturate a decrease in our POA okay but

471
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:17,820
again what we have when we're consuming the high carbohydrates even if they're the again

472
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:25,420
more refined carbohydrates or the less rapidly absorbed carbohydrates this is the path that we

473
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:37,340
wind up going on 16-1 is or 16-0 saturated fat is elevated and it turns on this cascade leading to

474
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:45,020
increase in VLDL I'll pause there before we go on if you had any comments that you wanted to add

475
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:49,260
here yeah again I think you know for folks that are watching this it's going to make a bit more

476
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,780
sense and if you're not I just want to make sure we're bringing you along for the ride so

477
00:57:54,060 --> 00:58:00,380
you know in the liver when you are taking C16 or C18 but let's just keep the discussion simple

478
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:08,540
and start with a saturated C16 it's the first committed step is going through SCD1 as an enzyme

479
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:15,500
and it adds that double bond it makes a few more steps along the way but ultimately it is

480
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,580
increasing a process of lipogenesis it is making more lipid it is increasing the amount of lipid

481
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,540
within the cholesterol ester and the triglyceride it is being exported from the liver so in response

482
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:33,180
to your question Sarah is this protective I guess the answer looks like the body is saying well gosh

483
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,820
I would rather get this fat out of the liver than keep it in the liver and we know that it's not

484
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:43,020
fully successful in doing that because of course although it hasn't come up yet on this discussion

485
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:48,460
everything we've talked about today runs hand in hand with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

486
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:55,820
which is truly an epidemic at the moment but I suspect that the body is still doing its best

487
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:00,060
even in the case of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to try to export this fat as much as

488
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:07,340
possible the triglyceride is a very efficient place to store it I've always believed obesity

489
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:13,740
is a protective mechanism I think that obesity is not the cause of metabolic illness but the

490
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:19,020
result of it which is not to say that the inflammatory environment that comes with it

491
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:25,580
doesn't pour more gasoline on that fire but I you know it is my belief that everything we're

492
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:33,020
talking about here is the body's aim to protect itself from an abundance of nutrition and so

493
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:38,300
that's how I read this is the body is doing and specifically the liver which is I arguably the

494
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,780
most important organ in this situation and the liver is really trying to protect us and it's

495
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:50,060
saying I'm making so much extra fat right now because you as my individual are so far above

496
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:54,940
your carbohydrate consumption tolerance your tolerance for carbohydrate consumption and this

497
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:02,060
is the most efficient thing I can do which is turn that into fat send it out via the VLDL get that

498
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,060
into the adipose site and yeah you're going to be a little bit fatter and it's going to come with

499
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:11,500
some downstream problems but in the short term it's protecting me the liver do you would you

500
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:19,820
agree with my teleologic view of that? I 100% would agree with it and again you know it's I

501
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:27,020
think that we're going to have more and more details on this coming out very very soon in

502
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:34,860
many research projects that are currently ongoing but what it really comes down to is you know we

503
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:43,900
want to know what an individual's carbohydrate tolerance is okay I mean that's key to personalization

504
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:51,260
right does everybody need to be very low carbohydrate low carbohydrate I mean where does we

505
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:57,340
can say population level what happens in large clinical trials but what's happening with the

506
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:03,660
individual because let's face it Peter and you know you and I as practicing clinicians know this

507
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:09,980
when you're sitting with one patient in front of you you can go over group data from a clinical

508
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:16,620
trial and that's important part of the decision making but the only thing that really matters

509
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:23,180
is what's going to happen with the patient right in front of you we really want to know what the

510
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:30,140
individualized reaction is going to be you know we know that this happens with a carbohydrate

511
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:36,780
consumption above a certain threshold but what that certain threshold is in the individual we

512
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:43,340
don't know and based on these pathways you know what is the marker we want to be looking at

513
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:53,500
actually it's probably POA surprisingly not a fatty acid but what this tells us is that when

514
01:01:53,500 --> 01:02:03,500
someone has consumed carbohydrates above their individual tolerance that POA level is going to

515
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:13,420
be a great biomarker it's going to go up as again a protective mechanism in the liver our livers are

516
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:19,340
really I mean you know we talk about livers all the time so related to insulin resistance it's just

517
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:26,380
always amazing just how sophisticated and how our livers although we think of them as producing

518
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:32,300
things that aren't necessarily good for us and that may be true they're also really working for

519
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:39,900
us as well and so again I want to also go back on one other thing that you said and the other

520
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:47,660
thing that you said is so this comes you know before the adiposity and I think that that is

521
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:55,020
such an important point and one I like to preach every opportunity I can get it but this is starting

522
01:02:55,020 --> 01:03:04,300
to happen before people gain a lot of weight okay this is a disease process in and of itself that

523
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:12,540
causes obesity so you know we have to really take that into account when we're in the office with

524
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:19,260
someone who's struggling for with obesity and I know Peter you take this really to heart of

525
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:26,060
approaching and treating these patients without bias and as I do but it's it's so important for

526
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:31,820
other providers to be looking themselves in the mirror and asking themselves you know what are

527
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:40,060
the biases I hold against patients who come to me struggling with their weight and what do I really

528
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:48,540
know about the science and what it really one must conclude is that this is not their fault okay

529
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:54,220
these are things that happened beforehand and they're suffering the consequences of it and the

530
01:03:54,220 --> 01:04:00,940
problem is the consequence is on full view for everyone to see it's not something that they can

531
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:07,580
hide and that makes them so vulnerable to bias in health care and again one of the other things I

532
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:14,540
come back to is part of our whole battle in health equity. So Sarah I want to keep digging into this

533
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:21,660
idea because it's so interesting to me of having a leading indicator for you know this early early

534
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,860
early warning sign you know I mean I we talked about it at the outset of this discussion which

535
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:33,180
is you know in some ways the tragedy of using hemoglobin A1c as the marker of when somebody

536
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:38,780
gets on the radar I mean you said it yourself patients will show up and nobody's ringing the

537
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:48,460
bell until their hemoglobin A1c is above 6.5 but I mean that literally is happening 10, 15 maybe 20

538
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:55,340
years after there were early early molecular warning signs and if measuring palmitoleic acid

539
01:04:55,340 --> 01:05:00,140
is one of them that's exactly the kind of stuff that I find interesting because in our practice

540
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:07,500
we use cgm a lot so continuous glucose monitoring is kind of you know we don't you know non-diabetics

541
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:12,140
are wearing cgm like it's no tomorrow in our practice because of that exact reason we're

542
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:16,860
basically holding them to a very high standard of average glucose and high excursions and all these

543
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:21,740
sorts of things. I want to go back to something that you alluded to which is the association

544
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:28,940
between palmitoleic acid and triglyceride is so tight that would we miss for example

545
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:37,100
african-american patients do we know if they are failing to synthesize cc16-1 in the way a white

546
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:45,420
patient is? Wouldn't we love to know that there's not been a good trial looking at that I mean one

547
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:51,020
of the problems that we have in research in general is that we tend to focus on white people

548
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:59,020
right you know and actually worse middle or upper middle class white people. So there are a lot of

549
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:07,180
questions with this in specific populations. There have been a couple of studies recently

550
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:16,300
coming out looking specifically at what we're talking about POA and its marker for future

551
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:23,980
problems and predictor of future diabetes and other issues. One was a study recently published

552
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:30,860
called the panic study looking at levels in childhood and seeing how they translate to health

553
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:37,340
consequences you know decades down the road and then there was another study I believe it was from

554
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:46,220
the netherlands where they looked at POA levels at 50 to correlate them with c-reactive protein

555
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:53,500
levels at age 70 right and what we see is what we would expect based on our our discussion here

556
01:06:53,500 --> 01:07:00,620
which is the POA was a predictor of problems down the road in people who were healthy when their POA

557
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:07,980
was elevated or healthy so we thought you know what we really want to know ahead of time and I

558
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:14,060
know this is very meaningful to you and your practice is I want the person who's healthy

559
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:22,380
so I can get to tell them how to stay healthy okay we we talk a lot about you know trying to

560
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,420
work on people who are already so so to speak behind the eight ball and we want to work them

561
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:35,020
out and we want to regress their disease clearly an important goal but we also really if we're

562
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:42,780
going to make a difference again with the individual and population-wide we need to know who's headed

563
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:49,660
for trouble. Well I mean this is again I hope there's an ongoing effort here because I think

564
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:55,500
this is the future of medicine right I mean I think the future of medicine has to be coming up

565
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:03,580
with tools that allow us to take broad sweeping you know population-based insights and very quickly

566
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:10,860
target individuals and if we have biomarkers like this that can say look the moment this is triggered

567
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:14,620
above a certain level it doesn't really matter what your glucose is and your insulin might still

568
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,260
be normal this is time to intervene and then of course the second part of that equation is what's

569
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:24,620
the right intervention and how do we pair people to the right intervention and and again you and

570
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:33,820
I have a very similar set of experiences which is patients with hyperinsulinemia and elevated

571
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:41,180
glucose generally respond well to carbohydrate restriction. My practice also focuses so much on

572
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:46,220
the role of glucose disposal and non-insulin dependent glucose disposal through exercise

573
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:53,660
and I know that you know that that's probably not a surprise to many people is is sort of correcting

574
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:59,660
the sleep exercise nutrition trifecta and then adding to that the the role of cortisol in all of

575
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:05,020
this so I don't know I think this is I think this is a very hard problem to solve that's the bad

576
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:11,820
news but I think the good news is if you get this one right you get a leg up on every chronic disease

577
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:17,740
so your risk of heart disease cancer Alzheimer's disease all go down

578
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:25,500
and and so it's worth this enormous effort to to continue pushing on these questions

579
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:31,660
and I think you know on that note too you know and when we talk about individualization and

580
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:39,580
risk prediction before we're seeing our classic you know biomarker issues come up has to do I'll

581
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:46,540
circle it back to carbohydrate restriction because we know very low levels of carbohydrate restriction

582
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:55,580
can you know reverse the disease process bring about normal glycemia in patients and be able to

583
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:02,220
get them off of medications but we could put a risk predictor like POA into wider use okay

584
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:08,380
which would give a person their individual carbohydrate threshold what if it didn't need

585
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:14,060
to be as low what if we caught them earlier in the disease process and we're like hey buddy

586
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:21,020
you go over you know 175 you know that's where trouble comes in rather than you know you need to

587
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:30,060
stay very low um you know indefinitely because we've caught you on the spectrum of the disease

588
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:36,940
you know so late and this is what we really need to do to control this to keep your glucose normal

589
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:43,260
without the use of these many medications especially insulin I want to ask you other

590
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:48,460
question on this Sarah um and again I don't know if it applies to patients that you've treated

591
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:54,940
with diabetes or those in the pre-diabetes category but have you have you treated patients

592
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:01,420
for long enough on ketogenic or very low carbohydrate diets who showed up in a state

593
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:09,020
of metabolic disarray ran through a lengthy period of this so you know maybe spent years on a

594
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:15,580
carbohydrate restricted protocol and everything gets better so they you know the weight goes

595
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:19,100
along for the ride but obviously and more importantly their metabolic markers improve

596
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,220
and they gradually reintroduce some amount of carbohydrate back in the diet and all of a sudden

597
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:31,340
they're fine almost as though you reset them during a long enough period uh how often do you

598
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:35,740
see that and what do you think is the best explanation for that see it all the time and

599
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:41,420
the best explanation for it is what is their insulin reserve what is their insulin reserve

600
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:50,380
so you know the majority of people um can go ahead you know starting out even at long-standing

601
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:56,700
diabetes um reverse their disease get normal glycemia um get off of all their medications

602
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:03,340
and then slowly reintroduce carbohydrates as long as they have functioning beta cells

603
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:10,700
okay the problem is you know the longer you've had diabetes clearly is a risk factor for this

604
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:15,100
and we can you know we see evidence of that in the bariatric surgery literature as well

605
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:22,700
i mean there's been so many studies looking at um beta cells um but you know and the fascinating

606
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:30,460
thing is who is getting back some of their beta cell function in other words maybe their beta

607
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:37,180
cells were only dormant and were able to you know wake them up again versus which are

608
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:45,420
gone and not coming back i mean the fact that people were on the incredibly high dose of insulin

609
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:54,220
okay starting on a very low carbohydrate diet and then they got better right away

610
01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:01,260
okay a lot of the change is swift but they couldn't get off insulin and it was just years

611
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:07,420
went by right and they're just staying on this much lower level of insulin and then all of a sudden

612
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:17,420
they come off of it i mean we logic would tell us that some sort of beta cell function has returned

613
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:24,540
it took a long time reset the system help them heal you know i mean we don't completely understand

614
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:30,060
this there's so many great scientists looking at this right now but we still don't have a certain

615
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,940
answer you know because the answers on the personalized level is how many are mine are

616
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:40,780
dormant how many of mine are dead right what's it going to take for me to wake these up you know

617
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:46,700
if it's impossible i'd like to know that because that sets expectations ahead of time right you

618
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,900
can get a lot better but there's always going to be a little insulin in your life it doesn't mean

619
01:13:51,900 --> 01:14:01,740
if they are someone who doesn't have any insulin production capacity that they can't get a lot

620
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:07,020
healthier but they may not ever be able to get off of insulin and so that's where it gets down

621
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:14,140
once again into that nitty gritty personalization aspect and wouldn't that be nice to know but i

622
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:21,100
think that the answer to the larger question is you know why is this happening that some people

623
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:27,900
can start to eat carbohydrates not anywhere near to where they were but they're able to put some

624
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:36,460
back into their diets versus people who can't is beta cell function um and i think something in

625
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:40,940
there that you said is very important that i don't think historically has been communicated

626
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:45,660
well enough to patients which is that insulin while an amazing and important hormone is not

627
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:51,020
benign and there's a big difference between taking 100 units of insulin a day to achieve normal

628
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:56,300
glycemia and taking 20 units of insulin a day to achieve normal glycemia and you'll take the

629
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:03,100
ladder over the former all day every day non-negotiable um and some patients will say well gosh i'm still

630
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:08,060
on insulin this hasn't worked and not realizing no you've had a five-fold reduction in your insulin

631
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:13,420
requirement that's an enormous improvement in your health outcome not and let's put the economics

632
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:18,700
aside the economics are enormous but ignore that for a moment just in terms of health outcomes

633
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:26,780
uh the the negative effects of hyperinsulinemia um yeah and it i just what would want to say

634
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:33,580
with that you know if we really think about the way we we manage diabetes okay rather than work

635
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:39,260
to actually reverse the disease process and get people off of medication i mean management

636
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:45,980
constantly leads to more and more and more insulin which we know i mean on the outward the the

637
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:51,100
appearance of it is that people gain more weight when they go on more insulin but you know if we

638
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:57,180
really get down to the nuts and bolts when we take someone with type 2 diabetes whose glucose is out

639
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:03,180
of control to the point where we need to put them on insulin the mandatory discussion that needs to

640
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:08,780
occur is i'm going to put this medic i'm going to give this medication this insulin that you're

641
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:14,780
going to inject to you okay um and i'm going to do that because your blood sugars are so high that

642
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:22,620
they could acutely kill you okay put you into the hospital put you at risk of all these complications

643
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:29,260
but i just want you to know you're more likely to die on insulin that's what we need to tell people

644
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:35,980
that's the truth and you know that would have changed the approach a lot of patients want to

645
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:42,940
take and it would certainly if if providers were forced to look at it that way when they're staring

646
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:50,140
each individual person in the face maybe they would treat it differently as well yeah i i i

647
01:16:50,300 --> 01:17:02,700
agree um so i want to talk about um something that that is you know been such a big part of your life

648
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:07,820
in the last few years and people who don't know you may be almost surprised at where we're going

649
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,860
in this discussion now but you know this discussion could basically continue down the path if we could

650
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,540
talk more about diabetes we could end this discussion here and and people would say wow

651
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:23,100
that's a really insightful thoughtful person but but there's a whole other side uh to to your

652
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:28,940
experience with healthcare sarah that started uh gosh four year almost four years ago um and i'll

653
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:33,100
tell it from just i'll tell the beginning of the story just from my end so you and i obviously

654
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:41,260
met each other uh through verta you're you know an early part of the the creation of this this

655
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:47,980
company which is basically scaling up a way to remotely treat patients with type 2 diabetes

656
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,100
uh this is a company of that that steve finney is also a co-founder of along with jeff olek i believe

657
01:17:54,700 --> 01:18:00,700
i have a minimal involvement in that company i'm a small investor and and at one point was an advisor

658
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:06,060
but it was during one of these advisory meetings that you and i happen to be sitting next to each

659
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:10,460
other now we've met many times before that but i do remember this very well it was i think june of

660
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:19,180
2017 it was up in san francisco a large u-shaped uh table in the room and you know it was a two-day

661
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:25,100
ordeal and you were sitting to my left and that gave us more time than than most times to be

662
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:29,900
chatting about this that and the other thing and uh you looked in perfect health as always and

663
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:34,780
at the end of the second day i said goodbye and see you next time and blah blah blah blah blah

664
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:41,020
and then about a month later i heard from a mutual friend that you had been diagnosed

665
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:47,980
with lung cancer um and i just about fell off my chair so can you tell people what happened

666
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:55,980
that summer the summer of 2017 yeah so you know i'll just start by saying i i've been someone

667
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:05,420
who's taken taking care of themselves to um the max you know all my life eaten well i've kept my

668
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:10,380
weight in a normal weight you know even nine months pregnant i would have still been considered normal

669
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:17,820
weight um exercise like crazy competed in you know half marathons triathlons olympic distance

670
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:27,180
you know i did everything right never smoked you know um never drank to excess um and you know it

671
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:35,900
was it was june 30th so right after that it was june 30th of 2017 i was having a normal day i was

672
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:44,620
went to exercise i had a big irb meeting in the morning went home um due to my wonderfully

673
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:51,900
full house of three kids and uh took a business call in the basement because that's was that's

674
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:58,300
always my escape place you know um where it can be a little less noisy and all of a sudden i couldn't

675
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:05,180
talk and i i couldn't figure out what was going on i knew something wasn't right but um i i couldn't

676
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:12,780
speak and um all i know is that i hung up the phone at some point because i was embarrassed i was

677
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:22,460
remember thinking there he's gonna think i'm drunk um and uh i hung up the phone and you know

678
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:29,660
the next thing i remember was being in the car with my husband and him saying i don't think we

679
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:37,420
could take you to urgent care i have just very flashes of this day and the next memory is in the

680
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:45,420
trauma bay at the hospital the hospital that i work at um where i had seen patients many many

681
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:50,140
times and i'll have to tell you the other thing is the last time i had been in that particular

682
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:58,700
trauma bay was when i brought my then four-year-old daughter in or my husband did i met them um via

683
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:05,660
an ambulance after a traumatic brain injury so it was like a very bad place for me although my

684
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:12,940
daughter completely recovered and i remember screaming at my husband that they're wrong

685
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:19,260
they're wrong and i wanted to see the computer because what had happened when they first came

686
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:25,340
in is they thought it was a stroke and so my poor husband was all the sudden tasked with you know

687
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:31,500
are you going to give her clot busting medication or not um because we think she's having a stroke

688
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:41,660
but lo and behold the imaging showed a really large tumor in my brain um and um then they

689
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:49,420
imaged the rest of me and it turns out i had multiple tumors in my chest um and so you know

690
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:55,820
they presumed you know correctly at that point that this was lung cancer but i also needed emergency

691
01:21:55,820 --> 01:22:02,460
brain surgery and this is all you know i i i remember most of this by people telling me about it

692
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:11,580
so um anyway the next day i did um had a virgin brain surgery and then

693
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:19,660
you know i being a physician in lung cancer you know i was like that can't possibly be you know

694
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:25,580
i have never smoked you know how do i have lung cancer i am the healthiest person i know i remember

695
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:30,380
being in the hospital because of course you know you're on drugs and everything else and and

696
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:35,020
shock and everything and i kept saying look at my nails these are the healthiest nails you've ever

697
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:40,220
seen how can this be a person who's sick because somehow that was like just one example you know

698
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:49,580
of how that's impossible talk about the stages of grief and denial right and um being a physician

699
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:53,740
and knowing what lung cancer meant the next thing that came out of my mouth is i want to move to

700
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:58,540
oregon because i was like i know what this means for me and i know what this means for my family

701
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:03,740
and i don't want to play any part in this i don't want them suffering can you tell folks what you

702
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:08,540
mean by that not everybody might understand the implication of what you're saying yeah i wanted to

703
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:16,060
go to oregon because they had physician assisted suicide because i you know i knew i have treated

704
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:24,460
so many patients with lung cancer i knew the horrible end i knew what this meant you know um

705
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:30,220
especially when it spread yeah and it had spread everywhere i mean i had stage four lung cancer

706
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:37,420
you know the day before i had been fine a hundred percent fine that morning i had exercised

707
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:45,740
vigorously and suddenly i'm in the hospital recovering from a brain surgery being told

708
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:54,700
that i have a rapidly fatal disease and you know all you can think of in that moment of panic is

709
01:23:54,700 --> 01:24:00,380
your family right and so you know my only thought was i don't want to watch i don't want them to

710
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:11,900
watch me go i want them to remember mom and so i mean there began my so far almost four year journey

711
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:25,180
of a new me you know i cancer changes you so i'm not that person you know and and one of the many

712
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:32,220
things is sometimes at this point in time you know i mourn that person i mean one of the things

713
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:39,580
that i think is very shocking for people to understand is that it's probably between 12

714
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:47,100
to 14 percent of people who get lung cancer are not smokers um and they all tend to get a certain

715
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:53,900
type of lung cancer you know lung cancer is broadly divided histologically by small cell and large cell

716
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:58,620
or non small cell i'm sorry and within the non small cell there's large cell adenocarcinoma

717
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:04,860
squamous cell and most of the people like you who are not smokers get this type of adenocarcinoma

718
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:10,940
non small cell and it is really shocking to think that given the prevalence of lung cancer

719
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:17,900
and the lethality of lung cancer lung cancer kills more people than any other cancer and i believe

720
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:24,780
that's true for male and female still um to think that i mean by far yeah to think that such a high

721
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:33,260
percentage 12 to 14 percent could be non-smokers uh tells us this the severity of this um i also

722
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:37,500
think it's worth reiterating something you've said which is sort of the miracle of the fact that

723
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:45,260
we're sitting here having this discussion four years later the uh median survival meaning if you

724
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:52,780
took you know a hundred people um with stage four which means a type of cancer that has spread from

725
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,860
its original site of origin and in your case it went to your brain which is a particularly

726
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:02,700
devastating place for this cancer to grow the median survival of people with stage four lung

727
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:10,540
cancer is probably 12 months or less correct well it depends on what kind of lung cancer that you

728
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:21,260
have but yeah i mean um in sometimes even eight months or less um and um those were the stats

729
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:30,460
that i knew when i was first diagnosed and you know one of the things that i'll say is non-smoking

730
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:39,980
lung cancer is growing at scary rates it's being diagnosed and it hits people in their prime

731
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:49,100
it's growing rapidly especially in young women so it's hitting a lot of moms much more common in

732
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:55,260
women than it is in men although it does happen in men happens in caucasian and asian women

733
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:00,460
predominantly and the interesting thing is most of the people that it impacts are thin

734
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:10,460
and in shape or athletes do we have any insight into why no and and it's one of the things that's

735
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:16,540
not being investigated as much you know when you look at okay you know what studies have been out

736
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:23,100
there oh we get the typical you know it's raid on it's you know um you know being next to a smoker

737
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:28,540
i never was okay my father was a smoker he quit smoking the day i was born and never went back

738
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:41,180
i was not raised around smoke um so you know you the fact of who it's impacting and and the fact

739
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:48,300
that the the demographics of the people that it's impacting are the healthy people you know

740
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:55,500
unlike what we associate with you know our epidemic of insulin resistance that's not who

741
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:02,380
these people are we know that insulin resistance is responsible for a huge number of cancers and

742
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:12,140
cancer rises that's not this you know and so you know it's it's young women um and again who have

743
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:19,660
presumably done everything right um and it's just it's something that is not getting enough press

744
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:26,140
i know the guardian did a big story about it about a year ago um but otherwise it's not getting

745
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:33,100
the attention it deserves and these women really wind up um with two different kinds of cancer

746
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:39,180
they wind up with egfr driven cancer that's epidermal growth factor receptor

747
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:48,780
or they wind up with something called alc positive cancer i have the egfr specifically

748
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:57,980
something called egfr exon 19 mutation and the thing i didn't know at diagnosis because again i

749
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:05,740
had been focused on obesity and metabolic disease and diabetes for so long um you know i hadn't been

750
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:14,140
seeing as many people with active cancer as i did when i was in primary care um and so i was quite

751
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:23,900
frankly behind um on some of the newer treatments and newer diagnoses if you will and we're talking

752
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:34,780
the genomics um of cancer um but for egfr cancer there was something called a targeted therapy

753
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:42,220
this class of medications is called tyrosine kinase inhibitors and you know people can go on them

754
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:50,060
and they can get better okay they can even in many cases have all of the cancer go away

755
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:57,980
okay doesn't mean they're cured though because it always comes back and so after initially

756
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:06,220
you know again going through all these i mean i'll tell you the denial grief stage well i want to i

757
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:12,380
want to actually ask you exactly about that sarah i want to go back to what is it like when you are

758
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:17,180
recovering in the hospital from the brain surgery because i assume they had not taken out the primary

759
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:22,780
tumors in your lungs they were just alleviating the most life-threatening symptom you had at the

760
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:27,820
moment which was a mass inside a part of your body that can't accommodate a mass which is why you had

761
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:34,620
a seizure um so they take that out you're recovering from a surgery that by itself is difficult to

762
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:41,020
recover from but then coupled with the knowledge of here's this disease and my lungs are full of

763
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:50,860
this what do you remember of those days overwhelming grief to the point of not being able to think

764
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:57,340
and again it's it's you know of course i come and approach everything in life as a mother

765
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:04,140
right i mean and and i'm not saying as a mother only like fathers would do the same thing but you

766
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:11,660
approach every problem in life through what it means for your children how how old were your

767
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:21,980
children at the time sarah they were seven twelve and fourteen and they needed me they still need me

768
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:33,420
um and so the grief is overwhelming about what i quickly realized is i'm gonna break my children's

769
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:41,500
heart and there's not a thing i can do about it and to have that realization because it comes quick

770
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,780
and have to sit with that

771
01:31:48,860 --> 01:32:01,900
is a grief i can't i can't even explain and so i mean initially i just was i couldn't handle

772
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:09,500
the grief i i had to be denial in denial i came home from the hospital i had just been discharged

773
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:16,380
from icu and i walked seven miles the day i got home and my fema see i i can't be sick

774
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:24,460
i i just got out of the brain surgery i'm still on medication i walked seven miles today i'm

775
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:29,100
healthy i don't know what you people are talking about what did your kids know at this time had

776
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:34,940
your husband already spoken with them well sadly enough and i actually didn't find this out until

777
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:41,820
quite a bit later they are the ones who found me in the basement so you know talk about

778
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:48,620
not telling the children we had that was never an option for us

779
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:57,500
so you know they knew i was having surgery that there was a tumor in my brain and that this was

780
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:13,180
cancer this is not good um and that's a lot for a kid to unpack right especially a kid you know

781
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:18,940
especially a kid you know again it's it's hard for any kid to unpack but you know one of the things

782
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:24,460
i remember when my kids were going through each of their own everyone kid goes through at the phase

783
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:29,740
of what if something happens to you mommy what if something happens to your daddy right all kids go

784
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:34,700
through that and the one thing we used to kind of laugh together my husband and i about that

785
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:43,900
say oh honey your mommy and daddy are the healthiest people um we are so healthy you know you don't

786
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:48,540
need to worry about that and and i remember that you know it's one of the one of the first things

787
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:55,740
that you think of when you're put in this situation is oh my god you know they have to unpack this

788
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:07,900
in that context and it's hard to be a teen it's hard to be a seven-year-old but to be one who's

789
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:18,220
mother suddenly had a you know diagnosis of advanced cancer and we it was a hard decision

790
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:23,500
on what to do but you know in talking and how do we handle the kids but the one thing we decided

791
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:31,340
together i mean my husband and i um is that we were never going to lie to them you know we were

792
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:35,900
always going to tell them the truth because i thought that the worst thing for a kid is to

793
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:43,260
constantly be wondering if something if there's going to be a huge shoe that drops and so we told

794
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:49,580
them we tried to open up the lines of communication they mostly didn't want to talk about it

795
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:55,180
um but we told them that we were making that promise to them and we have never never

796
01:34:55,900 --> 01:35:01,260
gone back on that problem and promise and never will i mean that's one that it's really important

797
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:07,740
to me we may delay telling them something for a little bit until we really know the facts but

798
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:18,700
as soon as we really know the facts they're going to hear about it so um anyway i mean

799
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:26,140
i mean you know and over time in grief you learn to accept many things

800
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:36,620
you know my husband and i our dream had been to retire to a farm and make gourmet butter

801
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:40,060
like that's what we were going to do that was going to be the second career right

802
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:46,860
and you learn to make peace with that's not the case anymore you know our we always used to joke

803
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:54,060
that the way we wanted to die was 95 years old on the way home from a skiing trip

804
01:35:55,260 --> 01:36:02,140
in a fiery car accident where our kids would not have to deal with the bodies right the cremation

805
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:07,900
the two for one a twofer it was going to be on the way home because we were going to be

806
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:17,660
having fun up until that point um and um you know you so that's acceptance you know you're

807
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:25,020
not going to retire you're not going to have all these things but you can't accept that you're not

808
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:34,460
going to be a mom impossible now at some point i'm guessing kind of the problem solver and you

809
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:43,100
started saying like hey i'm gonna learn as much as can be known about this um and we're gonna

810
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:49,900
talk about this in the context of the asymmetry that exists um i just had a discussion about this

811
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:55,820
with you know we have a weekly meeting in our practice with all the providers and you know we

812
01:36:55,820 --> 01:37:02,780
just had this weird situation recently where you know basically a patient of ours who has another

813
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:08,060
physician uh was kind of caught in the middle of a recommendation that turned out not to be the

814
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:13,340
right recommendation and you know we were able to get them a referral to somebody else who basically

815
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:20,460
got them out of a very unnecessary surgery and we were just sort of thinking man like we're so glad

816
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:25,580
that that patient was able to dodge that bullet you know they were going to have a surgery that

817
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:32,460
they totally didn't need um that's a very big surgery with lots of risks and we realized like

818
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:43,260
the asymmetry of knowledge in medicine is so overwhelming that it is it's it's it's not even

819
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:51,100
just about money or education outside of medicine like a smart person still has a hard time digesting

820
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:57,820
medical literature um and i know like i said we're going to talk about this but i you know you

821
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:07,100
very quickly must have figured out hey i have this egfr 19 deletion so we no longer talk about this

822
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:12,540
as you have lung cancer or you have adno or you have non-small cell we're really going to refer

823
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:17,740
to it by its mutation and everything will come down to how do we treat that how long was that

824
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:24,140
process for you to say i'm gonna i don't know if this is the right word but i'm gonna partition

825
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:32,220
my grief and my problem solving brains and i'll i'll do both of them but i'll i'll you know i'll

826
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:43,980
move back and forth pretty quick it happened pretty quick um which is okay you know this is terminal

827
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:53,660
right you have to come to to grasp but that but terminal when right and what can i do to control

828
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:59,100
the when but when you say that sarah did you really come to that realization so soon because

829
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:05,980
technically life is terminal i mean there's nobody listening to this podcast watching this video

830
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:12,700
who isn't going to die so that's all terminal but when you say that do you mean that immediately

831
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:18,300
and without question or reservation you felt that you would not live a normal life expectancy there

832
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:24,780
was no hail mary out there that was gonna you know take you to being the 95 year old skier

833
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:32,780
um yeah i mean i i think just the reading and understanding although the advances that that

834
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:41,820
this was going to be terminal really soon you know in my life and i was only 46 at the time

835
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:51,020
and you know my first thing was just please let me make it to 50 i'm 49 you're gonna be 50 soon

836
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:57,420
yeah i'm gonna be 50 um in the not too distant future so you know that was like my first one

837
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:04,540
was just like okay let's let's but right from the beginning i'll tell you the when was 11 years

838
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:13,740
okay and and that has not left i just i don't need to be 95 i can accept all those things that i'm

839
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:21,980
going to miss out on by not growing old i just need 11 years which to everyone was unrealistic

840
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:30,860
but why 11 years because my youngest would be graduated so so immediately

841
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:40,620
my goal was i can't settle for less than 11 years i have to make it to 11 years and so in became

842
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:49,980
that like my war cry 11 years 11 years i have to make it 11 years and so you know it started

843
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:55,900
i mean and that started me on a path of so much so the first thing i thought in reading all the i

844
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:01,420
mean read everything is i got to get this primary tumor out you know i'm considered inoperable but

845
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:06,540
we know that having this primary tumor here increases my risk for mutations okay remember

846
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:15,020
i said that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the tkis they work amazingly well but only so long

847
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:24,140
you know somewhere between eight and say you know on average eight and with the more advanced ones

848
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:32,220
you know at the long and it's like you know 24 to 30 months okay um so that's not enough time

849
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:39,260
that doesn't get me to 11 so i was like okay you know this is increasing the risk for mutation

850
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:46,620
which is how these develop resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors and remind me sarah

851
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:53,420
you because i remember you emailing me probably by august and and starting to you know explain

852
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:59,500
some of the details you had your biggest tumor was like five centimeters that's a monster tumor

853
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:05,740
how how many tumors did you have it was six centimeters or you had six tumors i had it was

854
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:14,460
six centimeters which is amazing in the sense that i never had pain from it you know it never i never

855
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:20,060
had a cough probably because you were so healthy i think so because you know i this talk about

856
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:25,580
being caught out of the blue you know there just wasn't this premonition of something is awry and

857
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:32,220
i'm just not addressing it and so the standard of care sorry to interrupt was just that you know

858
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:37,180
we typically don't operate on patients with metastatic tumors it's it doesn't the only

859
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:42,460
reason they operated on your brain was it was an acute way to save your life i think it's hard for

860
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:48,220
patients listening to this to understand that but that's sort of the that's the playbook in oncology

861
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:54,380
right when a patient shows up with metastatic cancer they're considered not surgical candidates

862
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:59,020
and this was the exception and not the rule you were going to be dead probably within days if

863
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:05,020
they didn't operate on your brain but all this time afterwards you still have these this burden

864
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:12,380
of tumors in your lung and now the question is can we improve your prognosis and maybe that doesn't

865
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:20,940
mean you live to 95 but can we reduce can we make your cancer less resistant to therapy by taking

866
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:27,980
the majority of the cancer cells out of your body right you know um and and decreasing the tumor

867
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:34,860
burden because really quickly the tki got rid of every single small tumor i had them throughout

868
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:41,660
you know like paint splatters on throughout both lungs and they were gone in a matter of weeks

869
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:48,460
that's staggering isn't it i mean it is it's it's remarkable but the you know again the primary

870
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:57,020
tumor was huge so um i had unfortunately the large tumor in my brain was not the only one i had two

871
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:02,380
other ones that they radiated um they didn't need to be surgically removed they were small they

872
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:08,700
could be radiated and then i set about trying to find someone who would take out this primary tumor

873
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:14,780
um can i can i ask you about the stereotactic radiation sarah that's i mean we glossed over

874
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:20,860
that but that's not a benign process either did you suffer nausea from that what how difficult

875
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:28,140
was your stereotactic treatment did you take it all in stride i did great with the treatment

876
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:35,100
to the brain i didn't have any issues you know i did have issues at the beginning but they were

877
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:42,460
more to the tki you know one of the things with every specialist that i saw you know

878
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:48,380
they couldn't believe it or they told me if i saw them earlier it wasn't going to happen

879
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:53,340
you know at least you'll keep your hair all my hair fell out like it wasn't supposed to happen

880
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:58,860
like your hair is not supposed to fall out with tki it's all my hair fell out anyway so the brain

881
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:06,380
radiation went fine um and then i met a surgeon who was going to take out the primary tumor for

882
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:14,540
the reasons that i was saying we just anything to decrease the risk of you know um developing a

883
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:23,100
mutation that keeps me from being sensitive to the tki's and so i went in you know for surgery in

884
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:30,380
september and i can remember her saying we're gonna take this tumor out we're gonna take out

885
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:36,460
your right upper lobe unless of course we've seen that there's disease in the mediastinum

886
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:42,460
but there was no disease on the PET scan in the mediastinum so she was feeling pretty positive

887
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:51,420
about being able to take that out but i knew for several weeks beforehand that that was a possibility

888
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:56,860
and just so folks know what we're saying on the on the right hand side you've got these three

889
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:04,060
lobes here but they drain into these lymph nodes that are in this middle structure called the

890
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:10,940
mediastinum and so you had this monster tumor that was going to require the entire upper right lobe

891
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:17,980
to be taken out but if the surgeon felt that on visual inspection at least or maybe even sampling

892
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:24,300
nodes that any of those nodes had cancer it was her opinion that this is really futile because now

893
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:30,060
we know it's already escaped the lung it doesn't matter so so you went into that surgery knowing

894
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:37,180
you could wake up with a huge scar in your chest chest tubes coming out and the cancer is still in

895
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:54,700
your right and that happened and that was i mean it was terrible i mean you know i kept apparently

896
01:46:54,700 --> 01:47:01,900
you know under the influence i mean everyone told me i was so hysterical screaming in the recovery

897
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:07,980
room i'm a mom you can't let this happen to me i'm a mom that's all i kept saying and i of course

898
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:12,460
don't remember any of this but they had to actually take me away put me in a private room

899
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:19,740
and and that was all that i kept saying and um so you know i had to come home and

900
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:30,780
learn to accept that um i now was bald and um i was definitely fell into

901
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:40,460
a deep depression but at the same time you know i refused to completely give up i mean like for

902
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:45,980
example i went back to work at the clinic the same month that i had brain surgery you know which

903
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:54,300
you know which sounds crazy but this is part of this whole process and then but after the surgery

904
01:47:54,300 --> 01:48:02,540
failure i i mean i was it was that was terrible um and then i didn't really recover back into my

905
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:11,420
determined place until a really very specific moment and that was just a couple of weeks before

906
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:18,780
my diagnosis um i had been selected to be an aspen health innovator fellow which was

907
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:26,220
i mean this is among the higher highest honors for your work you know this is the aspen institute is

908
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:33,900
you know a place that brings together thinkers in all kinds of disciplines and you know to be chosen

909
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:39,820
to represent people who are innovating in the health care space was i mean such an honor

910
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:48,780
and in order to do that you had to commit to four weeks of leadership sessions in the next two years

911
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:55,500
which of course at the time i was like of course sign me up but as that first session inched closer

912
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:05,980
it was in november i i was so what do i do i couldn't make up my mind i literally didn't make

913
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:13,420
up my mind for sure until i sat i got on the airplane and because i was ready to run back

914
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:22,060
because it was like i'm going to leave my kids for almost a week i've terminal cancer and at

915
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:28,540
that point i decided you can live feeling sorry for yourself and of all the things that you're

916
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:37,820
going to lose or you can go out and live and your kids are going to be better for it this is what

917
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:44,060
really made me decide your kids are going to be better if you choose to live and so that was the

918
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:51,660
moment sitting on that plane seat crying never i've cried on a lot of planes that's this diagnosis

919
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:58,780
deciding i just chose to live this was a moment i made my choice now i gotta stick with it

920
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:08,460
and that's how i've tried to live my life since then because i you know i have a platform i had a

921
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:14,780
platform i had done what i feel was a lot of good for a lot of people and it wasn't finished

922
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:22,220
and i knew that this was good for my children and i'll tell you one of the most impactful moments

923
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:29,420
of my whole life happened before my diagnosis and it was one of these times where we were at the

924
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:35,820
dinner table and the lottery happened to be one of those you know hyper inflated lotteries oh my

925
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:41,980
god you can win you know bajillion dollars and so my husband and i were at the dinner table joking

926
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:46,140
around about it right i mean we don't play the lottery but we were joking around we should buy

927
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:52,060
tickets you know we could retire we could retire and here at the time was my 13 year old son at

928
01:50:52,060 --> 01:51:01,020
the dinner table and he got really upset about us discussing this you can't retire mom you're doing

929
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:09,980
so much good for the world how could you even think of it i've never been so that is a defining

930
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:20,460
moment of my life and and and like i was like oh my god you know at the time i just i was so taken

931
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:27,500
aback by that and um certainly that weighed heavily on my decision to get on that plane

932
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:37,340
and to continue doing what i'm doing um and what i'm doing has morphed since my cancer diagnosis

933
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:45,020
into an even greater focus on health equity because of my experience as a cancer patient

934
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:54,620
and someone who is privileged because i'll tell you you have a much greater chance of surviving

935
01:51:54,620 --> 01:52:07,260
cancer if you are uh has privilege uh you know one of the lucky ones and i didn't realize

936
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:18,700
the stark differences until i became a patient i want to talk about that in some detail sarah

937
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:26,300
but i i want to also understand how it is that we're still talking today frankly in other words

938
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:35,660
how have you managed to um stay in an equilibrium with this disease right i've always i mean let me

939
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:41,500
let me share with you a couple of things that i i i've always struggled with when thinking about

940
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:49,180
cancer i i'm not fond of the language that we sometimes use around cancer and that we beat

941
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:55,580
cancer and that you know we can't give up and things like that because it almost suggests

942
01:52:55,580 --> 01:53:01,100
that the patients who don't survive cancer have somehow given up and i i just i i i just don't

943
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:05,660
find that in my experience having taken care of many patients with cancer to be true i think

944
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:13,020
um i just you know it doesn't make sense to me um and i think the way that you said it and described

945
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:18,780
it earlier makes the most sense which is basically finding a way to coexist with your cancer for as

946
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:27,340
long as possible um and you've exceeded all odds and i i want to kind of understand that journey

947
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:35,340
a little bit more um you you know i it's it's one thing to to go through the tyrosin kinase inhibitor

948
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:42,140
have this immediate response um that's remarkable but then get this setback you know three months

949
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:46,700
later where your primary is not only still there but you actually realize now there's there's

950
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:53,180
mediastinal involvement um which basically means there's no question you have cancer cells

951
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:59,900
elsewhere in your body um it's not like they stop when they get to the lymph nodes so pick the story

952
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:05,100
up for us in terms of what your ongoing treatment has been like like how have you stayed in this

953
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:17,020
state of uh of equilibrium so to speak yeah so i haven't okay um on many occasions i haven't um

954
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:27,100
uh but so so after the surgery um the next thing that happened is they found another brain tumor

955
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:34,140
um there's argument as to whether it was there from the get-go or um

956
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:44,300
uh whether um it was something new um but either way they decided it would be considered

957
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:55,820
um that the first line tki that they had put me on um had failed me um and so i got switched to

958
01:54:55,820 --> 01:55:04,380
i got more radiation to the brain and i was switched to um and the newest tki happens to

959
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:14,620
be called osamertnib or chagrissow i was put on that in november um right before i went off for

960
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:27,020
my first aspen leadership conference um and i had decided that i do not accept being a sitting duck

961
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:35,580
because what the cancer world then you know wants is for a patient like me

962
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:41,180
to just sit and wait for the cancer to come back right that's what you're doing you know it's

963
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:48,700
coming back there's no question about it and you know what's coming back soon and you know you are

964
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:55,580
just waiting and i couldn't accept that as a mother i think i could accept it as a human but

965
01:55:55,580 --> 01:56:04,540
i couldn't accept it as a mother and so i went on a journey to find someone who could treat me

966
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:14,620
in the most aggressive way possible who shared my view that sitting around and waiting for this to

967
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:23,580
come back was totally unacceptable i traveled the country i saw everybody let me tell you first of

968
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:27,500
all of course that shows i have means to do that right that a lot of other people don't

969
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:39,100
and i actually along the way met another mother physician my age just a bit younger

970
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:47,500
younger kids who had the same attitude towards it i refused to accept this we sort of became a

971
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:55,980
team so to speak and wound up by complete serendipity meeting a group of physicians

972
01:56:57,580 --> 01:57:05,740
who really felt that the way to treat this long term was to be constantly battling it with

973
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:12,940
something new so in other words you know the the cancer dogma right now is you put people on

974
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:18,140
something at the highest dose possible and you keep going until it doesn't work anymore

975
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:24,620
that that's how we deal with cancer and then we switch and it's the same thing over again

976
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:31,740
and the idea is what if we hit it with less and then change it up all the time

977
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:37,740
right and this goes to the idea of beating the mutations before they can get you

978
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:40,140
so

979
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:48,140
thankfully i had a physician here at home who was willing to say okay that that is worth a shot

980
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:58,700
february of 2018 2019 okay because it took a long time to get to this point right of searching

981
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:06,860
trying to find something i started chemo regular chemo i went through the regular

982
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:16,540
cycles of chemo and then when i was done with that i immediately went to anti estrogen therapy

983
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:25,900
okay because i had a very specific mutation besides the egfr1 and there was a medication

984
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:31,900
to treat it it just so happened to be a breast cancer medication but it was the same mutation

985
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:45,660
for either cancer so immediately upon stopping the chemo i went on the anti estrogen therapy

986
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:52,060
so i was put into early menopause with the number of you know regular medications lupron full of

987
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:58,220
strant and then i was started on a medication called padlicyclib okay which again is primarily

988
01:58:58,220 --> 01:59:03,820
a breast cancer medication but was targeting one of my very specific secondary mutations

989
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:10,540
i was on that for the summer and all this time i'm still on the tigris or asamertinib that never

990
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:18,700
stopped as soon as the eight weeks of that was over with i went back on chemo but very different

991
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:27,340
low dose chemo single agent very low dose which agent so the first one was cisplatin

992
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:36,220
okay and you know everyone says oh cisplatin you know you're you know you're gonna do terrible on

993
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:43,260
this i mean this is harsh and it is but you know i did fine i did fine i was able to still you know

994
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:49,660
i mean i'm not saying i wasn't tired you know i've basically been nauseous for the last almost

995
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:55,260
four years every single day you know it's just you learn to manage that you know so i learn to

996
01:59:55,260 --> 02:00:00,700
manage it i learned to manage you know being tired um and the things that came along i still

997
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:08,540
traveled for work i still did i was still able to do everything um i just i can't imagine i can't

998
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:14,380
like i i could tell you some really crazy stories of of things i had to do while traveling to

999
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:22,140
accommodate how i was feeling um that nobody knew about at the time but anyway um some really wacky

1000
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:27,260
stuff that you do but you just you manage you you figure it out right you improvise lots of

1001
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:37,340
improvising um and then um i got switched to another after eight weeks got switched to gem

1002
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:43,420
cytobine or gemsar which again these are so crazy you just don't think of this because that's a drug

1003
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:49,660
that's typically used in pancreatic cancer right well yeah and it can be used in lung cancer i mean

1004
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:54,460
it just depends on the mutation i think that's the point right right right right yeah um that

1005
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:59,340
believe it or not there's no standard chemo for lung cancer it's can you believe that there's not

1006
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:05,980
a standard like standard of care regimen so the thing is i wasn't doing any outlandish things here

1007
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:12,540
okay these are all treatments for lung cancer okay i mean like like you said gems are is used

1008
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:18,060
more for other things but this is not an outlandish thing that's never heard of for lung cancer i mean

1009
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:25,260
same with cisplatin i mean um none of these things are you know you know i was oh my goodness

1010
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:30,380
we're gonna you know do something you know that's never ever been done before you know so to speak

1011
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:39,180
and and at this point which is now the fall of 2019 where if you go and get a PET scan where do

1012
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:46,060
you actually have tumor in your body at this point so yeah let me back up for a second because well

1013
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:52,620
the quick answer is i had no tumor okay there was no tumor anywhere and to back up is that

1014
02:01:53,580 --> 02:02:03,900
the chagrissow this is pre-chemo had stopped shrinking my primary tumor in March of 2018

1015
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:11,740
so this was you know almost a year before i began chemo and so since they wouldn't surgically

1016
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:19,660
operated to get it out i had it radiated again you know i was lucky enough to have a radiation

1017
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:28,780
oncologist who worked with me and um and like i said i tolerated brain chemo well the same was

1018
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:37,980
not the case brain radiation for lung to the lung yeah the radiation i had real issues um

1019
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:45,100
and interestingly enough you know we were leaving for to hike the Inca trail

1020
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:51,900
and May of that year so i had had radiation that we're leaving to hike the Inca trail and i started

1021
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:58,140
having kind of bad chest pain it was like like a day or two before we hiked the Inca trail i was

1022
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:03,260
like okay i'm sure this is just reflux i'm going to take some reflux medication and then i was like

1023
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:10,060
look okay if it's not if it's more you know what a better place to die than surrounded by your family

1024
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:16,380
you know on the Inca trail and all the beauties of the Andes mountains okay i can accept this

1025
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:23,900
let's go you know i didn't even tell anyone i was like going forward and um did that successfully

1026
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:28,700
you know um it was great my eight-year-old tootling along you know she was always the

1027
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:37,500
fastest of any of us we went with our friends and um uh i mean amazing experience i just have

1028
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:42,460
to say that those things especially if you can get kids in it i'll never forget that when we all got

1029
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:49,340
back and we went and checked into the JW because we were like give me a shower a very clean bed and a

1030
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:59,260
spa my middle child my daughter said to all of the adults i developed my third eye during that

1031
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:05,340
it was one of those experiences like you don't normally think you're going to get that out of a

1032
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:11,100
you know she was what 14 at the time that's that we were all like what

1033
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:19,020
but anyway so it was a super special time i was still having pain and then my rest of my family

1034
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:25,740
flew home i actually had to fly um from Lisbon to Switzerland because i had a conference i had to go

1035
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:35,020
to and at that conference things started to get really bad um i made it through but you know

1036
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:41,420
not with again some funny stories that of how i accommodated to it because i was having crushing

1037
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:47,580
pain that home turns out of course i had some rare i had this rare complication where actually

1038
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:54,060
impacted my bones and my radiation oncologist said the only treatment for this is to put you

1039
02:04:54,060 --> 02:05:00,460
on long-term opioid therapy and i was like oh no thanks i will accommodate there was no way i was

1040
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:07,500
doing that so i had to get through that which was a which that was a little bit of a saga but anyway

1041
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:15,820
i had no disease then after that radiation none and so i was in this state they call it NAD

1042
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:22,140
or NED excuse me no evidence of disease i like to always say ned right i had i was ned for a really

1043
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:26,780
long time i had no evidence of disease it was a great place to be right still on treatment still

1044
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:32,620
trying to do everything to keep this from coming back and started gems are and you know everybody

1045
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:38,620
had said all these terrible things about cisplatin and gems are was 10 times worse everyone was like

1046
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:44,460
you'll be a breeze gems are as a breeze compared to cisplatin you you are really the exact opposite

1047
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:51,580
of everybody because yeah i mean we used to tell patients gems are is it's non-chemo yeah

1048
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:57,500
yeah everybody tolerates gems are i can still remember sitting because i was too feeling too

1049
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:03,180
crappy to drive my mother driving to pick me up to take me to chemo one day sitting on my front

1050
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:08,940
porch and throwing up in a plant on the way to chemo there are nutrients in there sarah that are

1051
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:13,500
very good for the plant so i wouldn't i wouldn't tell bad about that that's very it's a very healthy

1052
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:19,580
part of the carbon cycle i'm sure but i was determined to you know keep on i was really close

1053
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:23,660
to getting switched to tax calls which you know i'm like this is gonna have that'll be better

1054
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:36,140
um and um so then had to take another trip um for another meeting and had lots of friends there

1055
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:43,260
and i can remember them standing behind me after we had eaten and they were pushing me up this hill

1056
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:49,820
in san francisco because i literally couldn't walk and i kept thinking to myself i'm a hypochondriac

1057
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:56,780
this is just because i'm anemic you know whatever um i was super short of breath

1058
02:06:58,380 --> 02:07:02,300
but i'm like okay i had convinced myself i was making it all up in my mind

1059
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:11,260
i fly back from that trip and the very next morning head in for chemo and they immediately said oh my

1060
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:18,860
god no chemo you know everything is a mess my i you know my liver numbers were through the roof

1061
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:28,620
my kidney numbers were you know high um i had pancytopenia so bad um how anemic were you sarah

1062
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:36,140
so i was like six at this point okay i mean it was bad you know really bad the low sixes at this

1063
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:41,980
right and just so the listener understands yeah the the normal would be 13 or 14 of ahemoglobin

1064
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:49,820
and you're six so that's really low and your platelets were how low 23 which means you basically

1065
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:57,660
don't have the ability to form a single clot right you know i was a disaster and the funny

1066
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:02,380
thing is i was still up and doing okay you know what i mean i was tired i was shortness of breath

1067
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:08,860
with activity but i was doing okay and they sent me home and i was like

1068
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:18,060
that doesn't seem right am i crazy that i shouldn't be home so of course i call some of

1069
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:24,220
my other physician friends aha privilege right because i was getting sent home

1070
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:30,060
um and they're like oh my god we're admitting you right now

1071
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:34,700
right so i actually get a backdoor admission to the hospital

1072
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:45,260
and a complete workup starting right then you know i had to be i had to have a thoracentesis

1073
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:50,860
drained a whole bunch from my lungs that was unknown when i got sent home so you had tons

1074
02:08:50,860 --> 02:09:00,460
of fluid around your lungs that's tons of fluid around my lungs yeah um and once i was admitted

1075
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:06,460
i was promptly transferred to icu things were going downhill i had to be put on bypass so i

1076
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:13,340
had multi-organ failure i you know had respiratory failure liver failure kidney failure i was a big

1077
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:20,060
failure okay everything was bad and was this believed to be the result of your body's response

1078
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:28,700
to the tumor or the chemo it was the gems are so i got taken care of in the hospital

1079
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:38,380
i i just want to cry to think about the care i got it was so wonderful you know and i got i just

1080
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:46,940
had the best team i would have died you know nobody can believe that this was well over a year ago now

1081
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:58,300
and i'm healthy with no persistent failures um because i was near death you know and um i was

1082
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:04,300
in the icu for a really long time and everyone every day it went from i think your kidneys are

1083
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:15,500
rebound to uh 50 50 they're never going to be normal i was on plasma free assist and it turned

1084
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:21,580
out i had something called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and you know to just explain

1085
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:28,700
you know over 70 percent of people are either dead or on dialysis you know right away i mean it's

1086
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:35,420
it's got an incredible mortality right incredible it's incredibly difficult to treat

1087
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:44,300
um uh and so you know outcomes are you're dead or you're on permanent dialysis

1088
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:54,380
um and so i was put on a new medication after you know going through kidney biopsies all these

1089
02:10:54,380 --> 02:11:01,900
kinds of things in the hospital um sent home uh did outpatient plasma for recess for a while

1090
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:08,380
and then things miraculously started getting better right not miraculously it was because of

1091
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:14,700
this medication i was brought um of course that meant an infusion every eight weeks and

1092
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:20,060
the worst part to me is it meant no one would put me back on chemo just just they wouldn't put

1093
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:26,140
you on gems are they wouldn't put you on anything wouldn't put me on anything and to me that was

1094
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:33,740
devastating because i said you know well kidney failure is one thing but you know having this

1095
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:39,980
cancer that we know come back is another so that was another hard pill to swallow and you know

1096
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:49,820
long story short i got better i went to um a genetic um pharmacogenetics which is where they

1097
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:56,860
actually take a look at what your genetic profile is in in response to different drugs and it turns

1098
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:06,460
out i had a genetic mutation hey i i have lots of them um uh it turns out i had a genetic mutation

1099
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:13,580
that didn't allow the gems are to break down so i was getting toxic doses of this and i was on a

1100
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:20,540
very low dose but the thing is that um i couldn't get rid of it so normally if you see atypical

1101
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:25,580
hemolytic uremic syndrome with gems are it's after months and months of treatment and i got

1102
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:33,900
this within four weeks why because i was getting mega doses of it because my body couldn't get

1103
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:39,740
rid of it due to this mutation it was the explanation wow so you know and they said

1104
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:47,420
there's no reason you can't take any other chemo this is very specific to gems are but that was

1105
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:57,820
that sit in weight mode back to sit in weight mode and it took another year but the cancer came back

1106
02:12:57,820 --> 02:13:15,980
back in september of 2020 and um uh here's my story from that which really made me so determined

1107
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:26,300
to work even harder for health equity here i am a physician able to grasp really difficult concepts

1108
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:29,820
able to read and scour the literature and know what i'm looking for

1109
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:37,740
able to call at a moment time you know anytime someone to help me sort through something i didn't

1110
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:44,300
understand or help maybe refer me to someone you know i had all the resources in the world

1111
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:55,180
and the reoccurrence was in september even with all my constant pushing and self-advocacy

1112
02:13:55,740 --> 02:14:03,740
okay the one thing is i had by by the time i was diagnosed with cancer i was an expert patient

1113
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:10,940
advocate expert hardcore and you know one of the other advantages i had is it didn't take much to

1114
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:16,940
switch that and to become a self-advocate an advocate for myself so i was diagnosed in

1115
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:27,900
mid-september with a reoccurrence i did not get on a clinical trial until um i i got started

1116
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:31,740
um i i got started december 30th

1117
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:40,940
that's a four month delay that's a four month delay for me

1118
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:45,180
and in hindsight

1119
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:55,740
now looking back before i was panicked right and i couldn't really i was like something has to get

1120
02:14:55,740 --> 02:15:01,820
done something has to get done something has to get done i can look back in hindsight and say

1121
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,820
how many people die during that time

1122
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:14,620
how many people who don't have the advantages i had just die during that delay

1123
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:25,420
how many i shudder and i i just want to cry and what i've done is i've reached out to other

1124
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:34,460
cancer patients to say has anyone else been in this situation and i find out it happens all of

1125
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:41,580
the time it seems that we have a really good system as i experienced when someone is diagnosed

1126
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:47,420
with cancer they get a health nap a cancer navigator you know they get all these things

1127
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:51,740
and we're boom boom boom boom boom but when that cancer comes back it's kind of like the system

1128
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:59,100
seems to give up on you i had to advocate advocate the heck out of getting a biopsy done

1129
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:06,060
a biopsy that would be enough tissue to make me eligible for a clinical trial

1130
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:12,860
that would actually get me a full genomics report i mean that wasn't going to happen

1131
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:19,820
i'm telling you i had to get almost obnoxious about it and the stories that i'm getting from

1132
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:27,420
people are the same where was the recurrence in my right upper lobe and so they had to get you

1133
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:35,020
had to get another lung biopsy to to do this and can i ask you another thing sarah what has been

1134
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:40,060
you obviously have health insurance but i assume that there's been a non-trivial amount of out of

1135
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:46,780
pocket costs as well in the last four years oh yeah do you do you have a sense of what the out

1136
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:53,660
of pocket cost has been for your care tens of thousands of dollars which obviously speaks to

1137
02:16:53,660 --> 02:17:00,300
another challenge i don't know if this is still true but it certainly was true at one point that

1138
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:06,780
the greatest source of personal bankruptcy in the united states is health care an inability to pay

1139
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:14,380
her health care costs and a cancer diagnosis is so high up there i would have to believe that cancer

1140
02:17:14,380 --> 02:17:24,380
is the leading subset of that as well so you know it just so now i'm like especially when i got

1141
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:33,260
feedback that i'm not alone in this it wasn't just me you know and again i always keep saying in the

1142
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:42,220
backdrop of i am um one of the privileged and and i was put in this situation and the fact of the

1143
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:48,220
matter is by the time the reoccurrence was diagnosed to the time i finally got treated

1144
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:57,180
i had progressed so much that i had compression in my bronchus i couldn't get up a flight of stairs

1145
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:04,860
without desaturating i mean this all just happened i was in horrible shape which of course again and

1146
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:14,780
remember i'm starting out you know before my diagnosis in general i was so healthy and so

1147
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:22,460
it just is which gives me an advantage in this which gives me a significant advantage in this

1148
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:29,420
but it goes back to that question of how many people just die sarah you're very um

1149
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:39,820
realistic about the fact that your time on this earth is less than it should be right a 49 year

1150
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:46,140
old otherwise healthy person who's done all the you know done the right things for their health

1151
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:51,820
should have another 40 years on this planet and at least statistically speaking that's that's not

1152
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:58,700
doesn't seem likely it suggests to me that you're very cognizant of how you spend your time

1153
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:04,700
uh so should take a moment to thank you for spending a couple hours with me here

1154
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:13,180
but how do you now think about the time that you allocate to your family

1155
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:21,820
to your work in the diabetes community and now to this third important pillar to you which is

1156
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:29,180
cancer advocacy how are you how are you how are you managing that and how do you how do you think

1157
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:34,940
about how to even balance that because i think time is the most important currency i think

1158
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:44,300
everybody can appreciate that in a vague sense it is the great equalizer um but of course most of us

1159
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:50,700
can't appreciate it the way you can because you have a real visceral appreciation for it that

1160
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:59,340
comes exactly with this type of an illness um and so therefore i think that your appreciation

1161
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:06,300
for the balancing act of what you described earlier which is living your life to the fullest

1162
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:12,300
regardless of its duration that's your legacy that's what your kids are going to remember about

1163
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:19,660
their mom being the advocate for other patients so that in 10 years when another Sarah Halberg

1164
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:26,140
gets this diagnosis even if she doesn't have your education or your means she can have an

1165
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:31,660
extension of life the way you do i it's it's a bit overwhelming for me to think about how i would do

1166
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:37,900
that because as i put myself in your shoes my intuition is i'd want to retreat from everything

1167
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:44,140
outside of life everything outside of my family like i i i would imagine uh and and it's hard to

1168
02:20:44,140 --> 02:20:48,140
put yourself in another person's shoes without being there but my intuition is i would say i

1169
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:54,380
don't care about anything outside of the walls of this house and i would take a selfish approach in

1170
02:20:54,380 --> 02:21:00,140
some ways i think and you've done this very selfless thing which is continuing to sort of

1171
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:08,940
prioritize everything else as well um how do you do that well a couple of things you know

1172
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:16,780
number one believe it or not originally it was it was actually hard to be around my kids

1173
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:24,780
when i was so deep in grief because and that sounds crazy right that sounds counterintuitive but

1174
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:29,660
they reminded me of everything i was going to lose right they were the they were what i didn't want to

1175
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:36,780
lose and so it was challenging and i i knew i had overcome that you know and that that that was

1176
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:44,700
that was a big motivator for me to not be you know thinking about that um in thinking in that way

1177
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:53,420
and i i'm happy to say i i clearly have overcome that but um my kids come first you know i'll drop

1178
02:21:53,420 --> 02:22:00,540
anything and everything if they need me now but i also think again and i go back to sort of what i

1179
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:14,380
alluded to before they need to see me um not letting not getting knocked out by the stressors

1180
02:22:14,380 --> 02:22:19,660
and bad things in life you know i mean bad things happen to good people you know i like

1181
02:22:19,660 --> 02:22:25,340
i said there's been a pivot in every part of my career based on anger and i certainly am angry

1182
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:30,940
about this but what do you do with it that's that's what's going to be the important question in life

1183
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:37,100
you can take anger you can take all these things and you can get lost and buried in it okay or you

1184
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:45,340
can try to turn it into you know something else and i have to say i haven't become as big a cancer

1185
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:53,020
advocate yet and i'm working on it but the reason for that is and this was a question i had to ask

1186
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:59,980
myself a long time ago which is shouldn't you be a cancer advocate now was but i have a platform

1187
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:05,500
for diabetes and damn it that's important too all these people suffering from this is important

1188
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:13,180
so i can't just say i'm going to switch away from a platform that i have to one where i don't yet it

1189
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:22,460
doesn't mean i'm ignoring it but it's like it makes me want to work more again for health equity

1190
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:31,500
because it spans both right it has to do with both diabetes um and cancer you know um and and

1191
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:40,620
that is so important so yeah how i spend my time is really critical and i want to say it's not like

1192
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:46,940
i'm i don't want to paint the picture that oh my gosh i'm the superwoman i have a terminal cancer

1193
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:59,420
and yay life is great no you know when people ask how i'm doing okay if i say okay you know

1194
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:09,020
i'm doing okay there's never good or never great okay and that's just where i live right now

1195
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:16,060
i'm definitely not sitting around and feeling sorry for myself okay definitely not not enjoying

1196
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:25,740
things in life but great is hard to think about you know great is hard to think about now and

1197
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:30,780
you know the some people say well i'm so cancer really helped me get a new perspective on life

1198
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:39,020
and what i care about and you know i'm happy to say i don't know that i got that okay i mean

1199
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:46,380
having cancer sucks and i'm still mad about it and you know sometimes i have to sit and have

1200
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:51,580
a pity party every once in a while because the fact of the matter is i loved my life

1201
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:57,500
pre-cancer and i think i was living every minute of it i think i cherished my children

1202
02:24:58,460 --> 02:25:03,900
i cherished vacations i mean you know that i cherish travel and showing my children travel

1203
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:10,460
and that's you know that's a bit of a wonderful thing and it's also like a dagger too it's not

1204
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:15,500
like i've gotten some new life and new perspective that's so different from my old damn it i liked

1205
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:22,060
my old life and i liked the old me and it's still a little hard to get used to who this person is now

1206
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:23,980
she's still motivated

1207
02:25:25,740 --> 02:25:31,500
she still exercises although not doing the things i used to

1208
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:42,700
she loves her children with as much passion as one could have but i'm i'm fundamentally different

1209
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:47,180
it's tough

1210
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:47,820
it's tough

1211
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:52,140
