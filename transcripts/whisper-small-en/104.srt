Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,760
today's episode. Hey everyone. Welcome to a special edition of the COVID series. This is going to be

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,440
COVID for kids. So my guest today is my daughter, Olivia. And this was mostly her interviewing me,

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,440
but also a little bit of a discussion in me asking her some questions as well, all pertaining to the

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,240
coronavirus, but really through the lens of questions that Olivia had. So if you're a listener

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,560
of the podcast and you have kids, this might be the one episode that you want to sort of bring

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
your kids into. It has, hopefully it answers a lot of the questions that they've probably been asking

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,440
you. And maybe these are some of the questions you don't have answers to. So anyway, I hope you

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:41,960
enjoy this special episode of the coronavirus series, Corona for kids. Hey dad. So I know you've done

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,360
podcasts about questions people had on the coronavirus for adults, but I thought we could do one for kids.

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,640
So the first thing I'm going to ask you is what even is a virus? Well, a virus is a sort of living

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,640
kind of living thing that has genetic material in it, which all of your cells have genetic material

20
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,960
in them, but these viruses, they can't replicate on their own. So you know how like you get big,

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,120
your hair gets longer, your nails get longer, you get taller. All of these things are cells in your

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,720
body that are dividing. Yeah. Well, viruses can't divide without using another body. They don't have

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:33,560
the machinery, so to speak, to divide on their own. So they have to infect a host. That's the term we

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,160
use to do that. Now it's important to understand how small a virus is. Do you have a sense of how

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,880
small they are? Kind of. Do you think you can see them? No way. That's right. No way. So a virus is

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,840
like about a hundred nanometers wide. Do you know what a nanometer is? Something very small.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Yeah. It's like a billionth of a meter. So if we were to cut one of your hairs, and you can barely

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,960
see the end of your hair when it's cut, right? How many coronaviruses do you think you could line up

29
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,560
across the tip of your hair if it were cut? Probably hundreds. Yeah, about a thousand actually.

30
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,080
So think about how small that is. That's very small. So we can't see these things,

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,920
but these virtually invisible things without special types of microscopes, they get into our

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,880
bodies and the bodies of other animals, and they use our body to make more copies of themselves.

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,080
And a lot of times when viruses do that, they don't really hurt us or hurt the person or animal

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,200
that they're infecting. But sometimes they do. So when you think about bad colds that you've had,

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,920
or nasty GI bugs that you've had, that's just a virus that is causing that pain and suffering to

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,800
you as part of its replicating process. Okay. So I'm sure a lot of people are wondering this.

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,680
So how do you know so much about this virus? Well, I don't think I know that much about it.

38
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,320
To be clear, I didn't know anything about it until a couple of months ago. So there are people who

39
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,800
spend as much time as I spend thinking about longevity or Formula One or all the other things

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,160
that I love to think about. There are people who spend their whole lives thinking about these

41
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,640
viruses. And so I just have talked to a lot of those people. And that's how I've learned the

42
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,720
little bit that I think I've learned in the last couple of months. But the reality of it is I pretty

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,360
much a noob. Okay. So how did the coronavirus start? Well, I think we have a pretty good sense

44
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,640
that this virus, this particular coronavirus, and to be clear, there are many coronaviruses,

45
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:58,360
but this particular one, which now has a formal name, that name is SARS-CoV-2. So just like your

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:07,720
name is Olivia, that guy's name is SARS-CoV-2, it causes a disease called COVID-19. That virus

47
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:17,480
probably originated in bats. But the most recent evidence we have suggests that it went from a bat

48
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:25,000
to something called a pangolin. You know what a pangolin is? Yeah. It's like a mini ant eater,

49
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,360
like a picture, a little tiny scaly armadillo looking thing that eats ants and little insects.

50
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,200
And these are little tiny mammals that are actually quite protected in China because they're

51
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,680
endangered. But there is some illegal poaching of these things and people do, I believe they use

52
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,560
their scales for medicinal purposes and things like that. So I think the current genetic analysis

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,840
suggests it went from a bat to a pangolin to a human. The first person was infected with that

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,000
in this part of China called Wuhan probably in about November of last year, so relatively recent.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,600
So like you said, this isn't the first time corona has showed up, but it's definitely the

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,680
worst time I'm assuming, right? Yes and no. I think it depends how you define the worst. It's

57
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,440
definitely infecting a lot of people, but there have been other coronaviruses that have shown up,

58
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,600
two in particular in the past 15 or 20 years that have been more lethal, meaning a higher

59
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,040
number of the people who got the infection died. So one of those was called SARS and one of those

60
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:41,680
was called MERS and those would kill somewhere between 10 and 30 percent. SARS about 10 percent,

61
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,480
MERS about 30 percent of the people who got it. That's a huge number, right? That means in the

62
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,400
case of SARS, one out of every 10 people that got the infection died. In the case of MERS,

63
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,600
one out of every three people died. Think about that. But the good news is those viruses didn't

64
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,880
spread very far, so very few people got them. So in some ways those were worse viruses. Of

65
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,240
course this one is spreading a lot. At this point in time we've got over a million confirmed

66
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,080
cases, but of course we probably have tens of millions of unconfirmed cases. But there are

67
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,800
other coronaviruses that come and go every summer that have infected many more people than that,

68
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,280
but they just don't cause anything more than a miserable cold. Alright, so like you were saying,

69
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,560
this has been a problem before, but do you think it will show up again after this, assuming it's

70
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,000
all resolved at some point? You mean this one in particular or another one? This one. I think

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,920
it's a bit too soon to say, but probably. Could another one show up? Yeah. Alright,

72
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,560
so this next question I'm going to ask you is probably the one all kids are wondering. When

73
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,800
do you think we're going to be able to go back to school? I don't really know. If I really had to

74
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,920
guess, I don't think you're going back to school this year. Alright, and I've heard some people

75
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,880
say that not even until maybe next year, is that true? Oh, I think it's really too soon to say. I

76
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,160
know that sounds like a cop out answer, but there are so many things we don't yet know. Like we

77
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,520
don't actually know how many people have this infection. And it could be that a lot of people

78
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,320
already have the infection and they're doing really well and it's not causing that much harm. And in

79
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,480
that case, people who aren't at very high risk for getting very sick could mosey on back to school

80
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:31,120
and move back into work and things like that. But it's also possible that we have to be much more

81
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,720
careful and much more concerned. And if that's the case, then this quarantine might be something

82
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,280
that lasts a little bit longer. Yeah. So I've just recently heard that the US has hit more cases in

83
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,360
China. Why do you think that is? Well, that's a long story. And it's one that gets my blood a

84
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,560
little bit boiling. So I don't want to talk about it too much. I mean, basically, we didn't do a good

85
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:05,680
job of preparing for it of a couple of things. So we didn't heed our warnings. So we had very

86
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:16,400
clear warning signs that this virus was out there and that this virus was very infectious. Furthermore,

87
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,720
we had lots of evidence that it could easily spread outside of China, but we didn't take a bunch of

88
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,600
steps we should have taken. Now, part of this is not just what we did or didn't do in the last

89
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
couple of months, but really, this is a much bigger problem that goes back a number of years.

90
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,440
We don't really have the infrastructure in place to prepare for something like this,

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,880
because, for example, we don't have a national stockpile of the type of equipment that doctors

92
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,160
and nurses would need to be protected from this if they're taking care of a bunch of people that

93
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,040
got sick. At the beginning of January, when the Chinese government and Chinese scientists

94
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,160
were able to figure out exactly what this virus looked like, that's called sequencing. That's

95
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,680
when you can actually look at the, basically, the fingerprint of what this virus looks like.

96
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,840
So you have a very unique fingerprint. If I took one of your hairs and took it to a lab,

97
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,120
they could tell me exactly what your DNA sequence looks like. And you're the only person in the

98
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,640
world that has that. So we would know exactly what Olivia looks like. And similarly, at the

99
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,320
first week, second week of January, the scientists in China had already done that for this virus.

100
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,200
And that would have been a great time to have doubled down on developing tests in the United

101
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,320
States or taking tests that others had developed and making sure we had enough of them, because

102
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,480
testing is a really important part of this. That's a big way that you can help understand

103
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,680
how people have it and don't have it and how you need to isolate the people that have it from those

104
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,480
who don't. So without having all those systems in place, we were also a little bit late to the party

105
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,520
in terms of understanding what to do when people showed up and were infected. So we had our first

106
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,800
case basically at about the same time that a country like South Korea had their first case.

107
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:24,080
But we have now had more than five times the number of deaths for an adjusted population,

108
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,440
meaning for every million people in the United States versus every million people in South

109
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
Korea, we've already had five times the number of deaths, even though we both started at the same

110
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,960
time effectively. And that speaks to sort of not being able to put these measures in place.

111
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,920
All right. So you were saying that you weren't very prepared and listening to the warning. So

112
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,280
how could we have been better prepared and more aware of this? Well, I mean, I think it's sort of

113
00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:00,320
what I just said. Part of it is non-specific type of preparedness. So it's having the infrastructure

114
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,760
in place to deal with pandemics. So it's having like a pandemic preparedness program that is well

115
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,560
funded, that has all of these things that don't seem that interesting when you don't need them

116
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,320
laying around ready. And then part of it is very specific to this case, which is this is a really

117
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,600
tough virus because it spreads pretty aggressively, more aggressively than say the flu virus. And

118
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,400
look, I just don't think our leaders were doing a great job. Do you think it would have helped if

119
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,680
people started to quarantine sooner than they actually did? Yes, I think it would have, especially

120
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:48,800
in places like New York, New Orleans, probably Florida. So there were places where a lot of

121
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,400
things just went kind of sideways. Like New York has a high density of people. You've been there a

122
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,840
bunch. You know what New York is like compared to San Diego. You can imagine that a virus that can

123
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,240
spread basically by you breathing on somebody is much more likely in New York. Imagine you're

124
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,000
sitting on the subway. You have these people that have to commute in and out of Manhattan every day

125
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,520
from these different boroughs. So you just have a high population that's close together that has

126
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,640
these commuting challenges where they're in close proximity to others. And so all of those things

127
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,240
would lead to kind of an amplification. And I think that in some ways New York has done the

128
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,880
best job it could, but it probably started a little later than would have been ideal compared to what

129
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,720
we now know from other countries. Yeah, so some people are saying they just want to get the virus

130
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,360
and be over it, meaning they won't have to quarantine anymore and they've already been exposed to the

131
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,120
virus. So it would be a lot easier. Do you think that's a good idea? So the technical term for

132
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,720
that idea is called herd immunity. You know what a herd is? Probably when you get it so that your

133
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,280
body is used to it. Well yeah, but like the herd means everybody, you know what I mean? So the idea

134
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,360
would be once you have chicken pox, do you remember when you had chicken pox when you were a kid?

135
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,520
You're lucky you didn't have to get it that bad because you already got a vaccine for it. But when

136
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,800
I was a kid we didn't have a vaccine for chicken pox, so when we got it it was really bad. But

137
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,200
once you get the chicken pox or once you get the vaccine for it, you're not really going to get it

138
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,080
again. I mean technically you can get a cousin of chicken pox called shingles when you get a lot

139
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,400
older. So that's what people want. They think they won't be able to get it again. That's right, but

140
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,560
there are a couple things. One, we don't really know exactly what the immunity looks like. In

141
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,400
other words, we don't know that once you get this coronavirus, if you recover from it, and let's say

142
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,720
you're one of the majority of people who recover from it, and to be clear most people who get this

143
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,520
virus recover from it. At a minimum 80 percent do, but it could be significantly higher. It could be

144
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,160
95 percent. We don't know if that immunity is going to last them for another six months, another year,

145
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,640
another five years, for the rest of their lives. We don't know. The second thing is

146
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,080
there are certain people who are at high enough risk to get sick from the virus that you might

147
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,880
not want to take the chance of letting them just get infected. So you and your friends are at

148
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,480
virtually no risk from this virus. In fact, in the United States, as of this time, there is not a

149
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,280
single person your age who has died from this virus. That's good. Yeah, it's good for you, but

150
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,040
you have to understand that you could still transmit it to somebody. So if you lived with

151
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,680
your grandparents and you were back at school and you and all your friends had it, and obviously

152
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,760
it would be great that none of you would get very sick. But what if you came home and gave it to one

153
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,400
of your grandparents or gave it to somebody who was at a higher risk and then they transmitted it?

154
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,240
So it's a bit complicated to think of that, but it's definitely something that might end up

155
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,400
happening, and we just don't know it yet. In other words, we don't really know how many people have

156
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,880
already been infected. So you're saying different age groups can have a better or lower chance of

157
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,520
getting it? I don't know if it's a better or lower chance of getting it, but it's definitely a

158
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,960
better or worse chance of dying from it or being hospitalized for sure. So the younger you are,

159
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,520
the better you are, your risk is, and the fewer diseases you have, like high blood pressure

160
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,480
or diabetes or things like that, the better your chances of surviving it.

161
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,520
All right. So what should a proper quarantine look like? Because I know that while we're

162
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,680
quarantined, we sometimes order things from Amazon, and when they order the packages, we have

163
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,760
a specific way of taking them out. We don't bring them inside. We have to wash our hands and take

164
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,800
it apart outside. So explain that kind of. Well, do you know why we're doing that, by the way? What

165
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,200
are we afraid of? We don't want to bring the germs in. Right. There's a chance that there could be

166
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,400
some virus on the cardboard box. So let's assume that the person delivering the bag or someone

167
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,200
or the box or the person who touched it a few hours earlier has the virus. Maybe they don't

168
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,280
even realize they have the virus and the virus is sitting there on the cardboard and then that

169
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,880
cardboard box gets dropped off at your door. So there was a study that was published about

170
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,560
three weeks ago that actually looked at putting the virus on different surfaces, cardboard, plastic,

171
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,320
steel, copper, those sorts of different things. And it started to measure how long the virus

172
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,840
could survive on those surfaces. And what came of that study was that this virus can live for a day,

173
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,120
maybe two days on cardboard. So what you want to do is sort of assume that anything you come in

174
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,840
contact with potentially has some amount of virus on it. Now, that study doesn't really tell us you

175
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,160
can get infected from that because maybe there's not enough virus that's really surviving that

176
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,120
you're going to get it all over you. And if you don't take appropriate precautions, it's going to

177
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,560
infect you. But it seems to me at least that the safest thing to do is to assume that anything

178
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,400
that shows up has some amount of the virus on it and that virus could potentially infect you. So

179
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,520
what we're doing is we're opening Amazon packages outside. We're cleaning off the contents of them

180
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,880
and then just washing our hands really thoroughly. And you remember how long we have to wash our

181
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,200
hands for? 20 seconds. You got it. And that is a lot longer than it feels like, isn't it? It is.

182
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,120
Reese is the best at that, by the way. Is he? Yeah, that kid can wash his hands.

183
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,560
Well, Airy just throws soap everywhere. Yeah, he's not so good at washing his hands.

184
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,520
So is there anything else we haven't covered that you think kids should know about this virus?

185
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:01,120
I don't know, but there is something I do want to use as an example for kids to think about,

186
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,040
because I've been thinking about this a lot with you as we're going through this. So you can

187
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,880
probably tell, I mean, do I seem like I've been more irritable in the last month than normal?

188
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,840
Yes, kind of. Yeah, I apologize for that. But I think part of the irritability I feel is

189
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:27,200
just a frustration in what I consider to be kind of incompetence. And I think it's worth

190
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,680
using this as a teaching point because you asked a question, how did we get here? And the underlying

191
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:41,760
theme to how we got here is we didn't really do the things we needed to do before it was too late.

192
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,800
And so why does that happen? I mean, is it because we don't want to? I mean, I think the point here is

193
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,280
it's sometimes really hard to do things for which the payoff is far in the future.

194
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
But that's kind of what you're explaining this morning, right?

195
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:08,560
Yeah. So we're talking about the thought experiment of imagine mom and I never once

196
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,880
harped on what you ate, what time you went to bed, how much you looked at your iPad,

197
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,320
how much TV you watched, when you exercised, what sports you played, what activities you did,

198
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,000
when you did your homework. Like imagine you could do anything you wanted. You could watch as much

199
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,960
flash as you wanted. Okay, that sounds kind of fun. You can eat as much ice cream as you wanted.

200
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,560
Think through how much fun you could have if you were allowed to do anything you wanted.

201
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,880
I think it would be fun for a little bit, but then I would obviously in the long run,

202
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,800
it would be really rough. But how do you make that trade off?

203
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,280
You have to have discipline now so that it can benefit you later.

204
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,760
But that's hard. It is really hard. You know it because you and me and we all struggle with this.

205
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,360
We make these decisions today that don't always feel good. You make these sacrifices. Remember

206
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,200
what Jaco's, what do my Jaco shirts say on them? That before the enemy or that one. Discipline

207
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,840
equals freedom. What does that mean? It means the more you have discipline, the more free you'll be.

208
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,640
Eventually. Not in the moment, but eventually you will be. Right. And so when you think about

209
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,920
why it is that you can't just eat all the ice cream in the world, even though in the moment,

210
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:34,240
it feels so good, it is undoubtedly more pleasurable to eat ice cream than not to eat ice cream.

211
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,280
It is undoubtedly more pleasurable in the moment to watch as much flash as you want and do as much

212
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,000
TikTok as you want and screw around on your computer as much as you want. Those things

213
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,560
feel awesome. I can't deny that. But the problem is you will pay the fiddler tomorrow.

214
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,240
And life in some ways is a balancing act between enjoying things for the sake of enjoying them in

215
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,240
the moment and indulging, but also being responsible enough to make sure that when

216
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,520
something goes wrong, you're prepared. I think if you're a kid and you're listening to this,

217
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:18,160
it's important to understand that the adults screwed this up. This is a great example of

218
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,960
the adults not doing their homework, not saving their allowance, not eating their vegetables,

219
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,800
not exercising, just completely dropping the ball. And now we're paying the fiddler.

220
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,760
That's a problem. I think it's a huge problem. And that's probably the thing

221
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,000
that on a deep level has me most upset right now. It's that a whole bunch of innocent people

222
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,400
are suffering badly because the people who are supposed to be in charge, the grownups,

223
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,000
so to speak, couldn't make the long-term trade off. They couldn't sacrifice in the moment.

224
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,360
They couldn't invest the time, the money, the infrastructure in science that was necessary

225
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,840
to make sure that when this happened, we were prepared. And so I have to hope that this is

226
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,120
a wake-up call. And I have to hope that when this is over, maybe you guys will be the ones

227
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,600
to tell the adults, quit screwing around. So we were talking about this this morning.

228
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,400
And an example you used was that Reese was watching a show called Biggest Little Farm.

229
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,960
And the people in that show, they had to grow their own food. They had to produce everything

230
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,720
by themselves. And if they didn't wake up one morning, even if it was raining, and they didn't

231
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,080
go outside and garden or help their animals, then they wouldn't have food in the long run,

232
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,640
and they would starve. So they kind of had to do what they needed to do for the future.

233
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, I'm glad you remember that example. I think that's another great one is farming. Think about

234
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,320
if you have to go out there and plant your crops and go and tend to them and tend to your animals.

235
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,160
And if you just for a month decide, eh, I don't feel like doing it. I mean, I'd rather just screw

236
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,800
around. Well, you're going to starve when winter comes. Another question I had was, I was wondering,

237
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:16,880
is this China's fault? It has become incredibly convenient to blame China for all of this.

238
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,920
Consider the following scenario. You don't drive yet, but you know what it's like to be in a car

239
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,480
with me or your mom, right? I know it's like to be in a race car. Yep. So imagine you're driving

240
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,960
down the freeway and somebody changes lanes in front of you and cuts you off and they don't signal.

241
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,880
Is that their fault or your fault? That's their fault. That's right.

242
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,800
Now, how you respond to that is up to you. I could honk my horn or I could just.

243
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,840
Well, okay. Yeah, that's true. But I'm saying like how you respond from a safety perspective

244
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,640
is up to you. If you're paying attention and they cut you off, I mean, that happens like 10 times

245
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,840
a day. So if you're doing everything right, you're probably not going to die when somebody

246
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
cuts you off on a freeway. So like if you're texting and they cut you off, that could be a

247
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,640
worse situation. Exactly. Now imagine for a moment that you're speeding. You've had a couple of drinks.

248
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,200
You don't have your seatbelt on. You're texting and somebody cuts you off. That's not going to

249
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,040
work out too well for you. Now whose fault is it? That's my fault. Well, it's both of your faults

250
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,400
at this point. True, because that person did cut me off, but I was kind of not doing the right thing.

251
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,720
You were not doing your best to be ready for the situation. Okay. And that's kind of how I think

252
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,520
about this. To sit here and blame China for all of this, even though that's clearly where the virus

253
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:53,280
originated. And it's probably in part due to practices of food handling that we would never

254
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:59,280
do in this country. And all of those things are true. But again, we have to take responsibility

255
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,360
for all this. So China may have cut us off in the freeway, so to speak, but we were driving too fast.

256
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,320
We didn't have our seat belts on. We had a couple of drinks in us. We were texting and we were

257
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,440
looking back to check on our kids in the car seat and tell them to stop arguing with you. I mean,

258
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,800
we bungled every aspect of this. And I just think that in the moment when you're spinning out of

259
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,400
control, it's easy to say that guy cut me off. But at some point you got to be like,

260
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,280
I was doing something wrong too. Yeah, you were doing a bunch of things wrong.

261
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,520
I want to ask you a bunch of questions now. Okay. So Olivia, we went into quarantine a week before

262
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,640
your school closed. Right. That was about as upset as I've seen you in a long time when you went to

263
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
school on a day and I said, Hey, Olivia, this is going to be your last day at school for a while.

264
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,680
So can you please bring all your books home? What did you think when I said that?

265
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,040
I thought you were absolutely out of your mind because I've learned a lot about the virus since

266
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,680
then. And at that point when you said that I didn't even realize how bad the coronavirus was.

267
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,600
And I did start learning about it until a couple of weeks ago and none of my friends were leaving

268
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,600
school like I was. So I thought it would be really weird. I thought I would fall behind in

269
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,800
schoolwork and I thought I would be the only one. And I thought it was very odd and I couldn't leave

270
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,840
the house. So I couldn't do basketball. I couldn't go to drums. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't do

271
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,120
singing. And yeah, I was really upset at first, but then the next day a few of my friends dropped

272
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,560
out and then the next day school closed. I don't think school closed till the following Monday,

273
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,840
but I think they told you in that they said a few days later, Monday would be the last day.

274
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,280
Yeah. So a lot of my friends started dropping out and I was like, oh, oh, okay. Because I thought

275
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,880
me and my brother would be the only ones that weren't going to school. And the first few days,

276
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
all my friends were texting me, where are you? Why aren't you at school? And then kids started

277
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,400
dropping out super fast and then schools closed. So what's been the hardest part of this for you?

278
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,680
No friends because I'm a really social person. I usually have a million play dates.

279
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,080
And so not seeing my friends has been really hard for me probably. And also no sports because

280
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,640
basketball season just started and I couldn't play any games until next fall now.

281
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,080
What's been the hardest part about working, doing online classes and stuff?

282
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,240
Definitely having questions because usually at school, if you have questions, you can ask the

283
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,080
teacher after class. But now that teachers have things to do after each class, you can't really

284
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,840
stay online because you have another class right there. It's kind of hard to explain, but online,

285
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,400
it's hard to ask questions because everyone's talking over each other. It's total madness.

286
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,080
Like I have a headache after each class. And yeah, I do not like online school. I wish we could have

287
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,960
schooled back. That's interesting. So when you go back to school, assuming you go back to school in

288
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,600
the fall, back into actual school, what will you appreciate now that you probably didn't appreciate

289
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,960
in the past? Just school in general. Like me and my friends are saying how we took school for granted

290
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,720
and we didn't realize how amazing it was to have school because now we wish we had school.

291
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:19,440
That's interesting. What has been the best and worst part of your dad not traveling for the

292
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,480
longest time ever? Well, I have to work out a lot. So that's not fun. But I do like you being

293
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,800
home more because you made crepes this morning and you're just here to help more. And I think

294
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,120
it's really fun that we have a puppy during quarantine. So that's like really lucky that

295
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,440
we got her a few weeks before quarantine started. And so yeah, I mean, quarantine is good and bad

296
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,480
in some ways. Yeah. What's the deal with this puppy? She pees every three seconds of her life.

297
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,080
Yeah. Is that ever going to stop? I hope so because yeah, you could always walk around

298
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,360
the house and if you step in a puddle, you know what it is. So you don't regret that we got her?

299
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,120
No, I don't. I really like her. You don't think she's too much work? No.

300
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,040
How many watts are you up to on your zone two workouts now? 65 to 70, but I think I can start

301
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,560
coming higher because I'm doing longer rides now too. Yeah. What was your last lactate level at 70

302
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,880
watts? It was like 2.1 or something like that, 2.3. Pretty good. Do your friends think you're a freak

303
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
that your dad has lactate testing on you? They don't really know that part, but they do know

304
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,320
that I work out. They just don't know what lactate is, which I didn't until a couple months ago.

305
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,600
Well, Olivia, thank you very much for making the time. I know you've got a lot of things going on

306
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,320
today. I hope we answered questions that your friends would find interesting. Yeah, me too.

307
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
Is there anything else that you want to know about the coronavirus or that you think your

308
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,480
friends might want to know? I think we've covered it all, but yeah, I think that's it.

309
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,840
All right. Do you think there's any chance we'll get Reese on the podcast?

310
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,800
Oh, that would definitely be crazy. I mean, I'm sure he'd love it and you guys talk about

311
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,800
gardening and trash cans and what else does he do? Trains, Legos, probably talk about that.

312
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,920
We'll see if maybe he'll hear this one and he'll decide he wants to do one too.

313
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,080
Yeah. Speaking of which, I have online drums to go to now.

314
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,640
That's right.

315
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,920
Yep.

316
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,120
All right. Thanks, Olivia.

317
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,520
Thank you.

318
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,040
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

319
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,440
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

320
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,880
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

321
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,160
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

322
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,760
bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

323
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,880
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

324
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,240
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

325
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,000
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

326
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,360
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less

327
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,680
than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions,

328
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,800
topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

329
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,720
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

330
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,720
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

331
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,880
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you
