00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hey folks, welcome to a special episode that deals with kind of the aftermath and some

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,360
of the questions that are surrounding us in the wake of the brutal death of George Floyd.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,100
A lot of people have been speaking about this in their own way, choosing to post various

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,200
things on social media.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,280
I've never really thought I had much to offer with respect to doing stuff like that.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,240
For me, it's been a very difficult couple of days kind of just thinking about this stuff

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,000
and not really knowing how to explain it to my daughter who has been asking a lot of questions

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,400
about it.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,240
I kind of wrestled with this idea of doing a podcast or not.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,880
In the end, I sort of decided this evening after dinner that I was going to do this.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,400
Olivia and I sat down for maybe 20 minutes or something to talk about stuff that we have

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,080
been talking about all week.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,440
I really wanted to talk more in terms of something that I had some knowledge of.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't consider myself an expert in law enforcement, racism, the history of police brutality, all

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,120
of the things that might factor into this.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,560
There is one area that I do think I have some knowledge in that I can speak to and it has

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,880
to do with the training of physicians.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,280
There's something I've thought a lot about.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,960
I approach this conversation with Olivia as I often approach conversations with her, which

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,840
is sort of touching on a framework and an understanding then maybe that's broader than

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
this problem.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
As with all podcasts, of course, I can't address all things and that's more true in this podcast

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,480
than probably any podcast I'll ever produce.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,400
I do talk about one very particular way that I think about what's going on and perhaps

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,520
more importantly, how we can start to get a handle on it.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,720
This podcast might not be for you.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,000
If it doesn't resonate with you, I apologize, but I think that for some folks, especially

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,260
folks with kids who are struggling to kind of explain to them what's going on, perhaps

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,760
you'll find this helpful.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Hi, Olivia.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,920
Thanks for sitting down to talk for a few minutes tonight.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Hi.

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,840
So there's been a lot going on for the last few days and I know you're in the middle of

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
finals and I know that if that weren't enough, you've got a quarantine going on that you're

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
probably kind of at your wit's end with.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,860
But tell me a little bit about how you feel about the last few days and how you've heard

37
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,840
about it and what you and your friends are talking about.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
At first I was seeing it on everyone's Instagram, Justice for George, and I was confused.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
I was like, what is that?

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,200
And then I started looking it up and I was like, whoa, this just happened.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,840
And then I started reading articles about it to see what happened.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,680
And this is the first time that I've actually heard about something like this that's happened

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
recently because the only ever times I've heard about it is when I was younger and I

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
don't remember it.

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
But everyone that I text is sending like Black Lives Matter and they're all doing different

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
color fists.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,200
And I think that's great that they're noticing what's happening.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,520
And I just don't understand how this can happen because like, would people judge you about

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,760
the color of your eyes?

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,400
Like what's the difference with skin color?

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,320
I mean, it's a very complicated question, Olivia, and it goes back hundreds of years.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,820
And you know how the other day we were talking about all the different things in school that

53
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,880
I'm really looking forward to you learning in greater detail?

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,120
Well, one of those things is history.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,960
And I don't think you've yet really fully understood the history of how Black people

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,120
came to this country and what terms that was under.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,960
And what conditions of racism produced it and allowed it to continue for literally

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,440
hundreds of years.

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,880
And I hope that when you get to studying history, you will understand that it's not just about

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,720
taking tests and passing tests and getting answers or writing essays, but it's about

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,600
really understanding the systemic nature of racism.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,080
I want to tell you an interesting story that I've never told you before.

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
I don't think I've ever told mom the story either.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,120
So I kind of have slightly different skin color, right?

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Like if you look at me, you know, I'm not perfectly white.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm not black.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,800
I mean, I kind of look like I'm something, right?

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You also have slightly darker skin.

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Yeah, I don't know what I am.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,080
As a result of that.

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,040
So when I was in college, which was in an area that was pretty much exclusively white

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,240
people, one day, it was 1995.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,760
I remember this very well.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,520
I was riding my bike to the gym.

75
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,760
I used to go to this gym a couple of miles from my house and I'm riding my bike and

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,720
you're supposed to ride your bike on the right side of the road, but like, I don't know,

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
I forget.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,440
I think there was like a lot of water and snow in the ground.

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:38,560
So I rode up on the sidewalk and a police officer pulled his car right in front of me

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,280
and yanked me off my bike and threw me onto the grass right in front of where I went to

81
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
the gym.

82
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,040
And I took place right in front of the gym that I went to and I basically stood up and

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,560
said, what the F man?

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,360
And he said, were you in such and such a place at such and such a time?

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

86
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,080
He goes, you can't ride your bike here.

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
And I was like totally confused by what was going on.

88
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
He kept going back and forth between I'm not allowed to ride my bike on the sidewalk and

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
then sort of making these accusations.

90
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,600
And he said an older woman was mugged near here like yesterday or something like that.

91
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,520
And it was really clear at that point, what he was basically saying, which was you did

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,640
this and I can't prove it, but that's my suspicion.

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,880
I don't like the way you look.

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,600
And the fact that you're riding your bike on a sidewalk where you shouldn't be riding

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,040
it is my chance to make that case.

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,960
Eventually, a whole bunch of people came out from the gym, apparently, including somebody

97
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,920
who was kind of related to him.

98
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,200
It was a small town that I went to college in and he basically let me walk away.

99
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,280
And I was pretty shaken up about that.

100
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,560
That was super upsetting to me.

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,520
And of course, to put that in the perspective of what we're talking about today, that's

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,840
like one, one millionth of the type of racial profiling and racial discrimination that is

103
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,320
experienced by black people in the United States and elsewhere, but certainly in the

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,880
United States on a daily basis.

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Something that, I mean, you just won't understand and nor will I.

106
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,720
Why do you think he did that?

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,280
I think it's a combination of factors.

108
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,480
In my example, I think certainly racism played a role.

109
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,320
I don't believe that he would have done that to anybody else necessarily.

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,880
But I also think in that case, there was some indication that he legitimately felt like,

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,000
hey, this is a guy, this is a kid who's riding on the wrong side of the road or up on the

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,360
sidewalk and he shouldn't be.

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,640
And oh, by the way, I have a reason of suspicion that there's some bad apple somewhere out

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,840
here and this is what I'm going to do.

115
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,440
And that's, it's hard to imagine that times a thousand.

116
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,880
And that's what's going on in the case of someone like George Floyd or any one of the

117
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,160
other people whose names we don't know.

118
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,560
Remember, the reason we know about this, Olivia, is it's caught on video.

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Yeah.

120
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,280
There can be so many other people just like this that we don't know about.

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
Well, that's exactly right.

122
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,760
And you have to think about imagine an era when you didn't have cell phones that were

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,000
could capture anything and everything by video.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,640
How many times do you think this has already happened?

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Probably more than we can count.

126
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Yeah.

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,040
You would need scientific notation to count the number of times this has happened.

128
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,920
So when I was reading the article where I started to learn about this, I saw, so when

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,200
George Floyd was in the deli and he gave a check that people thought was fake, I saw

130
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,200
a comment in the article that said one time I went to Home Depot and I used a fake $20

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,280
bill and they knew it was fake and they gave it back to me and let me just walk out because

132
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I was white.

133
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Yeah.

134
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,100
There's absolutely no question that a white person and a black person has a completely

135
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,720
different interaction with, frankly, law enforcement, the criminal justice system, all of these

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,040
things.

137
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm glad to see how much this is upsetting you.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,720
It's good to see that this is upsetting to you.

139
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,120
As much as I hate to see a kid upset, it should upset you.

140
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
It should upset you greatly.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,280
Well, why do you think that police officers do this?

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,560
I mean, the only difference is that some people have darker skin, some people have lighter

143
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
skin.

144
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Why does that make them more likely to get killed or hurt?

145
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
I mean, it comes down to racism.

146
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,360
This is what we call systemic racism.

147
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,560
And so the real question is why is it tolerated in the police force?

148
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Yeah.

149
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,760
Shouldn't there be some sort of, I don't know how to put this, but like a test to see if

150
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,520
you're not racist before they let you on to be a police officer?

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,680
Because it's not fair that innocent people are getting killed because of this.

152
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Yeah.

153
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,200
I mean, I've been thinking about this a lot, Olivia.

154
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,240
I've seen some people who are very thoughtful make comments like, hey, look, there are very

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,520
few protesters that are actually looting and there are very few police officers that are

156
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,480
going to do what this guy did.

157
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
It's mostly good police officers and mostly good protesters.

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,200
And we're focusing most of our attention on the worst of both groups.

159
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,880
There may be some truth to that, but a counter argument to that is, isn't law enforcement

160
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,640
a profession in which we can't tolerate any of this?

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Don't we need a zero tolerance policy for this?

162
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,560
Would you want to fly on airplanes?

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
I think Chris Rock used this analogy.

164
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,560
Would you want to fly on airplanes where 99% of the pilots were good and 1% were horrible?

165
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,600
No, you wouldn't because that 1% could make a difference that they're horrible.

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah.

167
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,720
It's totally unacceptable paradigm.

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,600
So I've been thinking about this a little bit and I actually realized that I don't know

169
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,800
what the analogy is and I don't know if the airlines are the right analogy, but I think

170
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,640
a good analogy is actually doctors.

171
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Comparing doctors to police officers is better than trying to compare police officers to

172
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
pilots.

173
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Well, one, I think there are probably more interactions that are interpersonal that are

174
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,800
the ones that we're really talking about.

175
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I think that's probably the most different thing.

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,400
When you talk about a pilot being ethical or not ethical, moral or amoral, and of course,

177
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
by the way, there are examples of pilots that have done very bad things.

178
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,880
There are pilots that have crashed airplanes deliberately, but the frequency of that is

179
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,320
so incredibly low.

180
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,920
But in medicine, there really are some bad doctors out there and I don't mean bad doctors

181
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
that aren't smart.

182
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,280
I mean doctors that do horrible things that abuse patients.

183
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,120
There's a very famous doctor.

184
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,680
He was the doctor of the US gymnastics team and he abused many of the gymnasts.

185
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
I mean, these are despicable doctors.

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,560
And so I wonder if that's a better analogy.

187
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,080
And in medicine, there are basically three types of mistakes you can make.

188
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,400
And I think of this as a very important way to think about how you train people.

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,280
There are technical mistakes.

190
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,860
There are judgment mistakes.

191
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,680
There are normative mistakes.

192
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,960
Do any of those words mean anything to you?

193
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,680
Normative mistakes that can mean like mistakes that you don't mean to cause?

194
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,720
No, actually that's not what normative is.

195
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
So let me explain what these are.

196
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,000
So a technical mistake is like if you think about surgery, which is the easiest place

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,480
to explain it, a technical error is you mean to do something, but you make a mistake.

198
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
You cut too much, you cut too little, you poke too much, you poke too little.

199
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,360
The patient is hurt as a result of a technical error that you make.

200
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,960
I've made many technical errors in my residency when I was training.

201
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,560
I remember once doing an operation on a patient and I cut the bile duct by accident when I

202
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,120
didn't mean to doing an operation.

203
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,600
Do we forgive people who make those kinds of mistakes?

204
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah, because they didn't want to do that.

205
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,080
That's true, but there's a bigger and a more important point there.

206
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,120
We forgive them provided what?

207
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,040
They have to own the mistake immediately.

208
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,520
They can never try to cover it up.

209
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
They can't deny it.

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,400
They have to own up to their mistake and not hide the fact that they made a mistake about

211
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
that.

212
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
That's right.

213
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,680
The other condition to that is you must learn from your mistakes and not make the same mistakes

214
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,760
over and over again.

215
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,960
If I cut the bile duct every single week, that would be a problem.

216
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,800
If I'm putting a central line in a patient, which is a special IV that goes into their

217
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,720
neck and I constantly poke their lung, which causes a huge catastrophe of problems, and

218
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,200
even if I admit to it every time but never get better, that is a problem.

219
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
That's also not helpful.

220
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,760
Even if you do admit it, that's still not going to make it better in this case.

221
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,240
Yeah, at some point you just have to decide.

222
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,160
Maybe you're not technically capable of doing this job.

223
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,720
That's a technical error.

224
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
Then there's an error of judgment.

225
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,160
Judgment errors are a little harder to understand, but it basically says, should I or should

226
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,800
I not operate on this patient now?

227
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,160
Should I or should I not change this medication now?

228
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,880
Should I or should I not admit this patient to the hospital now or send this patient home

229
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,320
or call in another doctor to help consult with this?

230
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,400
Now again, you can make lots of mistakes with respect to judgment.

231
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Are they forgivable?

232
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,200
They can be as long as you own up to what you did.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
And you don't repeat them.

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,840
Okay, now enter normative errors.

235
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,040
Normative errors are the third class of error in training physicians.

236
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,020
These are errors of character.

237
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,640
This is when you lie about something.

238
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Let me give you examples that I witnessed firsthand.

239
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,160
You go in to see a patient in the emergency room who comes in with an infection, and you

240
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,480
give them an antibiotic.

241
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,880
You don't ask them if they're allergic to the antibiotic.

242
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,700
They have an allergic reaction to the antibiotic.

243
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,880
You go back and change the form where it says, what was their allergy to the antibiotic and

244
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,720
you write in, oh, they had a penicillin allergy, even though you didn't ask them.

245
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
Seems like a little error, doesn't it?

246
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
No.

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Why?

248
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Why isn't that just a little error?

249
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
Because when you lie about something that you did like that, that just makes it worse.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,320
Well, what if in that case, the patient was fine?

251
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,200
You gave them penicillin.

252
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,600
They had an allergy to the penicillin.

253
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
You gave them the appropriate Benadryl or epinephrine or whatever they needed to not

254
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,440
die from it, and they're totally fine.

255
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,080
But you went back and you changed your form.

256
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,520
That's still not right.

257
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Why is it not right?

258
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,920
Well, you have to live with the fact that you did that, and you could have hurt them

259
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,520
if you didn't know how to fix it.

260
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
That's true.

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,120
There's an even deeper issue, which is people who consistently make those kinds of mistakes,

262
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,360
or frankly, make those kinds of mistakes at all, will go on to make bigger and bigger

263
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
and bigger.

264
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
That's right.

265
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,280
They make bigger and bigger versions of those mistakes.

266
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:48,920
And so a good training system in medicine is one that fosters and encourages open and

267
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,320
honest discussion of technical errors and judgment errors, but it immediately identifies

268
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,160
normative errors and kicks those people out of programs.

269
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,080
And not just kicks those people out of programs, kicks those people out of medicine.

270
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,600
If a person commits a normative error and they are kicked out of one program only to

271
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,900
be picked up by another program, that hasn't really solved the problem.

272
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,000
They can just still make more mistakes like that.

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's right.

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,400
They're still going to make their way into the field and the practice of medicine.

275
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,840
And so as I think about these awful things that have happened and I start to think about

276
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,880
what can I do about it, well, the short answer is I have no clue.

277
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,800
I know what to do in terms of voting and I know what to do in terms of protesting and

278
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I know what to do with those things.

279
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,640
But the thing that I think a lot about is how do you change the training?

280
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,480
How do you identify systemic racism in training?

281
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,800
And to me it comes down to basically identifying traits that are prevalent in a way that are

282
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,920
going to be amplified this way later on.

283
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Does that make sense?

284
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,280
In other words, we should be treating racism as a normative error.

285
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:02,040
And when it shows up in even the smallest ways, it has to be tolerated zero.

286
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,200
Just as we wouldn't tolerate a doctor who says, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,920
I did ask that patient if they had an allergy and they said nothing.

288
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,960
I don't know what they're talking about.

289
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,680
I can't believe they had a penicillin allergy.

290
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,980
You have to be very careful.

291
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,700
And I know it sounds like a silly example, but Olivia, I've seen lots of people make

292
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,280
those normative errors where they lie about things.

293
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,040
They put their own interests ahead of a patient's interest.

294
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,200
Another example, I've seen doctors do it financially.

295
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,640
For example, there are two drugs that you could give a patient and the doctor has a

296
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,800
financial interest to use one instead of the other.

297
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,880
And they use the more expensive one because they have a financial interest in that.

298
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,840
Again, it's another example of a normative error.

299
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,400
So I don't know if I answered some of your questions because you've been asking me so

300
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,300
many great questions in the last couple of days, but I think that somewhere down the

301
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,420
line people a lot smarter than me have to understand what the normative equivalent looks

302
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:11,940
like to the type of racism that can lead to a police officer putting his knee on the neck

303
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:19,100
of a black man for nearly nine minutes for no apparent reason.

304
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,580
Because that can't be the first time he has acted in a racist way.

305
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,980
That guy's been a racist for a long time.

306
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,540
Why didn't we figure that out?

307
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,540
Yeah.

308
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
What's the norm?

309
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,460
That's the guy who is so far down the road that he's cutting off the patient's wrong

310
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,140
leg out of sheer sloppiness.

311
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,300
Then he should be more than just fired for doing that because if this is repetitive,

312
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
that's not right.

313
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Yeah.

314
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
And that's my point.

315
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,820
It's not even right to do it one time, but multiple times.

316
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,340
Well, my point is how do we know what was seen the first time?

317
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,740
I mean, at some point, I mean, not to get too far down this path, you have to have a

318
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,780
self policing system.

319
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,140
And this is not true in most systems.

320
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,100
So I'm not singling out police officers here because I don't think doctors like to police

321
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,900
other doctors any more than police officers like to police other police themselves or

322
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
teachers want to police teachers.

323
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,120
But remember, racism exists in a lot of professions.

324
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,900
It exists in medicine.

325
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,760
It exists in justice.

326
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,740
It exists in education.

327
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
It exists everywhere.

328
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,260
It certainly exists in the military.

329
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:33,340
It's just the stakes are so high in law enforcement that that's why we're seeing it the way we're

330
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,460
seeing it here.

331
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,220
And I think the point I want to make tonight as we sit here and try to make sense of this

332
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:47,780
is I hope that there's a way that we can take this idea of normative errors as a tool that

333
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,820
we can use to identify people who are making mistakes that are acceptable because they

334
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,340
can be learned from and improved upon versus unacceptable mistakes and quickly getting

335
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,940
those people out of the system.

336
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,520
It's one thing to say we may never completely eradicate racism.

337
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,960
It's quite another thing to say we're going to tolerate racist police officers.

338
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
You see the difference?

339
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,080
The stakes are much higher.

340
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,800
The biggest question is what can we even do about this?

341
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,840
There is probably one of the best videos I've seen going around on this.

342
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm going to show it to you later today.

343
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:28,800
It's by this rapper and activist Killer Mike and was at a press conference and he gave

344
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,040
a very eloquent, passionate speech about what exactly you can and can't do.

345
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,120
And it was like, hey, rioting, looting, that's not the thing to do.

346
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,520
Yes, I know you're angry.

347
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,600
Yes, you know, you have every reason to be upset, but that's not the productive thing

348
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
to do.

349
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,440
The productive thing to do is not just march and not just send your fisted emoji to your

350
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,560
friend.

351
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,960
It's actually do something political.

352
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,600
It's change the system, right?

353
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,800
It's vote out the people who allow this type of racism to proliferate.

354
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
That's one example.

355
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,000
I thought that was a very elegant example.

356
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,320
Have you guys talked about this in school?

357
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,520
Like it actually formally in any of your classes.

358
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,840
For some reason, teachers don't talk about politics like this in school, but I wish they

359
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,720
did because I want to know more about it.

360
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,840
That's so crazy to me.

361
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,040
Your teachers have not said anything about this?

362
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
No.

363
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,680
What do you guys think about that?

364
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,400
As students, do you talk about it amongst yourselves and say, why are they not saying

365
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
anything?

366
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Yeah, all these group chats in my grade are blowing up right now, but the teachers don't

367
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
really do anything.

368
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Hmm.

369
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,360
I don't know what to say about that, but I'm glad that you and I get to talk about it.

370
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Yeah.

371
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Thank you.

372
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
Well, thanks for making time to sit down tonight.

373
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,120
I know you got to get back to studying.

374
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,360
Bye.

375
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,040
