00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Hey everyone, welcome to a sneak peek, Ask Me Anything or AMA episode of The Drive Podcast.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,380
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,980
At the end of this short episode, I'll explain how you can access the AMA episodes in full

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,060
along with a ton of other membership benefits we've created.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,640
Or you can learn more now by going to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,980
So without further delay, here's today's sneak peek of the Ask Me Anything episode.

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:44,360
Hey everyone, welcome to Ask Me Anything episode number 31.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm joined once again by Bob Kaplan, although as you'll learn at the end of this episode,

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,980
this will be the last time we're joined by Bob Kaplan, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,820
In today's episode, we talk about really two things in detail.

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,060
One is HRV, heart rate variability.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,780
We've had so many questions on this subject for the past couple of years and we've just

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,900
been slowly kind of collecting questions until we thought we had enough to do kind of one

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,540
of our thematic shows on it.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,260
And the second thing we talk about is ethanol, all things related to ethanol.

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,500
So how does it affect HRV is really our segue, but then also what are the effects of alcohol

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
on sleep?

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,580
We go after mortality, probably where we spend most of our time and we talk about it

19
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,700
through the lens of all of the epidemiology as most of you or may some of you know, there's

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,180
a confusing body of literature out there that suggests that maybe some alcohol is good for

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,420
you and no alcohol is not as good for you.

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,900
And so we go really deep on this subject matter.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,220
So again, if you have any questions about alcohol or if you drink at all, or if you

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,460
don't drink and you're wondering if you should be drinking, I think this episode will be

25
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,780
very helpful for you.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,060
So one thing I want to point out for this episode, this episode was just due to some

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,900
limitations of timing when we recorded it.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,540
This was not recorded in video, so we will only be doing this in audio.

29
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,220
That might make the show notes a little more important, although we didn't really have

30
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,860
a lot of content here that necessitated being able to see.

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,100
So I think you're going to be fine listening to this in audio, but obviously the show notes

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,260
will have any of the graphs and other images that we talk about.

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,020
Now, if you're not a subscriber, of course you can get a sneak peek of this as usual,

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,420
and then you'll have to obviously subscribe if you want to enjoy the full content.

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,460
So without further delay, I hope you enjoy AMA number 31.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Hey Bob, how's it going today?

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
Going well Peter.

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
How are you?

39
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,460
It's good.

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
It's a little unusual today.

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,860
We're doing this a little bit on the old school tip, no video today.

42
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,800
We're going to be a little bit more descriptive in our terms since people can't watch our

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
facial expressions, although that somehow provided any value.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
We won't do any screen sharing.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
I think we can manage.

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
What do you have in store for us today?

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,840
So I aggregated a whole bunch of questions around HRV, heart rate variability, and alcohol.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,800
Many questions on both those topics.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,240
I know this has been something you've been asking me about for a year.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
When are we going to do one on HRV?

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
When are we going to do one on HRV?

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,680
So I think the answer is now.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
All right.

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,560
We'll dive in.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
First question.

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
Seems relevant.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
What is HRV?

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
It's funny.

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,520
This is a tougher question to answer without an image, but I'll do my best.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,440
As you pointed out a second ago, HRV stands for heart rate variability.

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,200
That's a pretty descriptive term because what it measures is the variation in time between

62
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
heartbeats.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
That's measured in milliseconds.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
So 1,000 milliseconds is one second.

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:52,480
So if a person's heart is beating 60 times per minute, you might say, well, there's 1,000

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,280
milliseconds between every beat, but it turns out that it's not really that way.

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,280
You see, even if your heart is beating 60 times per minute or once per second, between

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,000
the first beat and the second beat, it might be 1,010 milliseconds.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,040
And between that beat and the next beat, it might be 960 milliseconds.

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,320
And between that beat and the beat thereafter, it might be 1,027 milliseconds.

71
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,000
When you start looking at this thing at the level of thousandths of a second, you realize

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,280
that there is actually some variability.

73
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,960
If anybody has ever seen an EKG, which I'm sure everybody has seen, but maybe you haven't

74
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,600
thought so much about what all the little squiggly lines mean, without going into the

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,920
details of what the P wave and the QRS and T waves mean, I think most people will recognize

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,640
that there is a very big spike for each of those beats.

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,960
And that's actually the R spike.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,800
If you now measure the distance between the Rs, we call that the RR interval, and you

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,600
take the root mean square of the successive differences between the heartbeats.

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,520
So that means you calculate the time difference between each RR interval.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,640
Each of those values is squared, so multiplied by itself.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,440
Then the result is averaged before the square root of the total is obtained.

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,520
So it's just kind of a mathematical method for trying to approximate differences.

84
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
You get what's called the RMSSD.

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,420
Again, if you just think about that in units, you took something that was in milliseconds,

86
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,760
you squared it, so it became milliseconds squared.

87
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
You added them all up.

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
It was still milliseconds squared.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You took the square root of it.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
It's back to milliseconds.

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,920
So RMSSD is reported in milliseconds.

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,440
If anybody's been paying attention to wearables, a number of these things will calculate your

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,000
heart rate variability, typically while you're sleeping, and you'll notice it gives you a

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,560
number in milliseconds.

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,140
I think prior to the advent of wearables, this was typically just done with an EKG or

96
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,660
another sort of chest strap-like device that was very accurately measuring the electrical

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,180
activity of the heart.

98
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,220
The next question is probably why do we measure HRV?

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,220
So you talked about heart rate.

100
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,800
I think people would understand measuring heart rate and maybe why that matters, why

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,320
you might want a lower heart rate in general.

102
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Why do we measure HRV?

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
What does it tell us?

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,620
What can it tell us possibly?

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,120
As I alluded to above, the heart, even when your heart rate is not changing, and if you're

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,600
at rest, which is when we measure HRV, so we don't really measure HRV when you're out

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400
and about moving around because just the movement itself that you're undergoing is going to

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
change your heart rate.

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,440
So if I stand up from my desk and go and walk over to the kitchen and do something, well,

110
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,560
that's going to increase my heart rate just because I stood up.

111
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,920
And if I'm exercising, obviously my heart rate is changing quite a bit.

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,440
So this is really something that we care about when you're at rest.

113
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,440
But as I said, there is variability between those beats.

114
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,380
And it turns out that that variability is heavily influenced by which of the autonomic

115
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,920
nervous systems is most dominant.

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,480
So this probably warrants a slight detour.

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,660
So we have broadly, broadly speaking, two nervous systems.

118
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,140
We have one that is under our control and one that is not under our control.

119
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,560
And that's a very good thing.

120
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,480
If you want to reach for and grab a pencil or walk, obviously that requires voluntary

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
control.

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,080
You want to be in control of those nerves firing and making muscles do their thing.

123
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,440
But you certainly don't want to have to be thinking and consciously making things happen

124
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
that need to happen constantly.

125
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,720
You certainly wouldn't want to have to think about breathing.

126
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
You certainly wouldn't want to have to think about your heart beating.

127
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
You certainly wouldn't want to have to think about digesting food.

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
You certainly wouldn't want to have to think about a lot of things that take place beneath

129
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
the surface.

130
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,560
So all of those things are regulated by this thing called the autonomic nervous system.

131
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,560
We further divide this autonomic nervous system into two branches.

132
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,720
One is called the sympathetic system and the other is called the parasympathetic system.

133
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,000
The parasympathetic system, the way we would always learn to remember this in medical school

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,400
was this was the rest and digest system.

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
So this is the down regulating system.

136
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,520
It conserves energy.

137
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,240
It aids in digestion.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,480
It slows heart rate.

139
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Our favorite little fact was it was responsible for erections but not ejaculation.

140
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,080
Ejaculation somehow came from the sympathetic system.

141
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,000
So the sympathetic system of course is the fight or flight system.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,760
So it's making energy more available.

143
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
It's dilating the pupils, right?

144
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,760
It's getting you ready to see as much information as possible.

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,520
It's slowing digestion and peristalsis, meaning it's slowing down anything that's not essential

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,400
and it's increasing heart rate.

147
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
Let's just think about what this looks like.

148
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,600
From a practical standpoint, if you're laying in bed and you hear a loud bang in your house,

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,360
you have no idea if it's an intruder or if a picture fell off the wall but you don't

150
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,880
even have to worry about it.

151
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Your brain isn't going to even force you to make that decision.

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,960
It's going to make the decision for you which is this is a threat.

153
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,340
And so your heart rate is going to shoot up.

154
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,140
Your pupils will dilate.

155
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,380
Any amount of digestive energy going on right now will cease and your liver is going to

156
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,900
start cranking out glucose and making you available for a fight or flight.

157
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,540
Okay, so what does this do to HRV?

158
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,460
It turns out when the sympathetic system is revved up, HRV goes down.

159
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,820
And when the parasympathetic system is in control, HRV goes up.

160
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,860
And I think it's easy to think about this, right?

161
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,500
As the heart rate speeds up, which is what's happening under sympathetic tone, there's

162
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,740
less variability between the beats.

163
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,420
When the heart rate slows down, when the body is relaxing, there's more variability between

164
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
beats.

165
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
I don't know if that's intuitive or not.

166
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,820
I was thinking about that.

167
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,820
If you have over the course of a minute and your beats per minute is say you're, I don't

168
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,900
know, Lance Armstrong when he's at the height of his powers.

169
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
I don't even know what that is.

170
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,740
Yeah, probably 30 beats per minute, yeah.

171
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,140
30 and then you've got somebody else who has 100 beats per minute, just the RR intervals,

172
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
whatever you call it.

173
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,620
There's just less time between them.

174
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,700
Intuitively, I would think there would be less room for variation between each beat.

175
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,700
That makes sense.

176
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Yeah.

177
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,140
I mean, I don't know how strong the correlation is between resting heart rate and HRV.

178
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,300
It's almost undoubtedly positive, but I don't know what the R squared is on that.

179
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,060
Is that a fair explanation, Bob?

180
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,180
Does that make sense on why we would care about the HRV?

181
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
Yes, I think so.

182
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,060
There's a knock on to that.

183
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,860
When you get your HRV output, if it's high or low, what is that telling us or how does

184
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
that inform us?

185
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,140
What do we do with that information?

186
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,980
Thank you for listening to today's sneak peek AMA episode of The Drive.

192
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,740
include the following.

193
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,940
Ridiculously comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, and

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,140
topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive.

198
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,100
This is particularly important for those of you who haven't heard all of the back episodes,

199
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,020
