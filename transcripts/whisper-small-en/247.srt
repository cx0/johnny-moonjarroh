00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:14,320
All right, Ethan, thanks so much for making time to sit down again. This is round two,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,200
although I kind of don't remember when round one was. I think it was 2019, but it might

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,560
have been 2018, right?

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,400
I think it was 18, which is just a function of the fact that neither of us can remember

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,320
how long ago it was.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,520
Yeah. Well, that time we spoke in person and we sat in your office at UCSF, but you're

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
sitting in a new office today and we're not in person, but more importantly, where are

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,360
you sitting today? And there's been a bit of a change in your life in the past year,

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
huh?

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,560
Yeah, so I did. It's been an evolutionary change over the past couple of years, but

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,080
I did have sort of a midlife crisis and decided that I didn't envision myself doing the same

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,320
thing I'd been doing for the prior 25 years for the next 25 years. If I should be lucky

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,800
enough to be around in 25 years. And I was given the opportunity to get involved with

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,720
the local group of investors who create biotech companies and they asked me to help them conceive

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,480
and eventually they started a new biotech company. So I closed my lab and have become

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,400
a volunteer clinical faculty at UCSF and see patients infrequently and spend most of my

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,280
time over here working to build this new company that I can at least tell you a little bit

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
about later on.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,400
Yeah. Well, I know we're going to talk about some of the science that the company is interested

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,840
in because it factors in directly to what we wanted to talk about today. So there will

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,240
be a chance to talk about that for sure. But in some ways, this podcast is really just

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,960
a compilation of our email exchanges over the past couple of years. And so I think at

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,160
some point we said we should just do another podcast because we keep emailing each other

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,320
about these things. And I suspect as is often the case, there's value in sharing what it

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,880
is that we talk about with others. So let's just start with a quick recap of what a calcium

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,800
score is. And then we'll follow that up by what a CT angiogram is because I think those

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,280
two need to be understood to understand much of what we'll talk about in the next God knows

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
how long.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah. So, you know, we talked about this the last time. I think I do remember that we spent

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,680
a lot of time talking about the distinction between calcium scanning and CT angiography.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,360
And as we discussed last time, I think, you know, you've used the analogy before the calcium

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,840
scan that sort of demonstrates a site of a prior injury. What we know is that quantitatively

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,400
the amount of calcium that is in the distribution of the coronary arteries is correlated significantly

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,640
with adverse outcomes. So the more calcium you have in your arteries, the worse you do,

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,840
the higher the risk of both cardiovascular and all cause problems. And the reason we

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,400
suspect is that that calcium represents a healed plaque and that so the amount of calcium

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,720
you have in your arteries is strongly related to the amount of plaque you have in your arteries.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,640
We know that the amount of plaque you have in your arteries is related to your risk of

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,080
having heart attacks and dying from heart attacks. So calcium scans are great ways to

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,040
kind of the way the analogy I use for my patients is that it's a sort of a satellite

42
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,480
image of your heart and gives you a sense of has there been damage there over your lifetime.

43
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,680
And then also gives you a nice adjunct indicator of your overall risk of dying from a heart

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,040
attack, which people like to know.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,960
And one of the nice things about a calcium score is it's very, very low in radiation.

46
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,000
I mean, it's really, you know, even CTAs are now low. We'll talk about that. But the calcium

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,440
scan is a really low radiation and a very inexpensive tool as well. There are places

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,840
that are doing these scans for a couple hundred dollars nowadays.

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,400
Not all places.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,880
No, that's the that speaks to the problem in US healthcare where you'll still find some places

51
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,240
charging 2000 while some will do the exact same scan for literally 200. But it needn't be an

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,560
expensive procedure. It's a low risk procedure. It doesn't require die. So it's effectively a

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,600
zero risk, low cost procedure that at least at the population level, as you say, has really great

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,720
insight, especially the first time it's done. Right.

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,760
Absolutely. And I think we talked about this the last time, but I'll just say it again for those

56
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,800
who weren't around back then that I did a full 180 on these. You know, when I first started

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,840
practicing as an independent cardiologist back in the early 2000s, I would get patients showing up

58
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,200
with these calcium scans. And I really sort of wanted to make them go away. I thought they were

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,040
annoying and I didn't know what to do with them. And it really has been a full 180. I do find value.

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,200
Obviously, there's epidemiologic value and understanding the risk of different populations.

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,200
But I do find that there is value in many contexts and even in individual patients. And we can talk

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,160
about which context I think are most valuable. It's certainly not everybody. I think, you know,

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,680
a calcium scan and a 25 year old is probably not worth anything. It's just not worth doing.

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,800
So, yeah, I think I've come around now to seeing the value of calcium scanning as a tool that I use

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,840
regularly. Yeah. And I know we did talk about this, but again, I've learned that one of the things

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,080
that makes podcasting difficult is it's very difficult for people to go back and listen to

67
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,960
them. There's just too much volume. So we should never apologize for repeating stuff that we talked

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,200
about more than four years ago. And the way that I kind of explain it to patients as well is that

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,960
if you have a two by two of sort of, you know, young versus old and zero versus non-zero as the

70
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,600
calcification, you know, there are two areas where the scan provides insight and there are two areas

71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,920
where the scan doesn't really provide insight. And so one of them, as you said, you know,

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,320
if a 40 year old shows up, has a calcium scan of zero, haven't really learned a lot. And if a

73
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,560
calcium scan of zero in a 40 year old is accompanied by other risk factors, I would not be dissuaded

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,200
from aggressively treating those risk factors. And similarly, when an 80 year old with lots of risk

75
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,520
factors shows up and has a zero calcium scan, we'll talk about the false negative rate there.

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,160
All things equal, you might be less inclined to push for aggressive measures. Would you agree

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:44,400
with that framework? I do. Yeah. I think there's a group of very committed, whatever you want to call

78
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,720
them, calcium scanographers who believe in the power of zero and believe that a calcium score of

79
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,000
zero is meaningful no matter where it comes. But I just think that defies logic, right? You shouldn't

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,800
have any, if you shouldn't have any calcium when you're 25, I'm not sure what you learned there.

81
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
There may be edge cases where, you know, one in several million people will have some calcium,

82
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,840
but I just think mostly the two cases you described are where I find the most value.

83
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,200
Well, this gets to something that I think I've learned a little bit more about both through

84
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,120
personal experience and also just kind of spending more time in the literature on this is that a

85
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,480
calcium scan is a relatively imprecise measure. So the thickness of the slices that are used

86
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:39,040
in that scan are significantly greater than the CT, the slices that are used in the CTN geography.

87
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,360
And I'll give you a stark example of how I learned this in my own life. And I think I shared at least

88
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,040
part of this story last time, although clearly not all of it, because I just learned more recently. So

89
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,800
in 2008 or 2009, when I was in my mid 30s, I had my first calcium scan. Now, at the time my

90
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,160
doctor thought this was a crazy idea. I was 35. I was exercising at least 24 hours a week. There's

91
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,800
no seemingly relevant reason for me to waste insurance money and do this, but I had a horrible

92
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,680
family history and it didn't seem to make sense. It wasn't like everyone in my family was smoking

93
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,560
or anything like that. So anyway, I had the calcium scan and it showed that I had a score of six.

94
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:29,840
So I had a single foci of calcium in the proximal LAD. And interestingly, despite being in my mid

95
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,160
30s with that calcium score of six, nobody really seemed to care either. That was viewed as well.

96
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,840
I mean, look, your lipids are really not that bad. My LDL cholesterol was about 120, 110 to 120

97
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,640
milligrams per deciliter. So nobody took that terribly seriously. Of course, it changed my

98
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:53,280
life and it changed my interest in this field forever. Fast forward to 2016. So call it six,

99
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,160
seven years later, I went and had a CT angiogram and a calcium scan and the calcium scan had a

100
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,480
score of zero. The CT angiogram, which now is at much finer resolution, indeed found a tiny speck

101
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:18,160
of calcium in the proximal LAD. No other finding. Bob Peters, who is the remarkable radiologist that

102
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,040
now sees a lot of our patients explain to me, not uncommon at all. Like that little spec that you

103
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,520
had six years ago can easily be missed. If you had five calcium scans, half of them would miss it

104
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,440
because it's just too small. But now in the CTA, we can see it. So we repeated the CTA. Now I'm

105
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,320
just kind of partially interested in progression, more of soft plaque. I had it repeated very

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,440
recently. So call it 2022. This time the calcium score came out as two and the CT angiogram was

107
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:56,720
identical to what it was in 2016, six years earlier. So you could certainly believe that if I had a CTA

108
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,840
in 2008 or 2009, it would have looked similar. And you would argue that for basically the same

109
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,600
lesion, the score was six and two and zero in the, sorry, six and zero and two in that order.

110
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,800
Have you seen this yourself in patients where you've had the luxury of both longitudinal

111
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,520
assessment and simultaneous CAC and CTA? You know, I can't off the top of my head, I can't

112
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,320
think of anybody, but I would ask you, and this may be a leading question, but what were the

113
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,280
percentiles of those? I mean, I would imagine that calcium score of six when you were 35

114
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,040
was 99th percentile. It was 75th to 90th percentile at that age. That's right. Yeah.

115
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,360
Yeah. But there's a big difference even between six and two and a huge difference between six and zero.

116
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Yes, exactly. Yeah. So I haven't seen it, but it doesn't surprise me.

117
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
Yeah, exactly. My guess is at a low enough calcium score, that's not uncommon. Of course,

118
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,880
that then got me into the literature and I realized that 15 percent of people who have a

119
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,560
zero calcium score have a finding on CTA that is either, as mine was, meaning a calcification

120
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,560
that was not picked up or a soft plaque. Furthermore, two percent or maybe it's one

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:21,280
and a half percent of those people who are deemed with a negative CAC have an unstable plaque on CTA.

122
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,680
It's not just the 15 percent that have something, but 10 percent of those people have something

123
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:36,800
that would be deemed relevant if we saw it on the CTA. Just back to our prior discussion on age and

124
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,000
utility of the scan, I would imagine, I don't know if they're familiar with the data, but I would

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,880
imagine that that 15 percent is largely represented in younger people or is that not the case?

126
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
I'd have to go back and look. It's a great question. I'd have to go back and look at the

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,440
study because it's been probably about six months since I looked at it. We'll find it and

128
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
we'll link to it in the show notes so that it's unambiguous and we'll include the table that

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
summarizes all this, which would hopefully include age. If not, it'll be in the fine print.

130
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,520
The other question I have for you, Peter, is over the course of the whatever it was,

131
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,600
15, 16, 17 years since your first calcium scan, what's your average APO-B been?

132
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeah, so that's the point. It's been lower and lower and lower. That's

133
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,800
about the time I met Tom Dayspring and began to learn. I didn't know what APO-B was at the time.

134
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,000
At first, I was just bombarding LDLC and then that turned into really now targeting APO-B.

135
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,320
My target APO-B is between 30 and 40 milligrams per deciliter. That's where I aim to be

136
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,440
day in and day out. Obviously, that requires pharmacological intervention. Now, again,

137
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,640
I never really had a particularly high APO-B, but in some ways that actually gave me more concern,

138
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:54,160
Ethan, because I didn't have the obvious risk factors. I'm normotensive. I don't smoke.

139
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:03,520
My APO-B at the time was probably about 85 to 90 milligrams per deciliter. Very few doctors would

140
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,880
get phosphorylated over that APO-B in someone in their late 30s or mid 30s at the time.

141
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,120
But again, I watched countless men in my family die, some of them as young as in their late 40s

142
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,960
from heart attacks. You start to realize, A, this is probably quite polygenic, and B,

143
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,000
there's something going on here that's not just standard plug and play risk factor stuff.

144
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,680
Which, of course, is your practice. You get these really tough cases where it's not just,

145
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,800
oh, the LDL is too high. Yeah, it is my practice. Unfortunately, at least for now,

146
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,880
the only set of tools that we have are aimed at, well, I should say independent of blood pressure,

147
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,200
which is a different conversation we'll have later. But the tools we have now are focused

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,760
really on lowering the APO-B through any number of different means. I think we all expect that

149
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,960
there's something else there. There was clearly something else there in you. I mean, again,

150
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,280
it's hard to make the argument that you were sort of a ticking time bomb with a widow maker that

151
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,240
you were going to drop dead or a heart attack. You had a tiny minuscule lesion. The question

152
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,120
would have been what happened to you over the next 15 or 20 years had you not taken the intervention

153
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,480
that you did pharmacologically. Yeah, as I approach 50 now, I do find it interesting to play the thought

154
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,760
experiment of had I been on a different path in life, had I never looked at that 15 years ago,

155
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,360
had I never cared, what would it look like today? What would that CTA look like today?

156
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,720
How significant would that lesion be? Would there be others? Yeah. And my belief is that,

157
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,160
and we should obviously talk about this. I think that the epidemiology, the clinical trial data,

158
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,160
and the Mendelian randomization, to my reading of this literature, and I don't think there's

159
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,040
anything I pay closer attention to truthfully, is that APO-B is a necessary but not sufficient

160
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,880
criteria for atherosclerosis. And as such, removing it removes atherosclerosis. And so,

161
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,160
my best guess as to why there has likely been no progression of this disease in 15 years,

162
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,320
at least to the level that it can be detected by a CT angiogram, is that we've basically taken away

163
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,320
the causal agent. Yeah, I think I mostly agree with you. I think it's absolutely necessary. I

164
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,000
think the data really do suggest that if it's bottomed out, absent some really bizarre, probably

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,400
monogenic things that we don't see very often, that you can't get atherosclerosis. I think that's

166
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,920
demonstrated not just in humans, but across many other animal species. The one place where I might

167
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,760
quibble a little bit is that I do think it's probably sufficient in some cases, right? That

168
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,240
interesting, that in FH, for example, it's probably sufficient. In other words, I don't think you have

169
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,760
to have something else to get out through in cases where that APO-B is sky high.

170
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:16,320
The sufficiency is complicated, right? I mean, I suppose there are people with FH that don't go

171
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:24,240
on to develop ASCVD. Yeah, a lot. I mean, that's sort of the argument that the sort of, and I don't

172
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,200
know if we're going to get into this or if I ever want to talk about this ever again, but this lean

173
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:35,840
mass hyper nonsense, that's the argument that they make, that having a high APO-B is not sufficient.

174
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,240
It's definitely true that there are some people with FH who don't go on to have ASCVD. It's

175
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,560
interesting. I mean, obviously suggests some other genetic modifier or something else

176
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:57,360
that protects them. Yeah. I mean, so I think that one could argue that APO-B is not sufficient,

177
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,360
but is necessary, which is how I feel, and still take it very seriously because let's look at

178
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,120
another obvious example, which is smoking, right? And again, is smoking even, I would argue smoking

179
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,920
is even weaker, right? Smoking is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of,

180
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,480
let's just pick lung cancer. Let's just pick the most smoking associated cancer, so small cell lung

181
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,440
cancer. Smoking is neither necessary nor sufficient, but there's nobody in their right mind that would

182
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,800
argue that not smoking, if in our analogy, that's the equivalent to reducing APO-B,

183
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:43,440
does not improve risk. Absolutely. Yeah. So I just think that to point to people with elevated APO-B

184
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,600
as an example of why it's safe has never made sense to me. And I'll tell you another reason it's

185
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,560
never made sense. I know I'm not going to get an argument out of you, but I'm hoping we can try to

186
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:02,160
formulate some argument here is there are other ways to treat APO-B besides diet.

187
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,760
And so I feel like if part of the argument for I need to have this APO-B high is because the diet

188
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,880
that's making it high is producing other benefits, that's sort of not necessary. One can consume a

189
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,880
diet that if it needs to be in a certain way and produce a high APO-B, you could still continue to

190
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,000
consume that diet and just pharmacologically address the APO-B problem. Yeah. It's the sort of

191
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:40,720
mind numbing in congruity of this whole discussion. And again, it makes my skin sort of want to fall

192
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:49,440
off. But yeah, no, I think you made a great point about smoking and frankly, any other risk factor

193
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,400
for any other disease. You know, replace smoking for coronary disease with smoking for cancer.

194
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,560
We all have lots of stories of people who smoke four packs of cigarettes a day.

195
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,880
Or even emphysema, right? You know, that where the toxicity is much more direct.

196
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,520
It's part of the nature of the heterogeneity of response, right? That this penetrance in this

197
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:19,680
case of an environmental factor is not 100%. I guess there are some that are, right? Cyanide

198
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,440
probably is. But most of the things that we encounter in our environment don't have that

199
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
level of penetrance in terms of causing risk. It's certainly not the ones that we encounter

200
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,880
frequently, right? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, cyanide is a great example. 100% penetrance, carbon

201
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,680
monoxide at a certain concentration, 100% penetrance. Yeah. Okay. So let's go back to our discussion

202
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:50,400
and now contrast the calcium scan with the CTA. And then especially we'll use this to now explain

203
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,720
these other variations of CTAs that have shown up where they're more like software additions to CTA.

204
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:09,040
Sure. I mean, look, in what I tell patients is that what you get from a CTA is clarity and more

205
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,920
information, which in most cases is really, really good. And that comes at a small cost

206
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,360
in terms of increased radiation. And I guess some potential risk of the contrast,

207
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,720
although it's relatively small. The biggest cost and the biggest reason that I don't use it

208
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,720
in all of my patients in whom I'm thinking about these kinds of things is that it's hard to get it

209
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,760
paid for. So it is actually, in this case, more expensive if you pay for it yourself out of pocket,

210
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,720
which almost all of the calcium scans that I order end up getting paid for out of pocket. Almost

211
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,000
none of them as of today, at least are reimbursed by insurance. But as you said,

212
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
That's calcium scans, you mean, and CTAs. They're both just out of pocket these days.

213
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,040
No, no, no. Calcium scans are almost exclusively out of pocket. I would say 90 plus percent of them

214
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,080
are paid for by patients themselves. But again, as you said earlier, it's a couple hundred bucks and

215
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,760
almost everybody can make that leap and sort of convince themselves that it's worth, you know,

216
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,560
whatever it is, 10 Starbucks. So, but for CT angiograms, the cost is much higher. You know,

217
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,520
and again, I don't know, and this is one of the problems with their healthcare system. I don't

218
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,640
want to get distracted in that, but it's transparent to me what the cost is to my patients unless they

219
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,080
go and do some digging. And what's really annoying is that it's often not clear to them what they're

220
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,640
going to pay for until after they already have it. And so the cost of a CT angiogram is much

221
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,680
higher. It depends on the insurance that you have. And even if you pay out of pocket, so even if it's

222
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,520
not covered, the negotiated rate is going to be different based on whatever carrier you have. So

223
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:56,640
I would say much fewer than 50% of my patients have coverage. And we can talk about what would

224
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,480
justify coverage for a CT angiogram. And I've sort of gotten, I think, a little bit more

225
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,720
sophisticated in trying to be able to get around some of what I think are these sort of absurd

226
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,160
blockers for coverage. But then obviously, depending on the patient spending anywhere

227
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:21,520
from let's just say 700 to two or $3,000 on a scan may be more or less of an issue. And in some

228
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,320
patients, it's enough of an issue that they don't get it. So I think that's just worth

229
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,200
pointing out that in a world in which they were covered universally, and we could have access to

230
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,160
the data, that, in my opinion, at least, it provides so much more information than a calcium scan that

231
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,600
I'd probably just go straight there. And especially because in a lot of these cases we're talking

232
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,680
about, like you and your 35 year old self, these are cases where we just don't have a lot of data.

233
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,000
And the calcium itself is just not going to add that much.

234
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,320
So yeah. Yeah, I agree. And we kind of have that discussion with our patients as well,

235
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,080
which is that look, the IV contrast is virtually a non-risk outside of a handful of settings,

236
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,680
which are clearly well understood and can be, you know, we know how to handle those pretty well.

237
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,640
The radiation these days is so low. It's really in the neighborhood of two milli-seavers for a

238
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,960
person our size. So, you know, that's 4% of your annual allotment of radiation. But you're right,

239
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,280
the cost, I mean, we sort of assume 2000 to 2500 is pretty standard for that test.

240
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,680
When it's paid for out of pocket, it is, I would say that's probably average, but there are some,

241
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,960
for whatever reason, and I don't understand insurance in this country at all, but for

242
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,360
whatever reason, some insurance carriers are able to negotiate a lower rate for their members. And

243
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,760
so I've seen some people get, and it's very different institution to institution, right? So

244
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,920
you could go to UCSF and it would be $700, you might go to Stanford, it would be 1500 or the

245
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,200
other way around. And so I do advise people when it comes to these decisions, if the money is an

246
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,120
issue, which it is for almost everybody, because it's, you know, significant amount of money to

247
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,040
shop around a little bit. And then, you know, the question of sort of, all right, well, what do I

248
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,120
get for my money? And we know that right there are different scanners in different places, and those

249
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,280
different scanners provide different information in terms of resolution, but they also provide

250
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,720
differences in terms of how much radiation exposure. So that's another variable that we

251
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,560
kind of have begun to address a little bit. And those are the two things we always sort of say,

252
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,480
I mean, we have places we send people that we, because we know the answers to those questions,

253
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,120
but if it's not convenient for them, we're sort of saying, you've got to ask what the radiation

254
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,760
burden is. And it's actually, it can be a 10X difference. I've seen scanners out there that are

255
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,120
at 20 milli-seaverts. So now you're up to 40% of your annual allotment of radiation for one

256
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,360
screening scan, which, you know, personally, I think is too much. I just don't think it's

257
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,080
worth it, even if you're saving a bit of money. I agree. I agree. And it's just another layer of

258
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,280
complexity and sort of how you think about applying these different tests and getting

259
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,600
this information. It's just really important to make sure not to forget about it.

260
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,040
So every time I've had these CTA scans, you know, we get these beautiful images

261
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,320
and they're 3D reconstructed and then they're 2D sectioned. And, you know, we're looking at the

262
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,440
lumen, right? The tube of the artery. In both cases, that little speck of calcium shows up in the wall

263
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,120
of the artery. And then we're also looking for sort of soft plaque as well. And fortunately,

264
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,120
there hasn't been any, but that's, you know, soft plaque doesn't show up anywhere in the calcium

265
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,640
score. So you can have a significant burden of cardiovascular disease without any calcium. I

266
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,480
think that's the thing that maybe gets missed a lot. And that shows up in that 15% of people

267
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,920
who have a zero calcium score. A lot of them still have a significant burden of disease.

268
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,560
As you mentioned earlier, I mean, it could be that that calcification

269
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,600
where it's actually placed is not problematic. It's just that it's a harbinger of whatever it

270
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,480
took to get there. Do you look at patients with a high burden of soft plaque and no calcification

271
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:19,040
is even higher risk? I don't really, just because I don't think I buy that their data suggests that

272
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:25,120
I think a high burden of plaque period is a problem. Do I believe that a high burden of

273
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,280
calcified plaque might be less risky because it's more stable, I guess in theory, but it's super,

274
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,400
it's super, I get really nervous about sort of trying to impute plausibility and things like that

275
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,880
to drive clinical decision making. I think the reality is a lot of plaque is bad. I mean,

276
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,880
we know that people who have a calcium score of 4,000, which by definition means they've got a

277
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,000
shitload of calcium, that that's a high risk. And even if they don't have any soft plaque,

278
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,280
the risk is still high. So I don't pay too much attention. It's part of the reason why I actually,

279
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,080
if again, if everything else is equal, I prefer the information I get out of a CTA. Of course,

280
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,040
I'm greedy. I want more. And I feel like we just get so much more information and don't have to

281
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,400
make that distinction between soft and hard plaque. And frankly, I'm not sure we're at a point in

282
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,960
this field yet where we can make a compelling argument about plaque characteristics. It's been

283
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,920
a field that I think has evolved now since the early days, right? Since the 70s, probably when

284
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the pathologists were doing autopsies on people who died of sudden cardiac death. And

285
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,520
we've been trying to understand the vulnerable plaque and different plaque characteristics and

286
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,280
what confers risk of rupture and ultimately of an event. I just don't think, at least in my

287
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,520
estimation, and I'm certainly no expert, it's not, we're not there yet. So I don't use it

288
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,520
anything other than as a sort of how much plaque is there tool.

289
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,160
Yeah, it's really interesting that we don't yet have a better tool to explain what vulnerability

290
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,440
means or to predict what vulnerability is, right? I mean, I think, do you think that in the research

291
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,000
setting, things like intravenous ultrasound or intravascular ultrasound, where they can actually

292
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,360
look and measure the thickness of the cap on the arthroma, do you think that in a theoretical sense,

293
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,560
those things are any better, even if they're impractical from a clinical perspective?

294
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,760
I guess, but ultimately, as a lot of things in biology, this is just so stochastic that it,

295
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,120
I think we might convince ourselves that it means something that it doesn't. So I think we've

296
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,000
learned a lot that, again, from the early days of even understanding that ruptured plaque leads to

297
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,920
a thrombosis over the surface of the ruptured plaque, and that's what causes a heart attack.

298
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,840
That was a debate until 1979, or even maybe even a few years after that. It really wasn't settled

299
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,640
until ISIS II was published in the late 1980s that showed that if you gave striptokinus or aspen,

300
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:08,240
you could reduce the risk. I think we've learned early on that it wasn't necessarily that 75 or 80%

301
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,960
or even 90% plaque that led to the big one, that oftentimes the plaques that ruptured and led to

302
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,200
sudden cardiac death were the smaller plaques, the 30% plaques, which kind of makes sense in the

303
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,320
context of how we think about, we'll all hear these stories and I'm sure you get patients coming to you

304
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,160
after somebody prominent dies. And I'll mention the name just because I think this is an example.

305
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't know Cheryl, but when Cheryl Samper's husband died on a treadmill a few years ago,

306
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,560
I mean, I had probably 25 people call me that week to want to come in and get a risk assessment.

307
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,520
That happens a lot. I don't know anything about his case and I don't know anything about the

308
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,240
pathology, but my guess is in younger people who die of heart attack suddenly that oftentimes it's

309
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,000
a sort of relatively mild plaque that wouldn't trigger any discussion of revascularization

310
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,640
and wouldn't make anybody nervous at all that those are the plaques that end up causing

311
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,440
problems. And we can begin to weave together reasons why that might be, right? That maybe in

312
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,920
a person who's got more plaque burden, that there's more chance for ischemic preconditioning

313
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:21,360
and therefore the chance of an arrhythmic sort of malignant arrhythmic response to the ischemia

314
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,200
is lessened because of that. But I think my point is I don't think we have an understanding of,

315
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,520
to me, at least that satisfactorily would allow me to change the way I practice clinically based

316
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,640
on the characteristics of the plaque, even the volume of the plaque. And so for that reason,

317
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,840
I treat people with plaques, any plaque, 30% plaque, pretty much the same way that I treat people

318
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,920
with extensive plaque and I treat them maximally with sort of the best optimal medical therapy

319
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:01,120
I can offer. Yeah. So boy, we feel so similarly about this, Ethan, that we're going to have a

320
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,920
hard time coming up with some something to really clash about here because this is basically the

321
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:16,000
same discussion we have with our patients, which is I'm treating the causative risks, not the

322
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,720
end stage problems. If the goal is I need to wait until you have a 30% stenosis or a calcium

323
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,960
score of 200 to start acting, that's insane. It goes back to the smoking analogy. Right.

324
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,040
I want to tell someone that I want to tell somebody the second they pick up a cigarette

325
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:41,520
to put it down, not until I see that the pulmonary function tests are problematic or they've been

326
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:48,560
smoking for 20 years and their risk is significant. Yeah. And this is the sort of eye bleeding

327
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,840
experience that I have with insurance companies talking about adding PCSK9 inhibitors to what,

328
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,880
you know, sort of statins and whatever else they're on. And often they'll say,

329
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,040
well, they need to have an event first. And I'm thinking to myself, so backwards.

330
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,600
You're going to ask me to let my patient have a heart attack so that I can prescribe the drug

331
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,520
that's going to prevent them from having a heart attack. I mean, it's really incredible. And

332
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,000
hopefully we won't practice that way down the line. The problem of course is that, and I don't

333
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,240
want to get distracted, but all of these trials are so incredibly expensive to do that the

334
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,160
information that we're going to get from sort of the most rigorous randomized clinical trials is

335
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,960
going to be limited just because we're not going to be able to, you know, all the questions that I

336
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,640
want to ask and answer, I'm sure that all the ones you want to ask and answer are just not going to

337
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,200
be feasible to do because they're going to be overwhelmingly expensive. So we have to find a

338
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,840
way to be able to make decisions to treat patients independent of this gold standard level evidence.

339
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,440
And hopefully the insurance companies come around. Yeah. I've kind of accepted the fact,

340
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,360
Ethan, we're never going to have the gold standard evidence that we need in the most important

341
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,000
demographic, which is the demographic for whom we have the most runway to effect change. So in other

342
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:07,360
words, there will never be the study done in 40 year olds that says, what is the 30 year risk of

343
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,640
ASCVD in a cohort of 40 year olds, one group whose APO B is reduced to 30 because we've used a PCSK9

344
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,600
inhibitor plus or minus whatever other agent we need versus the group that's managed with

345
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,440
standard of care or some placebo or something else. And I mean, again, I feel more convinced of the

346
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,760
outcome of that theoretical trial than I do virtually any other theoretical trial I could

347
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,960
ever muster up in my brain. And yet it'll never be done. And therefore, there will never be an

348
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,320
evidence based case for true prevention of ASCVD. I say something very bold in my upcoming book,

349
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,160
which is that ASCVD should basically be an orphan disease. There's actually no reason it needs to be

350
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,960
the leading cause of death. It really doesn't even need to be in the top 10. It's that preventable if

351
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,080
you start early enough and if you're maximally aggressive. And really at that point, I think it

352
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,800
just becomes a question of working through the challenges of tolerating side effects in patients

353
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,400
who are sensitive. And I think there are going to be patients who are going to be challenging,

354
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,760
but with a long enough runway, this disease is sort of irrelevant. Let's talk a little bit about

355
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:23,440
these flavors of CTAs that keep showing up. So I guess we'll start with the CTA FFR,

356
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,800
because we did speak about it briefly. We don't have to go back into all of the detail of, and I'm

357
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,760
blanking on the name of the trial. There were two trials that looked at FFR in angiography.

358
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
Fame and fame too, I think.

359
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,680
That's right. Yeah, fame and fame too. I guess give the short version of what those trials

360
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,760
looked at, what the technology was, and then we can talk about the CT side of it.

361
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,920
Well, I mean the original FFR that was performed, that is still now performed in a cath lab is

362
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,400
basically a way to detect a pressure gradient across this diagnosis. So the simplest thing I

363
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,800
use to explain to patients is if you take a garden hose and squeeze it, that there's a gradient of

364
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,680
pressure. That there's going to be pressure proximal with your fingers squeezing the garden hose,

365
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,160
and the pressure on the other end is going to be lower. And that what they'd effectively do is

366
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:20,800
to put a wire with a pressure sensor on one end of the wire on the other end of the blockage,

367
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,640
and they put one on the near end of the blockage, and they can measure the delta. And that using a

368
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,400
mathematical formula that I've... You'll know the name of it. I'm blanking on it. You can impute

369
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,040
the diameter of the artery relative to the diameter of the unobstructed artery,

370
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,720
or the garden hose in this case. And so that gives you a way to get at the severity of the

371
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:58,160
blockage. And I guess what this stems from is a 40 year odyssey to try to take a very qualitative

372
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,960
measure, which happens in a catheterization laboratory, which is to measure the percent

373
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,960
stenosis, which is done if you've ever seen it. It's done very much by Gestalt. And the people who

374
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,200
are good at it are pretty good at it. But if you watch it, you understand that the difference

375
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:24,240
between 30 and 50 is probably not that meaningful. When there are severe blockages or stenosis, you

376
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:33,120
can all agree that it's really high grade. So I think of things in that high grade, modest and low.

377
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,760
So this has been one of a number of tools that have been developed to try to supplement the

378
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,800
information you get from that very qualitative assessment of visually how bad does that lesion

379
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,200
look. And many of these things have happened over the years. Ivis, you mentioned earlier,

380
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,280
is one of them. There have been a quantitative coronary angiography where they actually try and

381
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:03,520
take a cursor and electronically draw around the diameter of the vessel. Mike Gibson, back in the

382
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,920
old days, used to do this blush thing. I can't remember what it was called, but basically it would

383
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,760
count the number of frames it takes for the contrast dye to leave the myocardium. And that was

384
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,320
another indication of how severe the lesions were. FFR evolved as a sort of

385
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:32,400
hemodynamic way to impute the severity of this stenosis. And so I think FAME was the first of

386
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,640
these studies. And it showed that if you had a significant pressure drop, if the ratio of the

387
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:48,640
pressure and the sort of upstream sensor was much higher than the downstream sensor, that

388
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,120
conveyed that there was a bad lesion and that it conveyed worse outcomes in people

389
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,200
who didn't get stented. I can't remember the design of those. But basically-

390
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah. I think the idea was basically, look, there's no ambiguity in two subsets of people

391
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,720
who should be stented. So somebody who's actively having an MI, they show up in the

392
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,920
ED with chest pain, enzymes are leaking. I mean, we just go to the cath lab. There's no need to

393
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:25,200
putz around. Or I mean, what's the algorithm on clot dissolve versus stent in the active MI in the

394
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,200
ER? Oh, in the modern era, if there's a cath lab within whatever it is, I think, I don't know what

395
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,960
the exact number is in the latest guidelines, but it might be like 90 miles. It's really the

396
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,080
amount of time you have to calculate the amount of time it takes to get transported to a place

397
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,440
where there's a cath lab that does stenting, primary PCI. So primary PCI is the standard of care.

398
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,560
I think thrombolytics are used sparingly in this country, and only in remote places where there's

399
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,560
no access. Where they can't get to the cath lab. Okay. So in an ST elevation in my, it's primary

400
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,600
PCI is the standard of care, class one, the whole deal. And as quickly as you can get there.

401
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,080
And then the other indication in the non-MI setting is symptomatic, right? If you have a person who

402
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,400
for example, if someone has a stress test and on the stress test, you see ST changes,

403
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,600
is that an indication for a PCI as well? So we'll back up. So STEM, ST elevation MI is where there's

404
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,360
a complete and the physiology or pathophysiology is a complete obstruction of blood flow.

405
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,480
ST segments go up, you go in, there's no blood beyond the blockage. That's clear. Everyone

406
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,600
understands what we're now calling ACS, which we used to call unstable hands and our non-ST elevation

407
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:45,200
MI, which is not is same pathophysiology, right? Ruptured plaque, a thrombus sitting on the plaque,

408
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,000
but it doesn't completely obstruct blood flow. I think there's general consensus even among

409
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,040
some of the more conservative groups out there that those people benefit from going to the

410
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:03,760
cath lab early and having a stent to fix that blockage. I would say it's generally accepted

411
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
on the order of, I had to guess of 85 or 90% of people would practice that way. And what I mean

412
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,640
early, I mean within the first 24 hours. So it's not a sort of code level emergency where you,

413
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,920
you know, now most hospitals have these STEMI teams where they'll automatically, the emergency

414
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
department will page the pager and everybody comes in from the technicians in the cath lab

415
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
to the interventional cardiologists to the fellows and everybody else. They all just assemble there

416
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,800
to get there as quickly as possible. That doesn't happen. There's no STEMI activation for a non-STEMI

417
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,600
or a ACS event, but I think there's still general consensus that disease is treated best with early

418
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,080
intervention. And the only distinction between those people, Ethan, the only distinction is the

419
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,960
ST change on the EKG when they present. That's right. Yeah. I mean, that's the, that is the

420
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,840
distinction. And of course that is sensitive, but not a hundred percent sensitive. There are certain

421
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,720
lesions that are obscure, right? Where you would, you know, for example, a posterior MI,

422
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:05,040
you'd have to do posterior leads to be able to see that. So, but mostly it's STEMI is a, is a

423
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:14,960
emergency go straight to the cath lab, don't pass go. Non-STEMI or ACS is urgent. And generally

424
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,440
people end up in the cath lab and it wouldn't be a bad thing to have them go there, you know,

425
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,320
relatively quickly, depending on how unstable they are. Obviously, if anybody has unstable symptoms,

426
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,840
no matter what they have, in other words, if their blood pressure was labile or if they had heart

427
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,200
failure or ongoing chest pain that was refractory to medical management, then that would also become

428
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,000
a sort of don't pass go go straight to the cath lab. So I would say those things generally end up

429
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,240
getting stented. The, the, and this is a, this is my opinion, my read of the literature, but over the

430
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:53,200
past 15 years, what has changed is people with plaque, but without symptoms generally don't get

431
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,680
stented. Even the most aggressive interventional cardiologists, I won't mention names, would

432
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,680
probably agree that people who have a lot of plaque, maybe with the exception of proximal idea

433
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,280
of left mane, there might be still some people who would think, gosh, even without symptoms, I'm

434
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,560
going to put, I'm going to put a stent in this person. But generally people with, with plaque,

435
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,840
no matter how bad the plaque looks angiographically, those people are treated medically if they don't

436
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,360
have symptoms. Where things have gotten interesting is in these cases for symptoms, right? Because

437
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,560
I think most of us, when you say symptoms, Ethan, you mean symptoms in day to day life,

438
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,480
or do you mean under stress and provocation? Yeah. So no. So rest symptoms is unstable

439
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,480
symptoms and that falls into that first category. And those people would be, should be hospitalized

440
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,520
and they would go in that first 24 hour window. So any symptoms at rest without doing anything,

441
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,640
we can debate about what, what is like, what happens if you have an argument with your wife

442
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,280
and you get chest pain, is that unstable or stable? You know, but mostly it's the sort of

443
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,480
non-classic exertional angina where you're walking up a hill and you get chest pressure,

444
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,000
you get chest tightness or rarely pain. You stop, it gets better. You take a nitrocloser and it gets

445
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,880
better. Classic stable angina. So people have plaque, but do not have stable or unstable

446
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:22,000
symptoms at all. In general, these days are treated medically with some exceptions. It's the people

447
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,440
who have this classic stable angina, stable symptoms. So they go out and walk up a hill and

448
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,280
they get chest tightness, you know, feels like somebody's tightening a belt around their chest.

449
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,720
They stop, it gets better. It's those people who I think are kind of the most interesting today

450
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,120
in the contemporary practice setting. And those are the people I think that require the most

451
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,680
thought. And I think, you know, we, we hadn't put it on our list of things to discuss. I don't

452
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,560
remember if we discussed, you know, these trials the last time around, but, but obviously courage

453
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,280
was the trial that sort of taught us that it's okay to have a lot of plaque and not necessarily

454
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,600
intervene on it. There have now been several other trials to get at that question of is,

455
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,960
is, and this is part of the reason why fame is to me, like not that interesting,

456
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,200
because we've kind of already answered the question in all comers that stenting people

457
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,720
without symptoms, even if they have some significant lesions doesn't offer a benefit

458
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,800
over optimal medical therapy. There's, there's now, I think, some discussion around even patients

459
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,320
with symptoms, whether they, the range of opinion I think goes from anybody with symptoms should be

460
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:35,600
stented or re-vascularized, you know, in edge cases with bypass. Some people think, you know,

461
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,200
medical therapy in all cases. And then I think there's sort of this nuanced in between people

462
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,680
who think give a trial of medical therapy and see if you can get the symptoms better. It's not an

463
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,120
automatic take to the cath lab, but try to optimize medical therapy. And if you can make

464
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,640
the symptoms go away, then there's no need to go and stent that artery. And that's probably where

465
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,840
I land right now is I don't, I still use interventional cardiology. I certainly don't

466
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,400
use it as much as I did in the past, but I do use it for people who do have what I would consider to

467
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,080
be refractory symptoms. And then obviously for the unstable sort of emergency acute settings,

468
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,920
that's a different story. And if you had a patient with a really high calcium burden,

469
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:23,040
so they're north of a thousand, and they never experienced symptoms, which, and they're young,

470
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,160
they're, you know, in their fifties or something like that. Would you put them on a treadmill and

471
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,960
push them as hard as you could possibly go and assume that like, Hey, they're not necessarily

472
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,120
exercising that hard every day. I want to really see if they have any ST changes or

473
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,200
wall motion abnormality when I make them, you know, go to 15 minutes.

474
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,920
I don't, but because, because like I said, I sort of land in that camp of,

475
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,760
even if you had symptoms, I'd still medically managed them medically. Yeah, probably I would

476
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,440
still try to optimize medicines. Now, if somebody came in and was on great medicines and was still

477
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,440
having symptoms, then obviously it's a different story. But yeah, I don't routinely do anything to

478
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,640
people who have high calcium. In fact, if you have a high calcium score, whatever it is, a thousand,

479
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,600
it to me, it triggers a response. And it's the same. I don't think you need a CTA in that case.

480
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,240
And in fact, the CTA might not be very useful because there may be so much calcium that kind

481
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:27,120
of obscures the ability to be able to see into and beneath the vessel. So, and it's to me,

482
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,560
I don't automatically do stress testing in somebody like that. I often will see patients who've

483
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,920
been completely freaked out by the result and that, and they'll have had a big workup,

484
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,640
including potentially stress testing and, and a CTA engineering, but, but I don't do that. And,

485
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,880
and I likewise don't do any routine stress testing anymore as a way to follow coronary disease.

486
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,800
That was something we used to do in the old days when somebody had a lesion, you knew they had a

487
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,120
lesion, you'd kind of exercise them over once a year or something to see how they progress that.

488
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:07,840
I don't do that anymore either. Okay. So in light of that fame, if I recall,

489
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:14,160
basically said, or sought to answer the question, if you took a bunch of asymptomatic people

490
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,400
and you did this FFR on them, you measured the fractional flow reserve.

491
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,160
If you took the people who had a pressure drop of, I think it was either 30% or more,

492
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,040
I think it was a 0.7 P2 to P1. Yeah, something like that. It was either a 20 or 30% drop.

493
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:42,080
If those people automatically got stented and the others did not, and these are both asymptomatic,

494
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,240
would we see better outcomes in the more aggressive stenting strategy? Isn't that

495
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,160
effectively what the trial was? That was the design and that was the result. And,

496
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,200
and so therefore that became standard of care in a cath lab. In most cath labs that,

497
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,600
in fact, we were doing FFR and a lot of patients were, yeah, initially FFR was there for these

498
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,040
end cases where you weren't sure is this significant or not? Should we stent it? Should

499
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,760
we not stent it? I think it went through a period. I think it's now come back, but I think it went

500
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,040
through a period where it was being used a lot based on fame with the sort of assumption that

501
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,160
you're impacting people's outcome, hard outcomes based on your decision-making and that there were

502
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,040
certain groups of people who benefited tremendously from getting stented. And our job was just to

503
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,200
identify who they were. On the surface, that's not an absurdity, right? That's definitely a

504
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,720
possibility. But I think, you know, after however many years now of understanding the data,

505
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,720
I think the consensus is it's just not necessary. I think really mostly it comes from the sort of

506
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,680
line of evidence that we've had through, you know, courage, ischemia, orbiter, all these different

507
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,640
trials showing really that the take-home is that optimal medical therapy, even in a mildly

508
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:58,720
symptomatic person patient is quite effective. So all of this basically is prelude to

509
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:07,200
a CT based version of this study, which of course can't do the intervention,

510
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,840
but it can identify people who are getting CTAs, which are far more than the people who are getting

511
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:21,600
traditional angiography to say, hey, maybe you do need an intervention. So again, in theory,

512
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,520
the idea here is, well, you've got a CTA, I see a stenosis there, it's a 50% stenosis.

513
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,640
Is it significant or not? I can't tell. I don't have a pressure transducer in there that I can

514
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,480
measure, but I can run this algorithm on it and the algorithm will tell me what the pressure drop

515
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:46,160
is. So of course, question one is how successful is that algorithm? I don't know myself. I assume

516
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,160
that there was a head-to-head that was done where you had a whole bunch of people that actually had

517
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,000
cath that actually had pressure transduction and then concurrently had CTA, and then they could

518
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,080
actually see how predictive they were. I have to believe that was done right.

519
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, there was a trial. I don't remember the details of it. I guess the questions are in my

520
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,640
mind, so does the physics, and I don't understand the physics, but does it make sense? Can you

521
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,000
actually really make this calculation in a meaningful and reproducible way in these people?

522
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,880
I imagine back in the day when the method was being validated, that there were some comparisons,

523
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,280
the FDA required some comparison to be able to say that this is just as they probably required

524
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:30,800
something to clear the FFR catheters themselves. They probably required something. It probably

525
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,880
was close enough. I don't have any knowledge that the thing is a random number generator.

526
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,040
To me, that's a distraction. I think there are plenty of people who go down that path. To me,

527
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:51,040
the question remains what are we doing? And really, in the way I practice, do we need to identify

528
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,200
asymptomatic people who are at higher risk? Is there a group of these people who

529
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,800
are special and might show something that no other group of patients has ever shown in the

530
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,200
history of interventional cardiology, which is a benefit from stenting? I know that my

531
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,600
interventional cardiology colleagues are going to hate what I just said,

532
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:16,080
but we've been doing this for a long time now. We've been looking for any group of people who

533
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,560
would benefit from outside of the Akitamai setting, which we've talked about, any group of people who

534
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,440
would benefit from a stent being placed in their artery. And we've had a hard time doing that.

535
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,520
It's not for lack of track. It's been, I mean, again, courage, which sort of was the beginning

536
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,880
of the end of this in some way, since that was a trial that was conceived of and executed by a

537
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,520
group of interventional cardiologists who wanted to demonstrate the superiority of stenting

538
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:46,960
over medical therapy. It was designed that way. And all the bias was weighted towards getting

539
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,280
that outcome. It did not get that outcome. And frankly, there have been however many dozens of

540
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,560
studies since then. And at least from my point of view, there's nothing that screams at me that,

541
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:07,840
hey, look, our job as preventive cardiologists or thoughtful internists should be to go looking for

542
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,200
people who might benefit from a stent in the absence of symptoms. And that's where I'm left

543
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:19,920
today is that I don't see any evidence yet that there's something magical about some group of

544
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,000
people where they derive that much more benefit from a stent beyond truly optimal medical therapy.

545
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,200
And I think, as you said earlier, if everybody got truly optimal medical therapy, like if we

546
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,600
didn't have barriers to using all these tools in everybody, I think this disease would largely

547
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,720
be controlled. Now, I do believe there's something else going on that's residual.

548
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:50,000
And you're an example, I think potentially. But yes, I think the quality of the medical

549
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,760
therapy we have today is so good that it's going to be really hard to demonstrate the value of

550
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:04,960
stenting people. That assumes that stenting doesn't do something harmful. And again, I think that's a

551
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:14,000
open question. Why, if you have a very high grade lesion, even before there was great PCS

552
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,160
canine inhibitors, they were just ZOCOR or something, why wouldn't opening that artery lead to improved

553
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,920
outcomes outside of the Akita mice setting? That's a question that always plagued me,

554
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,560
even as a cardiology fellow, I was like, well, this doesn't make any sense. It should. You're

555
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,520
opening up an artery that's severely blocked and restoring blood flow back to the heart.

556
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,440
And there are lots of explanations for why that might be. I don't think we have a good one,

557
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,520
but you could imagine that in going in there and blowing up a balloon inside that artery and

558
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,880
deploying a stent that you're elaborating the contents of that plaque downstream. And much

559
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,480
like what happens when you break up a beaver dam in a stream, it's just going downstream and causing

560
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,840
its own set of problems. That's just me speculating and making it up. But to me,

561
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:07,760
it's an interesting question. Why it wouldn't be. Has the study been done, for example,

562
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,720
where they take a group of individuals who were asymptomatic at the time of being stented,

563
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,520
or they weren't being stented in an acute STEMI, who then go on to have subsequent events, what

564
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:27,600
the location is of the plaque. In other words, when a person gets stented in the mid-LAD,

565
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:35,120
and they go and have another event, is that other event more, can we identify a pattern?

566
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:42,000
So for example, is it distal in the LAD? Is it in a part of the heart where you could say,

567
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,880
maybe there was some mechanical change that took place as a result of that stent,

568
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,600
or maybe it was, hey, you know what? The reason it doesn't work is you're playing whack-a-mole,

569
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:00,560
and this person had lots of disease. You just happened to pick the one that had the most

570
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:07,200
stenosis, although stenosis by itself is actually a really crappy predictor of future events. So

571
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:15,200
you weren't more likely to do anything here. Maybe if you stented the entire vasculature,

572
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,640
you would have, but of course you can't do that. So it really comes down to how lousy is

573
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,640
plain up stenosis as a predictor of subsequent events.

574
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,920
Well, I think it's a good predictor that as we discussed earlier, these plaques that end up

575
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,480
leading to bad things often are not the plaques that would be get stented anyway. So I think

576
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,600
there's that. And that's my point, right? Because another explanation, which I think you had a good

577
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:47,440
one is if you have a 90% stenosis and you haven't experienced symptoms as a result of that yet,

578
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,360
that's probably telling that if you throw a clot there, you're going to survive it.

579
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,720
That's right. Because there's collateralization and we know that, right? From seeing these,

580
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,080
you know, you can see that. And that's probably the mechanism, right? That this ischemic

581
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,760
preconditioning leads to this growth of collaterals. And basically it's like,

582
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,280
if there's an accident on the freeway, it's like I tell my patients that you get off on the side

583
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,800
streets and you wind your way through, it takes a lot longer. And it's not great when there's like

584
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,360
a lot of traffic, but if there's no traffic and it's relatively light flow, you do fine.

585
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,080
Right. But that 30% lesion hasn't been tested yet. No, it hasn't.

586
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,920
So you don't really know how it's going to respond.

587
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,160
Because you would never send a 30% lesion. Yeah. So there's that. And then the other thing I think

588
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,840
is that if you look at, and now with the advent of sort of high sensitivity troponins and other

589
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:41,680
more sensitive measures, if you look at say troponin or CK elevations after a long intervention,

590
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,400
they most certainly go up, not in all cases, but they do go up. And so the question is,

591
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,080
are you doing, are you basically creating a little MI in the process of putting the stint in? And

592
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:58,160
does that then cause downstream risk in the form of arrhythmias or other issues, you know, later on

593
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,400
in life? That to me is sort of an interesting thing to think about it. Obviously there's no

594
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,360
great data at this point, but I think there are data, at least observational data, looking at the

595
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,760
area under the curve of the troponin elevations post PCI as a predictor of outcomes. I think

596
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,360
obviously the more troponin you have, the worse you do, as you'd expect.

597
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,920
Okay. So there was this study that I don't think is published yet, but I think you and I saw it in

598
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,560
email to each other about, was it, was, is it the precise trial that we saw the abstract for?

599
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:39,120
Remind me. This is the one that did the, I think this is the one that did the FFR

600
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,760
and it found no difference in all cause mortality, no difference in mace,

601
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:53,280
but a reduction in the need for catheterization. Right. Yeah. So this has now become the sort of

602
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:00,960
value add of doing these non-invasive adjuncts to CT and geography. And it's the reason that we

603
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:10,720
at UCSF now do CTFFR on not all of it, most of the CTAs that we do, is that in theory,

604
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,360
you've reduced the number of people who go to the lab. You only reduce the number of people who go to

605
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,560
lab if you send people to the lab. If you're not sending people to the lab, you're not reducing

606
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,200
number of people. So again, to me, it comes back to the primary issue, which is that people

607
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,720
with plaque probably, you know, in the absence of symptoms, people with plaque should probably be

608
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,520
optometically medically treated and left alone. And that taking it in the cath lab is a very little

609
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,720
value. And obviously if they get to the cath lab, the chance of them getting stented goes up

610
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:53,360
astronomically, once they're there. So yes, you do theoretically prevent unnecessary stents

611
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,320
with CTFFR, but you can do that without the FFR. You don't need the FFR.

612
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,400
Yeah. I think that's really well said, right? Because to me, I don't get hung up when a study

613
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,480
like that doesn't find a difference in ACM, because I think that's a short time horizon.

614
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,560
But I do get a bit alarmed when there's absolutely no difference in MACE, right? When you see

615
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,320
no difference in anything related to cardiac pathology. And the only difference is an

616
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:26,320
algorithmic difference that to your point, you can make on your own. Again, I think we should

617
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,640
maybe reserve judgment until the final study is published. I mean, so we'll wait for that. I don't

618
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,000
know when that's coming out, but I found myself very underwhelmed by this and it didn't change my

619
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,920
thinking, which is that at this time I'm struggling for the use case of FFR. And as such, we really

620
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:49,040
don't employ it with our patients. I think that the issue is you have all these levers you can

621
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,440
pull. And so your job is to figure out which levers am I going to pull. And I think sometimes

622
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,520
people overcomplicate it, right? That there are going to be relatively low risk people whom you

623
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,040
could get away with statin or maybe statin and a very low dose of Zetia. I mean, in my opinion,

624
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:11,200
if you have plaque, significant A plaque, they say a 30% plaque or greater in an artery,

625
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,640
in your coronary vasculature, I'm pulling all the levers. I don't need any other information.

626
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,280
Like I don't need more. And that's a pretty good intervention, pulling all those levers.

627
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,560
By the way, to your point earlier, let's just assume there's something in me that's off.

628
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:35,200
I think the fact that the moment I had a six score Ditzel, every lever got pulled. That's probably

629
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,400
why 15 years later, it looks like a Ditzel still, nothing's changed, which means

630
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,160
if we just pulled all the levers all the time, we could kind of take this disease off the table

631
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,400
for virtually entire population. This is the mission statement of my friend,

632
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:57,600
say, Catharines' company, Verve. I mean, they want to CRISPR out PCSK9, not necessarily initially in

633
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:03,440
everybody, but he believes that if you can do that, you'd eradicate this disease. I don't totally

634
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:09,120
agree with him, actually. We disagree a little bit on some of these things. But in general,

635
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,400
I think he's probably right. The question is, do you need to go to that extreme to be able to

636
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:21,680
solve for this problem? And could you apply that solution to everybody, feasibly worldwide?

637
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,840
That's his problem to think about, not mine.

638
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,760
That's a very, and I'm going to, yeah, I'd love to have Seth on to talk about

639
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,760
many of these things. Okay, so let's talk about two other things before we leave CTA.

640
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,720
There's the fat attenuation index, FAI. What is that exactly?

641
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
I actually, I'm going to be totally honest. I have no idea.

642
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,320
Okay. You've seen it, I assume.

643
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:48,960
It's been, if to be presented to you.

644
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,200
Maybe, I guess. I sort of have learned in now doing this for as long as I have.

645
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,480
Right. I mean, so I graduated from medical school in 1996 and did my residency for two years and

646
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,440
then started my cardiology fellowship here 25 years ago. So I've sort of learned to tune out,

647
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:09,120
like put blinders on and to some of this stuff, just because it's something new every

648
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:16,240
like few weeks. It's been that way, like consistently. So I'm sorry, I'm not like

649
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,760
completely up to speed on this latest and greatest fat attenuation index. I imagine it's some CT based

650
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,760
way to look at the characteristics of the plaque and to see if it's potentially vulnerable. Is that

651
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,320
the idea? No, it looks, and I'm not an expert in this. I was hoping you were. So it basically,

652
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:38,480
it is a CTA bolt on just like the FFR is, but it looks at the characteristics of the fat

653
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,000
around the plaque. Yeah. So it's not trying to predict vulnerability per se. It's actually

654
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,600
trying to predict how much inflammation is, I hope I'm getting this right, but I think it's

655
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:57,760
looking for how much inflammation is around the plaque. I see. That's interesting. That's

656
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,520
interesting. I don't, not familiar. I am familiar with PET CT. The amount of it you can measure

657
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,280
using FTG PET, you can measure the amount of inflammation in a plaque that can be done

658
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,200
quantitatively. There's a group of people who've been doing that for years. And I think

659
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,800
certain pharmaceutical and biotech companies have used that as a way to kind of gauge efficacy

660
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:23,120
in evaluating new molecules to see if they can have an impact there.

661
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,920
That I don't think has been being used now clinically, at least to my knowledge and

662
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,240
routinely. I'm not familiar with the fat attenuation index. It kind of makes sense.

663
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:40,320
So it's, it's epi-cardial fat. That's right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's an interesting

664
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:46,800
idea, right? I mean, epi-cardial fat is visceral fat and there's, it probably does impact risk in

665
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:52,240
some way. Again, what are you going to do with that information? You're already pulling all the

666
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,840
levers. I guess maybe you'd focus a little bit more on metabolic stuff, I guess.

667
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,480
Which we'll come back to. Okay. Let's now, let's pivot to another topic that seems to come up from

668
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:14,880
time to time online, I guess, which is are there subsets of people who, in whom an elevated CAC

669
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,760
is not a predictor of risk? So there's been some confusion about this. I think it's maybe worth

670
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:29,440
clarifying this for folks. So James O'Keefe has commented on the fact that certain athletes,

671
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,360
you know, who exercise a lot, so very high degrees of cardio respiratory fitness might have a higher

672
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:42,800
frequency of coronary calcification. So let's first talk about that. How robust are those data?

673
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:48,800
And more importantly, what does it mean? Yeah. Well, I think it's plausible. I mean,

674
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:55,200
we know that sort of increasing sheer forces across an endothelial surface can certainly

675
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,280
lead to damage and that would potentially increase calcification. We know that

676
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:05,200
in, say, patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, that people who exercise at extreme levels do

677
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,800
appear to have an increased rate of calcification of that valve. And I say appear to because none of

678
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,000
these studies are controlled. But it does seem that that's the case and it makes sense and is

679
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,200
plausible as dangerous as that word is. I think the same thing could be true in a coronary

680
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:31,360
artery vascular bed. The increasing sheer, as you would expect to by increasing flow, as you would

681
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:39,600
during extreme exercise could potentially lead to some damage and therefore calcification.

682
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:47,680
So I do think it's plausible. I guess I don't, I still don't think, and sorry, I do think there

683
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,800
is this one example where there is a disconnect between the amount of calcification in the artery

684
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,320
and the amount of risk and that is within people taking statins. And that's a very difficult

685
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,800
concept for people to grasp. And frankly, it's a difficult concept for me to explain.

686
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:08,880
And I do find myself getting tied up and trying to explain it. And I can make up explanations like,

687
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,560
what you're doing is healing the plaque and stabilizing the plaque, which we think statins

688
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,720
are doing and that that's a good thing and not a bad thing. But I think that's incontrovertible

689
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:22,880
that statins probably do increase the risk of calcification despite lowering the risk of events.

690
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,440
So there is this one example. So is it possible that exercise could be similar to that? Maybe.

691
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:36,720
But we don't have the flip side, right? We don't have the 40 years of really rigorous

692
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:44,400
randomized trials showing that some exercise versus some version of placebo does that. Would

693
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,880
I say don't exercise? Absolutely not. Would I still tell some patients not to exercise to that

694
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:56,160
extreme level? I don't know. I'm on the fence there. And the question is, what's the, so each,

695
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:03,680
let's just assume that it is the case that high, high amounts of cardiorespiratory fitness come

696
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,640
at the expense of some endothelial damage. Again, I don't know if it's true, but I agree with you.

697
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:16,240
There's certainly mechanistic plausibility there. The question is, if a person goes from

698
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:25,200
call it, I don't know, 50 met hours per week of exercise to a hundred met hours per week of

699
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:32,640
exercise. And let's assume that doing that increases their calcification. A, is that with

700
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,480
or without more risk? Let's assume it is with more risk, but is that risk more or less than

701
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,000
the benefit that they gain going from the 25 or 50 to the hundred met hours a week of exercise?

702
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,760
In other words, this is what makes exercise a bit more complicated here, which is most of the other

703
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,960
things that are increasing the burden of calcification are net negative, right? Obviously,

704
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,520
smoking more, having higher blood pressure, having worse lipids, but the correction of that moves in

705
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,240
the same direction as the correction of the calcification works in the same correction of the,

706
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,680
as the calcification of works in the same direction as the improvement of the risk

707
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:16,800
modifier with exercise is not the same. What's I think unambiguous though, and we were talking

708
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:24,080
about this earlier, more exercise is better than less and more calcium is worse than less.

709
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,520
I've yet to see an exception to that rule. That is according to the thing.

710
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,160
I agree with you. And I think that discordance is only mimicked by the statin story, right? Where

711
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:40,160
we need more spattens are better and also lead to more calcium. Look, here's the thing. If you

712
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:48,080
put it back into sort of the terms in the context of a patient comes to me and says, Hey, I got this

713
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,160
calcium score of whatever, let's call it 800, I don't know, whatever you want to call it 500,

714
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:58,000
300, 200, 100. But I don't think it means anything because I exercise a lot. Like that's

715
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,120
the question, right? That's the question that gets presented to us sort of at an individual level.

716
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,760
And I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not yet comfortable saying, Oh, don't worry about that.

717
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:12,800
Whereas I am comfortable saying, don't worry about that if it's because they're on a statin.

718
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:20,800
And so what I would say to that patient is we have to assume that that calcium is representative of

719
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,960
plaques in the arteries and that having plaques in the arteries is a bad thing.

720
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,560
And that we should treat you accordingly, even though you exercise a lot. And if you want to be

721
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,200
sure, then we can do a CT angiogram to kind of see how much plaque you actually have.

722
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,840
Because, you know, I don't know any evidence that this calcification is not plaque related,

723
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:49,840
that it's somehow extra vascular calcification or beyond the, it's in the intima or something

724
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,680
or media, I guess. But that's how I would approach it today is I just can't tell you,

725
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:01,680
I can't give you a free pass on the calcium because you exercise a lot. Exercising is great.

726
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:07,840
Keep exercising. Don't stop exercising. But I think the burden of proof is on us to show

727
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,840
that that is not risky. And if we did a CT angiogram and it showed you didn't have any plaque and

728
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,680
all the calcium is sort of extra vascular somewhere else, then sure, I'm sure you're

729
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,720
okay with that. But that if we do it and we see plaque, I'm not aware of any data that would say

730
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:30,320
let's not treat you. Which is sort of the subtle but important difference between the statin store,

731
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,760
because the people on statins are already by definition on the risk reducing therapy

732
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,880
that's been shown to save lives. So like, it's not like, what are you going to do to that person

733
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,600
because their calcium score is higher? You know, would you be more aggressive, I guess,

734
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,280
is one question people might ask. But I think it's a little bit of that's the difference is that

735
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,040
there's that lever still to pull and the exercise person is that 90.

736
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,280
So what percentage of your patients take statins?

737
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:04,640
I mean, it's a completely biased group of people because it's all of course, of course.

738
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,720
90, I'm guessing. And is the implication that the five to 10% who don't

739
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,800
have some side effect that they aren't able to tolerate?

740
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,640
Right. There's those for sure. Although I think that's less frequent now because

741
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,200
would you say statin or any other like or PCS-kinine inhibitor? Because I do have

742
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:27,680
a few patients.

743
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:33,680
No, I would just say statin to start because what I want to sort of explore for a moment is

744
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,840
what are the real world implications of the use of these drugs? What are the real world side

745
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:45,760
effects? What are the real world conditions that prevent people from being maximally

746
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,200
medically treated?

747
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,320
Small number of patients of mine who don't take them because of true side effects.

748
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,280
Equally, maybe even slightly larger group of patients who don't take them because they're

749
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:03,920
afraid of them. And I don't mean that to be pejorative. I think there's been a tremendous

750
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,880
campaign, a propaganda campaign to demonize statins that's been going on for a long time,

751
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,800
25 or 30 years. And it's been very successful and people are terrified of statins. And

752
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,280
there have been documentaries made on how statins are poison and they're killing people.

753
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,680
And while not everybody or even maybe most people are aware of that,

754
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,960
plenty of people who spend any amount of time online are. And so that is, I do spend a lot

755
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,120
of time with patients who come to see me because I have some openness to at least having that

756
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,720
conversation with them and I'm not going to force them. I have a patient of mine who came to see me

757
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,640
with a tremendous amount of skepticism, had every risk factor, was probably having angina when he

758
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,640
first came to see me. And I recommended that he start taking a statin that first day and he was

759
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,920
afraid to because of stuff that he'd read about how dangerous they were. He ended up, needless to

760
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:02,240
say, a few months later in the ER with an acute MI and fortunately the outcome was good. He ended

761
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,520
up with a stent. He's stayed on a statin ever since then. So that sort of was enough of an

762
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,960
experience for him to change his mind. But I have a number of people who just flat out either won't

763
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:19,600
or it takes me years to convince them to. Years. I mean, some people I've seen for years, I've had

764
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,960
the same conversation year after year after year after year. And some people never changed their

765
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,280
mind. Some people change their minds because of other things happening like this patient having

766
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:35,680
an MI and some people change their minds because finally they are convinced. But I never force it.

767
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:42,320
What's the core belief that's at the root of the fear you think? I mean, again, and I say this just

768
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,280
acknowledging that probably about 5% of patients are going to experience muscle side effects that

769
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,520
are going to warrant not taking a statin because it's going to impede in their quality of life.

770
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,320
But so if you just acknowledge unemotionally that there are side effects, you're going to see

771
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,680
transaminase elevations that are just too much, especially if mixed with Zetia. But if you

772
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:06,640
acknowledge all of those things, there's obviously some deeper seated fear in something that can't

773
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,960
be seen or measured or quantified. Where do you think that comes from? Why don't we see that with

774
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,440
other classes of drugs to the same extent? I think we do. I just think this happens to be

775
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,920
one of the most prescribed classes of drugs in the history of humankind. And so

776
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,920
it's just the denominator is bigger. I think this is sort of the same thing that gets at a lot of

777
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,000
skepticism around science and big pharma. And there's a whole world of people out there with

778
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,400
these vast conspiracy theories about the development of statins and about how Rory Collins is an evil

779
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:47,760
person. He's engineered this whole conspiracy to try to get the whole world on these poisons.

780
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,840
I mean, there are people out there who really believe that. And look, if you hear something

781
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,840
enough and you aren't an expert and don't have access to all the data that we have access to,

782
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,640
it can be compelling. And I've watched some of these documentaries. They're terrifying. Just as

783
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:08,560
I'm sure the documentaries were made after the Wakefield experience in the late 90s were

784
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,800
terrifying to young mothers who were worried about giving their kids MMR vaccines or whatever,

785
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,640
any other. I think it's very easy to convince people to be scared of something.

786
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:24,880
It's a lot harder to make people unscared of something. And this is just an example,

787
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,160
I think, where there's a group of people out there who just don't believe in this whole

788
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,720
enterprise. They're, for whatever reason, very skeptical of big science and big pharma. And

789
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,720
don't get me wrong. Obviously, there are plenty of things that big pharma has done wrong. And

790
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,480
we can go through the examples of that. This happens not to be one of them. The sad thing

791
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:52,240
about how demonized statins have been is that it's one of the most profoundly important interventions

792
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:59,200
that we have in modern medicine. And it's astonishing to me that this is being compared

793
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:06,400
effectively to smoking, right? To cigarette companies. I haven't heard that comparison,

794
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:13,280
but certainly people will quickly point to Purdue and the opioid crisis has proved positive that the

795
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:21,280
pharma entities are evil. And it's again, it's there's no question that Purdue pharma is indeed

796
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:27,280
evil. And again, I've said this before on the podcast, I think it's really difficult for us

797
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:33,920
as a species to think dialectically and to hold seemingly contradictory truths simultaneously that

798
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:41,840
pharma companies can do good things and bad things. And that seems to be true across the board. That

799
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,760
seems to be true of every person as well, right? Any given individual can do something good and

800
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:51,840
something bad. The exceptions would be those that are universally good or universally bad

801
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,960
as people. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think there are people out there who just

802
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,640
are clearly bad. And yeah, there are people who are probably clearly always good. And yeah, again,

803
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:09,200
I'm not even I'd like to meet I'd like to meet them. Yeah. Okay, let's let's talk about blood

804
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:15,120
pressure. Because I think this is one of those areas that I've personally become more and more

805
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:23,120
interested in over the past year. And it's actually become more of a concern to me maybe

806
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:29,680
over the past two years through the lens of the kidney. So we have this organ that just doesn't

807
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:35,120
get much attention. I'm trying to think outside of my podcast with Chris Sananday, where we talked

808
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,480
about kidney and liver transplantation. I don't think I've got a single podcast that deals with

809
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:47,840
the kidney. And it's a really special organ. And I sort of explained to my patients that

810
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:57,360
in our bootstrapping approach to living an extra few years on this planet, a lot of it requires a

811
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:04,240
phase shift in time. Right. So if you're 50 years old, you really need to be held to the standard of

812
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:08,320
a healthy 40 year old, if you want to live an extra 10 years, that's the way you want to think

813
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,760
about it. You want to think about that in terms of your mind, you want to think about that in terms

814
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,200
of your body, you want to think about that in terms of your coronary arteries, want to think

815
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,200
about it in terms of your bone density, but you got to think about it in terms of your kidneys.

816
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:26,000
And so when we look at a person and estimate their glomerular filtration rate, which we use,

817
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,960
you know, cystatin C to measure that we've largely abandoned creatinine.

818
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:42,080
It's really tempting to say, well, you know, this guy's 55 years old, his EGFR is 70 mils per minute.

819
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:48,560
That's good enough. But in reality, it's not actually. It's far from good enough. And

820
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,160
the kidney is not uniquely, but exquisitely sensitive to high blood pressure.

821
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,040
Again, I'm not a nephrologist and I never really, I don't think I remember much from nephrology, but

822
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,760
I certainly remember that something about its vasculature is incredibly sensitive, right? It

823
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,840
probably has to do with the fact that it's such a tiny organ that takes such a high amount of our

824
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:18,400
cardiac output. And I suspect just like the heart and the brain, it's very sensitive to pressure.

825
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,440
And so that really is the lens through which I think about this first and foremost with the

826
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:33,280
meaning even the slightest amount of elevation in blood pressure is going to interfere with

827
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:38,720
long-term kidney health and also with heart and brain health. So really, there's a win across the

828
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:44,720
board if we just normalize blood pressure. So I'll posit that and have you just kind of explain

829
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:50,320
from the ASCBD perspective, the importance of blood pressure and how it stacks up with

830
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,440
smoking, APO-B and some of the other heavy hitting risk factors.

831
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:01,760
Yeah. So I guess I just want to acknowledge how strongly I agree with you about the neglect,

832
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:07,040
how much we neglect the kidney as an organ and nephrology as a subspecialty of medicine.

833
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:13,840
I actually used to give a lecture on hypertension in the first year of medical students at UCSF.

834
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:20,000
And I did that in conjunction with a kidney pathologist who interestingly had been at Hopkins

835
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,120
when I was a medical student was my advisor, very interesting woman who's now retired named Jean

836
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,920
Olson. And she and I co-gave the lecture, she gave the pathology part and I gave the

837
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,880
clinical part. And I learned so much about the importance of the kidney and regulating blood

838
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,760
pressure in that, in giving that lecture with her for however many years it was, 10 years.

839
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:48,480
So it's both an important cause of blood pressure. And in fact, I think if you go back and look at

840
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,840
Rick Lifton, who's sort of one of the premier human geneticists in history, member of the National

841
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,360
Academy, some probably should win a Nobel Prize. He characterized all of the single gene mutations

842
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:08,640
that lead to extreme increases or decreases in blood pressure. I think at the time,

843
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:15,360
and this is 20 years ago, there were like 10 single gene mutations that led to people who had

844
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,560
really, really low blood pressure had to constantly supplement salt and do things like that. And then

845
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:29,040
10 that led to extremely high blood pressure. And I think like 19 out of 20 of these things

846
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:36,000
were located in the same location in the proximal collecting doctor in the tubule. It was like,

847
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:43,920
you couldn't have picked a place that was more important evolutionarily for how we handle volume

848
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:51,680
and salt and solute. So it's an incredibly important organ both as a cause of high blood pressure

849
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,440
and also as a consequence. And those experiments, you know, Jean showed these beautiful slides that

850
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:02,800
I'll send along sometime, you know, pictures of what happens to your kidney after it's exposed to

851
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,520
increased levels of blood pressure over time. So it was interesting because I was giving this

852
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,480
lecture as a cardiologist during the kidney block. It always felt, I felt out of place.

853
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:21,040
So most people kind of know that when they go to their doctor and they get their blood

854
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:30,880
pressure checked, normal is about 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury. What do we know about

855
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:39,840
how much that changes in a healthy person across the course of the day? So when they're sleeping,

856
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,080
when they're ambulatory and walking around, but not under stress, i.e. not exercising,

857
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:54,480
when they are exercising vigorously, when they're, you know, under stress, physiologic stress,

858
01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:00,720
psychological stress, all of these different things that we do every single day, surely our

859
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:06,560
blood pressure must change. And yet most of us, myself included, have virtually no idea of how our

860
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:14,240
blood pressure is changing under those situations, even if under perfect optimal conditions, i.e.

861
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:19,440
sitting down, legs uncrossed for five minutes, it reads 120 over 80. So what do we know about the

862
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:24,800
rest of the time? So I guess it's, we don't, I don't want to get too distracted, but I think

863
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,800
it's fascinating. I've thought about this a lot. And the question of what's normal is, you know,

864
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,720
we all assume 120 over 80 is normal. If you look at blood pressures across different animal species,

865
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,360
it's mostly in that range. There are some that are outliers. Obviously a giraffe is,

866
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:45,280
is the best example of an outlier species with much higher blood pressure that it needs to have

867
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:52,400
to be able to pump blood up to that very, that head that's sitting way up high. It is weird to me

868
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,200
from an evolutionary perspective, why we would have the same blood pressure as a mouse,

869
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,160
right? It's a little tiny creature who walks around on four legs. Why should we have the same

870
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,800
blood pressure? It speaks, I think, to the conservation of this sort of vascular system

871
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,720
that we have. I think most people when I was a medical student, I'm sure you were the same,

872
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,880
were taught that 120 over 80 is normal, but that's just normal. Whether you're,

873
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:27,440
you know, 7, 17, or 75. I don't think we have a good understanding of, well, we have an understanding

874
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:33,440
of what is epidemiologically normal as we age. And so we know that blood pressure does go up with

875
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:39,520
each decade of life. If I had access to that lecture I used to give, I could show you what

876
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:45,600
happened, but certainly with each decade of life, your blood pressure goes up on average. If you're

877
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,840
looking at a population of people, is that normal? Is that part of normal healthy aging? Or is that

878
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,480
just a function of pathology? Is it a function of something going wrong over time? To your point,

879
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:01,200
is it something about decreased kidney function or maybe as an increased vascular stiffness

880
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:08,160
over time? I think all those things are possible and probably probable. So for a long time,

881
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:14,640
it was assumed that a blood pressure that was normal for somebody in their 20s and 30s

882
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:21,040
was probably too low and not normal for somebody who was in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And so we

883
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:28,640
had this permissive hypertension in elderly people because we thought, well, gosh, they

884
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:36,080
required. It's just part of the aging process. And it really hasn't been until the past

885
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:43,920
really 10 plus years that we've begun to ask specifically in really well-designed clinical

886
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:50,640
trials, is that the case? And is it the case when it comes to looking at important clinical outcomes?

887
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:58,160
And I think my take on this now is different than it was 15 years ago. And that is that

888
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,960
120 over 80 is normal no matter where you are in life. And that anything above that is abnormal.

889
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,320
And just to kind of get to the punchline, what I tell patients is that my aspiration is that we

890
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:14,080
can get you as close to 120 over 80 as we can without harming you. Because there are certainly

891
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:20,000
potential harms that are associated with treating people to these low numbers, they can be in the

892
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:29,200
form of side effects or impacts on lifestyle. They can be in the form of real toxicity. Hyperkalemia,

893
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,440
risk of death, I mean, there's all kinds of potential issues. It's not just a simple intervention

894
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,880
like treating LDL or APOB lower and lower and lower. There's really no consequence at all.

895
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,640
There is a consequence of lowering blood pressure too low in this case. So that's my overall kind

896
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,640
of philosophy of how to think about blood pressures. I do think there's now evidence from

897
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:54,000
good clinical trials that 120 over 80 is normal and that we should try to get there

898
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:02,000
as best we can without making a mess. So through that lens, basically we're saying that the amount

899
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,640
of float that we see in blood pressure, again, we're talking about blood pressure in a very

900
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,920
narrow instance, which is seated, resting, et cetera. We'll come back to the other point, but

901
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:19,360
just to build off that, that when that drifts up to 125, 130, 135, 140 in an aging population,

902
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:25,440
we're actually calling that pathologic in the same way that I think we would all agree that the

903
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:31,920
reduction in glomerular filtration rate, the reduction in ejection fraction, the reduction

904
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:38,000
in pulmonary function, okay, yes, that occurs with aging, but that doesn't mean that it's not part of

905
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,720
an aging process and therefore part of something we want to minimize, correct? That's right. We

906
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:47,040
lose muscle mass as we age. Is that something we want to accept and that's normal or do we want to

907
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,680
try to do it? We can't have preserved the muscle mass that we had it younger in life. And again,

908
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:59,200
I think here the, the crutch that we fall back on and is good, high quality, well done clinical

909
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:04,720
trials. And in this case, we have now have them and it's not just sort of an opinion-based thing

910
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,560
that says, oh, we'll really get closer to 120 over 80. We actually have evidence that being closer

911
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:16,160
to 120 over 80 impacts mortality and that permitting people to run higher to a level

912
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,680
that we used to consider to be just basically prehypertension or just normal, even an older

913
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:27,520
person 140 over 90, that leads to a significant increase in risk of dying. So to me, I think

914
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:34,800
we've learned a lot and I don't consider it to be a normal function of aging. I think

915
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:40,000
there may be a process, there's obviously a process that goes along with aging that there's

916
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,600
a decrease in function of a lot of different things that lead, combines to lead to this increase

917
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:50,880
in blood pressure, but I don't leave it alone. Okay. I think that makes sense to me as well.

918
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:57,440
Let's ask the second question now, which is the one that vexes me the most,

919
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:08,880
which is how much of a given day, let's assume I sit down three times a day for five minutes,

920
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:15,840
relax, don't look at my phone, don't drink coffee, don't cross my legs and perfectly Zen.

921
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:21,600
I put the cuff on my arm, I measure the blood pressure, it's 120 over 80. Let's assume I do

922
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:27,120
that three times a day and I get that number. How reflective is that of what my blood pressure is

923
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,440
when I'm sleeping? Let's say I'm sleeping eight hours. When I'm exercising, let's say I'm

924
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,440
exercising for an hour, 90 minutes a day. And when I'm sitting at my desk stressing out over email,

925
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:46,320
how much variation am I getting? Tons. So the first time I ever was in the cath lab,

926
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,880
it was really amazing to me to see the variation in blood pressure just in a patient lying on a

927
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:57,760
table based on before they were sedated and after they were sedated. There are all kinds of things.

928
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:03,040
So there's no doubt that there's a huge amount of variation from second to second, minute to

929
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,640
minute, hour to hour, day to day and beyond in blood pressure. And I think it's very easy to get

930
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,520
distracted by that. And I do all the time. And obviously when I'm sitting in traffic,

931
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:20,560
my blood pressure is not 120 over 80. When my kid spills coffee all over the computer,

932
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:26,800
it's not 120 over 80. When I'm exercising, it's not 120 over 80. There's physiology and there's

933
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,840
pathophysiology. So physiologically, our blood pressure does go up and it's meant to go up

934
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,240
during some of these cases. It's a function of increased cardiac output, which is one of the

935
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:44,160
components of blood pressure. So I think it's understandable. The question then is what do you

936
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,480
do about that relative and sort of how best do you measure blood pressure? And so again,

937
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:53,440
and this is a broken record, I'll just keep doing this, but I fall back on the clinical trials.

938
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:00,480
And just as we try to practice as best we can with some sort of fidelity to the way the trials are

939
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,400
done, I go back to sort of how are they measuring blood pressure in these trials and therefore how

940
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:11,440
were the decisions made to adjust medications and how did that influence the practice of the trial

941
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,640
and therefore how should that influence our practice? Because those are the outcomes that we

942
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:18,880
look at. So this got a lot of attention. When Sprint was first published, which was I think

943
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:24,640
2014 or 15, I can't remember the exact date, but it got a huge amount of attention. There was all

944
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:29,280
kinds of pushback from almost every angle you could think of. There were a lot of people out

945
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,440
there who felt like this is just yet another example of medicine trying to do too much.

946
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,360
The Less is More crowd hated it, right? That this is just over medicalizing normal aging, right?

947
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:46,720
There was a significant amount of attention paid on how they actually measured the blood pressure

948
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,840
because it wasn't the way that we typically measure blood pressure. And it was the way that

949
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,360
we probably ought to measure blood pressure, but it certainly wasn't the way that we typically

950
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,800
measure blood pressure. So if you go back and you look at the data, if you look at the methods,

951
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:04,400
what they did was they had people in a quiet room, then automated cuff, one of the sort of standard,

952
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:10,320
you know, sort of best in class at that time, automated cuff, they put the cuff on the person,

953
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:15,760
they had them seated and relaxed in a quiet room by themselves. And they had the blood pressure

954
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:22,320
measured three times, five minutes in between, right? So total of once, five minute break,

955
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,720
one more, five minute break, and once more. And they took the average of those blood pressures.

956
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:33,600
And that's obviously much different than having somebody rush in after parking their car and run

957
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:40,560
into the office in a sweat and show up and somebody slaps a cuff on them and measures the blood pressure.

958
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:47,600
But my point is that that optimal way of measuring blood pressure, even if it ends up

959
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:53,440
yielding numbers that are lower than what we typically get, that led to the result in that

960
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:59,280
trial, which was so spectacular, the trial was stopped early. And this is not to all the,

961
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,400
you know, conspiracy theorists out there, this was not a pharma sponsored sponsored trial. This

962
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:10,480
is an NIH sponsored trial, the government sponsored trial, and was agnostic to different

963
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,680
agents, right? I mean, it was not about the physicians who enrolled patients in the trial

964
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:21,600
had had access to almost any therapy during that trial. So this was not about sort of proving the

965
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:27,200
benefit of one drug over another. This is purely about testing the hypothesis that getting as close

966
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:34,000
to 120 over 80, rather than letting people sort of float up to 140 over 90 was better or not. And it

967
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,960
turned out that it was with caveats. So let's talk about that methodology. And then let's talk about

968
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:46,320
the algorithm agents and then the potential downside. So I have started testing my blood pressure

969
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:51,120
six months ago. And the reason for it, so I shouldn't say that I have always checked my

970
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,200
blood pressure, because both my parents have hypertension. I'd always attributed to the

971
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,720
fact that I had low blood pressure to the fact that I was super healthy and did all these other

972
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,440
things. But I realized, look, there's genetics to this as well. So I'm just going to start checking

973
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:08,000
my blood pressure every couple of days. And I did. And so for a couple of years, I just take my blood

974
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,200
pressure, three, four times a week, just when I'm sitting at the desk working, never attempting to

975
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:20,640
relax or rest or do anything. And it was pretty low, you know, probably averaged 110 over 70

976
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:26,240
was sort of a typical reading of while I was sitting there working. And then something happened

977
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:35,440
in August, it was consistently a little bit higher than that. Not a lot higher, but it was 125 to 130.

978
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:42,240
And it was, you know, more or less 80 in the denominator. This made me get a little more

979
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:48,000
serious. I got another cuff. And now I started doing the full sit protocol three times a day

980
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:57,600
with both the Amron cuff and the Withings cuff. And what I realized were two things. The first is

981
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,800
I can always breathe my blood pressure down to normal. In other words, there's never been a

982
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:08,880
five minute window when if I don't sit there and really focus on breathing, I can't get that blood

983
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:14,800
pressure to come to normal. But most often than not, that first reading the second I sit down,

984
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:21,280
especially in August, it got better in October and September was kind of a transition month. It's

985
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:27,120
kind of normalized now. But it was not uncommon for that first one to be as high as 140 over 90.

986
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:32,080
If I just, you know, was literally doing something, not exercising, but if I was, you know,

987
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,680
doing something active, and then I went and sat down like the equivalent of the guy who

988
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:42,400
shows up from the parking garage, you know, just parked the car, had to walk up one flight of stairs,

989
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:53,520
sits down 140 over 90. Five minutes later, it's, you know, it's 117 over 74. And, you know, I've been

990
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:58,480
in sort of a back and forth discussion with my doctor and with my colleagues about, is this

991
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:04,320
something I need to care about? Because now if you look at my spreadsheet and all of my phone data,

992
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:10,160
my blood pressure looks perfectly normal. For the last six months, I've averaged below 120 over 80.

993
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:16,960
But I kind of feel like I'm cheating, Ethan, because to guarantee that it's low, I have to

994
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:22,320
take five minutes of being calm, which then makes me wonder, I know that that's in line with how the

995
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,920
sprint study was done. And you could argue, well, Peter, you're simply, you're actually doing

996
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,520
something that's less extreme than what they did, because they did three measurements over 10 minutes.

997
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,880
But I think, but deep down, I know my blood pressure is not 120 over 80 when I'm sitting

998
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:41,520
at my computer, you know, writing, because when I check that blood pressure straight away, it's

999
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,720
it's above that. So I hear your point that it's okay. I mean, what I think I'm hearing you say is,

1000
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,400
based on the way the trial was done, we have to assume that the other people,

1001
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,560
when they first sat down, might have been higher as well.

1002
01:36:52,560 --> 01:37:00,880
Yeah, so here's what I would say is, I think, sounds like something changed in you.

1003
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:07,200
Yeah, a book deadline is definitely what changed in August. So there's no question that was that.

1004
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:11,920
Well, so if that's the case, then that's understandable. And that's, that's okay. I

1005
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,320
think, in your case, it sounds like what I was going to say was, if it was truly a change,

1006
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,640
and there was no explanation for it, like a lot of things in medicine, then I probably

1007
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,560
would have paid more attention to it, even though it was going from what was normal to normal,

1008
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,920
right, that you just, that it sounded like something did change. But in this case,

1009
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,440
it sounds like there is an explanation in that you had this stress in your life in the book.

1010
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,440
So I guess the cheating thing reminds me of my daughter, who I think I told you before,

1011
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:44,800
is my younger daughter is legally blind, and she plays basketball, and we were discussing

1012
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,800
a potential. This is such a crazy little side, but I thought I'd tell the story because it's

1013
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:53,600
kind of cute. She, we were discussing a potential procedure she could have to improve her vision.

1014
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,960
Because part of her decrement of visual acuity is that she has pretty bad nystagmus,

1015
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:04,400
lateral nystagmus. And the ophthalmologist was saying that if you can sort of make that better,

1016
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,840
you'll improve, understandably, you'll improve her visual acuity. And that they,

1017
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:14,480
somebody stumbled onto the idea that if you cut the optic, the extraocular muscles,

1018
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,280
and just reattach them, don't do anything else, but just sever them and reattach them,

1019
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:24,560
that nystagmus can go away. And that people's visual acuity can improve a lot. So we thought,

1020
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,640
well, gosh, that sounds really interesting. We should do that. It's fascinating how that

1021
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,000
might happen. But she said she didn't want to do it. Because she was like, that's cheating.

1022
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,520
This is a kid who runs around with a visual acuity of 20 over 200. And she was like, that's cheating.

1023
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:44,080
So we haven't been able to convince her to do it yet. We'll see if she changes her mind someday.

1024
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:49,600
But I don't think you're cheating. What you're doing is optimizing the measurement. I think

1025
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,680
what you could do if you want to, and maybe you've already done it, if you really want to get a sense,

1026
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:59,200
and it would be great to have this over time, serially, is to do a 24 hour ambulatory blood

1027
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:04,880
pressure monitor to really get a sense of what is the average blood pressure you're seeing over

1028
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,960
a 24 hour period, because there is a difference. When you're sleeping, your blood pressure should

1029
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,760
be low, right? That's physiology. When you're out and about and doing these, it's going to be higher.

1030
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:19,360
What is the survival? They can quantify all the spikes. It's actually a really nice tool that

1031
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:25,520
I'll use, especially in people who have some degree of what's commonly termed white coat

1032
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,920
hypertension, which is what white coat hypertension is real life. White coat hypertension is

1033
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:39,680
living in the real world. How does an ambulatory BP cuff work? It's presumably a cuff that sits

1034
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:45,280
on the arm and then it straps to a device like a halter would. It's funny, I don't think I've

1035
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:50,640
ever seen a device, I've ordered a bunch. It's a cuff, so it's really old school, right? It's not

1036
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,800
like this is new technology where they can measure blood pressure without doing the old sphincter

1037
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:02,640
monometer. It's a cuff, I think it's got a self, I would imagine it's got some hardware attached to

1038
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:07,680
it that tells it to inflate and measure blood pressure, just as you would with a one that you

1039
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:13,520
have in your office. It does that once a minute or whatever it is over the course of 24 hours.

1040
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,560
So it's constantly inflating, deflating over the course of a day. Patients who have

1041
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,040
mine who've warned them say that after a while you get used to it and just you can ignore it.

1042
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,560
It seems to me like it would be really annoying to have this thing like inflating and deflating

1043
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:35,280
all the time, but that's what it is. What it does though is it buys you sort of a distraction from

1044
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:39,120
real life. It buys you sort of when you're not thinking about things, when you're clearly not

1045
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:44,240
stressed or you shouldn't be stressed, i.e. when you're sleeping, what is your blood pressure? And

1046
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:50,080
we know that blood pressure, that hypertension during sleep is abnormal. It should really be a

1047
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:55,120
time when your blood pressure is the lowest. So it's just another tool that we have to kind of

1048
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:01,920
get at that question. It is always interesting to me that we measure blood pressure not just once

1049
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:09,760
a 10 or 30 second interval in a 24 hour day, but that we do that on average once or twice

1050
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:18,400
a year. And that we assume that this very variable number is actually meaningful. And it's remarkable

1051
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:23,920
to me that it has been even meaningful the way that we've been measuring it because it is such

1052
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:31,760
a poor sample. I mean, we in our patients will ask them to do twice a day checks at home, same

1053
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:39,440
method that I'm using for at least two weeks once a year. And if we have reason to believe that

1054
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:44,160
that suspect will do it more and yet, so even though that's much more than they would be asked

1055
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:51,040
to do normally, it still feels woefully inadequate. And I've tried a bunch of devices that's supposed

1056
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:57,200
to measure, supposedly measuring blood pressure like little wrist based devices. I've never found

1057
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:02,960
them to work. Is there anything on the horizon that's closing the gap on that?

1058
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:09,280
You'd think so. There was a period of time where people were using a cell phone camera and you could

1059
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:15,120
press your finger on the camera and that it could basically detect the pulsation. It could almost

1060
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:22,320
calculate a pulse wave and then could give you a sort of imputed systolic and diastolic blood

1061
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,640
pressure that never made it. Obviously we're not seeing those around. We're not seeing any other

1062
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:31,920
devices that people can wear that can accurately measure blood pressure. So I do think it's a

1063
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:36,880
interesting question. You'd have to think that at some point, even if it's an intravascular device,

1064
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:43,680
that you could put a miniature device, much like we're now using, I don't know how much you use

1065
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:50,720
them, but I use them a lot, these implantable event monitors, these loop recorders. We use them to

1066
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:56,080
detect arrhythmias. It sounds bad, right when you think about it, but it's really not that big of a

1067
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:02,000
deal. There has to be a way to get a pressure transducer into an artery safely that you could

1068
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:08,400
leave there for some period of time. It feels like that's going to come, but I haven't seen it. And

1069
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:14,640
then non-invasively would be amazing, but I just again, haven't seen it. So yeah, as you know, I

1070
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:20,400
find CGM to be kind of a remarkable tool. I would think this is even more important because glucose

1071
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:25,440
in many ways is less variable than blood pressure, or at least its variability is more

1072
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:31,360
predictable. In other words, you could, I think much more easily get by with just spot checks

1073
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:36,160
of glucose than you can with just spot texts of blood pressure. To have a true continuous

1074
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:42,080
ambulatory BP monitor, I mean, that would really be a game changer in medicine.

1075
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,480
Again, when you think about the heart, when you think about the brain, when you think about the

1076
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:51,440
kidneys, it's such an important thing. I agree with you. I think that said, the intervention

1077
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:57,840
that was used in sprint still showed a remarkable benefit. And so we can't exist with the tools we

1078
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:03,200
have. Yeah. And while they're not optimal, they're probably adequate. And they're definitely better.

1079
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,120
If you go back and look, and this was part of this lecture I used to give, if you look at the

1080
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:16,480
percentage of people that have either diagnosed blood pressure, so how many people are known to

1081
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:25,120
have hypertension who actually do have it, how many people are treated at all, even have on any

1082
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:32,480
medicine, and how many people are controlled. If you look back in time, when this was first done

1083
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,720
in the first Indian survey in the whatever 1975, 76, whatever that was, only 50% of people who had

1084
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:45,120
hypertension were even aware of it. Only 30% were actually ever treated, and only 10% were controlled.

1085
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:50,640
And I don't know what the most current numbers are, but the awareness has gone up, it must be

1086
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:57,360
north of 80% now. Treatment is probably 75 or 80%. And control is probably somewhere around 50%.

1087
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:04,320
So we're still missing the opportunity to treat 50% of people with this disease.

1088
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:12,160
So let's go back to Sprint. This trial was drug agnostic, right? Is this the one that basically

1089
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:18,000
said, start with a thiazide, move to a calcium channel blocker, and then an ACE or vice versa?

1090
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:27,040
No. Actually, I don't remember the algorithm for Sprint, but I think it was relatively agnostic.

1091
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:34,960
Allhat was the first NIH sponsored blood pressure trial. That was in early 2000s, like 2002, 2003.

1092
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,760
And that tested five different classes of medications, two of which were discontinued.

1093
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:45,520
So I believe it was calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and the calcium channel blocker at the

1094
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:52,560
time was amylotopine, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, thiazide diuretics, the cortilidone, beta blockers,

1095
01:45:52,560 --> 01:46:03,520
and I don't remember what it was. Oh, it was alpha agonist. Because at the time,

1096
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:08,960
they were being used for blood pressure. And both the alphas and the betas were stopped early

1097
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:14,560
because they were harmful. And so what the result of that trial was that using any of the other three

1098
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:18,640
classes was first line and primary hypertension treatment, a primary hypertension.

1099
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,280
And that was lysinopril, amylotopine, and ethiazide, correct?

1100
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:27,680
Yes. And I believe the thiazide they used was cortilidone. And we can talk a little bit about

1101
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:33,200
the difference between cortilidone and hydrochlorothiazide, but in general, cortilidone is more potent.

1102
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:37,440
And that's the one that was, I think, used in the allhat trial, but I'd have to double check.

1103
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:43,680
And if I recall, the amylotopine, lysinopril, and the thiazide all ended up having similar outcomes,

1104
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,520
which were all better. Yeah, no real differences. Yeah.

1105
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,480
Yeah. And I think there were maybe some stroke, it's been like so long since I've reviewed it,

1106
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,200
but I think there might've been like a minor difference in stroke risk and the amylotopine.

1107
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:59,840
But the take home of that and what became contemporary practice was use any of these

1108
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,240
three agents as first line and primary hypertension. And if you need more, you add another.

1109
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,880
And the target was 120 over 80.

1110
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:13,440
Well, that was, yeah, I mean, it was the target. It certainly wasn't

1111
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:20,800
a, the emphasis was not, the definitions definitely changed, right? Because there was

1112
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:29,280
this sort of category in, I don't remember which JNC, so I think it was JNC six or something.

1113
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:37,680
There was a category for normal. Ah, that's right. So it was normal was actually 120 to 130

1114
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:45,760
over 80 to 85. Borderline was 130 to 140 over 85 to 90. And it was only then hypertension,

1115
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,000
if you were greater than 140 over 90, and then they called it stage one, two, and three.

1116
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,760
So then when they redid it JNC seven, it was normal was less than 120 over 80. Prehypertension

1117
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:04,240
was then at 120 to 140 and hypertension was then above 140 over 90. That was the difference

1118
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:15,360
in between JNC seven and JNC six. JNC eight, I believe, gosh, I can't remember what happened.

1119
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:21,600
There was some controversy and they stopped after that. There was like basically the, and NHLBI said

1120
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,560
we can't do this anymore because there was too much controversy over these.

1121
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:32,240
So what was the impetus for sprint? The impetus was to test the new hypothesis that was,

1122
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:35,040
should we be more aggressive in the management of hypertension?

1123
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:41,120
So the impetus was that there were epidemiological observational studies,

1124
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:46,880
and I can send you one or two, that showed that it appeared that the risk of

1125
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:56,080
bad outcomes, mostly coronary cardiovascular disease, was lower, step function lower in

1126
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,280
patients who had optimal blood pressure. This is, you know, according to the old classification,

1127
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:04,160
people whose blood pressure is 120 over 80 or less optimal, and then a small step increase in

1128
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:09,600
people who had what was then classified normal, and then a large step increase in people who were

1129
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,960
considered high normal or even early stage hypertension. And so, but this was all

1130
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,280
observational. It wasn't, you know, there was, it was, it was not a prospective study. So the NIH

1131
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:24,720
designed a study to prospectively evaluate whether treating people to these two different goals,

1132
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:32,480
and these were aspirational goals, whether that resulted in a change in outcomes. And so

1133
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:37,280
they randomized these people, again, the doctors were given leeway as to which agents to use,

1134
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,800
and you can look through the supplemental tables and see which ones were used, but

1135
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:43,920
there was really nothing, at least to my recollection, there was nothing about the

1136
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:50,960
different agents that was that meaningful. Clearly, people got to the two goals that they were

1137
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,160
assigned to randomly. It was obviously not blinded because you couldn't be blind to your blood

1138
01:49:56,160 --> 01:50:01,040
pressure. But they got to the two goals. So the people assigned to the more aggressive 120 over

1139
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:08,560
80 got to like 123 or whatever it was, 82. And the people into that 140 over 90 were more like 137.

1140
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,480
You can look at the curves in the New England Journal paper, and they separated.

1141
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,160
Yeah, it was 121 versus 136.

1142
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:20,160
It was something like that, but it was a significant difference. And obviously,

1143
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,640
the amount of medication usage was much higher in the people who were assigned to that more

1144
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:28,320
aggressive arm. And there are some questions there was, well, is it a benefit of the medicines,

1145
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,920
or was it a benefit of the blood pressure? Look, I mean, we can ask all these questions

1146
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:37,600
forever and ever. But the reality is this was a really striking difference such that the NIH

1147
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:44,320
stopped the trial early because of benefit in that lower group. And I think it was one of the

1148
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:49,760
most important and practice changing trials that we've had. I don't think that it came without

1149
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:58,400
some cost risk. It would be silly to just completely dismiss this. There were real issues,

1150
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:03,760
right? There was a greater increase in the risk of falls and syncope. And I think even in the risk

1151
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:10,080
of significant kidney dysfunction, it was all reversible, but it was all there. And so what we

1152
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,640
took away or what I took away from that trial was, it looks like you get a mortality benefit for

1153
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:20,800
getting closer to 120 over 80. So let's get there if we can without creating one of these problems.

1154
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:25,200
So obviously, if you're falling all over the place because you're dizzy, or if your kidney function

1155
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:29,440
deteriorates because your kidneys aren't getting enough blood flow, or whatever, something else

1156
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,520
bad happens, then we're not going to do that. But we're going to get you as low as we can,

1157
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,400
as close to that target as we can without making a mess.

1158
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:43,120
Yeah. And I think that's sort of why my doc has been relatively unexcited about doing anything in

1159
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:49,360
me is he still remembers a year and a half ago or less than that, just over a year ago, when under

1160
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:56,240
my normal set of relatively low blood pressure, I stood up in the morning, too quickly fell,

1161
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:01,600
face planted, split my head on the table. And that was an occurrence like once,

1162
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:09,280
maybe twice a week, I'd get up and need to sit back down again in the mornings. And so

1163
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:17,520
understandably, his appetite for trying to correct an average blood pressure of 120 over 78

1164
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:23,600
is pretty low. And I'm not keen to take any medication either, clearly.

1165
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:30,240
Well, and there is no doubt in blood pressure, unlike in cholesterol, if we want to go back,

1166
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:37,680
there is a U-shaped curve, right? But too low is definitely bad. And I think your body was telling

1167
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:42,240
you that your blood pressure is probably right about where it ought to be and maybe even a tad

1168
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:47,680
too low. Maybe you're just like a little dehydrated in the morning or have some orthostasis. It sounds

1169
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:51,760
like your doctor made the right decision in you. I don't think there's any evidence that I'm aware

1170
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:57,760
of that treating you to below 120 over 80 is advantageous. No, it was more just my question

1171
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:04,560
was, should we treat such that I never have a reading above 120 over 80? And again, I think

1172
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:10,000
that's probably too aggressive based on these side effects.

1173
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,560
Well, I don't think it's even feasible. I mean, the way you exercise, I would be shocked. There's

1174
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,880
just no way. I would imagine if you wore 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure when you're exercising,

1175
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:23,760
especially doing isometric resistance training, your blood pressure is going to go way out.

1176
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:29,120
Yeah. No, actually, I think that's a great idea. I've wasted a little bit of time in the last

1177
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:35,600
two years looking for new technology to measure blood pressure in a continuous ambulatory way.

1178
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:40,720
And every device I've tried has failed. So I think I just need to bite the bullet and do the old

1179
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:47,840
school low tech way. If some smart engineer out there wants to figure out a great important

1180
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:54,240
thing to work on, this is definitely at or near the top of my list. I would agree.

1181
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:58,800
I haven't been solved. So go for it. It would be great. Right. As you say that there isn't

1182
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,960
really anything now other than the old school old fashioned single manometer just attached to

1183
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:08,880
your arm. So what about the step trial last year? Did that sharpen our thinking at all?

1184
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:14,080
I think it just assuaged any fears that people had that there was something unusual in that

1185
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:20,880
sprint. And of course, there was this concern over the trial being stopped early, which does risk,

1186
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:28,320
you know, does risk what is it? You know, this stuff better than I do, but it does risk the

1187
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:34,240
possibility that the result of spur. Yes. Yeah. So I think step does sort of is a nice confirmation.

1188
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:39,600
Because I think that I think sprint was stopped at like three and a quarter or something, three

1189
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:43,360
and a half. Yeah. Something like that. It was definitely stopped early. And again, that was

1190
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:48,240
because it was pre specified and there was a DSMB and the whole deal. And again, it was an industry

1191
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:54,960
that stopped it. It was the government that stopped it. And because of overwhelming benefit.

1192
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,120
And you know, you could have made the argument to keep going. A lot of people did.

1193
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,320
They felt like this was an important, you could calculate the number of people who are

1194
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:09,760
under treated, and that they could calculate the impact on mortality, even here within the United

1195
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:14,160
States for every day that you didn't get this result out there. And so they made the decision

1196
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:18,320
to go ahead and stop the trial and report the results. And like I said, there were a lot of

1197
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:23,440
reasons people didn't like the trial. Lots. And that's fine. There are lots of reasons that we

1198
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:27,920
can all find fault with a lot of different things we do. Anyone who's done a scientific experiment

1199
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:32,320
knows that there's plenty of people out there to find fault with all of the things that you did or

1200
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:37,760
didn't do correctly. So I think that what I took away from step was that it was a nice confirmation

1201
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,720
that that sprint was probably not spurious that the result of the sprint was real and robust and

1202
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:48,240
repeatable. I think the other thing step had going for it over sprint is it included patients with

1203
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:53,920
type 2 diabetes, which I believe were excluded. So you had a longer trial, you had a more

1204
01:55:53,920 --> 01:56:03,040
representative population. And yeah, again, so I'll tell you, and we can leave this after we're done

1205
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,760
with this, because I want to make sure you have some time to talk about the metabolic stuff. But

1206
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:13,520
do you have any thoughts on the specifics of various agents? So you have these two really

1207
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:21,360
good trials that were largely drug agnostic. Yeah. And yet I still, when I'm hanging out at

1208
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:25,840
the bars at night talking to, no, I'm kidding. This is not bar discussion. I was going to say that.

1209
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:36,640
You hear this little bit of ARB versus ACE versus calcium channel blocker. And basically the question

1210
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:42,160
is independent of the effect on blood pressure. So if you have two agents, an ACE inhibitor

1211
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:47,280
or an angiotensin receptor blocker, for example, or throw in a calcium channel blocker that can

1212
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:54,560
equally lower blood pressure so that they can get everybody down to 120 over 80 and they can,

1213
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:58,960
the symptoms and side effects become non-issue. And each of those will have a slightly different

1214
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:06,640
set of symptoms we know. Do we have one reason to prefer one over the other, for example,

1215
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:14,400
when it comes to renal protection? Okay. So my first answer is because of the conversation we

1216
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,840
had earlier about the sort of lack of awareness and lack of treatment and lack of control of blood

1217
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:22,160
pressure. My first advice to people is get the blood pressure control. And that's what I tell

1218
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:25,120
patients, right? That let's just get the blood pressure control. And then if we want to try to

1219
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:31,760
optimize and find out what the right combination of things is for you, given your other circumstances,

1220
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:38,720
the NIH used to use this term, extenuating or special circumstances. For example, if somebody

1221
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:42,880
had angina, even though beta blockers were no longer first line for true in the primary

1222
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:47,760
hypertension, if you had angina, you'd have, you'd include the use of a beta blocker in that

1223
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:53,040
hypertensive regimen. It was really an anti-anginal, but it lowers blood pressure. So I think the first

1224
01:57:53,040 --> 01:58:01,360
step is just get to goal. I do tend to do things differently in some contexts. So age to me has a

1225
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:08,640
big deal in both directions, right? Young people don't like taking diuretics. And in old people,

1226
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:12,960
diuretics can be a little bit more challenging, right? So there are more electrolyte abnormalities.

1227
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:18,480
I see a much greater incidence of hyponatremia and other electrolyte problems. And of course,

1228
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:26,720
the kidney issue, right, is there too. So while I think if I had to pick my favorite agent,

1229
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:32,560
that I think probably among the three classes is the best at managing sort of all comers of

1230
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:39,120
high blood pressure, it would be chlorthalidin or thiazidyridic. I don't use it as much just because

1231
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:48,160
it's harder to use. I think amlodipine is a great drug because it's the easiest to use.

1232
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:51,840
It doesn't require any monitoring, right? You don't have to monitor electrolytes, you don't have

1233
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:57,840
to monitor kidney function. It's a benign drug, super easy, very few side effects other than

1234
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:08,160
a not super infrequent amount of what's considered to be swelling in the ankles. It's not really

1235
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:12,000
edema, but it's the sort of non-edema ankle swelling that people just don't like, especially

1236
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:20,960
women don't like having. So aside from that, it's a very easy drug. For ACE inhibitors or ARBs,

1237
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,240
I mostly don't make the distinction between the two. I probably should, but I don't. There are

1238
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:34,400
data, I think that do suggest that those drugs may be more indicated in certain subpopulations.

1239
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:39,920
So for example, there was the HOPE trial, right, which was, I think, you know, mid 2000s.

1240
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:46,400
And so it suggested there may be a benefit in people that have atherosclerotic coronary disease

1241
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:53,120
to have an ACE inhibitor on board. So maybe in people with, you know, with

1242
01:59:53,120 --> 02:00:00,960
ASCVD or ACVD risk, I'll use that one over the others as a first line. It's also, you know,

1243
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:05,600
there's the whole ARB and aortic diameter thing, right? So people who may have a little

1244
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:12,960
increase, whether you want to call it an aneurysm, but just an increase in aortic size,

1245
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:18,800
that there may be a benefit to ARBs. You can start begin to weave together all these little

1246
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:25,600
things. I like ACE inhibitors and ARBs probably the best. They do require monitoring, right? So

1247
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:31,200
they do require that you get, you know, electrolytes because there can be in some patients, there can

1248
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:37,600
be issues, especially with potassium. And they can impact kidney function. So it's this weird thing

1249
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:44,000
where the benefit to people with kidney disease is high, but then kidney doctors are also very

1250
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:50,560
nervous about the potential kidney toxicity of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. So it's this weird thing.

1251
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:56,560
To answer your question, I think in people with existing kidney disease, that that's probably the

1252
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,760
drug. The other place that I use ACE inhibitors ARB first line is in patients with diabetes,

1253
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,440
because that's been shown to, they've been shown to reduce the progression to diabatic nephropathy.

1254
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,320
Again and again. So I think. So somewhat renal protective again.

1255
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:15,040
Renal protective. Yeah. So I think they are probably the most renal protective beyond just

1256
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:23,360
getting the blood pressure lower, which is not, is still to me primary. Yeah. So really what you're

1257
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:30,880
saying is, look, the first, second, third order term is take that 50% up to 100% in terms of

1258
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,480
effectively lowering blood pressure. And when everybody's at 120 over 80, we can, and we're

1259
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:42,720
doing it without causing ancillary side effects. So that's the third, fourth, fifth order term.

1260
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:52,000
The tail end of this polynomial is the nuance around actual class of drug inside that. Yeah.

1261
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,400
I think that makes a lot of sense. And tolerability. Because I do think,

1262
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:00,160
you know, we probably don't pay enough attention to that. It's probably the biggest reason for

1263
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:04,400
non-compliance. Yeah. I kind of include that in the second bucket, right? Is anything,

1264
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:09,600
whether it be ankle swelling or a dry cough that obviously tends to occur in some people with

1265
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:15,280
ACE inhibitors. Older people who tend to get more orthostatic, right? I'd stay away from that. Again,

1266
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:19,200
staying away from direct for them. Because falls in older people, I mean, you're not old and you're

1267
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:24,480
obviously not at risk for having a significant injury from falling, but it's a huge source of.

1268
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:31,200
Did you see my face after I fell? Well, you had a good story about the bar you were in the night

1269
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:40,560
before. Yeah. No, it's, look, I think falling is an enormous risk for an elderly population. And

1270
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:45,920
it's, I mean, between the head bleed and the femur fracture, I mean, these are devastating

1271
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:51,040
consequences for someone in their eighth decade and beyond. I mean, absolutely life-changing and

1272
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:57,760
sadly often life-ending. Yeah, they are. Yep. Yeah. And I say that with an 81, almost 82-year-old

1273
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:04,560
father who has unfortunately fallen now several times and it's a bad thing.

1274
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:09,280
So let's spend a minute, Ethan, talking about one other thing,

1275
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:13,680
kind of bringing it all the way back full circle in the atherosclerosis world.

1276
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,360
I generally tell my patients that there are four big pillars of risk in ASCVD.

1277
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:30,480
Smoking, hypertension, APO-B and metabolic health. And that last one is kind of squirrely

1278
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:35,200
because, you know, I can't point to one number that tells me like I can point to your APO-B,

1279
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:38,320
I can point to your blood pressure. You're either smoking or you're not smoking.

1280
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:46,480
But here I talk about the sources of fat that exist outside of your subcutaneous,

1281
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:52,560
you know, depose of fat. And I typically talk about five of them, but I know you tend to focus

1282
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,320
on a couple. So I want to double click on those, but just for folks listening, right?

1283
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:04,080
I think the generally accepted principle of this is we as a species, one of our remarkable

1284
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:09,040
advantages in evolution was our ability to store energy. You know, without this capacity,

1285
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:14,800
we wouldn't exist. And so we have this vast network of subcutaneous

1286
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:20,800
adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, that is incredibly adept at storing triacylglycerides.

1287
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,920
And I think what appears very clear is that different people have a different genetic

1288
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:30,400
capacity for how much they can store. So I kind of liken this to a bathtub. Everybody has a

1289
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:37,440
different size bathtub. And the water coming in the bathtub is how much you're eating and the

1290
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:42,640
water leaving through the drain is how much energy you're expending. And if you're accumulating

1291
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:49,840
fat, you are, you know, obviously consuming more than you're expending. But at some point,

1292
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:53,760
you could fill that bathtub up and water can escape the bathtub. And that's when really

1293
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,960
bad stuff happens, right? That's when it gets into, you know, the floorboards, the electrical stuff,

1294
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:04,800
and that's a disaster. And you don't need to get a lot of water out of the tub for really bad things

1295
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:10,960
to happen, right? Ask anybody who's gone through a leaking, a leak in their house. So you can,

1296
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:15,840
you might have a hundred gallons in the bathtub. If two gallons escape in the wrong place,

1297
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:20,080
it can be a disaster. So talk about the places where it escapes. So around the viscera,

1298
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:24,720
within the muscle itself, in the pancreas specifically, which we can talk about maybe

1299
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:31,440
why that's so problematic, pericardial fat. Tell us a little bit about why this is so problematic.

1300
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:37,440
Well, first of all, I'm so incredibly impressed at how you tell that story. Because it's exactly

1301
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,920
how we tell the story. And we learned it from Steve O'Reilly, who I think is the sort of godfather

1302
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:49,120
of this concept. I think we've all appreciated for some time that there's a relationship in terms of

1303
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:56,320
risk and weight, that that's imperfect. And BMI, right, that their BMI is not a great measure of

1304
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:01,120
risk. It is in epidemiology, it is in large populations. We also know that how much fat

1305
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:06,160
you carry. So overall, adiposity is important. But what we've learned really in the past 20 years is

1306
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:11,520
that, as you've said, that it's not so much even how much fat you have, it's where you carry it. And

1307
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:18,000
that we are evolutionarily programmed to store energy in these places around our hips, and our

1308
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:25,520
butt, in our legs, and not as much up here in our bellies, and definitely not in our organs, right,

1309
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:34,880
that's a bad thing. And that has been shown to be a very potent predictor of risk. And that there

1310
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:40,960
are a number of genetic alleles that predispose to both these differences in body composition,

1311
02:06:40,960 --> 02:07:04,040
but also to differences in risk of developing diseases like corn

1312
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:11,720
Why does that so bad? The answer is not one I can give you, but I we started our sort of process and

1313
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:17,320
thinking about this problem, and thinking about extreme the extremes of biology, in particular,

1314
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:22,280
these rare genetic diseases that are called lipodistrophes, where people are born with the

1315
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:29,160
inability to store fat at all in generalized lipodistrophy, or with just an isolated inability

1316
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:34,680
to store fat in the gluteofemoral and subcutaneous regions in the legs. So they have a selective loss

1317
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:42,600
of adipose tissue in their butt and their legs, and therefore a huge overabundance of fat in the

1318
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:46,760
abdomen, the viscera, in the liver, and the pancreas, and the heart, as we talked about.

1319
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:53,320
And those people have tremendous metabolic disease and extraordinary levels of risk, right? I mean,

1320
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:57,800
there's small numbers of people that have rare diseases, and all of these studies are observational,

1321
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:09,480
but there's a beautiful paper from Canada from 20 years ago, showing that people born with these

1322
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:15,720
sort of congenital forms of severe insulin resistance, be it either lipodistrophy or type

1323
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:21,000
A insulin resistance, have astronomical coronary artery disease risk. There are women who are

1324
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,800
having bypass operations in their 30s and 40s, which is basically unheard of. And

1325
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:34,920
you know, in women. So I think the question of why that is remains unanswered. I think there are lots

1326
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:43,880
of different potential hypotheses. You know, I think the role of insulin and its impact on different

1327
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:50,440
organs and tissues and cells is interesting. We don't have an answer yet. What we do know is that

1328
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:57,000
there's this very strong now association between these different shapes, body shapes, right, the

1329
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,600
apple pear thing, and risk of developing these diseases. And so I think if you look at the

1330
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:07,240
epidemiology curves of say coronary disease over the past 30 years, we've done an amazing job of

1331
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:12,120
reducing the risk of coronary artery disease events using all the tools we have at our disposal,

1332
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:17,960
whether that's, you know, blood pressure, smoking cessation, lipid management, etc, etc. Yet, as you

1333
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:22,760
mentioned, at the very beginning, it's still the number one cause of death in the world, and even

1334
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:29,480
in the COVID era. And so it's still a huge problem. The question then to all of us is what

1335
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:35,800
is what is what is what is that? Is that just that we're adequately using the tools we already have?

1336
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:41,240
Or is it that we're missing something else? Or is it a combination? And I guess I would sort of

1337
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:45,960
probably bet that it's some combination of sort of we're just not doing anything.

1338
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:51,160
And I think that's a combination of sort of we're just not doing a good enough job with what we

1339
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:56,840
have. And there's probably something else there. And so that's the focus of sort of what I want to

1340
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:02,040
spend, like I said, the rest of my life thinking about. Yeah, I would agree with you. I think it's

1341
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:08,600
really a combination. I think we start too late and don't go low enough on lipids. We fail to

1342
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:15,560
recognize and don't get enough traction on blood pressure. I mean, I still think nearly 20% of

1343
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:24,440
that is the case. And then I do think that this pillar of poor metabolic health is so improperly

1344
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:31,960
understood. And I don't think we're identifying people at risk because I mean, I think about how

1345
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:36,680
little I know about my own state here. I mean, I have a pretty good sense from any blood test you

1346
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:43,720
can do. I can do a DEXA scan. It tells me how much of that I have. My transaminases are adequate.

1347
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:50,040
I assume and based on last test, no liver fat. But I don't, other than that, it's a real blind

1348
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:57,240
spot. I mean, I don't have the clarity that I would have about my ApoB, for example, or my blood

1349
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:02,120
pressure. And that's I think because we're sort of increasing our very poor resolution of this

1350
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:07,240
problem starting with the most blunt tool of all, which is BMI and then moving to other things.

1351
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:12,440
Even what you just said, I think it still represents probably a very low resolution

1352
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:19,960
image into this, right? Just focusing on that. We know that's bad. But so here's a question right

1353
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:26,200
up. Just a thought experiment is what is, is the problem with that? Is that a defect in the ability

1354
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:29,320
to store fat where it should be stored in the gluteal femoral depot? And is that just a

1355
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:34,600
manifestation of that? Is there something different about that? Is there truly a benefit to having

1356
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:38,280
more fat in the gluteal femoral? So in other words, to your bath of analogy, if you could make

1357
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:42,440
a bigger bath, would you be more metabolically healthy? Well, certainly there's one experiment

1358
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:47,960
that Gerald Shulman did that, you know, obviously it's a contrived experiment, but it would certainly

1359
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:53,880
suggest in the model. So he looked at a mouse model where the mice had profound insulin resistance,

1360
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:59,800
and he would just put more and more subcutaneous fat into those mice, and they got fatter and they

1361
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:05,160
got less insulin resistance. They actually got paradoxically fatter and healthier. So in at least

1362
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:11,080
that intervention, allowing them to get fatter, making them have a bigger bathtub, improved them.

1363
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:16,680
But it's not clear that that's the same thing, right? In other words, that doesn't answer the

1364
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:23,560
question, is that bad simply because it's not in the subcutaneous space? Or is it doing something

1365
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:27,320
fundamentally different? And I think that's where we want to sort of eventually understand, right?

1366
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:33,560
Are there cytokines that are coming out of those cells that are different from the cytokines

1367
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:36,200
coming out of the other cells? And how does that interact with it?

1368
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:40,520
Yeah, I mean, there are all kinds of things that we're learning about the difference in

1369
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:44,200
life, basal lipolytic rate between the two depots. And again, we're just describing these

1370
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:49,240
depots based on what we can see and how we can describe them based on a DEXA scanner and MRI.

1371
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:50,200
I think-

1372
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,880
Right, it's just so low resolution.

1373
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:56,920
It's very low resolution at this time. I think what we can say is that in a patient

1374
02:12:57,400 --> 02:13:02,040
with bipolar dystrophy has an extreme who has normal lipids, right? Not normal triglycerides.

1375
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:07,080
So maybe a modest elevation in APOB, but APOB triglyceride, that those people have

1376
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:11,400
extreme increases in risk independent of their traditional risk factors. We think

1377
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:15,800
that there's a group of people, and I've now, as I've been thinking about this, begun to see

1378
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:19,880
these people all over. And once you see them, you can't not see them. But we think there are group

1379
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:24,920
people here who represent probably some polygenic version of this where there's a relative decrease

1380
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:29,880
in fat in the legs. I can think of patients now who come to my practice who may have a tiny little

1381
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:39,320
pot belly, but their lipids were not that bad and their legs are super skinny and they had a bypass

1382
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:45,400
at 38 or 40 or 41. And the number of people I can think of like that keeps getting bigger and bigger.

1383
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:53,160
And I think what we're going to learn is that gluteofemoral storage capacity is going to be

1384
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:59,160
an important driver of risk in this context. And finding ways to change that, if it's possible,

1385
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:04,680
would be of great benefit. I think it remains to be seen if it can be changed. There is some

1386
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:12,120
very poor evidence, right? If you talk to the plastic surgeons, they've begun to understand

1387
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:17,800
that there are metabolic consequences to taking fat out of places like the legs and the hips

1388
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:22,120
that are very different from taking fat out of the belly. And so I think, again, we're just

1389
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:27,240
getting it sort of something. It's like Jerry's experiment of putting in more subcutaneous fat.

1390
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:32,440
It's just helping to guide us towards this idea that there's something there.

1391
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:35,480
And especially where it's... Oh, go ahead.

1392
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:36,360
No, no, it's fine.

1393
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,360
No, I was just going to say where I think it's really going to be interesting, Ethan, is when you

1394
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:47,320
start to look at this in the much larger and less extreme population of those without lipodystrophy.

1395
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:55,320
So the cases you're describing are profound. But the question is, this is probably also playing a

1396
02:14:55,320 --> 02:15:01,080
very big role in people who aren't the ones showing up for bypass at 38 years old, who don't have the

1397
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:09,880
complete lipodystrophy where they have no ability to store fat on their legs and hips. And so the

1398
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:16,040
question is, are there targeted and directed therapies that can be aimed at the metabolic

1399
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:17,720
tip of that spear?

1400
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:24,920
Well, that's what we're doing. So my answer to you is we think so. We need to do the experiment

1401
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:30,920
to demonstrate that. But using human genetics as a guide, there are a number,

1402
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:40,360
large number of alleles that seem to confer this concordance of changes in both directions. So

1403
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:47,000
for example, people who are born with alleles that confer more gluteal ephemeral. So really,

1404
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,840
what's important is not so much the amount of visceral fat you have in an absolute sensor to

1405
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:56,600
amount of gluteal ephemeral fat. It's really the ratio. It's called in DEXA terms, and maybe on

1406
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:01,160
your DEXA reports, it's called fat mass ratio. And there are different levels that are normal

1407
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:06,120
or abnormal for women and men, but having a high fat mass ratio, meaning having more fat up here

1408
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:13,080
and less fat down here is bad. And there are alleles that confer that, and that they do also

1409
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:18,200
confer a bunch of changes in the other things that we know are bad, including lipid-based biomarkers

1410
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:23,320
and then diseases, like coronary disease.

1411
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:27,800
And how concordant are these alleles? So do you have enough data to look at identical twins

1412
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:34,040
and say that the genes are completely concordant between them and the phenotype?

1413
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:42,200
I don't know of any twin data, but I do know that there are certain of these that are common enough

1414
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:46,040
that you can find heterozygotes and homozygotes, and it looks like there's a dose response.

1415
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:52,360
And again, it's not just one, right? It's not like there's just one of these things. So I do

1416
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:59,080
think there will be targeted therapies, and we'll test one sooner than later. We'll probably begin

1417
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:04,360
by testing it in patients with lipodystrophy. But the hope and expectation is that we'll move

1418
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:09,560
beyond that and to eventually try and target other metabolic-associated diseases in the

1419
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:13,480
ultimate way than most metabolic-associated disease, which is coronary disease.

1420
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:18,600
What percentage of the patients with a phenotypically appreciated lipodystrophy

1421
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:24,440
have an identified set of genes or gene that results in that?

1422
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:31,800
Oh, it's probably on the order of 50%. It's a great question because we don't really look

1423
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:38,520
at the recognition and diagnosis of lipodystrophy as abysmal. And Steve O'Reilly, who at some point

1424
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:42,680
if you ever can convince him to come on, he's one of the most entertaining human beings I've ever

1425
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:49,720
been around, and I love every moment I spend with him. And Reed is banting metal lecture from 2019,

1426
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:55,880
which was just astonishingly brilliant. He gave it at the ADA, which was here in San Francisco

1427
02:17:55,880 --> 02:18:05,960
that year. But Steve will say that the problem is that we don't take our patients' clothes off,

1428
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:11,800
and that if you don't undress your patient, you'll never see it. And actually, we have some patients

1429
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:17,880
with lipodystrophy who are big in the advocacy groups, and they've been incredibly helpful to us.

1430
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:23,480
And they often tell the story that their own personal diagnosis of lipodystrophy happened

1431
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:26,600
by accident because it happened to be a warm summer month and they were wearing a skirt,

1432
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:30,440
and a doctor was able to see that their legs were super skinny and muscular. So I can't

1433
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:34,760
answer your question because we just don't know what the denominator is. There is this

1434
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:42,360
form, so partial lipodystrophy is characterized or classified in how it's been

1435
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:48,680
defined historically, and there's familial partial lipodystrophy 1, 2, 3, 4, and beyond.

1436
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:55,160
FPLD1 doesn't have a monogenic cause. It's by far, in a way, going to be the most common.

1437
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:59,720
But there's not an agreed upon way to make that diagnosis today, which I think is a major problem

1438
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:03,880
and is going to need to be addressed because a doctor, if you talk to an average doctor,

1439
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:07,320
will never have heard of lipodystrophy, would clearly never even be thinking about it. And

1440
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:12,680
I'm saying this having had the experience myself where I probably just never thought about it.

1441
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:17,320
We're conditioned to think that leanness is good. Leanness and muscularity are good. And if you see

1442
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:21,320
leanness and muscularity, if you haven't even see it, it's a good thing. You never would think,

1443
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:27,960
oh, this is a problem. Yeah. I mean, look, to me, this is interesting in that it becomes the index

1444
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:33,080
upon which you can build a far greater set of insights because, again, while I think this

1445
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:42,760
population experiences such an extreme consequence of this, I think I share your belief that this,

1446
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:46,040
even absent a lipodystrophy, this is still a problem.

1447
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:51,800
Yeah. And again, the lipodystrophy patient has a broken bathtub. Of course.

1448
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:59,080
It's not like a normally shaped bathtub. It's a jagged bathtub that is more quick to overflow

1449
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:05,960
because it's simply smaller and therefore they show up much sooner with this problem. And to your

1450
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:10,840
point, if the clinician would simply walk in the bathroom and go, how come that's not an oval? Oh,

1451
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:17,480
I need to be looking harder. And I think that's the expectation is that they represent a very rare

1452
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:23,080
version of what happens when the whole thing goes awry, but that there are going to be

1453
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:27,560
more common versions of this that exist. And it's very similar, I think, to the distinction between

1454
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:33,320
familial hypercholesterolemia and run-of-the-mill hypercholesterolemia. And we've learned a lot from

1455
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:39,400
rare diseases. I think this is a case where we'll learn a lot. In this case, we already have

1456
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:46,680
an abundance of human genetic data that suggests this sort of polygenic version of this thing.

1457
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:53,000
And there'll be some papers coming out soon with collaborators of ours that will show that the

1458
02:20:54,760 --> 02:21:04,360
FMR itself conveys more risk even than smoking status. And that's a pretty amazing finding,

1459
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:09,000
right? That if you have a high FMR, I mean, you have a lot of fat up here and not very much fat

1460
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:14,200
down here, that your risk of significant bad things in the form of coronary disease events

1461
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:18,920
is higher than it would be even if you smoked cigarettes, which is astonishing. And I think

1462
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:27,000
none of us would have believed that. Yeah. And I do like the analogy of FH because FH is also

1463
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:35,560
a very, very heterogeneous wastebasket of genetic things and more than 3,000 different genotypes

1464
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:41,800
that produce this phenotype. But interestingly, at least one of them has now become, I think,

1465
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:46,840
the most powerful drug we have on the market, right? Which is the PCSK9 mutation. So it'll

1466
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:54,760
be interesting to know if how much the genetic insights will also form therapeutic options for

1467
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:59,960
the people that don't have lipodystrophy. Yeah. I think for in this case, at least what I can say

1468
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:05,160
with some confidence is that the rare genetics are probably not going to be as informative.

1469
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:11,640
Certainly not as informative as PCSK9, which is, I think, stands alone in terms of the quality of

1470
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:16,920
its informativeness, both as a rare disease mutation, but also as a common disease variant.

1471
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:24,920
But the genes that underline a common variation in these phenotypes are, I think, going to be very

1472
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:29,000
interesting. And so I think that's where we're focused because the rare disease, the single gene

1473
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:36,040
mutations, one of the most common, the disease underlying FPLD2 is a mutation of lamin A.

1474
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:40,920
I mean, we know that this leads to progeria, leads to cardiomyopathy, leads to muscular

1475
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:46,760
dystrophy, leads to lipodystrophy. It's a complicated mess of a protein that's expressed

1476
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:52,840
in the nuclear laminar. It's hard to kind of imagine that common variation in that gene is going to

1477
02:22:52,840 --> 02:23:02,200
lead to problems. It might, but it's not obvious. Well, Ethan, this has been really interesting.

1478
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:05,560
We've covered a lot of ground. Some of it we repeated from before, but I think it was necessary

1479
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:08,600
both because I just don't think everybody has the capacity to go back and listen, but I also think

1480
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:14,360
we have a couple more years of insight. So thanks again for making time. And for me personally,

1481
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:18,920
this whole getting deeper down the rabbit hole on blood pressure thing, I'm hoping that enough

1482
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:24,200
other people are equally becoming interested in this because I just worry that there are too many

1483
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:30,520
people walking around out there who have no idea what their blood pressure is. And even if they're

1484
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:36,760
just 10 millimeters of mercury above normal, as you pointed out, the consequences are significant.

1485
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:41,400
And again, it's just such an eminently treatable thing. It's a tragedy.

1486
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:49,000
Yeah, it's been that way. This is not a new problem. And I'm glad that you're latched on

1487
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:54,280
because it is one of these, in terms of things that probably are lowest bang for the buck

1488
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:58,680
in public health these days, maybe short of vaccines. This is at the top of the list.

1489
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:03,000
If we could just raise awareness and treat this, because I think we've done a really good job on

1490
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:09,080
the lipids. Excuse me, the lipids, the lipids, what's left over now is probably, it's not awareness.

1491
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:15,240
But blood pressure is one of these funny things. For whatever reason, it's just not sexy. And it's

1492
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:20,280
very hard to convince somebody to do something that doesn't make them feel better. And in some

1493
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:25,000
cases may make them feel worse. And we've known that for a long time. And this is one of these

1494
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:28,680
things where you're trying to get somebody to understand that it's not going to have any

1495
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:35,720
impact on positive impact on them for years, decades. Yeah. All right, Ethan, thanks very much.

1496
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:39,240
Thank you, Peter. I look forward to seeing you. Yeah, I look forward to seeing you in person

1497
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:44,600
someday. Hopefully I'll hook up. Sounds good, man. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Thank you.
