Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,440
today's episode. Welcome back to another COVID-19 episode of the Drive podcast. My guest this week

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,720
is Dr. Paul Conti. Some of you may recognize that name as Paul was a previous guest on the

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,080
show about a year and a half ago when we spoke about mental health, depression, trauma, and a

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,360
number of other things. On this episode, we kind of pick up a little bit of that thread, but obviously

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,800
talk much more specifically through the lens of the anxiety, trauma, uncertainty that many people

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:25,800
are experiencing in the midst of the pandemic, the quarantine itself, the isolation, the uncertainty

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,880
that comes from it both economically, socially, politically, etc. Paul and I go off on a number

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,400
of tangents here that I think, on some level, speak to societal problems, on other levels,

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,000
speak to challenges that we all have at the individual level. So I hope you'll enjoy this

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,400
as a bit of a deviation from the normal flow of information as it pertains to some of the more

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,200
technical aspects of this, which we'll obviously continue to return to. But I found this to be a

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,440
very helpful discussion and frankly the type of discussion that Paul and I will often find ourselves

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,080
having in the midst of situations like this, but hopefully by being able to have this discussion

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,840
and share it with you, some of you may find value in this. So without further delay, please enjoy

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:19,160
my discussion today with Dr. Paul Conti. Hey Paul, thank you so much for making time to talk this

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,280
afternoon. I know you're even busier than you normally are, but I know you appreciate that

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,480
some good can probably come of us setting some time aside to talk. Thank you very much and I so

26
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,640
appreciate you having me back on. It's such an important time and there's so much to think about

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,320
and talk about and thank you for taking the time to have me on. So Paul, before we jump into some

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,320
of the stuff I really wanted to talk about, it's probably worth you sharing with people your own

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,960
experience with what has to be believed as a presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19. You got

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,600
sicker than hell about a month ago, as did one of your children. And as you've described those

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,280
symptoms to me, they are very classic for the diagnosis. And you're no stranger to getting

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,960
the flu and things like that, but tell folks a little bit about what you experienced.

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,480
My wife and my two-year-old both just had malaise, mild symptoms, but my six-year-old,

34
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,920
who were kind of like carbon copies of one another, she had pretty significant symptoms

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,240
by pediatric standards. So I kind of knew it was coming and I had the malaise and just generally

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,800
not feeling good. And that was there for a couple of days. And then I very rapidly got very, very

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,720
sick in a way that felt different than flus or food poisonings or other illnesses felt extremely

38
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,080
hot, alternating with really terrible chills that kind of took over along with an awful headache.

39
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,240
And it's just deep nausea, not like I've experienced before. And interestingly, I wasn't

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,160
congested. It was strange to start to have a feeling of shortness of breath, really having

41
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,920
to catch my breath and start taking deep breaths and to be that sick, but to not have any congestion.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,520
And it was scary. I mean, I remember at one point I was in the shower and I had the water turned up

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,800
high enough to scald me, like it should have been really painful. And I was just shivering and I

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,120
had goosebumps and just things that haven't happened before. And I could really see the lethality

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,040
in someone who has some of the medical comorbidities, I'm fortunate not to have, or is

46
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,120
older. And it was scary. It was scary. Well, I think it also kind of gives you an interesting

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,000
perspective to be able to talk about the stuff I want to talk about with you today. As you know,

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,320
I've been spending the past month trying to figure out how to be useful and that's required more

49
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,040
starts and stops and fits and starts than normal, because there is this feeling of helplessness.

50
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,440
You and I were talking about this earlier, which is like you have this desire to do something,

51
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,920
but at the same time, you feel like you can't really do anything. And there are days when I

52
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,080
just wake up and all I want to do is watch Netflix and play in my simulator and literally have nothing

53
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
to just forget that this is all happening. And then there's days when I wake up and I feel really

54
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,240
motivated and I think, how can I help? And I haven't figured the answer to that. I suspect

55
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,600
doing these podcasts is helpful. The feedback has been great. And I also think that people are

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,560
probably at least as interested, if not more interested in the kind of stuff we're going

57
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,200
to talk about today, as they are on the nuances of this type of RNA virus versus that type of virus

58
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,560
versus this drug and that drug. And while those things matter, I get a very vague sense. There's

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,440
a coming fatigue around the uncertainty of when are the cases going to peak and what all these

60
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,800
things. And there's a little bit more of a sense of, okay, well, what does this mean for me as a

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,240
person? And how have you been sort of struggling with the role that you play as an individual to

62
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,960
your family and then the role that you're trying to play with your patients and then maybe even

63
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,880
thinking more broadly? As I know that you know, and you and I have talked about on your podcast,

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:12,520
I see the world through the lens of trauma. And I think part of what just frustrates me at times to

65
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:21,080
just utter exasperation is I think the predictability of so much that has gone on around us.

66
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,520
And I think we've had an explosion of so much technology, so much increase in capability. And

67
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,800
I think we've made errors as a society in how we're utilizing that technology. And we've really

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:45,560
paved the way, I think, for deeply traumatizing ourselves as a society, as a country, and also

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,720
as species. And I think I'm a psychiatrist and one of the principles that's at times used in

70
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,400
psychotherapy is this idea that everything is as it should be, which does not mean morally right.

71
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,080
It means that the vast majority of things that ail us, I mean, some of them befall us,

72
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,440
but so often there's a predictability that we've gone 19 steps down a 20 step path

73
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,480
and then are surprised when we get to the 20th step. And I think that we have been paving the way

74
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:33,560
for terrible trauma to happen both medically and also socioeconomically. And what so disturbs me is

75
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,200
that as the virus itself recedes in whatever way that ends up happening, we're going to have to

76
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,600
make decisions. And I think that those decisions have tremendous gravity to them. I mean, I try

77
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,600
not to be inclined to hyperbole, but I think that they are as serious as you and I have discussed

78
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,320
in other venues. I mean, is it America passing the torch as really no longer being the world leader

79
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,400
that we have been since the second world war? Are we setting the planet on a reckless course

80
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,040
that we can't recover from? And I think we have to learn from this. And I think where I wring my

81
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:19,080
hands and gnash my teeth is the idea that maybe we won't learn from this. And I'm worried that we

82
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,720
could then sort of traumatize ourselves out of existence. What do we know about how humans

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,880
internalize this type of stress versus other types of stress that are more potentially uniting?

84
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,520
So I know that there's a body of literature that would say, look, pandemics do different things to

85
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,080
the human psyche than most other things like war, terrorist attack, even natural disaster, because

86
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,760
by their very nature, they are isolating. Sebastian Younger has written very eloquently in his book

87
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:02,440
Tribe about how post 9-11 suicide rates actually went down. People united. There was a common enemy

88
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,760
and then there was something we could all do to stand together. But the literature on pandemics

89
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,400
actually doesn't suggest that to be the case. What is your take on these sort of differences in the

90
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,880
psychology and psyche of us when confronted with these different external stresses?

91
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:24,840
I think on the one hand, it creates tremendous feelings of loss of control and tremendous

92
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,800
vulnerability. And it also creates suspicion. We know that viruses are real, but there's still

93
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,480
that part of human beings that we can't see it. We can't just stop it no matter what we're doing.

94
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,640
It can be lurking around invisibly. And those are things really that terrify us, the idea of an

95
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,440
invisible enemy. And we internalize this in a way that is more and more isolating. And I think

96
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,320
historically just makes people very suspicious of one another. I don't know the idea that, hey,

97
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,320
if I meet you on the street, I don't know if you're going to accidentally kill me. And I can't read.

98
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,160
I can't use what I would do to read safety, to read control in order to keep myself safe.

99
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,760
And I think in addition to that, we have a very big added problem, which is that that feeling of

100
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,200
vulnerability, that feeling of loss of control is looking for an enemy. I mean, after 9-11,

101
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,160
whether we ultimately were targeting the right enemy or not, is there was an attack. There was

102
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:34,520
an enemy. And here I am very, very worried that the social structure we have allowed to arise

103
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:43,080
is a social structure that searches for an enemy. And I see the xenophobia, the racism,

104
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,600
that then makes us feel that there's an enemy that actually isn't our enemy. Instead of seeing,

105
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,520
look, this is a human ailment and people who are suffering are suffering in the same way.

106
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,800
I mean, as you and I know as physicians, when you see someone who's really suffering, nothing else

107
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,440
matters. And we're not thinking about like, what's the color of that person's skin? And how much

108
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,680
education or money do they have? Like it makes us all the same. But we lose that perception of

109
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,040
people who are suffering in China, suffering in Iran, suffering in America, suffering in Europe,

110
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:27,720
suffering in Africa and South America. We lose that. And we start to, I fear, further the processes

111
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,840
that are separating us already to such a dangerous degree. Paul, if you could wind back

112
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,080
the clock to January 12th, so the virus has been now identified, the scientists in China have

113
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,360
sequenced it. If you had mind control over world leaders at that moment in time, and you could have

114
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,400
programmed everyone in such a way that there would have been complete cooperation

115
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,240
and borders would have effectively dissolved, not from the standpoint of interstate travel and

116
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,160
things like that, but in terms of nationalism, everyone said, Hey, you know what? We're all in

117
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,400
this together. This thing's going to be a potential disaster. Let's completely share every piece of

118
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,320
information we have. And we're all part of the same country. So whether you're our enemy in Iran

119
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,440
from a political standpoint or not, no, no, no, we're all going to share resources of testing,

120
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,080
of data, of medication, et cetera. Is there any precedent for the world being cooperative and

121
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,400
productive in a manner like that? Because I got to be honest with you. The only thing that comes to

122
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,520
my mind is these goofy sci-fi movies where the aliens come to invade and all of a sudden the

123
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,600
Russians and the Americans are friends because they have to sort of fight the alien. Like,

124
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,520
so outside of goofy sci-fi, is there any reason to believe we even possess the ability

125
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:53,400
for that degree of cooperation? I don't think we do right now. I think we can, but I don't think

126
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:01,880
we do. And this is because it is much, much easier to ally around a common enemy. How long

127
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,080
has the expression, you know, my enemy's enemy is my friend. I mean, that's probably been around

128
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,200
since people develop language in some form or another. It's very easy to identify that is my

129
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,400
enemy. So now you are my friend. Hence the alien invasion. Even you look during the second world

130
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,160
war, nations that had a lot of adversity, there were examples of unification around fighting the

131
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:30,200
common enemy. The problem is what becomes much, much, much harder and requires different elements

132
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:38,200
of the human being's ability to call upon the deeper parts of our brain, the parts that don't

133
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,440
just react with what I think of as traumatic aggression in order to ally around something

134
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,040
that really isn't an enemy. The virus isn't plotting against us. This isn't of intelligence.

135
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:58,600
It's invisible. In order to unite, we have to recognize our shared humanity. And our ability

136
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,640
to, for people to cross borders, our ability to destroy one another with weapons has so far

137
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,160
exceeded our ability to do that. I mean, if you look at the reactions in various countries,

138
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,760
it's been the same reaction. I mean, I think to me, core principles here are the everything is,

139
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,040
is, it should be. If we make decisions one through 19, we're going to end up at decision point 20.

140
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,600
And the other point is how much the middle school playground plays into all of this. Even it was

141
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,080
three, four weeks ago, around maybe three weeks ago, my father, who's in his 80s, his girlfriend,

142
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,400
who's in her 80s, we're going to go out to an event with like 500 people. My response is,

143
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,920
oh my God, stay home. And then he responds, why would I stay home? There are no cases of the

144
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,240
virus in New Jersey where my father lives. Right? Sure. If you don't test people, then you don't

145
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,960
know that there are cases. And I think this is so part of the problem that we've reacted in this,

146
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,480
hey, not, I don't have the cooties. It's not mine. It's a middle school playground reaction.

147
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,960
And when you combine that with how easy it is to just blame somebody, it's someone else's fault.

148
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,680
And that we've, I think socialized ourselves through how media in general, let alone the

149
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,960
subcomponent of media, that social media has grown up around us to self-indulge to that appeal.

150
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,080
It's not me, it's somebody else's fault. Somebody's my enemy. Can't land here. And then it's a

151
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,720
combination of misguided aggression and sticking our heads in the sand. And then

152
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,400
look where this leads us. I mean, the scenario that you cited shouldn't have to be science fiction.

153
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,760
We should be able to collaborate in ways that recognize common threats to us, but we don't

154
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,920
do that. We so quickly devolve into the first part of what we were talking about, which is,

155
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,720
I feel insecure, I feel vulnerable, are you my enemy? And I certainly don't want you to think

156
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,960
that there's something wrong with me. Maybe you'll think I'm your enemy. And then we all put our

157
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:11,960
heads in the sand and look what happens down the road. It's so clear how preventable this was,

158
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:21,480
and also how inevitable it was given that we did not set the groundwork in place to prevent

159
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,960
something like this. So you've been very busy, obviously, in the last month. You're as busy as

160
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:35,240
I am, if not more busy generally. But my guess is that the people you help have found themselves

161
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,320
relying on you perhaps even more than normal. Is that a fair assumption?

162
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,400
In some ways, I mean, it's been interesting. That has been the case for some people.

163
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,960
For other people, there is some sense of safety in sort of hunkering down at home,

164
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,320
and that idea of circling the wagons. So it's interesting how much it has really dichotomized

165
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:10,120
in that way. And also, what I'm not seeing nearly as much of are the people who were so at risk

166
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:18,360
socioeconomically before this. A lot of what I do, I'm the medical director at a place that

167
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,200
provides drug and alcohol treatment for mostly an indigent population. That's part of the work I do,

168
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,840
and the other part tends to be with people with more resources. What I'm not seeing is the gigantic,

169
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:39,560
and I mean gigantic swath of most of the country that were on a socio-economic precipice before

170
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:45,800
this. So then not only do they have the medical risk, the fears that I do think are pervasive and

171
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,520
are perhaps temporarily soothed by holding up at home, but they're not soothed by holding up at

172
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:00,760
home if you don't know what you're coming out to. We've known for a long time that the specific

173
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,800
numbers vary by study, but the idea that like half the population in this country couldn't survive

174
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:15,240
and move forward from $500 unexpected cost or a $500 shortfall. So on the one hand, we've talked

175
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,800
about, oh, look how great the economy is doing because employment rates are high. But so many

176
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:26,840
people are living either in desperation or one step away from desperation. And I think what we

177
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,360
are doing is yes, a lot of people are traumatized, absolutely, but that gigantic swath of the

178
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,720
population that is most of us are traumatized disproportionately because they don't know what

179
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,960
they're emerging to because we've set up a system that has essentially made that inevitable. I mean,

180
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,600
how long was it going to be if half or more of the population can't survive through a $500 need or

181
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,600
$500 shortfall? Something is going to trigger that, and it's not a surprise that something triggers it

182
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,240
en masse. And I think that's where this is a gigantic medical problem. It is a social problem.

183
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,880
It is an economic problem. When you add those things together, those things synergize and it

184
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:23,000
becomes a societally threatening medical socioeconomic problem. And we haven't had that before.

185
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,080
So let's take both extremes of the types of patients that you're most working with,

186
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,720
most commonly working with. In the first group you said is the indigent population who

187
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,800
you're helping with substance abuse, presumably many other medical and psychiatric problems that

188
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,880
accompany those. How is that population doing in the presence of what's happened in the past

189
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:54,040
four to six weeks? I think it's added desperation on top of desperation, which is obviously not a

190
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:01,160
good thing. It's an element of the population that I think in large part we've left behind.

191
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,480
Because I see the world through the lens of trauma, I see part of my reason for existing

192
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,680
in fighting the shame that's created by trauma. But there are ways in which shame is called for.

193
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,920
And I think as a society, there are things that we really should feel ashamed of. The ways we don't

194
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,360
give people chances to get back on their feet. And then we have a populace that's... There's

195
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:31,080
so much desperation in that part of the population that yes, this makes things worse, but it's not a

196
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,200
change in how a lot of people in that situation are living day-to-day life. And I think that's

197
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,280
lamentable. Which is a sad statement. Yeah, it's a terrible thing to say, but that's even in the 20

198
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,760
years or so that I've been doing this, which is it's not a gigantic amount of time, it's not a

199
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,960
small amount of time. But the change has been dramatic where there is a part of the population

200
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,040
that we just leave behind. They need more resources than we're willing to put towards them. So we

201
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,520
check a few boxes and we say we're doing things that we're not really doing as a society. And

202
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,040
we've written people off en masse. Now that is not true of everyone. And there are people who,

203
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:19,160
of course, work so hard and so selflessly to help other people. But as a society, we've decided

204
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:26,120
that it's okay if you can't navigate complex systems or if a couple of bad things happen,

205
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,240
either things happen to you or you make bad choices, that as a society, I don't think it's

206
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,680
subtle that we've written people off that way. And then what about the patient population you

207
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,480
take care of for whom the economic stress of this is not nearly as it is for perhaps the majority

208
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,480
of people, but who still have their own demons, their own neuroses, their own stresses. What are

209
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:57,080
you seeing that is unique to this environment that is maybe either similar to or even distinct from

210
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:05,320
other things that you have been in the capacity of being a therapist, for example, during the

211
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,480
economic catastrophe of 2008, 2009, again, post 9-11, any other sort of external stressor,

212
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,040
how does this stack up and what is it that you see that's maybe unique about it?

213
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:28,120
I think I've never seen something that just supercharges this idea that if I fear enough,

214
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:37,720
then I'll be safe, which I believe is an impact of the insecurity that many, many people, if not

215
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:46,520
certainly most people I encounter, I believe feel about the world. This idea that our biological

216
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,640
drive to recognize threats so that we can stay alive and pass on our genes has in so many people

217
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,280
mutated to where we're essentially living in a state of constant hypervigilant discomfort.

218
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:07,240
There's always something else to do. It's never enough for us to be safe and secure. I think

219
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:16,040
the society is always telling us that. The news has mutated from providing news to grasping

220
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,360
people's attention, grabbing people's attention in a way that says, look at that news again,

221
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,560
because you're going to see something else bad. All the anecdotes of he got up at nine and felt

222
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:34,120
healthy and by noon was in the intensive care unit. We know this. We don't need to be assailed

223
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,800
every moment by every threat to us. We have become prisoners of the insecurity that we have

224
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,760
generated. I think that comes through these biological drives that have led us to a place

225
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,160
that is no longer keeping us safe. If you think of the biological drives and psychological drives

226
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,640
to increase our safety by participating in social systems and economic systems,

227
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:09,800
a lot of that has mutated into strivings that make no individual sense within systems that make no

228
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,560
group sense. People that are working and working and putting money away for retirement, but the

229
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,560
vehicles that they're in aren't safe vehicles anymore. We've created so much insecurity

230
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,920
that it affects people even who say have enough economic means, but still have this pervasive

231
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,640
feeling that there's always, always, always something to fear. Then this idea that if I fear

232
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,200
enough, I'll be safe, then starts to spiral out of control and people get obsessive and people get

233
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,240
ruminative. The negative thoughts go over and over and over. What if something happened to my

234
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,120
kids and like, okay, what if we all get sick or what if we don't get sick, but there's a terrorist

235
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:59,240
attack or what if, what if, what if, what if, and become so pervasive that what's fascinating to me

236
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,080
is that I don't see peace in any demographic. Does it matter if people have tremendous amounts

237
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,760
of money or have no money? I just don't see peace anywhere. I think I am trying to scientifically

238
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,280
ascertain for it. I mean, I'm trying to listen to people, talk to people, learn what's going on

239
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:25,800
inside of them. What is uniting us is this pervasive insecurity and then these parts of

240
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:33,080
our brain that want to keep us safe go into overdrive and inadvertently make us feel so much more vulnerable.

241
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,960
What do you think is actually happening from a neurobiology standpoint? I mean,

242
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,600
we're now over a month into our quarantine here and spoken about this on the podcast before. I'm

243
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,640
pretty fortunate there are people who are quarantining inside tiny apartments and they

244
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,960
don't have the luxury of being able to go outside in their yard and things like that. So I want to be

245
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,680
clear that I'm not for a second lamenting the quarantine I'm in because I feel really, really

246
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,440
lucky. But I can't for the life of me understand the degree of irritability that I've experienced

247
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,560
over the past month. And I've done a little bit of a better job in the past few weeks, at least not

248
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:17,400
lashing out. But there's no denying internally a feeling that I have that is, well, frankly,

249
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't know how to explain it. I'll tell you because I mean, it's so frequent, I can tell you

250
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:28,040
how I felt this morning. So this morning I was, I was exercising. So I'm lucky to have a gym at

251
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,040
home so I can exercise. And again, intellectually, it's not lost on me. What a privilege. Like, I

252
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,760
think of all the people who can't go to the gym now and their best thing they can do is pushups

253
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,960
and sit ups in their apartments. So intellectually I get that, right? But I'm sitting there thinking,

254
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,920
I don't really feel like doing this. And frankly, if this quarantine ended tomorrow,

255
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,280
I don't feel like going anywhere. There's this weird feeling of, I don't know what I want,

256
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,640
but I don't want this. I have a lack of interest in anything. But of course, I'm as busy as I've

257
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,480
ever been. So there's this very difficult feeling of every minute I'm moving, I'm hustling. I mean,

258
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,000
even my exercise is scheduled and between calls and this thing, the other thing. But if you told

259
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,840
me, Hey, I could wave a magic wand and make the coronavirus go away tomorrow and everything would

260
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,960
be back to normal. I didn't even have a sense of joy over that. I was just like, Oh, well, what

261
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,440
would I do? I don't know how to describe this Paul. I'm sure there's a word for this sort of

262
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,560
overall just lack of interest in life. Maybe that's too broad a way to explain it, but

263
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:43,000
it's this really weird oscillating feeling of sadness and irritability and almost wishing I

264
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,920
could just escape something, but not sure what I want to escape. Does any of that make sense?

265
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,840
Absolutely. And then I am finding there are more people who are escaping drugs and alcohol and

266
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,200
other really unhealthy things through that sense of desperation. And I think what you are describing

267
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,840
is demoralization. And you could tell me if this resonates with you. You and I haven't talked about

268
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,680
this before. So you tell me if this resonates that, that I think somewhere in there is a sense of

269
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,840
futility that says, if you look on two different levels, one on a personal level, you've worked

270
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:25,240
very, very hard to better yourself, better your situation in the world, take care of your family.

271
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,240
And there's something that speaks to, okay, there's a roof over our heads and we're sheltered here,

272
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,200
but have I succeeded in doing that? Or have those efforts been futile because I can't

273
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,520
protect the people around me. I can't make things okay. That my personal efforts to make life okay,

274
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,760
have come to naught. I mean, obviously not saying these things are true, but this is what goes on

275
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:52,840
inside of us because you feel that, okay, you can shelter everybody for now, but what does it say

276
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,480
about the world around us? And what does it say about the next threat that maybe you won't be able

277
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,320
to shelter from? That's one aspect of how we become demoralized. The idea that, hey, no matter what you

278
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,880
do and how hard you work, you can't make a difference because you can be vulnerable anyway.

279
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,480
And I think it brings that home to a lot of us because I think, I'm not saying that we should

280
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,880
be demoralized, but I'm saying I believe there's truth to that because I think the world around us,

281
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,840
the world around us leads to that. Everything as it should be says the world is such that we're not

282
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,560
safe. On the other hand, there are things that you've done on a broader level that are about

283
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,880
trying to contribute to the world in a bigger way around you.

284
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,840
I think what you said is incredibly spot on. And of course, that's part of what makes you who you

285
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,680
are is your ability to sort of see things I would never see. I've never thought of this as being

286
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,960
demoralized, but I think you're absolutely right. And I think you're right that I'm not alone.

287
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,200
I suspect people in 2008, 2009 were demoralized for a different reason, which is if you're that

288
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,680
person who did everything right and found themselves on the wrong side of a mortgage

289
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,000
because the value of their home came crashing down and they were not sophisticated enough to

290
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,160
know that, hey, these types of loans have these hard, nasty resets on interest rates, etc, etc.

291
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,040
You could very easily say, hey, I did everything right. And look what happened, right? And now,

292
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:32,600
I think you're seeing that same thing all over again, but with far less economic stratification.

293
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:39,480
The economic stratification plays probably a broader role in your resilience to this,

294
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:46,360
but it probably doesn't play as much of a role in what you just described, which is whether you're

295
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,800
the wealthiest person in the world or the least wealthy person in the world, there's still sort

296
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,920
of a view that you should live in a world where you have some ability to control your health

297
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:05,480
if you do the right thing. If you take care of yourself, if you eat, sleep correctly, exercise

298
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,600
correctly, you shouldn't be afraid for your life. And I'm not saying that that fear is rational,

299
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,120
by the way, because as we've discussed, the majority of healthy people who get this virus

300
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,360
are going to be totally fine, but there is a degree of fear that says that that might not be true.

301
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,240
I think that's right. And that's where I'm sort of fond of saying it's the soup that we're all

302
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,240
swimming in. And I think that's the commonality, wealth status, social standing, those things

303
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,680
don't matter when we're swimming around in the same soup. And neither you nor I, we're not

304
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,320
political animals and we don't have political discussions in that way. And this isn't about

305
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:51,640
politics. I mean, I'm a believer that many things in the world are driven by strong individual

306
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,880
people, good, bad, or otherwise. But I do believe that that's not always the case. There are cases

307
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:04,200
when social forces evolve and then they produce something that's going to be a certain way,

308
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,240
regardless of the specifics about it. So this isn't Republican, Democrat, like it's so far from that.

309
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,080
But the idea that the importance of expertise actually has become less and less and less and

310
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,760
less important because everybody can have an opinion and can just yell that opinion louder.

311
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,640
And then what we get is an erosion of expertise, which isn't so much mattering. What does somebody

312
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,400
know or not know? Because well, everybody's got an opinion. And I think we've seen that evolve.

313
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:42,440
And my thesis is that the inevitable outcome where the basics that we think of about the state

314
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,160
around us, the government, keeping us safe, it just isn't true. And we do expect that. We live

315
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,680
in this society. We participate in it. We vote, we pay taxes. I expect that if I'm driving down

316
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:01,800
the highway, there's not going to be like 20 foot long hole that's 20 foot deep that my car falls in.

317
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,760
Like I expect that's not going to happen, but that's not the only expectations we have. We

318
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,800
expect that there's something going on that's providing us with some sense of protection,

319
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:21,080
that there's some force to the world around us, that everything isn't just based upon opinions

320
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,280
and opinions that then justify whatever the person expressing them wants to justify.

321
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,760
And I think what we're seeing here is like truly that the emperor has no clothes. And again,

322
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,440
I'm not speaking. This is not me trying to be political about the president. I mean like the

323
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,280
emperor of the society we live in, it's not adorned with the splendor that we think will protect us.

324
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:50,280
There's a truth here that there can be hurricanes that devastate individual places and people don't

325
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,640
come to help. I mean, some people go to help, but not in a way that says, look, let's make sure that

326
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,280
this doesn't devolve into complete lawlessness. Like we've been able to pull that off in focal

327
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:08,680
settings. How are we going to pull that off on a national setting where there has to be acumen and

328
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:14,920
resolve to decide what tests should we deploy to have the willpower to deploy? I mean, it's not that

329
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:21,720
long ago where people were still saying, oh, some person somewhere in this place had the coronavirus.

330
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,600
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. And we look at that person had it. We now know this by half a million people

331
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,040
who have it. There's a seduction of like, let's look at that person and look at that bad thing.

332
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,080
And then we can posit that we're other than that. And the truth is that that never made any sense.

333
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,120
That never made any sense. That example you gave where everybody's cooperating,

334
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,760
we would identify who's been exposed, know who those people are, test those people,

335
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,520
protect their contacts. We could have done so much better containment, but instead,

336
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,560
there really hasn't been that much going on to protect us. And I think this lays that bear

337
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,840
in the way that the hurricane showed us in a focal way, but it's not just about health. I think it's

338
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,800
about socioeconomic risk. Paul, I want to shift gears for a minute and talk a little bit about

339
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,680
healthcare workers. I don't know how much time you've spent thinking about that in this setting

340
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:25,560
but do you have any thoughts about sort of the lingering effects of this on that population,

341
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,640
which has a couple of things working against it. One, they're on the front line. So while

342
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,800
people like you and I have the luxury of working remotely with people we care about during a time

343
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,760
like this, they don't. The doctors and nurses that take care of these patients don't get to do so

344
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,840
remotely. So now they're at this increased physical risk and there's still some evidence

345
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,920
to suggest that the risk that they face is even greater just based on potentially the viral loads

346
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,240
they're encountering and things like that. So this is real risk. Secondly, you have the sort of

347
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:09,640
the morale insult that comes with seeing their own colleagues also become patients. So when they

348
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,160
start to have to care for each other, do you have any thoughts about sort of the PTSD that

349
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,520
comes to this population in the months that follow this or in potentially even longer?

350
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:28,120
I think it's going to be so pervasive. I think the trauma is going to be pervasive

351
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,520
and even generational. I think that family members, children of people in that situation

352
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:42,200
will be affected by it and potentially deeply affected by it going forward. I think we are

353
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,520
facing the, what I think of as the appalling consequences of compounded ignorance. I mean,

354
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,120
look at what we have done in our health system. Like you and I have both been in it in a whole

355
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:01,800
bunch of different ways. And I think people in it can see how little it makes sense that we're

356
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:09,320
trying to run our healthcare system in a way that is sort of pushing people to the limits and

357
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:16,520
extracting profit and reducing costs wherever possible. And then ultimately everything is

358
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:25,320
running in a way that stretches people to the limit, stretches people to the limit. And how

359
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,120
much have we seen of that in anyone, doctors, nurses, social workers, respiratory therapists?

360
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:40,200
I mean, everybody is pushed to the limit in systems that have in a sense abdicated their intelligence.

361
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,320
They're not being run with intelligence. They're being run by rules that no one is looking at,

362
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:51,240
whether they make sense or whether they keep people safe or whether they make the people who

363
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:57,880
are doing the work in that system feel so disempowered and so devalued. How many times have

364
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,760
we heard, I mean, you must, I guess you can hear this the way I do of healthcare workers, just

365
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,400
talk about the feeling of their own expendability. They're working in a system that doesn't

366
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,520
know them, care about them, value them. And again, I'm not trying to criticize individual people.

367
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,840
There's so many people trying to do their best, but we've allowed the systems evolve into this

368
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,320
compounded ignorance where we can't take care of the people who are supposed to take care of us.

369
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,400
And they know that. And they've known that for a long time. And they're seeing it come

370
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:40,120
to the forefront. So what's a path forward, either in the scenario where this just lingers on longer

371
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:46,920
than any of us would like to imagine, or where it becomes sort of a vacillating, ebbing,

372
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,240
flowing pandemic, or even under the scenario where, look, six months from now, everything is

373
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,880
back to normal. This virus is squarely in the rear view mirror. We have effective treatments and

374
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:07,560
the healthcare system is back on its feet. In either situation, how would you think about

375
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:15,480
managing the long-term toxicity of this? Because especially if it's sort of smoldering, but not

376
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,400
resolved. I mean that from a psychological trauma perspective. I think the first thing we have to

377
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:29,480
do, which is by no means a given, is acknowledge the trauma. When a person has been through trauma,

378
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,600
there is a strong and reflexive impulse to keep that inside. We don't understand it. We feel ashamed

379
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,960
of it. It's so threatening and we push it down and we need it to be validated. I think we need

380
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:52,600
to validate as a society that we set ourselves up for this. That we set the healthcare systems up

381
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:59,960
to be overwhelmed, to not have the protection mechanisms, the testing that they needed. Now

382
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,760
we need to essentially acknowledge and atone. I don't mean in some way that's atonement in

383
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,600
some abstract way, but we actually need to make things different. I think you would agree, and

384
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:20,680
again you're the master of what data tells us. I think we can look at data and see how we can

385
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,280
and should be doing things better. There's not a tremendous mystery to that. I mean there are

386
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,640
places that are doing it better. There are paradigms that we could utilize more that don't

387
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,920
reduce people to cogs in a system. I think we need to, number one, acknowledge that to the people who

388
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,680
have felt like just things in the system. You can throw away a mask. You can throw away a gown.

389
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,080
Just like you can throw away a person. We have to get out of the interchangeability of employment

390
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,480
in the modern world in healthcare as well. We have to look at what are we doing with our resources.

391
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,920
We have to make it different so people feel like you understand me and what has happened to me.

392
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,120
You are trying to make it better. You being all of us as a society. If we don't do that,

393
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,920
just like with any other trauma, if no one acknowledges it and there's nothing being done

394
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,120
to try and make it better, then it will stay with that person and fester. It will lead to all sorts

395
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,560
of bad outcomes that we'll see years down the road. We'll look in retrospect and we'll see rises in

396
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,400
rates of alcoholism. We'll see rises in rates of domestic violence. We'll see rises in rates of

397
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,280
suicide. We'll see rises in rates of people just giving up and walking away from important things

398
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,520
to them. We'll see all of this. We will see all of this because if we demoralize the population

399
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,080
and we don't rectify that, it's not going to be okay. If somehow it seems to be in six months,

400
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,760
that will be a deceit. It will be tempting to just believe that and go on. But we have to have

401
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,160
the courage of our convictions to know that that's not okay. Is it true that everything is

402
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,320
as it should be? Meaning we let ourselves here. If it's not, let's argue about that and prove

403
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,920
that it's not. If it is, let's look at it and change it. I think it involves people standing up

404
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,920
and saying, look, this needs to change. How do we make the systems better? How do we fine tune this

405
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,160
or that or give this to this population that really suffered? No, it's how do we acknowledge

406
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,920
the need for change? That's the hardest thing to do is not that we're going to make systems better.

407
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,560
We're going to look at systems and we're going to bring change to them.

408
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,120
What does that look like? I mean, I understand what you're saying in the abstract. I don't think

409
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:44,680
I understand what it means. I don't think I know what that looks like five years from now. When

410
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:52,440
this is long forgotten, how does a society from a mental health perspective look if they are going

411
00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:00,280
to be resilient to the next pandemic? So if there's a SARS-CoV-3 that's coming in 2030,

412
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,080
what does a national psyche, what does the mental health of a population need to look like

413
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,600
the year before that hits to do a better job than we might be doing today and to do maybe the best

414
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,680
job that can be done given the circumstances? What has to be true of that population?

415
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:23,400
I think what we need is what I would call an alliance of common sense. I was talking about

416
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,320
this earlier this morning with our friend and colleague, Jim Kochalka, about the ideas of how

417
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:38,680
would we work towards an alliance of common sense where people would say, I can't pretend that

418
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:46,520
something is okay just because it suits my interests, even if I know it is false. I have to

419
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:54,440
first prioritize looking at truth and can we, the people who would do this, which ideally could be

420
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,400
a growing movement led by people with influence and with the ability to say we have to put aside

421
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,240
whatever our wishes might be, whatever our animosities might be, that we actually do have

422
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,680
to treat this like post-9-11 or like the Second World War and say what we need to look at now is

423
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:22,520
truth. What are the failings in our public health system as a planet and also as a nation? They

424
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:30,200
stretch people to the limit. They stretch resources to the limit. When do we pretend

425
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,200
that lies are truth and how can we say that that's okay? Republican, Democrat, or other, who cares?

426
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,640
And again, this gets contentious because as soon as you get political and you can't talk about

427
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,440
change without treading into the political, then there's such bitter and brutal animosity

428
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,400
that it tells all of us. Part of me, I want to have this conversation because I care about the

429
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,320
world. Even if I didn't have children, I would care about the world, I hope. But the fact that

430
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,680
I have children is I want to have this conversation. But there's a part of me that says, hey, put your

431
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:09,240
head down and go back home. Because ultimately, whatever you say is going to make some people

432
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:17,160
really, really angry and people get angry and bitter and vindictive. What we need is something

433
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:24,440
that fights against that, that says we are going to ally around truth in our medical system, in our

434
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:31,080
social systems, in our economic systems. We have to look at this. And if people start

435
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:39,080
allying in that way, then we have all the expertise that we need, social systems, public health,

436
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:45,560
economically, whether it's economic on a local or on an international commerce system. We

437
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:54,040
absolutely have every single bit of expertise we need. What we do not have is an alliance of

438
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:00,600
common sense of people who say, I will stand by that, come hell or high water, I will not give

439
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,160
into lies. I will stand by that, then we can start making the world better. If half the population

440
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,600
can't survive a $500 shortfall, I am not going to pretend that the economy is okay, or that our

441
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,560
social systems are okay. Or if the healthcare choices that people are facing are too complicated

442
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,280
for them to understand, and then people ultimately don't get the care that they need. They show up at

443
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,760
emergency rooms for their primary care, demoralizing the emergency room staff that wants to take care

444
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,720
of people who have emergencies. There's so many thousands and thousands of examples, and we just

445
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:40,360
need people to say it's enough. Do you think that this event is potentially a catalyst for changing

446
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:47,880
the way people think about science and truth? And again, I use those two in the same sentence,

447
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,240
because when you take a step back and think about what the truth means, I think we have to

448
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:59,640
differentiate between personal truths and absolute truths. I think it's true that Formula One is

449
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,160
amazing, but I also recognize that that's a personal truth. It's shared by you, but it's not

450
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,320
necessarily shared by everybody else, and that's okay. You and I believe it, that doesn't make it

451
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:17,080
true. I believe I are at the incentive is the greatest Formula One driver of all time. Again,

452
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,360
I think that verges on being an absolute truth, but I'll leave it in the category of a personal

453
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:28,200
truth. Yes. But when you start to get into things that are absolute truths, that's really where

454
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:35,160
science comes in. Science is a toolkit that allows us to test hypotheses. It's a methodology that

455
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:43,720
allows us to examine absolute truths. And do you think there's a chance that what we're seeing here

456
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:53,000
could ever be a catalyst for allowing that distinction to be made in broader society?

457
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,200
Because it's not clear to me that it does. I think that for the majority of society,

458
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,680
there's a blurred line between absolute truth and personal truth or relative truth.

459
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,120
Peter, I think you're striking to the heart of the matter because absolute truth operates

460
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,960
through logic systems in our brain. I mean, ultimately, this does relate to brain biology.

461
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:25,160
Absolute truth resonates with logical systems in our brain. Relative truth, personal truth,

462
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,360
resonates with emotional and what's called affective or limbic systems in our brain.

463
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:37,160
When we engage effectively in the world around us, and again, I have a thesis that says we as a

464
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:44,280
society are not engaging effectively because we have lost the distinction between those two

465
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:53,800
that lets us make the personal truth secondary to the absolute truth. So the idea is there's a

466
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,320
strong resonance if I feel something to be true. I mean, there are social issues I feel very

467
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:05,080
strongly about. That resonates with me emotionally because I'm a human being and says,

468
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,880
because I believe that, that makes it true. That's my belief. So that's how I want it to be. So that's

469
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:17,560
true. But then the other systems in my brain say there are absolutes that I want to hold up and

470
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:25,960
against that. And I want to have those absolutes govern my own personal feelings. So I may feel

471
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,760
just as rabidly that Formula One is the greatest sport ever. I want everybody to believe that. And

472
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,120
if I let my emotion run away with me, where do I end up? I end up thinking everybody who doesn't

473
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,080
believe that is an idiot, as opposed to saying, look, I feel that way. But hey, look at all these

474
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,360
other sports. And there are people who really love those other sports. And they see the excitement and

475
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:53,480
the personal strivings that I see in Formula One. So the reflex in us is to elevate the personal

476
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,960
truth, the emotional, to supremacy. And we need to overcome that so that logic wins the day because

477
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,440
logic is not charged the way that emotion is. And I think media, social media, I mean, this is the

478
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:12,600
heart of the matter, have made it very easy to elevate personal truths. You believe A, I believe

479
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,120
B. Instead of having a conversation about it, isn't it just easier? And in some ways, doesn't it feel

480
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,240
better for us each to say the other one's an idiot? And that's that. We're indulging that in a way

481
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,360
that then starts making logic subservient. It makes the absolute truth subservient to the

482
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:36,600
emotions, to the personal truths. And if you look at how change happens, the concept of a dialectic,

483
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,560
where you have something and you have something different from it, right? You have two different

484
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,520
things, and they become something that's different from both of them, I think is where we're at.

485
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,400
This is going to be a catalyst to something. And something on the other side of it, I strongly

486
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,000
believe, is going to look differently than what it looks like now. If it's not after this and things

487
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,880
seem to be back to normal, this will just be one of steps that lead us to things being different.

488
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,120
And one way things could be different is that absolute truths really do go out the window.

489
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:15,080
We very much come back to superstitions, and we're really not that far away from it now.

490
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:22,920
And we could very, very easily get there. Or this will be a catalyst for us writing ourselves

491
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:31,240
and saying, look, we must prioritize logic, whether I like what it says or not. And there,

492
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:37,160
I think, how do we make the catalyst, the resolution of that dialectic, go one way and not the other?

493
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:44,040
We need people to make this, I'm just calling this no magic to the words, but an alliance of

494
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:51,800
common sense that says, hey, if you think A or you feel A and I feel B, that's the word, if you feel A

495
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:59,000
and I feel B, that instead of immediately being at each other's throats, let's stop and look at the

496
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,600
facts. Let's stop and look at logic. Otherwise, I mean, how far, I'm not trying to be overly

497
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,960
dramatic, but look, when the Khmer Rouge took control in Cambodia, one thing they did away with

498
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,240
was doctors. This is very easy to put one person's blood into another. We can teach people to do

499
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,920
that. Okay, what about blood types? You didn't have any doctors or science or hospitals, and then they

500
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,120
just started randomly transfusing people and either making hemorrhages or putting one type of blood

501
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:32,280
into another. I mean, that was an utter human catastrophe there, but there are whiffs of that

502
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,080
going on now. Who cares what the science says about hydroxychloroquine? Try it. I mean, this is

503
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:44,360
emblematic of us leading ourselves away from logic. I don't see how we're not heading towards

504
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,520
destruction. The everything is as it should be tells me, we can't let that happen because it

505
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,560
ends with destruction. There's nowhere else it ends. So we need this alliance of common sense,

506
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,280
of people who will stand up and say, if I disagree with you because I feel differently, I'm going to

507
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,680
look at the logic. And if the logic tells me that what you're saying is right, what I'm saying is

508
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,960
wrong, then damn it, I'm going to go forward with your way of seeing it no matter how I feel.

509
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:16,280
We need more of that. I mean, do you worry, Paul, that we have spent such a scant period of our

510
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:23,000
evolutionary history with any formal language around logic and science? I mean, for all intents

511
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,440
and purposes, it's about one-tenth of one percent of our evolutionary history has operated with even

512
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:37,480
the nomenclature of science, the skill set and the tools for logical thought, the reason that

513
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,320
I think religions exist and the reason that mythology exists and superstitions exist is

514
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:50,840
they became ways to explain things prior to a nomenclature that could describe things. The sun

515
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,320
went up on this side and the sun went down on that side. And before you understand that the

516
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:01,320
earth is spinning around the sun, you have to concoct another explanation. And so we're not

517
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:11,080
hardwired to think critically. Our limbic system has literally billions of years of repetition

518
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,680
and maybe not our limbic system exclusively, but say from amygdala up, right? In other words,

519
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:23,080
the most primitive part of our brains have billions of reps in them. And as you point out,

520
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:29,720
the brainstem, the amygdala, the limbic system are generally driving us now when in reality this

521
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,440
would be the time to have higher cortical functioning take over. But that is such a recent,

522
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:41,000
recent development, not just evolutionarily where maybe for the past 50,000 years we've had those

523
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,560
structures of our brain and I could be off by some magnitude there, but directionally,

524
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,680
but really only about 500 years in terms of formal structure of scientific methodology.

525
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Is this just not even a fair fight? I mean, we're sitting here having this philosophical

526
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:02,040
discussion about logic, but I mean, in times like this, when we recede to our lowest common

527
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:08,040
denominator, how in the world can we expect those systems of logic and science to prevail?

528
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:15,000
So on the one hand, you're speaking to a very powerful truth, which is we are driven to be

529
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:22,840
driven by the limbic system, by emotion. It has always held the upper hand. So it's not a fair

530
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:27,320
fight, but it's a fight we can win. You know what I mean? The odds may be stacked against us,

531
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,440
but we can win that fight as evidenced by the fact that we have evolved in a way that the

532
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,320
scientific method became understood. And then we learned, oh, wait a second, the earth does

533
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,240
revolve around the sun. We can fight that just because the odds are against us. This is because

534
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,880
we're swimming against a strong current. Does it mean that we can't with the right preparation

535
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:52,840
and cooperation successfully swim against that current? What has happened, and I think my

536
00:55:52,840 --> 00:56:01,560
amateur read of the sociological data is that what has happened is our ability to unleash emotion

537
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:10,440
has way outpaced our ability for our logical processes to keep up with that. The explosion

538
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:17,080
of social media, of people being able to communicate with one another so rapidly about what they feel

539
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:25,000
our control mechanisms haven't kept up with that. I mean, the fact that the lead physician in charge

540
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,760
of fighting this virus has to have bodyguards, right? I mean, whether he does or whether it's

541
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,000
been talked about, I don't know. It's part of this anger that that person said something I don't like.

542
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,320
So stone him, right? I mean, these emotional responses are in us. And what we need to do is

543
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:49,080
be adults and not be children. We're being children. And we need to be adults. And we need

544
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,440
to say, look, we need to hone our control mechanisms. But what we're not doing is saying,

545
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:01,560
we can't have systems around us that propagate just how someone feels about something and then

546
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,520
stokes the emotion of everyone else who feels the same way. I don't like this. That person is bad.

547
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:12,040
Like this political opinion, I don't like whatever it is I don't like. That spreads like wildfire.

548
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,920
I think in a way, I don't know if it's happenstance or not, but I think the wildfires that are

549
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:22,920
plaguing us in California and Australia, right? These are far flung events that I think mirror

550
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,160
the wildfires of emotion that go on. And it doesn't matter what's true. People's emotion runs wild.

551
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:34,120
And what we need to do is to step up to the plate and develop greater control mechanisms

552
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:40,360
and look at how do we stop misinformation? How do we establish sources that are arbiters of truth

553
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,680
outside of politics? What's actually true? And we don't have that. We need more of the things

554
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:52,920
that aren't sexy and aren't glamorous. Otherwise, this emotion you're talking about is running

555
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:59,160
wildly ahead of us. And it's going to metaphorically make wildfire that consumes us.

556
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:06,840
And I don't think that's catastrophizing. Do you think part of it is we're also not very well

557
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:14,520
equipped genetically to understand uncertainty? So in what we're talking about of absolute truth

558
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:20,120
versus personal truth, there's another layer of complexity. So if the personal truth is that

559
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,720
formula one is the most exciting thing on the face of the earth, I think most people, if they're

560
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,600
being intellectually honest, can come to an understanding that that's a personal truth, no

561
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:38,200
matter how strongly one feels about it. But let's use the example you've brought up, the example of

562
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:45,000
hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for this. To say that hydroxychloroquine is an effective

563
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,680
treatment for COVID-19 doesn't really fit in either of those categories. It depends on how it's

564
00:58:52,680 --> 00:59:00,440
expressed. It could be expressed as, hey, it's my opinion that looking at the scant data to date,

565
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:09,880
the risk of this is lower than a certain threshold which deems it an effective treatment in someone

566
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:17,960
whose risk is high enough. That level of nuance to something kind of straddles both personal and

567
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:24,440
absolute truth. Another example is climate change. Part of the struggle with climate change is nobody

568
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,760
can really talk about it in terms of probabilities and with error bars. And so you basically get

569
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:37,560
polarized arguments that both sort of have their own flaws. So on the one hand you have people that

570
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,000
just completely deny it, or if they don't deny climate change, they're sort of adamant that man

571
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,120
can play no role in it. And on the other end of the spectrum you have these extreme hyperbolic

572
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:57,240
estimates that might represent a scenario, but not necessarily the most likely scenario, or not

573
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,960
necessarily a complete picture of the plausible scenarios. In other words, again, it comes down

574
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:09,720
to uncertainty and probabilities. And I think that something like this, this experience that we're

575
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:19,400
dealing with, makes it very complicated for our little plebeian brains, our little reptile brains,

576
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,680
to deal with. And I'm struggling with it. And I'm someone who understands probability, and I

577
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:30,040
understand logic, and I understand science, but I have to be honest with you. I am tired of saying

578
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,760
I don't know. And yet it is the only answer I have to give. A hundred times a day I get asked a

579
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:42,040
question, and it can be my daughter saying, dad, when do we get to go out and have dinner? And it

580
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:48,120
can be one of my patients, and he was asking me, let me ask you your opinion, Peter, what do you

581
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:54,360
think is going to be happening in six months? And again, all I can say is I don't know. I can give

582
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,960
you five different scenarios of maybe this, maybe this, maybe this, maybe this, but there is no

583
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:06,600
absolute truth that I can offer that person. So I could give a personal truth, which is this is my

584
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:14,200
opinion, but science rarely proves anything. It's not like mathematics, right? In mathematics,

585
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:21,320
we have proofs, but in science, we just have high degrees of certainty. And again, I just, I worry

586
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:29,160
that this introduces a new layer of complexity to a discussion that already makes it impossible

587
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:36,520
to sort of cope with a lot of signal, a reasonable amount of signal, an extraordinary amount of noise

588
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:44,920
and then a supercharged emotional swamp that dilutes and amplifies the wrong things,

589
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,720
if that makes sense. I'm rambling a little bit. I think my point is I'm generally pessimistic,

590
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,600
Paul, I guess is my point. Yes, Peter, of course, I don't know, right? For sure. But I see it

591
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:05,720
maybe in a more simplistic way. I don't think there's another level on top of it, because I

592
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:15,400
think that I don't know is actually a beautiful answer. If you don't know, what do we really know?

593
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:22,120
Right? So we know so little that admitting that we don't know engenders humility. It engenders

594
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:27,480
the humility that makes us careful. I don't know if a pandemic is coming. Let's look,

595
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:32,440
let's have some preparedness to it. I don't know if this is helpful or not. Let's learn more about

596
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:39,160
it. There's a caution that then leads to alliance. I mean, we started early on talking about how can

597
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:45,400
people, countries, nations, ally. It's through a sense of humility that you know what? I don't

598
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:51,240
know. And I'm not ashamed of not knowing. I mean, think about in medical school, I think part of

599
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,560
the myths of medical education, right? It's like you never say you don't know. I think it's the

600
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:02,200
worst thing ever. I think why would you ever say you know when you don't know, and we're talking

601
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:09,000
about somebody's health. There's a humility in I don't know that leads to collaboration,

602
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,800
that pushes against aggression. It pushes against that middle school playground of,

603
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,960
oh, I don't know. And now I'm ashamed. And it leads towards progress. The other side of that

604
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:27,960
coin is what I see as the hubris that leads people to just declare that they know. And there's a

605
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:34,840
recklessness to that. I mean, I think we're a society of angry, frustrated people and we're

606
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:40,280
getting angrier. We're not going to come out of this with more of that. I mean, people already

607
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,360
were feeling insecure, traumatized by the systems that we live in, the insecurity about it, where my

608
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,560
healthcare is coming from, where people's fear of that $500 that's going to sink them. We're not

609
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:58,680
going to come out of this angrier and the anger is what fuels the emotion. And then it's the emotion

610
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:05,240
that then falls into the political spectrum. So if that's the case, then whether you agree with

611
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:11,000
something or not, it becomes a mechanism of your allegiance. We start to look more like systems

612
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,880
that say, it doesn't matter what's right or wrong, do you agree with me? Because if not, you're bad.

613
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:22,840
And we're doing that all the time. Why is the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine a politically

614
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:28,520
charged question? That's insurmountable then. We need to make it not a politically charged question.

615
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:35,080
There are political issues, taxation rates, social equality, value systems we're deploying. There are

616
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:41,880
lots and lots of political questions, but because we are so angry and I think so traumatized and

617
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,480
desperate as a population, we make everything a political question. And then that adds to that

618
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:53,320
emotion side of things. I think it is just the real truth versus personal truth, logic versus

619
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:59,560
emotion. It is that, but it's become so convoluted because the emotion is so high and it gets attached

620
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:05,720
to things as vehicles for that emotion. And that's what we have to work against. That's where the

621
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:12,200
alliance of common sense would say, look, we have to not be children. We have to be adults and we

622
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:16,520
have to look at what is it that I don't know. And if there are 20 questions and I don't know the

623
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:23,160
answer to any of them, well, at a minimum, I hope that that engenders humility in me and the ability

624
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:28,440
to work together with other people and listen to their opinions. Even if I have a say, if I have a

625
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,400
strong personal opinion about 15 of those questions, but actually there's no logic to know any of the

626
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,800
20 of them, can I find it in myself to have the humility to admit that and to say that and to say

627
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:44,760
that to you and know that you're okay with that. You're not going to humiliate me for it and embarrass

628
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,320
me for it. That's what people are afraid of. You have to know because you have to fight with what

629
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:54,920
you're going to say you know. We need to stop that. And we don't have to be, look, I'm pessimistic too,

630
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,520
but that doesn't mean that I feel hopeless. I am pessimistic, but not nihilistic because I think

631
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:06,600
the wake up call, what this can catalyze is people who are trying to do good things,

632
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:13,480
but may be hesitant to step into what seems like a political arena. I don't mean to run for office.

633
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:20,440
I'm just saying that truth, personal truth versus real truth just has to stand aside from politics.

634
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,560
And our economic system, our social system, these are systems tied in politics. And we have to look

635
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:31,400
at the truth of those systems because they are not serving us well. We have to separate ourselves,

636
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:38,280
our trauma and our anger and our shame and our frustration from what is logical truth or not.

637
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,240
And I think again, I think you and I between us is what I was talking to Jim about this morning.

638
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,800
There are enough people who could step up to this plate, but boy, it's a thing people are

639
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:54,920
least inclined to do because it's a thing that draws the most flack and the most personal animosity.

640
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:00,040
Paul, I want to shift back from the macro to the micro now. You and I have spent a lot of time

641
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,600
over the years talking about something that I think you're better at than I am, but I think

642
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:13,080
we both struggle with what has been your recipe in the past month for self-care? I don't know how you

643
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:18,600
do what you do. I mean, I think, and I don't just mean you, I mean people like you, right? People

644
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:25,960
whose job it is to take on sort of the burden of other people's pain and suffering and then to be

645
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:32,360
able to do it in a manner that's not detached, but rather to be fully involved and invested in

646
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:37,800
whatever crisis, whatever struggle, whatever turmoil that person exists and how you then

647
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:44,200
manage to buffer yourself from that without being detached, take care of yourself so that you can

648
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,520
continue to take care of people, take care of your family. Again, you and I have had endless

649
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:53,800
discussions on the types of things that one can do here. I just wonder if there's something that

650
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,920
you can teach listeners about how you've done that and what can somebody take away from this

651
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,480
when they're feeling going back to where we were a while ago, back to that feeling of sort of

652
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,720
low and morale. I forget how you described it. The way you very aptly described how I was sort

653
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,360
of feeling demoralized, right? Yeah, demoralized. I think is the word you use. Yeah. So let's assume

654
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:21,400
that this quarantine is going to continue in the weeks and even months that follow and people are

655
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:30,040
going to be in their routines that are full of stresses and stressors that they might normally

656
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,480
be able to escape from. And they don't have the luxury of picking up the phone and speaking with

657
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:43,240
you or Jim or some of the other amazing people out there who are really just sort of a godsend

658
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:52,200
to folks who have access to you. Is there something that they can do to ease the suffering? And I mean

659
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:59,000
the suffering in their mind, which is of course the worst kind, I think. I think the answer to that

660
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:09,560
is finding one's way to the lowest common denominator of what matters. And I think if people

661
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,520
are experiencing the truth now that they're say with their family, the realization that

662
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,120
that is what matters the most now. And it's also what's going to matter the most tomorrow.

663
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:30,120
And I'd rather be with my family in a lean to out in the middle of nowhere than any luxurious

664
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:36,520
living situation alone. And part of that realization that I think I can sustain that if

665
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,080
everything else went away, like it probably, I don't know, put some sticks together, give us

666
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:48,280
some shelter, right? Like it gives me a feeling that what matters is care and concern between

667
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:53,080
people being with the people we care about. And look, I'm hearing that from people too. I'm hearing

668
01:09:53,080 --> 01:10:01,480
a lot about the silver lining of this, which is more time with family. I talked to almost nobody

669
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:08,200
who's a purchased anything in the last month other than necessities. I don't care so much that I think

670
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:13,800
matter matters. Doesn't matter. And look, I'm not advocating like I'm not a Luddite or anything.

671
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,280
Let's go back to just living like we did a thousand years ago, or a hundred years ago,

672
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:25,960
or whatever. But it is meaningful to realize that the things I care about most are actually more

673
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,080
immediately accessible to me in the moment. And I think that's still going to be the case tomorrow.

674
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,000
Hopefully everyone's staying safe and we're trying to ensure that that's what most matters. And it's

675
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,840
a good place to start from. I think it engenders practicality. It engenders humility. It engenders

676
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,920
a sense that everything is okay. I've sat at home with my family for a period of time I wouldn't

677
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:54,520
have before. And I have a very strong sense that everything is okay. I sit around with my family

678
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,000
because I have a six year old and a two year old and we blew up six balloons. And we're just throwing

679
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,600
these balloons between the two of us. I mean, and we're happy. And I think we need more of that

680
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,120
because it works against the trauma. There's a realness and a connectedness to that that works

681
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:15,880
against the trauma. Now look, I think we need to change the social systems or we are not going to

682
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,480
change the trauma and things are not going to be okay. If I'm understood your question, you're not

683
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:23,400
saying how do we fix this on an individual level of people in their homes? I think the answer is we

684
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:30,280
don't. But how do we feel better? How do we let ourselves find some peace? I think that is the

685
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:37,080
answer. My daughter who's turning six this coming weekend said to me, she said, Daddy, with you at

686
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:43,960
home more, it's like spring has come but inside of me. And my thought was, oh, I'm not sure what

687
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,440
else really matters. And that doesn't mean I don't want to go to work and do my job. But when I'm

688
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:53,000
talking with people on the phone, I'm looking more through that lens of what else really matters to

689
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,360
that person that I'm talking to than the people that they love. And I think we need more of that.

690
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:02,280
We need to fix our social systems, but we need more of that. And that's something that each of

691
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,000
us can do at home. Because it's really our interpretation of things. Are things not okay,

692
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,600
because I don't know what's going to be like when it boots back up? That's true too. But I don't have

693
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:17,480
to live in that every moment. And I can live in more time with my kids. That's real. And that's

694
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,280
tangible. And that's going to mean something to me this evening and tomorrow. And that can be real

695
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:27,320
for everybody and people who don't get to be with people that they love and that love them. So

696
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,560
thinking of how do we make more of that in our life? The idea that we all need love, and we need

697
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,360
things that are generative, that make where there wasn't before, does not just have to apply to

698
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:42,120
human relationships. It can apply to nurturing a pet or nurturing a garden to making a poem where

699
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:47,640
there wasn't before. It's kind of strange, but our needs are not that complicated. But I'll be damned

700
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,680
if they aren't hard to meet in the system that we've set up around us. We need to change it. We

701
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,080
need to change the systems. But part of how we change the systems is to change how we're looking

702
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:03,400
at them as individual people. What am I valuing? So if I'm hearing what you're saying, it sounds

703
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:10,440
like you think that this sort of attachment to others or connection to others is sort of an

704
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:16,360
antidote to this trauma? Put more broadly, I think the attachment to things that are meaningful.

705
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:22,120
Yeah, yeah, sorry. Not to, yeah. Meaning to other people in relationships that matter to our kids,

706
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:31,160
to our friends, to our spouses. Right, right. Because not for all the money, success, prestige,

707
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:37,000
world mastery. I mean, if you could have all of it, I mean, you wouldn't sacrifice the ability to

708
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,440
be with one of your children. That stuff matters the most to us. And it's also where we generate

709
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:48,680
our own meaning. That's where I don't feel demoralized. That's where I don't feel demoralized.

710
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,760
Because I know that I have meaning to people and people have meaning to me. And then I can find

711
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:00,200
within myself the strength to put one foot in front of the other, keep doing what needs to be

712
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:05,720
done, even though I sure do feel demoralized often. I mean, the reason why I think I can project and

713
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,520
guess how you were feeling is because you and I know each other very, very well. And I'm feeling

714
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,760
the same way that you are. Has whatever I contributed to the world made a difference? Or

715
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,760
whatever I've done for myself and my family made a difference? I mean, the answers to those

716
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:25,640
questions are yes, but we feel that they're no when we're confronted with the state of the world

717
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:30,760
around us. And again, it just brings me back to that something more is called from us. I mean,

718
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,920
there's a little bit of, again, I'm not trying to be political, but when John F. Kennedy said,

719
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,560
like, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. And yes,

720
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,640
he was speaking about difficult things. He wasn't just saying, do more of what you're good at doing

721
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,920
or what's easier for you to do or even think that you're hard for you to do. But you may need to do

722
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:55,000
some things that are very, very difficult. Do you see people having a difficulty reintegrating back

723
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:01,880
into the world when the quarantines lift? Do you see lingering fears? I mean, fears literally of

724
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:08,360
infection, recurrence of pandemic, other forms of phobias that might not even seem

725
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,280
logical or rational. I mean, do we have any insight into what people do after quarantines

726
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:24,040
and what their psyches are left with? This idea that if I am more afraid, I will be safer is going

727
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:33,240
to precedents. We're going to see more anxiety, more obsessiveness, more panic, more agoraphobia,

728
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,080
right? Fear of being outside of the home. We're going to see more and more of that. And we're

729
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:41,400
going to see more of the unhealthy coping mechanisms to that, more drugs and alcohol.

730
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:47,400
We're going to see more of the unintended results of that, like depression and accidents. We're

731
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:53,320
going to see more of all of those things because there's nothing to prove to you that you're not

732
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:59,400
safe, like a period of time in which you were very clearly not safe. And I think if we reintegrate

733
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,080
into the previous lies, then underneath that is the knowledge that this is not okay. It wasn't

734
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:12,440
okay before. So if we're now back to it, it's not okay now either, which is why we need to make

735
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:19,800
change. That ultimately, yes, this is about trauma and how this pandemic is traumatizing us

736
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,200
and how we paved the way for the trauma of it to be so bad. And we need to change that,

737
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:31,720
just like we need to change what traumatizes people individually. If someone has been traumatized

738
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:40,360
individually, someone has been attacked and hurt, and that person knows that there are people around

739
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,680
them that care about that, that care about them, that care about what happened to them,

740
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:51,000
and that are working for change in the systems that allowed the trauma to happen in the first

741
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,640
place, then we help move that person towards healing. And yes, we need to do that for individual

742
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:03,560
people in their trauma treatment. And we need to do that as a society. Otherwise, we will be no

743
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:09,720
more successful as a society than we'll be the individual sufferer from trauma who is trying to

744
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:14,360
deal with that trauma by pretending everything is okay, which is a natural response because we're

745
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,800
afraid of it and we're ashamed of it and we don't know how to deal with it. And there aren't the

746
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,840
systems around us to say, you can come and talk about that and you don't have to be ashamed of it.

747
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:27,400
And you know what? I have that too. Maybe I have a different flavor from you, but I have what you

748
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:33,480
have. And you and I know this. Part of the reason I think we've survived our own traumas is because

749
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:39,080
we have not gone through them alone and we've had them validated and we ourselves have been validated.

750
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:44,440
And then we look to ways to make the world better. And that's part of our demoralization, that it

751
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,080
kind of hasn't had as much of an effect as we might have wanted. So let's start doing something new

752
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:56,280
about it. Because it does not have to be this way. Say rape cultures on college campuses, you know

753
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,160
what? Doesn't have to be that way. And we start making changes. My good is not that we've made

754
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:06,520
the changes we need to, but we start looking at that, looking at what it really is and looking

755
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:11,880
at the lies that said, oh, it's all okay. And people are consenting and everybody who's drinking

756
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:18,600
is de facto giving consent. We look at those lies and we start making change and we start making

757
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,480
less trauma and we start better being able to help the people who have suffered trauma.

758
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:30,520
That is a very real and tangible example that we are going to need to do on an individual basis,

759
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,600
whether it's healthcare workers who are afraid to go back in the hospital or it's people who are

760
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:41,240
afraid to try and go find the next job or it's our society as a whole. We have to change those

761
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,560
things. There's nothing else that makes it better. I think it's worth pointing out for listeners,

762
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,560
you and I have known each other for 25 years. We're pretty much inseparable. In fact, this is

763
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,320
probably the longest we haven't seen each other in person because the last time we were together in

764
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:59,080
person was January. So that's for us, that's an eternity. I think it's worth the listener knowing

765
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:04,760
you and I have never once talked about politics except in the context of history. In other words,

766
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,800
you and I together, we are not the type of people that sit here and wax on about current political

767
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:15,080
affairs. We over a meal, we'll sit here and discuss the Cuban missile crisis ad nauseum.

768
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,480
Talk about Nixon and all these things we love to talk about the history of politics. We're not

769
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:24,360
political people and I think it's important that people who are listening to this don't take this

770
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:29,400
to be a political rant. Everything we've talked about today seems to come down to a common theme,

771
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,840
which is those of us who sit here in the peanut gallery who are not in a position of leadership

772
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:42,760
are going to have to sort of become the movement of change. In other words, it's not enough to just

773
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:47,320
sit around and pontificate about this stuff. We are going to at some point have to do something

774
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:51,720
about it. We're going to have to take some sort of action. It's not going to be enough to just

775
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:58,520
think about this, lament this, talk about this with our friends. That won't change the system.

776
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:03,400
Everything you've talked about from this most recent example, which I think is a great one

777
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:09,480
of sort of date rape culture on college campuses to social support network. I mean,

778
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:16,520
all of these things in the end come down to not just being open about what we think is right and

779
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,360
not right, but it's also taking some sort of action. It is going to come down to that.

780
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,920
I don't know. It's funny. I didn't come into this discussion with any sense of what we were really

781
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,000
going to talk about. I just knew it was going to be something sort of interesting and not sort of

782
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:34,120
how does this drug work versus that drug work. But I don't know that I really thought about it as

783
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:38,840
broadly as you've been thinking about it. It sounds to me like this experience, you've made

784
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:45,800
good use of your time, you're forced exile from the busy travel schedule, and you've thought even

785
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,040
more broadly and deeply about some of these problems that we've thought about and talked

786
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:56,360
about in the past together. But I don't think, I think you've coalesced a broader mission urgency

787
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:02,600
around this. I think so Peter, because I've just felt it. These are not foreign concepts to me,

788
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:08,360
and these are things I have been afraid of, but really seeing it play out, it becomes so compelling.

789
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,480
And you talk that we're all going to have to do things, those of us in the peanut gallery,

790
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:18,200
we're going to have to do things. And it's not just that, we're going to have to do things that

791
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:24,520
are unpalatable. And that's what I've really come to realize. It's like a couple of weeks ago,

792
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:29,000
garbage disposal, it gets kind of clogged. And there's a whole bunch of strategies I have to

793
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,760
try and fix that. I mean, I put a bunch of water down and I've got a butter knife and I'm trying

794
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:38,360
to do things with it. And I'm doing things, but ultimately, what I had to do to make it better

795
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:43,160
was the thing that was unpalatable. I had to stick my hand down there into a bunch of gross stuff

796
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:49,240
and unclog something. And now everything is okay. I have a willingness to do things and you do too,

797
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:55,960
and lots and lots of people do. But what we shy away from is doing the thing that's unpalatable.

798
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:01,640
And the way society has developed, I don't think we can get around the political flavor of this.

799
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:06,760
Because if you want the setup, like if I had my way, there would be committees of people with

800
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,960
expertise that would look into these different areas. But what they have to do is really

801
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:19,240
unpalatable things. Stand against the status quo. Enter into areas, arenas that are politically

802
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:23,960
charged. Enter into minefields, knowing that something unpleasant is going to happen, right?

803
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,680
I'm going to try not to get myself killed doing it, but something unpleasant is going to come of it.

804
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:34,440
And I think those are the things we shy away from. And I have the privilege of knowing and interacting

805
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:39,480
with lots and lots of people who are helping. And God bless that people are helping. But there's

806
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:43,640
a difficult message for all of us here that says, yes, help in the ways that you're built to help

807
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:49,320
uncomfortable helping, but you got to help in the, I'm sick of my hand in the garbage disposal way

808
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:55,560
too. Which is why when Chiaokook calls and talks about this and he starts talking about leadership

809
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:01,320
in ways that come through humility, that come through marshaling people to do unpleasant or

810
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:07,160
unpalatable things to really look at this, it resonates with me in part because like you and I,

811
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:13,800
I mean, he and I have an ongoing dialogue about life, but because I just, I can't not believe

812
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:19,000
that's what's necessary. I try and do thought experiments where I come at a position that's

813
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,560
diametrically opposed to mine. It's different from mine. I feel differently, have a different personal

814
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:29,800
truth. And I can't but come to this conclusion, which obviously doesn't mean that it's right,

815
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:37,400
but I'm using all the due diligence I can inside of myself. And I can't but come to any other

816
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:44,680
conclusion. Well, Paul, on that note, I want to thank you for this discussion today. I look

817
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,480
forward to continuing our discussions over the coming weeks. I rely on them heavily.

818
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:56,040
Thank you so much. As always, Peter, I appreciate your trust in me and my opinions to have me on.

819
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,560
And as always, I deeply appreciate your friendship. Thank you, Peter.

to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less than five

829
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:52,680
minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics,

830
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:57,320
and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

831
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:01,240
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.
