00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480

at PeterAttiaMD.com.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,960
In this podcast, I'll be speaking with my close friend and amazing scientist, David

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Sabatini.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
David's a professor of biology and a member of the Whitehead Institute at MIT.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
He's also an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a senior member of the

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,240
Broad Institute, along with a bunch of other accolades that would take too long to get

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,920
into here.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,720
This podcast was actually recorded initially as part of an interview series I was doing

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
for research around my book.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,960
This was recorded in August of 2017.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,500
Maybe at some point we'll even just put the video up as this was actually done as a video

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,360
interview with David, along with a number of his amazing postdocs.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,800
And certainly some of those will probably make their way into the podcast as well.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,120
Now, in this episode, we talk about his amazing journey in science and the work and stuff

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,520
that he's done around mTOR and Rapa Myson.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,120
If you've been following the blog and or paying attention to stuff that I'm interested

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,120
in, you'll know that mTOR and Rapa Myson sit kind of at the heart of it.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,580
Now, about four years ago, David and I were having lunch one day and it was kind of the

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,200
first time that he ever really told me the full story of his work as a graduate student

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,720
at Hopkins, where he was part of the MD-PhD program.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
And I was just, you know, I remember sitting there taking notes on a napkin and thinking,

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,800
God, this is such an incredible story of science.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,920
And I remember thinking, God, you know, one day we have to have this discussion again,

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,880
but such that most people can actually hear it besides just me.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,520
So part of what we discuss on this podcast is actually that journey and how as a young

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,920
PhD, newbie, grad student, David methodically went after a problem that really wasn't even

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,320
deemed particularly interesting at the time, which was to basically figure out how this

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,200
thing called Rapa Myson actually worked.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,360
And of course, through the process ended up being the first person to identify this

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,400
mechanistic target of Rapa Myson in mammalian cells.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,760
Now stuff that I found really interesting in this podcast is that David points out that

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,720
he's from an academic standpoint, kind of an unusual bird in that he's one of the few

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,000
people who has carried his work from graduate school into his career.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
And that's actually pretty unusual.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
He's incredibly thoughtful.

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,400
And some of you may have already heard a podcast that David, myself and Nav Chandel, another

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,000
good friend who will also be on the podcast recorded back with Tim Ferriss on Easter Island

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,280
back in the fall of 2016.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,400
We'll link to that here as well.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,920
And obviously the reason we went to Easter Island was as sort of a pilgrimage based on

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,200
the discovery of the bacteria that ultimately led to Rapa Myson, a bacteria by the name

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,120
of Streptomyces hydrocophicus.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,480
The interest I have in mTOR of course has to do with its central role in nutrient sensing.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,420
And of course it's, I believe and many believe it's central role in longevity.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,400
So if you are interested in longevity, if you're interested in fasting, if you're interested

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
in Rapa Myson, you're really going to want to listen to this podcast because David is

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
effectively mTOR man.

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,540
I don't think there really is a person on the planet and I'm saying that without trying

59
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,240
to be hyperbolic, but I don't think there's anybody on the planet who knows more about

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,160
Rapa Myson and mTOR than David Sabatini.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,160
And if you like this podcast, please make sure to check out the one that's going to

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,400
be out soon with Matt Caberlin, which will take this discussion to another level as well,

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,360
looking at Matt's work in dogs.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,440
So without further delay, here's my discussion and conversation with David Sabatini.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,920
David, thank you so much for making time to sit down today and talk about what is potentially

66
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,600
mutually our favorite topic of discussion.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,680
Before we jump into it though, maybe for people who don't know you, can you tell us a little

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,800
bit about how you got here and what it is you do specifically?

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Sure, sure.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,720
Thank you, Peter, for coming and for visiting and both of you and for wanting to talk to

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
me.

72
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
So I am a biologist.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm a professor of biology at MIT and I'm also a member of the Whitehead Institute,

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,040
which is where we are today.

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,120
And I receive a lot of funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which is a key charity

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,720
that works for biomedical researchers.

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,920
I have studied this protein that I'm glad you like a lot.

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,600
It's my favorite protein called the mTOR protein, which is the protein through which this drug,

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,000
the lamycin, which gets quite a bit of attention now acts.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
And I basically worked on that from the earliest point.

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,860
We discovered that when I was a student.

82
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,400
And so my career is that as an MD-PhD, never really following the clinical track though

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,760
and staying on the research side and finishing that and actually coming to the Whitehead

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,000
in a program that is quite interesting and very unique at the time, which is you could

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,440
start your own lab after graduate school.

86
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,960
And so I did that and I eventually joined the faculty here.

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
And now I've moved up the academic ranks.

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,860
And to some extent, I'm a little bit strange from an academic point of view because I've

89
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,360
continued to work on, not exclusively, but to a large extent, what I started in my graduate

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
school.

91
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,000
So most people, as you know, do something in graduate school.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,840
They do something in their postdoc and then they sort of morph along the way.

93
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,320
I've kind of stuck with this mTOR protein.

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,360
And in many ways, I was very lucky because we were there at the beginning and it turned

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,280
out to be such an exciting thing to work on.

96
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,360
So let's go back to the beginning a little bit.

97
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,360
You were an MD-PhD student at Hopkins.

98
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,080
And after a couple of years of doing preclinical stuff, you pick a lab.

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Exactly, right.

100
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
So you do two years of medical school and then you pick a lab.

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,240
And I was very fortunate to be taken by Salomon Snyder, who was at the time the head of neuroscience.

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,200
He had a very big lab, lots of MD-PhDs.

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,040
A lot of MD-PhDs wanted to go to his lab.

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,520
And I was lucky that he let me go.

105
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,160
And Sal is a really interesting man.

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,640
He still has actually a really prominent lab at Hopkins.

107
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,480
And the fact that the department is now named after him.

108
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,440
And he was that person who had a lot of varied interests.

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,080
He was a neuroscientist, but he was also a psychiatrist.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,860
And he was also a pharmacologist.

111
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,880
So he really loved small molecules.

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,360
And he loved particularly potent small molecules.

113
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,720
That is, small molecules that act at low doses.

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,160
How do we define in pharmacology a small molecule?

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,640
What's the cutoff point?

116
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,320
I know some people say 1,000 daltons, which rapamycin is about that.

117
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,800
To a larger extent, it's sort of a non-peptide also.

118
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,680
So it's not a piece of a protein.

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,280
In many cases, it's not a natural molecule.

120
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Although in our case, it's made by microinversal.

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not natural to our body.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,520
So probably 1,000 daltons.

123
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,680
And so he had these set of interests.

124
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,360
And when I went to his lab, I was actually really interested in neuroscience.

125
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,920
So I'd had some classes in which I was sort of fascinated by some neuro questions.

126
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,220
But when I got to his lab, I actually never did anything on neuroscience.

127
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,720
And I often told the story that the most influential scientific discussion I probably ever had

128
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
is when I went to talk to Saul.

129
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,700
And basically, as a student, you need to pick a project.

130
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,160
This is something that is quite challenging.

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,400
And I see with my own students, they really get quite apprehensive about their projects.

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,120
So I went to talk to Saul.

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,280
And I went to his office.

134
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,480
And I only met with Saul like, I don't know, maybe five or six times during my PhD.

135
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,560
So this was like a big deal.

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
And so I went to talk to him.

137
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,640
And he basically said, David, we work on the brain.

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,480
And I thought that was great because I wanted to do neuroscience.

139
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,640
But then he didn't say anything else.

140
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,760
So I was it.

141
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,200
And so I remember leaving his office really anxious because basically, I didn't have a

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
project.

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,600
But I realize now in retrospect, what he did is he actually was giving me complete freedom

144
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,500
to do what I wanted to do.

145
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,400
And that was, as I said, probably the most important thing anyone's ever done for me

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,840
because it really forced me to come up with my own project.

147
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,080
And I think was a key sort of foundation in becoming the scientist I have.

148
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,660
And it's something that I try to foster amongst my own people.

149
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,360
So anyways, I was in his lab.

150
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,980
And I didn't have a project.

151
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,160
And at the time, they were actually working with this other drug called FK 506, which

152
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
is a well known.

153
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
It's an immune suppressant.

154
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
It's immune suppressant.

155
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,800
It's used clinically still.

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,640
Mechanism of action, although structurally, it's very different than cyclosporine.

157
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,400
It actually mechanistically works on the same target, which is calcineurin.

158
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,880
And at the time, this is before we had a lot of the tools we have now like RNAI or CRISPR.

159
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
And so we needed controls.

160
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,400
So if you had a drug, what you tended to use was another drug that kind of looked like

161
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,560
it but didn't do the same thing.

162
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,040
And so their control was rapamycin.

163
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:52,280
And when I started reading about rapamycin, this would have been in probably late 91 to

164
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,720
92.

165
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,400
And it was clear to me that this molecule in many ways was much more interesting than

166
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
FK 506.

167
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,000
And as you very well know, this had come from Wyeth Ayers, the pharmaceutical company by

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,240
Soren Segal, who championed it.

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,280
And there was a number of papers, which at the time were actually a few papers were largely

170
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,360
abstracts from meetings that show that it had antifungal effects, immunosuppressive effects,

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,080
anti-cancer effects.

172
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,880
So it seemed like an interesting molecule.

173
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,520
I had just come from medical school.

174
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,080
We'd learned about immunosuppressants like cyclosporine, which at the time, you know,

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
were really just coming on.

176
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,200
And we're really seen as miracle drugs.

177
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Your lab's interest in FK 506 was not its immune suppressive properties, but its calcineurin

178
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,280
because calcineurin, as the name implies, there's a lot of in the brain.

179
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,040
And so in Saul's lab, they're basically studying the modulation of calcineurin in the brain

180
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,800
using FK 506 as a tool.

181
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,440
And they were looking at actually excitotoxicity in the brain.

182
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,920
Things that at the end didn't lead, I think, in the directions they wanted to, but they

183
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,640
were using it as a probe, basically.

184
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,520
And so I basically decided, why not try to work on rapamycin?

185
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,840
And so that's what I did.

186
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
And so we-

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,880
It's just a control that nobody particularly cared for.

188
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, I mean, there were people in the world that were interested in that.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,400
But in your lab, this is a great peripheral project.

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,160
We had this great advantage, though, is that you couldn't buy rapamycin at the time.

191
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,480
So rapamycin was a compound that Wyeth was developing clinically.

192
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
It wasn't clinically available.

193
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,240
You couldn't buy it.

194
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,440
But Saul, being a very prominent scientist and having this interest in pharmacology,

195
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,360
had actually written siren, sigala.

196
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,360
And actually, he had sent us, probably without any of the legalese that happens now.

197
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Now if you try to get a molecule out of a pharmaceutical company, the amount of paperwork

198
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
and red tape is huge.

199
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,320
Basically, it sent us a very significant amount of rapamycin, which I remember when it did

200
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,280
start to be sold, which was incredibly expensive, I kind of back calculated.

201
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
The street value.

202
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Yeah, it was like millions of dollars.

203
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Wow.

204
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
Now, of course, it didn't really have that value.

205
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,160
But theoretically, it was sort of millions of dollars, which incidentally, that tube

206
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,720
followed me all the way here.

207
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
And then- Do you still have the original tube?

208
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,720
No, at some point, it was lost.

209
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
It disappeared at some point.

210
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
But- I'll take eBay.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,000
We actually had it, which was cool.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,220
So we could actually do experiments with it.

213
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,320
And so I went on to try and understand how it worked.

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,640
And eventually, we purified this protein that at the time, we actually called Raft1, was

215
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,920
the original name we gave it.

216
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
And eventually, it was called- And Raft1 stood for-

217
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,400
It was rapamycin and FKBP target1.

218
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,880
And the reason that we, and also Stuart Shriver, who was at Harvard, and when he was working

219
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,520
on this, he was also at Harvard, also identified mTOR, basically, at the same time.

220
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,860
And he called it FRAP, which was FKBP, rapamycin-associated protein.

221
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,800
And both of us were trying to accentuate the point that rapamycin actually the co-receptor,

222
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,020
this protein FKBP.

223
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,240
From that point of view, it's a very unique kind of drug where it doesn't directly bind

224
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,140
to a protein target, but rather, it first binds to one target.

225
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,560
And now that drug receptor complex has a new surface on it, which now, in this case, interacts

226
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,140
with mTOR.

227
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,280
And we were really trying to get that point across.

228
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,120
But independently, you didn't realize we were both working on that.

229
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,640
Yeah, I had no idea that, in fact, the only point where I found out they were working

230
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,580
on it was once our paper had been accepted, I got, and this was pre lots of email, internet,

231
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:13,120
we got a fax from a journalist saying he was writing an article on our paper, and another

232
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,080
paper from Stuart Shriver, and actually sent us Stuart's paper, which we thought was really

233
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,180
unethical at the time.

234
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,360
And so we actually, at that point, contacted Stuart and said, hey, we got your paper.

235
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,860
You should know we're working on this tube, and here's our paper.

236
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,720
So it was, yeah, I didn't know at all.

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
And in many ways, I was very naive.

238
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
I was in this lab.

239
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Saul basically let us do whatever we wanted to.

240
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,160
We had this drug.

241
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,900
Unbeknownst to Saul, I started working on this thing.

242
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,520
And Stuart had had a history of FK file six mechanism action, so it was a logical progression

243
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,400
to what he was doing.

244
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Saul was not.

245
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
It was funny.

246
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,080
He came from a world where people looked for the receptors for drugs.

247
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,720
So if you look at his history, he'd really looked for receptors for drugs, for small

248
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,060
molecules, including the endorphins, for example, that I worked with.

249
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,240
But he wasn't big on cloning, what we call cloning a gene, which is where you have that

250
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
get the DNA sequence.

251
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
He almost thought you didn't need to do that.

252
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,140
Once you purified it, you could study the protein.

253
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,240
So I was one of the first people there to actually clone a cDNA, as we call it, in his

254
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,500
lab.

255
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,680
So it was a fun time, because it was clear that we got this protein.

256
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,020
But you did this in a very short period of time, because your paper, which was in cell,

257
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
was 1994.

258
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
1994, yeah.

259
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,440
I worked like crazy, really like crazy.

260
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,020
And that lab in general worked like crazy.

261
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,640
It was very common to be there until one in the morning, and then I would usually show

262
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,680
up at seven, eight in the morning.

263
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,400
We would sleep in the lab a lot.

264
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,160
Once things started to go, so we were purifying.

265
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,240
I purified out of the rat, out of rat brains.

266
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,560
And so we killed hundreds of rats to do this.

267
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,720
My friends would help me kill them, take the brains out.

268
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,520
There's a method in biology to visualize proteins called a silver stain, which is a very sensitive

269
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,440
way of seeing a protein.

270
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,800
And the first silver stain I did, where I actually saw sort of a glimpse of mTOR on

271
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,160
this method, I remember that really clearly.

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,540
Because at that point, I knew I could do it.

273
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,840
How did you know it was mTOR that you were looking at?

274
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,760
Well, I mean, I had all the controls, and there was this band on what we call a gel

275
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,600
that showed up just in the right place.

276
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,980
And so I was like, OK, there is a protein here that has all the properties that I want.

277
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,880
And at that time, what properties did you know?

278
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
You didn't know its size, did you?

279
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Didn't know its size.

280
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,580
Well, we know it bound to FKBP rapamycin.

281
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,480
But you didn't know that that exclusively bound to it, did you?

282
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
We didn't.

283
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,760
But we knew that it could be competed by FK506, based on some competition type experiments,

284
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,400
and so we had done that.

285
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
So there was these features.

286
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,520
It was mostly the specificity that it required rapamycin to bind to FKBP, and that was crystal

287
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
clear in the early experiments.

288
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,620
When we had FKBP by itself, there was no band on the gel.

289
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,680
And when we added rapamycin, there clearly was.

290
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,640
And when we added FK506, it clearly went away.

291
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,300
And so we knew that that thing had all the right properties.

292
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,000
But I remember very strongly feeling, OK, and at the time, now we have very, very sensitive

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,600
methods to sequence proteins, largely by mass spectrometry.

294
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
There we didn't.

295
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,160
And so from what I saw on that gel to actually figure out what its sequence was, I knew it

296
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,240
was hard.

297
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
But I knew it could happen.

298
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
That was a very powerful feeling.

299
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
It was the existence principle.

300
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Exactly.

301
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,960
So I knew the thing, kind of the enemy existed, and I could get it.

302
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,000
But then going from that initial glimpse on a gel to then having enough to actually sequence

303
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,840
it, that's what took hundreds of rats to actually get to enough that I could purify it.

304
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,280
And eventually, we collaborated with this guy called Paul Temps at a memorial salon

305
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
in Ketering, New York.

306
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,480
And he was able to sequence enough of the protein that then through a whole variety

307
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,520
of molecular biology tricks, we were able to clone it.

308
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:54,040
And it was a really huge cDNA, which basically is the length of the DNA sequence that encodes

309
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
it.

310
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,760
It was very big, sort of in the eight, nine kilobases, which is very hard to work with,

311
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,840
particularly at the time.

312
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,000
And I got very, very lucky in the sense that I did a bunch of tricks, and I got the whole

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
thing at once, which also was kind of unheard of at the time.

314
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
How did you do that?

315
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,520
Yeah, so back in the time, what people would do is they would get pieces, and then they

316
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,120
would sequence them, and they would sort of-

317
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
With overlapping-

318
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,760
They would overlap and stitch them together.

319
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,000
But what I did when I screened what we called libraries at the time for these pieces, I

320
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,520
would get some pretty big pieces, but I knew, when I would sequence it, I knew that the

321
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,440
front of the protein was missing, like it was missing, and I couldn't get it.

322
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,040
I could never get beyond a certain point of the protein.

323
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,800
And so then what I did, which really turned out to be incredibly lucky, so what we would

324
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,880
do is we would screen libraries of phages.

325
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,520
And so this was basically, people would take cDNA, complementary DNA, from rat brain, and

326
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,920
they would clone it into these bacterial virus called phages.

327
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,720
And so now every little cDNA was in a virus, and you'd have hundreds of millions of this

328
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,120
library, and you would plate it out on these plates, and the phage would make little plaques,

329
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,440
and then you would screen those plaques.

330
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,560
And so you'd have dozens of these plates each with thousands and thousands of these little

331
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,080
dots on them.

332
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,160
And so what I decided to do is that I would screen this library with a piece that I knew

333
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,880
was as far towards one end and as far toward the other end.

334
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,320
And so I screened it with both, and I looked for plaques that hybridized both.

335
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,080
And in fact, when I first did it, I got nothing.

336
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
It was really disappointing.

337
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,560
I got plaques that had one piece, and I had plaques that had another piece, but I didn't

338
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
have any plaques that had this thing.

339
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,200
And then what I realized, and this was really key, I realized that the so-called full length

340
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,080
cDNA was so big that it was going to make the phage replicate slowly.

341
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,040
Because basically their genome was so much bigger now that to replicate, it would take

342
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
longer.

343
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
And on what order of times?

344
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,200
It was probably two to three times more that it would take.

345
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I got it.

346
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
And you were missing it.

347
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,040
I could have missing it because the plaque that would have this would be incredibly small.

348
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,400
And so what I did is I went back and redid it, and now I let the plaques grow longer.

349
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,160
And I re-screened it, and in fact, I got one plaque.

350
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,520
There's a tiny, tiny little plaque that hybridized with both probes.

351
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,960
And when I looked at what was in there, it turned out to be the complete full length

352
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,980
cDNA, which was amazing because it was unheard of that these libraries would give you something

353
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,820
like 9,000 base pairs.

354
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
But it was.

355
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,180
I was going to say it was literally the intact thing from one end to the other.

356
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,860
So I got very lucky because that would have been pretty hard to assemble at the time.

357
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,460
You knew at the time, had Michael Hall's work in yeast been published yet?

358
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,820
It had been published sometime during this period of time.

359
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,360
But you didn't know anything.

360
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,340
You didn't know even what the yeast form of this protein.

361
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,340
When we started, we were enjoying it.

362
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,780
And in fact, when we first started getting sequence, there was no sequence out there.

363
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,900
And the yeast protein, really only the kinase domain is conserved.

364
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,180
And so most of the peptide sequences that we had, that Paul Temps had sequenced for

365
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,060
us, we didn't know at all where they were.

366
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,100
And so these are kind of fun things that used to happen in the past.

367
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,260
You used to collaborate with a person who did protein sequencing, and they would give you

368
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,180
back a series of peptide sequences.

369
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,940
But you didn't know what order they went in.

370
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,020
So let's say he gave you back, I think Paul gave me, Paul was amazing because he would

371
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,140
give you, let's say, 15 peptide sequences.

372
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,540
He'd say, look, your protein, these 15 peptides exist in your protein.

373
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
And then so-

374
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,700
With or without overlap in those peptides?

375
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
No, overlap.

376
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
These are short.

377
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,300
Mathematically, it's impossible to, by chance, figure out, like, you need more clues to figure

378
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,740
out the order because it's combinatorially impossible.

379
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,980
You have no idea what the order is.

380
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,220
And so what you end up doing is kind of a cool thing.

381
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,700
And Paul was really cool because he would actually, in the sequence of the peptides,

382
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,140
he also had uncertainty.

383
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,620
Sometimes he'd say, this amino acid-

384
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,660
Plus or minus.

385
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,900
Could be this or could be that.

386
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,300
And he would tell you what he thought it was.

387
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,300
And it turned out he was so good that when I actually figured out the sequence, every

388
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,140
one that he said it could be this or that, he was right, his prediction.

389
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,220
But so what you would do is you'd have these peptide sequences.

390
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,380
And what you could do now is design, we know the, obviously, the code, the amino acid code.

391
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,820
So we can predict what the DNA sequence would encode.

392
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,900
But as you know, the DNA sequence is degenerate.

393
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,380
So one peptide sequence can be encoded at the DNA level.

394
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,860
You don't know what the electrons and introns look like.

395
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,860
You don't know anything, right?

396
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,660
But each peptide could be encoded potentially by thousands of oligonucleotides.

397
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,260
And you don't know the order of the peptides.

398
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:38,460
What you would do is you would make a degenerate pool of oligonucleotides that had

399
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,740
thousands of different ones.

400
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,420
And you'd make them in both orientations.

401
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,300
And now you do PCR between them in all combinations.

402
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,980
And you would find which ones worked.

403
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,540
And that would define the order of the peptides.

404
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,580
And this is before you had real-time PCR.

405
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,460
Yeah, real-time PCR was usually used for quantitation.

406
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,420
But we had PCR.

407
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,820
And so we would take these oligo libraries and we'd mix and match them all combinations

408
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,340
in all orientations.

409
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,740
And if you got a band, it means that you got, that you had basically, and then you could

410
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,860
take those fragments and go and screen the libraries.

411
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,820
And so it's funny, because now, you know, with my students, when we discover a new protein,

412
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,380
all you do is you look up at the database because we have the whole genome sequence.

413
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,820
I always tell my students that my paper, which was the discovery of mTOR, which at the time,

414
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,820
to be fair, we did not realize how important mTOR would be, my paper basically is like

415
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,220
figure 1a b of their papers.

416
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,340
Because my whole paper is about discovering the protein sequencing and all this kind of

417
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
stuff.

418
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Was that paper effectively your PhD?

419
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
That was my PhD.

420
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,380
So you went back to, finished a couple years in med school, obviously decided, not going

421
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
to do a residency.

422
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm going to become a full-time scientist.

423
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,440
And then you basically have been at MIT since, or affiliated with MIT since.

424
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
Saul's lab was big, and I was very independent.

425
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,280
So the people said, why don't you do one of these fellows positions where you can start

426
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
your own lab?

427
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
And at the time, there was only three.

428
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,480
There was the Whitehead one, there was one at Carnegie Institute, which is in Baltimore,

429
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,600
and there was one at Cold Spring Harbor in New York.

430
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,720
And I applied to all of them.

431
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,720
And I got accepted pretty quickly, although after I graduated to Cold Spring Harbor and

432
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
to Carnegie.

433
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,800
But I didn't hear anything from the Whitehead.

434
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Like, nothing.

435
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,440
And only, like, basically once I graduated and I was kind of unemployed at that point,

436
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,960
I was technically a postdoc in Saul's lab.

437
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,400
But I hadn't taken, like, the boards, which Hopkins, you know, Hopkins didn't make you

438
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,680
take the boards, the medical boards to graduate, which was a nice thing.

439
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,800
My mother was like, you're going to starve, you're going to have a job, you can't do

440
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,000
residency now because you didn't apply, you didn't take the boards.

441
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,480
And then I got a call from Whitehead, actually inviting me to interview, and I did.

442
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,660
And then it took, again, a lot of time to, like, hear back.

443
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,620
And I remember they called me and said, look, we're going to offer you a position, but you

444
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,820
need to understand you will never, ever stay here as a faculty member, ever.

445
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
I was like, OK.

446
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,940
I realized I was applying for this Whitehead fellow position, not a faculty position.

447
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,580
But then eventually I came, and eventually I did stay.

448
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,780
And when I look actually at history, it's, they do keep, you know, about a third of the

449
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,500
people who come through, but they give you this sort of speech that you will never, ever

450
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
stay.

451
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Set the expectation.

452
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,620
And incidentally, many people named David have stayed.

453
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,380
So it's actually a good thing to be named David.

454
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,380
And actually our current director was a Whitehead fellow.

455
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,380
His name is David.

456
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,460
One of the other faculty members' name is David.

457
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,020
So I didn't know at the time, but now I realize that David was a big advantage.

458
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
So how has your work evolved?

459
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,300
I mean, you came here in the late 90s, right?

460
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
In the late 90s, exactly.

461
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,500
A rapamycin would go on to be approved by the FDA in 1999 as a frontline treatment as

462
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,940
part of the double or triple cocktail for patients.

463
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
As rapamune, right?

464
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Right.

465
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,320
As rapamune, along with often prednisone, cyclosporine, or MMF.

466
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,940
So now you're here, and I mean, we're going to get into much more detail, but effectively

467
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
you've never looked back.

468
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,640
You've never really left this space.

469
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,960
I got here and I was incredibly naive.

470
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,120
I realized at this point how I thought, you know, I knew a lot.

471
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,640
I thought I knew how to run a lab.

472
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,200
I had been very independent on my own.

473
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
That doesn't mean that I was sort of independent from like running a lab.

474
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,480
You know, behind the scenes in Saul's lab, obviously there was the entire finances.

475
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,800
I had written grants and things, entire finances, organization.

476
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,960
But there was a lot.

477
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,760
I could be independent, me, but then a lab is a different thing.

478
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,960
And so that was a hard transition to run, even though it was a small lab, Toronto lab.

479
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,280
And it was clear that at that time I felt that this field had kind of plateaued.

480
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,980
There had been the discovery of mTOR, but we weren't getting very far.

481
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,240
People were using rapamycin to look at lots of different things.

482
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,280
And mTOR by implication through rapamycin was being connected to lots of different things.

483
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,000
But one of the things that was obvious to me, and I think to others as well, was that

484
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,840
mTOR had to act with partner proteins.

485
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,120
And so we set about trying to identify what we now know are these mTOR-containing complexes,

486
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,600
mTOR-1 and mTOR-2, mTOR-complex-1 and 2.

487
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,360
But yeah, it was really hard.

488
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,040
We failed for years.

489
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,560
It was again one of—this field has had a series of just like little things that until

490
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,360
you figure them out, you make no progress.

491
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
And so we would purify mTOR and we'd look for other proteins.

492
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
We would continue to work with Paltemps.

493
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,520
And we just wouldn't find anything.

494
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,600
To be clear, you knew that you had discovered the gene for TOR.

495
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,560
You suspected that this thing exists in different complexes.

496
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,720
And I already knew that there was other proteins, because when I was doing the mTOR original

497
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,980
purification, the way that I was following mTOR was with kind of a funky cross-linking

498
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,680
assay where I was cross-linking a radioactive FKBP to the putariff target.

499
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,560
And there was always two bands on the gels.

500
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,720
There was a protein, mTOR, which I eventually purified, but there was a smaller one, which

501
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,800
I could never get either because it was just low abundance.

502
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
I couldn't detect.

503
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,160
I don't know what, but that little protein, which at the time I called RAF-2 actually,

504
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,320
basically remained unidentified.

505
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
So I knew that there was—

506
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,680
So basically the first version of mTOR-complex-1 was TOR and the version of mTOR-complex-2 was

507
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
RAF-2.

508
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
No, no, no.

509
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,080
That protein actually now that we found it turns out to be in both complexes.

510
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Oh, I see.

511
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,080
And what I knew was that there was an associated protein with mTOR.

512
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,960
I knew from—I didn't know what its identity was, but it was very clear on all my experiments

513
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,120
that there was a small—mTOR is very big.

514
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,800
It's around 300 kiloolons, which is a big protein.

515
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
This was a little protein.

516
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
It was around 30, so it was about 10 times smaller.

517
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,720
So from a technical point of view, it's about 10 times harder to get because there's about

518
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,960
10 times less peptides in that protein.

519
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,440
So I failed to get it.

520
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,080
So when I got here to the whitehead, I knew there was another protein to find, and we

521
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,240
kept trying to go after this protein.

522
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,560
And others, we knew it had to work.

523
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,840
You know, it's a really big protein.

524
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,760
Big proteins work with friends.

525
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,040
And it turned out—this is, again, these little things—it turned out that the detergent—so

526
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,920
when you work with mammalian cells, you have to lyse them, you have to break open their

527
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
membranes.

528
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
You typically use a detergent.

529
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,840
It turns out the detergent we were using, which is by far the most common detergent

530
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,240
that every lab in the world use, breaks apart these complexes.

531
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Just by bad luck.

532
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
Just bad luck.

533
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,800
And I had a postdoc—his name was Dostoroposov—who figured this out.

534
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,840
And he found this other detergent called CHAPS that kept them together.

535
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,640
When you think back to your career, and you're like, well, what are these key inflection

536
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
points?

537
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,880
His discovery of that detergent was key because once we did that, we purified all the interacting

538
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,120
proteins, and that eventually led to MTORC1 and MTORC2.

539
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,600
It eventually led to all the proteins that associated with those.

540
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,480
Basically that was the key to all the biochemistry.

541
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,960
There was several years of nothing, and he found that.

542
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,960
And then everything has sort of—from that point on, we've sort of marched along in

543
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,960
figuring out all the components of this pathway.

544
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,760
We still don't know why things are sensitive to Triton.

545
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,400
We don't know why their incentive is of the detergent, but it's the kind of happenstance

546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,000
of science that I guess makes it interesting.

547
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,560
So when, roughly by year, where are we when we have a—we meaning the world as a result

548
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,960
of your discoveries in the lab—where are we when we sort of know that now we have MTOR

549
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,000
complex 1 around Raptor, MTOR complex 2 around Richter?

550
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,160
This is around 2002, right?

551
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,360
So we were doing that around 2001, published around 2002.

552
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
It's in that range.

553
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,480
It's in the early 2000s.

554
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,840
Although as I said, we knew there was complexes even back in 1994.

555
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,040
At this point in time, your thought was these two complexes control what or sense what or

556
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,440
are important for what.

557
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Right.

558
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,040
So it was very clear early on that MTORC1 was doing most of the things that we had connected

559
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,960
before to MTOR.

560
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,400
So we'd had Rapamycin.

561
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,320
And so Rapamycin, in a way, had allowed us to know a lot about MTORC1, we now realize,

562
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,440
then otherwise we would have known.

563
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,280
Because we didn't have really genetics, we didn't have easy ways of modulating MTOR,

564
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
but we had Rapamycin.

565
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,080
And so there was a body of knowledge acquired by many different investigators about what

566
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,000
was so-called downstream of MTOR.

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
What did MTOR do?

568
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
We had some ideas.

569
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,840
It was a growth regulator, it regulated translation, it regulated autophagy, it regulates many,

570
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,000
many metabolic pathways, it regulates cell size.

571
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,560
We knew that largely through the use of Rapamycin.

572
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,400
And so now when we discovered MTORC1, which the first part we discovered was a protein

573
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,480
called Raptor, we now could go and say, well, does Raptor matter for all those things?

574
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,960
And it turned out it did.

575
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,800
So it was very clear that MTORC1 must be doing the things that we ascribe to Rapamycin.

576
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,040
MTOR2, therefore, remained very mysterious for a long period of time because it wasn't

577
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,120
doing those other things.

578
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,040
And only later did we find that it was actually part of the PI3 kinase pathway in a regulated

579
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
AKT.

580
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,880
And that clarified lots of things.

581
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,800
And in many ways, MTORC2, you could actually even say, and we've written papers arguing

582
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,160
this, that it's almost like upstream of MTORC1 because the PI3 kinase pathway is one of the

583
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,880
inputs into MTORC1.

584
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,800
In many ways, MTORC2 is less important than MTORC1.

585
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,760
You can modulate it more and still survive more.

586
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,320
So we've really focused largely on MTORC1.

587
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,920
And when I first got here, you sort of asked me, OK, well, what did you end up doing, right?

588
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,640
And I was pretty worked up when I got here.

589
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,720
And I had to realize I was sort of running a lab and unclear exactly what I was going

590
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
to do.

591
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,040
And I ended up working on MTORC1, or MTORC, I should say, largely because I didn't know

592
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
anything else.

593
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,120
And so I basically had to work on something.

594
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,000
And I remember some people here were pretty critical of me working on Rapamycin.

595
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,360
They were like, why are you working that silly molecule?

596
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
OK, now you have the target.

597
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,400
And the truth was, that's what I knew how to do.

598
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,720
Even at the time, you didn't appreciate what you do now, which is that effectively, MTORC

599
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,360
sits at the center of the universe for at least some of the things that we care a lot

600
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,560
about, including potentially longevity.

601
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
We did not.

602
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,480
When did that become clear to you?

603
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
That became clear.

604
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,160
You know, we tried, when we started to understand the connection to nutrients and the fact that

605
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,800
caloric restriction had been connected to longevity, we started thinking, OK, we actually

606
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,280
tried doing experiments on worms at the time with Rapamycin.

607
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,800
It turns out Rapamycin doesn't get into worms.

608
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,000
But there was really some, it was an important paper in worms where there was a mutant in

609
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,020
the C. elegans version of MTOR that had longevity effects.

610
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,360
I would say that was sort of the key paper.

611
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,040
And this is unrelated to DAF2.

612
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,920
Unrelated to DAF2, although interestingly, in the screens that gave the DAF mutants,

613
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,640
one of the DAF mutants, in retrospect, one of the ones actually had never been identified,

614
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,640
what the gene was, it was simply a mutant that had a mutation, turns out to be Raptor.

615
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,000
I think it's DAF15, I don't quite remember.

616
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,080
So there was a- Not 16, I'm sure.

617
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I don't remember.

618
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
We'll look that up.

619
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,360
But so it was interesting.

620
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,800
There was all these DAF mutants that had these interesting phenotypes.

621
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,320
And once we found Raptor, someone went back and found that one of the DAF mutants was

622
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,080
actually Raptor.

623
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,520
So that connected again to MTOR1.

624
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,120
Not only were there mutations in MTOR itself, the C. elegans MTOR, but also in the C. elegans

625
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,920
Raptor that connected it to it.

626
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,160
We did not realize, of course, our paper was published in CEL, Stuart Fiverr's paper was

627
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,580
published in Nature, I remember Nature wrote a news interview.

628
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,320
So people appreciated that the finding of MTOR mattered.

629
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,960
But I think more from, okay, this is a new signaling pathway, this is a new component.

630
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,040
I don't think we realized that it really- We certainly didn't, at the center of so many

631
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,860
important processes as we do now.

632
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,280
People sometimes joke and say, well, MTOR does everything.

633
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,280
So if something does everything at some point, okay, how interesting is it?

634
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,240
It's a funny- Not a lot of people studying oxygen these days.

635
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Exactly.

636
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Or like from the ribosome.

637
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,140
We all appreciate the ribosome makes proteins, and so it's important for everything.

638
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,560
But you don't study it as something that's regulators.

639
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,760
Although now we realize ribosome is very regulatory.

640
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
So it's a transport channel.

641
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Exactly.

642
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,200
So it starts to fall into that category.

643
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,120
And luckily we have enough of these regulatory systems that clearly shows us that it's a

644
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,600
very regulated process in the south.

645
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:12,080
But today MTOR and by extension Rapamycin and its analogs are really interesting, not

646
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,080
just in your world, but in mine.

647
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,120
So the plebes over here out in the peanut gallery, this is super interesting, right?

648
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,760
This is potentially a molecule that could make people live longer, at least if what

649
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,880
it does in yeast, flies, worms, and mammals is any indication.

650
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:42,560
So why is it that Rapamycin or asked another way, why is it that the inhibition of MTOR

651
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,640
or specifically MTOR complex one as you'll probably elaborate on can extend life?

652
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,540
I find that a very interesting question.

653
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,640
And it's a question that I'm often asked.

654
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,220
And I think we should say upfront, we don't know the answer to that question.

655
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,980
One way of addressing it is that you can eliminate many of the things that MTOR one

656
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,060
does.

657
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,260
And then ask, well, now why inhibit MTOR one, do I still get lifespan effects?

658
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,500
If you do that and look at many different processes, probably you'd vote autophagy is

659
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,940
the most important thing that it regulates, which as you know, autophagy is this self-eating

660
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,300
process where the cell breaks down some of its own components and presumably has to remake

661
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
them.

662
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,420
In a kind of naive way, you might imagine that what you're doing is throwing out the

663
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,820
old and making new.

664
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,700
And again, naively, you might think, well, that's going to rejuvenate a cell, although

665
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,340
none of that is, of course, proven.

666
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,360
So that would be a simple answer, but it clearly is not the whole answer.

667
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,780
So my answer to your question, why MTOR modulation has these longevity effects and yet many other

668
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:49,220
pathways that in some ways are as complicated and as important for a variety of other things,

669
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,580
don't.

670
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,780
And this is the way I think about it.

671
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,740
I think about it, like I try to analogize it a little bit to like a building.

672
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:03,100
So if I wanted to take a building like this one and make it younger, rejuvenate it, I

673
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,660
can't just get a plumber or electrician or a painter or a carpenter because the building

674
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,140
has many different features of which all of them have aged.

675
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,820
What you really need is a general contractor, right?

676
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,500
Who's going to then bring in all of those people?

677
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,940
Those subcontractors.

678
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,740
And fix all the subsystems.

679
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,340
We look at an old building, but an old building has lots of things that are messed up for

680
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,740
me, from the electrical systems, to the windows, to everything.

681
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,260
And to some extent, MTOR is like the general contractor for the cell.

682
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,740
I don't know of any other pathway that does as many things, right?

683
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,340
MTOR basically has a finger in every major process in the cell.

684
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,580
And so I think another way of thinking about your question is, what's the simplest way

685
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,780
to manipulate a cell so that lots of things are changed?

686
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,000
And the answer to that is to modulate MTOR.

687
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,900
Because all these other pathways, maybe some of them will regulate transcription.

688
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,540
Maybe some will do translation.

689
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,460
Some are going to change the shape of the cell.

690
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,620
But if you've got to do all those things, plus more, the only way of doing it with like

691
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,340
a single hit is to go after MTOR.

692
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,540
It is like the thing, it's like the brain of the cell, which then has all these subroutines

693
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
that do all these things.

694
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:22,100
And so to me, that's the simple answer, is that to impact the state of a cell, to rejuvenate

695
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,180
it, to slow the aging process, you can't do one thing.

696
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
You can't do two things.

697
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
You can't do three things.

698
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
You can't do 10 things.

699
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
You probably have to do 100 things.

700
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,100
And the only way you can do all of those things with one button is to go after MTOR.

701
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,140
Now, in biology, that tends to be a two-edged sword, right?

702
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:47,020
Because presumably, if you have one switch that controls so much, if you have the wrong

703
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,620
general contractor, or if the general contractor does the wrong thing, the effect is much more

704
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
noticeable.

705
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,980
So when did it become apparent to you, or how is it apparent to you that this isn't

706
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,380
just a linear relationship between signal and response?

707
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,380
This is a very good point, right?

708
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,300
So you could say, well, as a general contractor, there's a lot of things.

709
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:13,540
And so not only is anti-aging one of the things it does, but how you sort of scramble

710
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,940
sperm production, which is a potential target, heart function, right?

711
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,300
All these things require it.

712
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,060
And so, okay, you might get the anti-aging effects, but you're also going to get all

713
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,500
the downsides.

714
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,100
And I think that is certainly true.

715
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,820
And that's the major issue with targeting MTOR.

716
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
And so the question...

717
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,900
Because at the time you really kicked your efforts off here, people thought of rapamycin

718
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,180
and MTOR as a one-trick pony, which was you give this drug every day, your immune system

719
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,820
specifically, your cellular immune system doesn't work as well.

720
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,340
And at least for that subset of patients who had foreign organs in their body, that's a

721
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,780
reasonable thing to have.

722
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,820
And incidentally, you know, there is now...

723
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,020
So it's funny, rapamycin started as an immunosuppressant.

724
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,660
The interest in MTOR in the immune system pretty much was unexistent.

725
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,180
And now there's an entire field of so-called immunometabolism of which MTOR is probably

726
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,360
50% of that whole field.

727
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,060
And so it's MTORK1, MTORK2 in different immune cells, Tregs, right?

728
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
T-HOPRs.

729
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,180
And I believe this came out of the Novartis work from three years ago.

730
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,620
Did this precede that or...

731
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,060
Well, it's preceded that.

732
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,740
I mean, the Novartis work was the first sort of work in humans, right?

733
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,020
They clearly showed modulations, beneficial modulation in the immune system.

734
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,900
But in terms of studying which immune cells are most affected by rapamycin and what the

735
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,180
role of MTORK1, that's come out of the academic role by a number of groups that were heavily

736
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,700
enabled by the discovery of Raptor and Richter because now you could genetically inhibit

737
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
each of those.

738
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,860
And one of the things that my lab, we've really tried to do is to put our mice out there.

739
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:44,100
And so people use, for example, our Raptor mouse, so-called Phlox Raptor mouse a lot.

740
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,260
But this question of, in a way, what you're saying is, how much can we sort of tolerate

741
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,780
of MTOR modulation for beneficial effects versus non-beneficial ones?

742
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,220
And again, I don't think we have the answer to that.

743
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,580
To some extent, rapamycin is not a complete MTORK1 inhibition.

744
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,900
We know that.

745
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,140
And complete MTORK1 inhibition is probably not tolerated.

746
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,460
And so rapamycin might be as good as you can get.

747
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
You get some modulation.

748
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,380
Well, let's say a little bit more about that.

749
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,980
So you're saying if we could wave a magic wand, Bobby was very eloquently spoke about

750
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,060
why inhibition of MTORK1 leads to inhibition of MTORK2 and what the temporal relationship

751
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,820
of that might be.

752
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,660
But I don't think we got into this issue, which is, if I could wave a magic wand and

753
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:32,140
completely inhibit MTOR complex one, not lay a hand on complex two, why wouldn't that be

754
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
a good thing?

755
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,820
Because MTORK1 is probably required for the growth of any normal cell.

756
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:44,940
So for a cell to basically make its organelles, to make its proteins, to divide, MTORK1 is

757
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,380
probably an essential.

758
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:53,180
So at that level, it would start to mimic a crude chemotherapeutic agent that modulates

759
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
cell.

760
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,180
It becomes 5FU at a ridiculous dose.

761
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,420
Something that's going to basically slough off epithelial cells.

762
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
Exactly.

763
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,460
It calls basically atrophy of everything, anti-growth, and probably cell death.

764
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,220
And in fact, in many tissues where you delete Raptor, it can be quite bad.

765
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,220
That's the phenotype?

766
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,100
Yeah, like an epithelium in the gut, at least when we've looked, that's what they're saying.

767
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,420
So I don't think there's two issues going on here.

768
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,140
As Bobby Shirley told you, Rapamycin will also, with a longer time point, inhibit MTORK2.

769
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,160
And that is potentially bad for glucose homeostasis.

770
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,980
The other issue is that Rapamycin doesn't fully inhibit MTORK1.

771
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,260
So in an ideal world, you'd like to have, and what I mean by that is that MTORK1 probably

772
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,500
has dozens of substrates.

773
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,580
And Rapamycin only effectively inhibits some of them and not others.

774
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,140
Including Prabhupautophagy is relatively weakly modulated by Rapamycin.

775
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,140
Why is that?

776
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,780
Because the substrates, what Rapamycin basically does is sort of occlude the substrate binding

777
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,340
channel in MTORK1.

778
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,380
And it's physically, physically occluding.

779
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,620
And depending, probably, we don't, you know, this is somewhat hand waving, but there's

780
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,220
some evidence for this.

781
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,500
Probably the size of the substrate, if it's smaller, it might get easier and it's not

782
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
occluded.

783
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,460
If it's bigger, it's going to get blocked.

784
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,180
And so probably the key substrates in the autophagy pathway simply are not as affected

785
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,700
because they get into the kinase domain of MTORK1 still.

786
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,220
By the way, is this issue different for any of the Rapalogs?

787
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
No.

788
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,320
They're all basically producing the same effect as Rapamycin.

789
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,640
Some people might argue differently from that, but in my experience of them, they are

790
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,580
basically like Rapamycin with maybe different PK PD properties.

791
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,760
But from a mechanistic point of view, I wouldn't expect differences.

792
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
And I haven't seen those differences.

793
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,720
But so in an ideal world, you might want a molecule that would inhibit all the substrates

794
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,280
of MTORK1, not touch MTORK2.

795
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,040
But not do it constitutively.

796
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,200
Not do it constitutively, but also maybe not to 100% inhibition.

797
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,960
So I'm not sure I would use that molecule to wipe out MTORK1.

798
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,560
I would use it to bring down all the MTORK1 activity of all towards or to some extent,

799
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,640
leaving MTORK2 intact.

800
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,680
I think that's going to be very hard to do by targeting MTORK1 itself because MTORK1,

801
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,200
MTORK2 share the same kinase domain.

802
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,280
And so you can't go for the ATP binding site, which is most kinase inhibitors, MTOR as a

803
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,420
kinase, protein kinase, like LIVEC, for example.

804
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,680
They all go for the ATP binding site.

805
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,900
So we're not going to do it for that.

806
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,640
And so our view is that the way to accomplish that is not to go after MTORK1 itself, but

807
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,680
to go after its upstream regulators.

808
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,600
And the big benefit, in my view, of doing that is that you should be able to have something

809
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,160
now that modulates all MTORK1 substrate.

810
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,840
And you can also start to get tissue specificity because these regulators vary in importance

811
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,320
across tissues.

812
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,520
The aspect of this pathway that's kept our attention for two decades at this point is

813
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,520
that MTORK1 is basically regulated by everything.

814
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,740
Everything I do to the cell, whether I change nutrients, oxygens, pH, growth factors, osmotic.

815
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,120
What's the direct effect of glucose and or insulin on MTORK1?

816
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,360
It obviously plays an enormous role on complex two.

817
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,000
It seems to activate them, right?

818
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,360
So through independent pathways.

819
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,440
There seems to be a pathway through which insulin acts, and there seems to be a pathway

820
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,680
through which glucose acts.

821
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,680
And even the glucose pathway probably has several subbranches to it.

822
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
I see.

823
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,120
Which again, teleologically makes sense because if it's a nutrient sensor, it should be

824
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,800
activated by nutrients.

825
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,220
But it becomes very complicated now because you have the same nutrient acting in completely

826
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
different areas with great redundancy.

827
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,120
And that's probably because you're looking at, in the cells that we use in culture, we

828
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,760
can get both of these sensing systems.

829
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,160
We're probably in vivo, there's tissues that are going to care more about the insulin arm,

830
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,920
there's tissue that care much more about the glucose arm, and there's something that

831
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
care about both.

832
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,720
So if you think about being a peripheral tissue, let's say you're a cell somewhere in your

833
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
leg and you need to make a decision.

834
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
A muscle cell.

835
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Let's say a muscle cell.

836
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,360
You need to decide whether you're an anabolic state or a catabolic one.

837
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,400
So clearly there's things of use and all that.

838
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,800
But let's say just in response to nutrition, you kind of want two pieces of information,

839
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
right?

840
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,880
One, you want to know that the organism that you live in as a whole is in a fed state.

841
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,720
You want to be a good member of the community.

842
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,200
And that is reflected by things like insulin, which basically tells you the pancreas.

843
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,520
It's a global metric.

844
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,520
Right.

845
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,840
Pancreas, saw glucose, we sent out insulin.

846
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
Yep.

847
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,120
And the other one is you actually want to know that you have the nutrient that you need.

848
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,800
You could have like central command telling you, hey, I got glucose.

849
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,720
But if you don't have glucose, you can't do anything.

850
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,160
It's a local issue.

851
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,480
And so you really want like the central signal and you want the local signal.

852
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,120
So I think one can interpret that the pathway senses both the nutrient.

853
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,840
So the amino acid can be a local, the glucose molecule itself.

854
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Itself is a local one.

855
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
For sure.

856
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,840
We know it is.

857
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,720
Whereas the larger peptide can be sort of the central command.

858
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,440
And now you can extrapolate that to.

859
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,560
There are many signals that are secreted in response to food.

860
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Right.

861
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Insulin just being one of them.

862
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,720
And then there are many local nutrients.

863
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,520
And now you can start to see the enormous complexity of the problem.

864
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Right.

865
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,240
And now you add a temporal component to it.

866
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,360
And now you actually have a concentration.

867
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Yeah.

868
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,240
And then you make things tissue specific.

869
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,360
So our view has been if we can find the sensors of the nutrients, and that's what we focused

870
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
on.

871
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,160
So we focus a lot on amino acids, but we're also working on glucose.

872
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,400
If we could find those sensors, by definition, they'll have small molecule.

873
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
You'll buy new pockets, right?

874
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,720
Because they buy nutrients, which are small molecules.

875
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,160
Although they're small, small, small molecules, compared to drugs.

876
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
We should be able to drug them.

877
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,000
So in 2015 in the fall, you had these two papers that came out that looked at leucine,

878
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,120
of course, huge interest, but also arginine.

879
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,400
Leucine and arginine can get into a cell very easily.

880
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,600
Do they passively diffuse in?

881
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
There's transporters for that.

882
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
There's relatively straightforward transporters.

883
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,200
But they're high capacity transporters.

884
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Okay.

885
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,440
So in the cytosol, these amino acids bind to receptors that then downstream result

886
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,800
in the activation of TOR.

887
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,080
Specifically on TOR Complex 1.

888
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,200
People have long talked about how branched-chain amino acids are important for building muscle.

889
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,120
Specifically to be consumed in a workout was always sort of the rhetoric, presumably because

890
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,880
that's a very catabolic time for muscle.

891
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,600
It now seems that that makes sense, at least in the presence of what leucine is doing.

892
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,720
Do we think that the other two branched-chain amino acids are having any effect?

893
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,480
At least when we look at the receptor we found for leucine, and then we look at the concentrations

894
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,320
at which it might bind the other branched-chain amino acids, we don't think those affinities

895
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
are relevant.

896
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,280
Particularly valine is way too low.

897
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,200
Isoleucine maybe in some situations could act through the receptor, but unlikely.

898
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,320
So in our hands, again, looking at a very molecular point of view, it really seems like

899
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,200
leucine is the key one.

900
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,040
And I would think from talking to bodybuilders and looking at bodybuilding products out there,

901
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,200
it does seem like leucine is the one that people focused on more than the individual

902
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,200
ones.

903
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,520
And the difference between leucine and arginine then with respect to the signaling is what?

904
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,680
One way of sort of conceptualizing Amtrak 1 is it wants to drive anabolism.

905
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,760
And what its goal is to detect when something's missing for that.

906
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,640
So we tend to think of the pathway like when we turn it on, but probably its really key

907
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,840
function is to turn off when something is missing.

908
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,960
Let's say you're building a house, all of a sudden you run out of concrete, you want

909
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,520
to turn off, all of a sudden around a wood you want to turn off.

910
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,520
So this path would...

911
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,680
So the default is on?

912
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,480
The default, when everything is there, is on.

913
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,400
But it's built, it's organized in such a way that the removal of anything can turn it off.

914
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Efficiently turns off.

915
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Of course.

916
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,440
Now this is going to vary obviously between different tissues.

917
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,160
And so the pathway evolved that it needs to detect leucine and it needs to detect arginine.

918
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,640
At least in most tissues.

919
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,880
Now why is that?

920
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,240
They're both amino acids.

921
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,960
If you think about this during the course of evolution, you're an animal that ate another

922
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,920
animal so you ate its muscle, you got protein.

923
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,040
Why do you need to sense two different amino acids?

924
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,760
And they're very structurally different.

925
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,880
They're about as structurally different as you could get in terms of amino acids.

926
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,300
We don't have an answer to that.

927
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,160
Why did evolution do that?

928
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,160
Take these two amino acids.

929
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,400
I mean that's a phenomenal question.

930
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,200
I don't know enough about amino acids to know what the evolution of amino acids look like.

931
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,520
I mean a billion years ago, I assume we didn't have the same amino acids.

932
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
No, I think we did.

933
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
We did.

934
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,040
So most all forms of life have problems.

935
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,240
So basically from the beginning of when we had DNA to RNA to protein, we had the exact

936
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,600
same amino acids.

937
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,120
So then it's even more of a mystery.

938
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,680
Why in the heck did we...

939
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,720
Part of people in the lab that I was encouraging to look at other organisms because the sensing

940
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,760
part of the system is probably evolving quite quickly because different organisms live in

941
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,760
different environments.

942
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,500
And so if I have flies, we know already, don't care about arginine.

943
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,240
They care about leucine and it turns out they care about a whole bunch of other amino acids

944
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,240
that we don't care about.

945
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,320
What about yeast?

946
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,880
So yeast in many ways is the most mysterious because yeast...

947
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,400
So we don't know any sensors in yeast and none of the sensors we have found are in yeast.

948
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,840
And that's because yeast can make amino acids.

949
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,740
So to some extent yeast is very primitive.

950
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,480
You give it nitrogen, you give it carbon, it's going to make every amino acid.

951
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,440
So things like leucine, which are essential to us, are not essential to yeast.

952
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,440
They can make it.

953
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,920
In what state do yeast cease to activate TOR only in the absence of the essential elements?

954
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,680
So regulation of TOR is not as well studied in yeast because it's harder to detect the

955
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,680
output.

956
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,040
And so typically what people do is they change the nitrogen source or they change the carbon

957
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,160
source.

958
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,720
And so my view is that yeast has to have a sensor of nitrogen, whatever that means.

959
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,840
It's not so easy to understand what that means.

960
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,520
And a sensor of carbon.

961
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,560
But not a sensor of individual amino acids.

962
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,800
And as we find more sensors, so we've now connected the pathodimathione sensing and

963
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,320
we have a receptor for that.

964
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,720
That yeast doesn't have that either.

965
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,300
And so I've actually also tried to encourage people in the lab to look for what might be

966
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,200
a nitrogen sensor in yeast for example ammonia, which is a simple form of nitrogen.

967
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,040
Maybe that's what's sensed.

968
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,680
Maybe acetate is what's sensed for carbon.

969
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
But we don't know.

970
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,680
So say more about methionine because in the protein restriction literature, certainly

971
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,380
one argument is that methionine restriction specifically could be beneficial if one believes

972
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,600
that low IGF is beneficial and we can talk about whether that's causally the case or

973
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,480
not, not even getting into the IGF binding proteins.

974
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,080
Where does methionine fit into TOR?

975
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,080
Right.

976
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,440
So methionine actually is a very interesting one.

977
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,980
As you said, there's an extensive literature on what's so-called methionine restriction

978
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,840
having quite beneficial effects from glucose homostasis actually to quite very reasonable

979
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,900
lifespan extension effect as good as chloric restriction.

980
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:41,520
And there are some papers in FLY, genetic papers, that suggest that some of the methionine

981
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,680
restriction effects go through the TOR pathway in FLYs.

982
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,560
We got to this basically through the protein.

983
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,840
We found a protein of unknown function and we tried to figure out what it did and it

984
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,840
turned out to be a sensor of this metabolite called SAM, esodenosyl methionine, which

985
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,340
is basically made by methionine.

986
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
So it's actually quite interesting.

987
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,060
And people supplement with the variant of SAM-SAM-E.

988
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,460
Exactly, right.

989
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,440
SAM actually has some pretty interesting clinical effects.

990
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,520
Actually some quite convincing data on anti-depressive effects of SAM out there.

991
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,840
So the sensor here is interesting because the other sensors we have directly bind leucine,

992
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,940
directly bind arginine.

993
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,160
This one doesn't bind directly to methionine.

994
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,560
It binds to a metabolite made by methionine, which is SAM, which SAM many things can feed

995
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,600
into SAM, so it actually can integrate lots of signals.

996
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,080
So this sensor basically behaves like the other ones.

997
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:36,000
As soon as methionine levels go down, SAM levels go down, this sensor therefore inhibits

998
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,320
this pathway.

999
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,320
And so...

1000
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,640
So SAM would not be a longevity agent by the oversimplification that excess SAM would be

1001
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,600
akin to excess methionine would be akin to failing to inhibit TOR.

1002
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Exactly.

1003
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,920
So methionine restriction could be presumably rescued by giving SAM.

1004
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,880
And we actually know in the pathway that we've built in cells that that's true.

1005
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,320
You can bypass methionine simply by giving SAM.

1006
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,240
So a molecule that could basically trick this sensor into thinking that SAM was not there

1007
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,320
would be quite an interesting one.

1008
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,200
I think methionine is probably the most interesting of these amino acids because if you fast an

1009
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,240
animal, methionine is the amino acid that drops the most.

1010
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,800
And you looked at all of the amino acids in mice.

1011
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,640
So we should do some of this in humans.

1012
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,640
But it kind of makes sense.

1013
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,920
I can volunteer if you want.

1014
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,640
We could definitely profile.

1015
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,920
The reason probably is that arginine, you can make some, your liver can make it.

1016
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,240
And then leucine is an essential amino acid, but to some extent it's only used to make

1017
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,240
protein.

1018
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,240
That's it.

1019
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,640
So when you fast, you start to break down your muscle and release leucine.

1020
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,600
It's not only an essential amino acid that you use to make protein.

1021
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,160
And remember, the first amino acid of all proteins is the methionine.

1022
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,000
So by definition, every single protein has methionine.

1023
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,120
But it's also incredibly metabolically active through SAM and the so-called methionine

1024
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,120
cycle.

1025
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,240
So when you fast, you probably just can't generate enough methionine by breaking down

1026
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,840
your proteins to keep up with methion demand, while you can for leucine.

1027
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,160
So if you look at the blood of an animal that's fast, methionine is the number one dropped

1028
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,160
amino acid.

1029
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,760
I think that's true in autophagy in general.

1030
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,160
If we put an animal into a state that induces autophagy independent of caloric restriction,

1031
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,520
so for example, would we see the drop in methionine as a readout?

1032
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,240
You might expect it to go up actually, right?

1033
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,960
Because autophagy is going to break down protein.

1034
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
You might have methionine.

1035
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
If you're not recycling.

1036
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
If you're not recycling.

1037
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,520
And it depends if you induce, in the state for example, post-exercise, I don't know what

1038
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,040
we know about the use of methionine in SAM.

1039
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,800
So SAM is used for methylation reactions.

1040
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,800
And there are hundreds of methylation reactions.

1041
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:55,040
SAM is the second most common cofactor in enzymes after ATP.

1042
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
Everyone knows about ATP.

1043
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,040
ATP is energy.

1044
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,720
And then it's used in many, many, many reactions for phosphorylation.

1045
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,440
But SAM is the second most common one.

1046
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,160
So there are literally hundreds of proteins that use SAM.

1047
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,280
So maybe after exercise, a lot of SAM is used.

1048
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,280
I don't know.

1049
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,780
It's an interesting question, right?

1050
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,380
But with fasting, methionine definitely plummets.

1051
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,060
SAM definitely plummets.

1052
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,780
And so we're now generating the right animal models to ask whether the sensor we have is

1053
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,220
involved in the effects of methionine restriction.

1054
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,620
So we can basically knock it out and then do methionine restriction.

1055
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,920
And if the animal doesn't have the health benefits of methionine restriction, it means

1056
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,460
that this sensor and by extension mTORC1 are the key mediators of methionine restriction.

1057
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,460
So we'll see.

1058
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,420
So coming back to Rapamycin specifically and all of its limitations.

1059
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,940
So we've established that you can't just take Rapamycin all day every day because

1060
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,020
that experiment's been done.

1061
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,500
That's the clinical utilization of it.

1062
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,340
Certainly the animal data have suggested and the human data have suggested that an intermittent

1063
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:57,640
dosing of Rapamycin could produce a beneficial phenotype with respect to longevity specifically

1064
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,380
and also with respect to immune function.

1065
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:07,380
So if you had to guess based on triangulating these data, assuming no new drug came along

1066
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:14,060
that was going to selectively do some of the things that we've discussed, how would one

1067
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:21,060
dose in an animal or a human for that matter, Rapamycin, to increase the odds in favor of

1068
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,760
longevity and against harmful side effects, which presumably the most obvious ones would

1069
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,060
be immune suppression and or glucose homeostasis disruption.

1070
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,940
Yeah, and also epithelial sort of toxicity.

1071
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,940
Particularly the GI epithelium.

1072
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,860
So I think the intermittent approach is definitely the one that makes sense because if you buy

1073
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:44,140
the idea that you want to induce autophagy, which a lot of people, of course, like yourself,

1074
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,060
who study the effects of fasting also view that that's one of the goals of fasting is

1075
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,060
to induce autophagy.

1076
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:54,260
So if we basically want to chemically induce autophagy without fasting, I think the intermittent

1077
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,660
dose is what makes sense.

1078
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:00,580
You basically let have an induction autophagy, a relatively weak one with Rapamycin, but

1079
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,580
then let the system rebuild.

1080
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,260
It's clear that both mTOR, you need just right amounts, right?

1081
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,180
You can't have too little, it's toxic, you have too much, it's toxic.

1082
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,820
The same thing with autophagy.

1083
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,500
If you remove autophagy, it's really toxic.

1084
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,780
If you have too much autophagy, it's really toxic.

1085
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:19,980
The cycling and abalism, catabolism might be the single most important thing to do.

1086
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,700
It might be, right?

1087
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,920
And I think it's hard for us to know, but those intermittent dosing strategies, every

1088
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,740
other day feeding strategies all point to that.

1089
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:35,540
And the genetics where too much is bad and too little is bad also point to that.

1090
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,260
So if you genetically inhibit this pathway by deleting Raptor, if you genetically activate

1091
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,060
it by deleting these repressors called the Tuberosclerosis Complex, both are bad.

1092
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,700
Both in fact in many tissues like the muscle give the same output.

1093
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,700
They get muscular dystrophy.

1094
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,380
I was just about to say there's an overlap with muscular dystrophy here, isn't there?

1095
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,380
Exactly.

1096
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:59,420
So this may be a theoretical question, but when we think about the life extending properties

1097
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:08,980
of rapamycin, do we believe that it is a result of delaying the clinical onset of disease?

1098
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,500
Let's use a disease where that tends to be more binary like cancer.

1099
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,180
But obviously cancer spends probably 70 to 80% of its time undetectable, but due to just

1100
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,260
the law of growth, it becomes detectable only at the end.

1101
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:26,260
So do we think that in as much as say taking these agents would allow you to live longer

1102
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,100
by not dying from cancer at the same period of time, does it delay the time it takes for

1103
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:38,060
cancer to become clinically detectable and or delay the demise of the animal once it

1104
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,060
has that cancer?

1105
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,500
I think specifically in the case of cancer, rapamycin is there's some situations where

1106
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,780
it has some decent activity, but in general, it's not a cytotoxic agent.

1107
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,140
It's not going to kill a cancer cell.

1108
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,140
It's really going to...

1109
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,600
Once an organism has cancer, do we know if it's doing anything to prevent the development

1110
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,600
of cancer?

1111
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,600
We don't know that well.

1112
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,320
There actually has been some epidemiological data where people have compared cancer rates

1113
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,640
in transplant patients.

1114
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,680
Identical patients who are with and without rapamycin.

1115
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,280
FK506 versus rapamycin.

1116
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,200
And it's actually quite interesting because as you know, immunosuppression in general

1117
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,920
is associated with higher cancer rates, right?

1118
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,360
The idea that you have less immune surveillance, that's not seeing a rapamycin.

1119
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,720
So it is seeing a FK506.

1120
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,880
It's not seeing a rapamycin.

1121
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:26,280
And the argument has been that rapamycin itself has cancer cell autonomous effect.

1122
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,480
Independent of the immune modulation problem.

1123
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,320
So you're presumably getting less immune surveillance because it's immunosuppressant, although of

1124
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,800
course that's not proven.

1125
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,480
But you're mitigating that by now directly targeting the cancer.

1126
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,920
And they've canceled each other out.

1127
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
They canceled each other out.

1128
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,080
And you know the size of the effect from the FK506 cohort.

1129
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Exactly.

1130
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,340
And other immunosuppressant things, Cyclosporine, have also been looked at that.

1131
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:51,840
So my bet would be that in the case of cancer, you're not going to cure cancer once you've

1132
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
got it.

1133
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,900
But also I don't think you're going to modulate the incidence, like the mutational frequencies

1134
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,520
that are giving you cancer, right?

1135
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,460
So if you think of cancer in a way is easier to think about when it starts because you

1136
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:08,000
say, well, it starts when you have a cell that has all the requisite mutations to be

1137
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,040
a cell that has uncontrolled growth.

1138
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,920
So if that's the point it starts, I think we're not going to affect that.

1139
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,840
But once that cell exists and now has to start growing and also escaping the immune system,

1140
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,180
I do think that's probably what you're going to affect.

1141
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:29,720
In other diseases, like a cardiovascular disease where you could imagine things like autophagy

1142
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,460
could be quite modulatory, I think you can imagine that you're also going to be affecting

1143
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,240
the incidence at the exact point at which you'd say, OK, this is an atherosclerotic plaque

1144
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,240
or not.

1145
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:47,440
What do we know about rapamycin and taur in the brain, especially with respect to neurodegeneration?

1146
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah, that's a really interesting one.

1147
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,060
And that probably is a really important question for the future.

1148
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,520
So we know autophagy matters a lot in the brain.

1149
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,040
If you delete autophagy, and really Mitsushima was the person who kind of made autophagy

1150
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,800
interesting to lots of people.

1151
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,000
And it was awarded the Nobel Prize.

1152
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No, no, he wasn't.

1153
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Oh, he wasn't.

1154
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Oh, Shumi was for originals.

1155
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Well, he didn't share.

1156
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
He didn't know that much.

1157
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,680
I think was a bit of an oversight in my view.

1158
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,760
But anyhow, he basically studied autophagy in the brain, made mutations, showed you got

1159
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,760
neurodegeneration.

1160
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,360
So that was a really important finding.

1161
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,440
Connects up to lysosomal storage diseases, which autophagy basically autophagosomes fuses

1162
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,440
with a lysosome.

1163
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,460
So now you have that connection.

1164
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:28,560
So I think in all tissues, it's a bit of a double-edged sword.

1165
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:35,120
You clearly need mTORG1 activity to maintain healthy synapses, certainly during brain growth.

1166
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:40,440
If you make mutations around a growing animal, you basically don't have a cortex.

1167
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:48,280
On the other hand, you clearly need to modulate mTORG1 to have some level of autophagy to

1168
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,440
keep the system healthy.

1169
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,540
Now you could debate, is that in neurons?

1170
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,540
Is that in glia?

1171
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:53,540
It's probably in both.

1172
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,600
People have made mutants, certainly in neurons, which suggests it's both.

1173
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,240
But then some of those promoters are a little bit dirty.

1174
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,720
But the real question in the brain is what modulates mTORG1?

1175
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,520
Because it's not probably nutrients.

1176
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,880
Because they're so constant.

1177
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,480
Your brain, your body, your brain prioritizes nutrients in the brain over it.

1178
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,720
It basically protects.

1179
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,400
So if you take an animal and you fast it for two days, a mouse, it loses a lot of weight,

1180
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,260
25% of its weight.

1181
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,680
And now you take every single tissue and you weigh it.

1182
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,680
Every tissue has shrunk.

1183
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,680
Except the brain.

1184
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,760
Some like the thymus have shrunk ridiculously.

1185
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,200
The kidney shrinks, which you wouldn't expect.

1186
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,280
The heart shrinks.

1187
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,200
The brain, nothing.

1188
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,160
Now clearly, probably if you, in a mouse, you can't do that extreme of fast.

1189
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,440
And so the body protects the brain from a nutrient point of view.

1190
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,040
Yet mTORG1 activity is high there.

1191
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,280
Clearly we know that we have to modulate autophagy.

1192
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,040
So something must be inhibiting mTORG1.

1193
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,040
By the way, this is my peripheral argument for why, and I'm in the huge minority here,

1194
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,280
I do not think the brain is really the appetitive center.

1195
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,640
I think it's the modulator.

1196
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,920
But for that exact reason, think it wouldn't make sense for evolution to put our appetite

1197
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,920
center in our brain.

1198
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
It should be in the periphery.

1199
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,760
It should be in the liver, I think.

1200
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,760
I think the liver should be the bone.

1201
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,680
And people would argue that the things of the hypothalamus are in the periphery, right?

1202
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,680
Because they're not protected.

1203
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,080
There are parts of your brain like the hypothalamus.

1204
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,160
Yeah, the point is I think it has to be your appetite center needs to be regulated to something

1205
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,240
that senses very rapid change.

1206
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,680
The outside, for sure.

1207
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,680
Yeah.

1208
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,680
For sure.

1209
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,200
And exactly where it is, and the bottom line is probably…

1210
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,680
But I never thought of it through the lens that you just explained it, which was the

1211
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,280
implication of that for tors is enormous.

1212
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,360
So does tors look different in the brain?

1213
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,360
Or obviously the protein won't, but do the co-factors around it look different?

1214
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,600
We have never done from biochemistry out of the brain.

1215
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,720
It's something that would be very interesting to go and do now.

1216
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,440
I think now it's something we talk quite a bit as a lab to do.

1217
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,680
We haven't quite done it at all.

1218
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,120
But then what actually regulates it?

1219
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,120
It's very clear that neuronal activity does.

1220
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,200
But there are there, as you're suggesting, maybe neuronal specific factors are regulated.

1221
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,720
I think that's a completely open area.

1222
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,760
I've tried to get some of my students interested in that.

1223
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,040
My brother's a neuroscientist.

1224
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,840
He's argued we should really do some work there.

1225
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,560
Maybe when we run out of sensors in the periphery, we'll go to the brain.

1226
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,360
And that's where I purified mTOR.

1227
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,040
Was that a brain?

1228
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,440
So there's a ton of mTOR in the brain.

1229
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,600
And I did that not because I was like, whatever.

1230
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,800
I basically measured how much there was, and it was clear the brain had the most.

1231
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:23,400
One of the challenges of studying biology in humans is that you can't do the same

1232
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,440
experiments you can do in animals.

1233
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,600
If we had a Gedanken experiment where you could take a sufficiently large number of

1234
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,320
human subjects and divide them into groups.

1235
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,960
So you had a control group.

1236
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,760
These guys were going to do everything that the standard American does.

1237
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,880
You had a group that you could give rapamycin to in any way, shape, or form you decide.

1238
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,640
And then you had a group in which you could manipulate their behaviors.

1239
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,720
And they would behave as animals.

1240
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,200
They would do anything you want with respect to how they would eat or how much or when,

1241
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,840
exercise, whatever you like.

1242
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,680
First question is, how would you design arms two and three to have the best outcome with

1243
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,840
respect to longevity?

1244
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,320
And then I'm very curious to know what you think the difference between groups two and

1245
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
three would look like.

1246
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,080
So I think as we spoke before, I mean, the mTOR modulator arm would probably be an intermittent

1247
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,920
type dosing one where hopefully we'd have biomarkers of that.

1248
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,680
And you and I have spoken in the past, a biomarker for autophagy, for example, a biomarker for

1249
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,680
mTOR activity.

1250
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,460
And you have to decide what tissues you cared about.

1251
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,960
Probably the muscle would be one that you'd want to focus quite a bit on and perhaps the

1252
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:21,960
liver.

1253
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:28,560
Now, I don't think that mTOR modulation on its own is going to give you all the benefits

1254
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,920
of good lifestyle modulation.

1255
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,840
So it might give you lots of the benefits of the dietary manipulations, the fasting

1256
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,280
manipulation, although clearly there's differences there.

1257
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,880
But I'm not sure if that will give you all the benefits of the exercise modulation.

1258
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,120
And so if on the lifestyle side, which you obviously know better than almost anyone what

1259
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:49,640
you'd exactly want to do, there'd clearly be an exercise component to it on top of a

1260
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,400
dietary component.

1261
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,840
I think mTOR modulation will give you a subset of that.

1262
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,920
So let's simplify the experiment then.

1263
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,200
Let's assume that everything but food is the same in the groups.

1264
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,000
And the rapid group gets the intermittent dose as you see fit.

1265
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,400
And the other group now can fast or do any sort of CR mimicry that you want.

1266
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Do you think that normalizes the playing field?

1267
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,000
I think it gets a lot closer for a simple reason.

1268
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,600
So if you give an mTOR modulator versus a fast, remember there's one really important

1269
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,680
difference is that nutrients in the mTOR modulation case are actually still high.

1270
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,680
Yeah.

1271
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,880
Because first of all, in fact, if you actually look in cells, they can actually be a little

1272
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,880
bit higher because the cell thinks it's starving.

1273
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,880
So it does all this...

1274
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,240
So it shuts down processes that would accumulate them.

1275
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,920
Yeah, and it upregulates more.

1276
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,880
And so we've looked in cells, so actually they tend to go up, versus a fast where things

1277
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,400
are going to be lower.

1278
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,840
On the other hand, if all those nutrients are eventually doing their stuff by communicating

1279
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:51,080
through mTOR and you've sort of inhibited downstream, to those downstream processes,

1280
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,080
things look the same.

1281
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,080
It doesn't matter.

1282
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,240
We have a lot of nutrients here and very low nutrients here.

1283
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,800
So the modulation of mTOR is what matters.

1284
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,280
And so I think to answer that question, we really need to understand whether all these

1285
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,160
nutrients which are still there in the fed state have a lot of other signaling effects.

1286
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,960
And it would be naive to think that they don't.

1287
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
They do.

1288
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
We know they do.

1289
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
Now, do they matter?

1290
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,920
And do they matter a lot?

1291
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,280
I don't think we know.

1292
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:21,120
And I think a lot of the genetics and pharmacology would argue that within the range that we

1293
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,580
can actually manipulate lifespan, it could be that those fasting regimens and rapamycin

1294
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,960
are somewhat similar.

1295
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:34,120
And certainly in the mice, it appears to be at least similar, if not better, in favor

1296
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,120
of rapamycin.

1297
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,120
Exactly.

1298
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,040
And that's why I'm particularly excited about the methionine restriction work because, you

1299
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,560
know, caloric restriction is not only hard to do in people, it's hard to do in animals

1300
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,560
too.

1301
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,560
It's really hard.

1302
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,360
You have to wait a food, pairwise feeding.

1303
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:50,360
It's a real pain and it's a real restriction to doing lots of experiments.

1304
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,680
While methionine restriction is a lot easier.

1305
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,360
Yeah, just by methionine and free chow.

1306
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,120
Yeah, not totally free, but lower.

1307
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,920
And so there we can do these kind of experiments where you could do methionine restriction

1308
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
plus rapamycin.

1309
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
Right?

1310
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,140
And actually ask, do you get synergy?

1311
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,140
Do you not?

1312
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,140
Right?

1313
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:08,320
So I think that's going to be an intervention that's going to be a lot easier for us to

1314
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,320
play with.

1315
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:14,860
So if resources weren't constrained, what are the sort of dream experiments or what's

1316
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:20,040
a dream experiment that has been on your mind that you want to do, but it's either technically

1317
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,560
we're not there yet or it's just economically an innocent challenge.

1318
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:28,280
I think what I want to know, and this is I think the challenge for anyone who does

1319
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,880
what we call signal transduction in a dish like we've done for a long time, is to really

1320
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,160
try to understand in each different tissue in a temporal fashion in response to a variety

1321
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:43,160
of different diets and nutritional states what those tissues are actually doing.

1322
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,640
Right now we have these little time points in the liver, in the muscle.

1323
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:54,120
We don't really have a deep sort of kinetic understanding of what the actual physiology

1324
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,120
is doing.

1325
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,240
We'd really like to know.

1326
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,420
Because even in the mouse, you know phosphorylation in one moment.

1327
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,420
You don't have an integral.

1328
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,420
In one tissue.

1329
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,420
We don't have that.

1330
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,920
And we don't even have, it's just they're expensive and hard experience to do.

1331
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,440
Let's say I was really wanting to take mice, fast them, and in all different tissues, and

1332
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,560
ideally, tissues are complex.

1333
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,480
Now with all the single cell sequencing, we're seeing much more complexity.

1334
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,600
So even in tissues like the liver that we tend to take a chunk and sort of say it's

1335
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,680
liver, we know that's an amazing complexity.

1336
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,440
And so in an ideal world, we'd like to have a description of what all these different

1337
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,800
tissues are doing over time.

1338
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,760
And then you'd like to do it under different diets, under whether they were obese mice,

1339
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,840
whether they were exercise mice.

1340
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,660
And so the matrix becomes ridiculous at that point.

1341
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,180
But I think that's the future of signal transduction.

1342
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:47,600
People like me have done a good job of finding all the pieces in some random cell line in

1343
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,600
a dish.

1344
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,720
And clearly, the systems have all these pieces because it allows them to communicate in vivo

1345
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,580
to many, many different upstream signals.

1346
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:59,140
And now the challenge is how do we go back and actually see that happening?

1347
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,680
And that's going to teach us, OK, which tissues actually matter.

1348
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,200
We've talked a lot about longevity.

1349
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,920
Do you need to impact all tissues?

1350
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,920
Is it the muscle?

1351
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,920
Is it the liver?

1352
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,920
Is it the brain?

1353
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
Maybe that you need to impact.

1354
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,560
You know, people debate still how much rapamycin gets in the brain.

1355
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,920
Are you actually affecting the brain?

1356
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,080
I don't think those are open questions to some extent.

1357
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:22,700
So it would be a complete description of what these systems are doing over time across

1358
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,760
many tissues under many different states.

1359
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,640
Well, David, we're pretty much out of time.

1360
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,240
But is there anything else that we should at least take advantage of while you're here?

1361
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:35,200
I think we already touched upon it when we talked about targeting mTORC1 or other things.

1362
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:40,000
And so I think to me, and this is why we sort of had commercial interest in this regard,

1363
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,840
how do we go and target other things upstream that might be more amenable to giving us sort

1364
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:50,920
of more of this dream molecule of a pan mTORC1 inhibitor and no mTORC2 activity?

1365
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,920
David, thank you very much.

1366
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,920
All right.

1367
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,920
Thank you very much.

1368
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,920

1369
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,920
