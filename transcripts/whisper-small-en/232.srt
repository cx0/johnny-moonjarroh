00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:15,400
Alton, so great to finally be sitting down with you. We talked about this even before you operated

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,440
on me, which is at the time of this recording, I think we're coming up on seven months. But this

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,720
is a topic that I just, I can't tell you how many times I get asked about this by my patients. And

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:34,320
I don't know, in some ways medicine is so siloed. You think, well, I did general surgery, surely I

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,920
know something about orthopedics, but the reality of it is outside of trauma, and even in the most

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,240
basic sense, I know very little about orthopedics. And I think that's probably true for a lot of

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:52,440
doctors, primary care and otherwise. And then how much more is that true for patients? So it's a

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,600
pretty broad and specialized field at the same time, huh?

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,880
Yeah, I think that's a great point. I mean, I always have told people who've asked about medical

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,240
school, well, don't you know all these things? And we only do a subset of rotations. So I know

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,880
nothing about urology, I know nothing about brain surgery, right? It just depends on the luck of the

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,800
draw and what you get exposed to. And so I wholeheartedly agree. And then we just narrow ourselves

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,680
down like a funnel in terms of knowledge, because there's been such a knowledge explosion for the

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,920
last, really the last two decades, in terms of research, in terms of new science, a lot of which

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,000
you've talked about and do talk about routinely and know a lot more about than me. But as it

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,760
applies to orthopedics, even there are subsets of orthopedics. And then there are subsets of

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,960
shoulder surgery that involves just research versus just clinical practice. And all of that

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,440
is just an explosion of information. And, you know, my well informed patients often ask me about

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,560
things. And I know hopefully a lot of it, but I don't know all of it. And they know that is

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,960
sometimes fine because they're very good now at looking at true scientific articles, and they

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,840
approach it and approach me with new articles. So I'm learning every week from my patients,

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,400
actually, about shoulder surgery. Now, when you went to med school, did you think you wanted to be

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,480
an orthopedic surgeon? I didn't know. I barely went to medical school. I only went, I just had

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,840
a very circuitous path, but I was an engineer at UT here in Austin. And I don't think I really,

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,280
I'm an engineer as well. I don't think I knew that. What kind of engineer were you? I did mechanical

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,880
and biomedical. Okay. Yeah. And so I didn't know anything about it. My dad was an engineer. And so

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:43,480
I just, it just went that way. And, but as, at the end, I was, I was a little edgy about going into

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,640
industry. And so, on a last whim, because I had two uncles that were dentists, I went to dental

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,720
school for a year. And I actually didn't like that at all. But I loved the science, what was going on

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,080
with the biomaterials. They dentistry has been at the forefront of biomaterials, right? And so I left

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,200
after a year, but I was exposed to the entire anatomical body because the anatomy instructor

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,680
for head and neck was actually an MD, PhD. And she said, when I confided in her that was leaving,

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,000
she said, you know, you ought to try medical school. And so then I went back, came back to Austin,

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,080
painted houses for a year and then, then applied to medical school and went and still didn't know.

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,440
And so you go there, you don't know what you're going to do, not even if you're going to do

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,240
surgery or medicine. Right. Right. And I liked it all. I loved invasive cardiology, right? So,

38
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,720
I mean, just, just all the aspects of the physiology and the electricity really going on in our bodies.

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,680
And, but then I was exposed to orthopedics, fortunately. And it was like,

40
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,160
I knew all this stuff. I didn't know it all, but it felt so natural putting things together,

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,640
piecing them back together, the jigsaw puzzles. And it's so, it just, it felt all

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,200
in perfect line with my engineering background. In the time when you went through orthopedics,

43
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,760
was it common for people to also do a fellowship after the five years of residency?

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,040
It was, I think at our time, we had a big, I went to Tulane and there at that time they had eight,

45
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,560
this was pre-Katrina, they had eight residents per year. So it was a big program. And at that time,

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,960
about four, we're going to general practice. So fellowships were not ubiquitous. Now they're

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,600
almost mandatory, really just, just because you need to have a, I wouldn't call it a gimmick,

48
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,320
but you need to have a special interest because the groups that you'd be applying to work for

49
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,760
or the hospitals kind of want you to have some subspecialty. Yeah. I mean, I think that's,

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,200
that's the case in medicine, right? It's really, even if you did something like general surgery

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,040
and didn't do a fellowship after like vascular plastics, cardiac, et cetera, you'd be hard pressed

52
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,400
to go even into the community and kind of do everything. You probably tend to focus on one

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,040
part of the body. Exactly. So what, where did you do your fellowship? Obviously upper extremity.

54
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah. So I did my shoulder fellowship at Columbia in New York. And then I did my hand fellowship

55
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,120
in New York at Roosevelt hospital. It's two separate fellowships. Yeah. And, and most people

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:24,440
didn't do that at the time, but I just really liked both very much. And so, and I, it just

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:33,480
evolved into that. I dabbled with spine during residency. And I think the reason I evolved into

58
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,520
wanting to do upper extremity is because there's nothing cookie cutter about it. And I don't,

59
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm not by any means demeaning any part of orthopedics, but for me, there, there were no,

60
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,640
there were very few jigs, cutting jigs, very few, um, linear, um, things that you had to just,

61
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,640
there's so much variability in the upper limb, both anatomy and also the specific pathology

62
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,080
that you just have to be all over the place. And it was more creative for me, frankly.

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,800
What would have been some of the sort of big steps forward? Let's go back to,

64
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,480
so what year did you finish your training? In 90, 96. I started practice in 96. Okay.

65
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:27,640
So at that time, what was the state of the art in terms of what was being done? So when, for example,

66
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,040
there was a day when, if you look at the surgery I had, that would have been done with a big open

67
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,840
incision. Right. When did minimally invasive orthopedic surgery take over the joint space?

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,360
It's crazy. It's such a cool question. I'm glad you asked it. Really don't get to speak about

69
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,680
it very much, but there was knee arthroscopy was the first big arthroscopic realm to develop. And,

70
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,520
and a fellow that most of my younger residents don't even know now, Dick Kaspari was, was hugely

71
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,960
innovative in that space. And so it shoulder arthroscopy by the time I was in residency was

72
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,200
primitive. We had the basic equipment to get into the shoulder, but we couldn't do much. Right. So

73
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,880
by the time I graduated, all we were doing arthroscopically, by the time I even finished

74
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,080
my shoulder fellowship, we were doing open shoulder arthroplasty. And I was at one of the

75
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,040
meccas of shoulder surgery. So everything advanced was being done there at the level that it could

76
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,440
be done. But it was open shoulder arthroplasty, which is still open, but smaller incisions. It was

77
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,240
open instability repairs, open labor repairs, but we didn't even appreciate what, for instance,

78
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,080
the slap tear. We knew they existed, but we didn't know the impact. And what we started seeing there

79
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:53,400
was, and there were certainly no arthroscopic repairs of, of, of the labrum, except these

80
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,320
early, early devices where you'd kind of get in there, see it, and you just mallet in, drill a

81
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,560
little hole and mallet in this big broad tack that was just now so primitive and they would fall out.

82
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,520
They had a high failure rate and it was just, that was the state of the art at that time.

83
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,560
So, and was any of this being done in clinical trials or was it kind of like patients are saying,

84
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,960
look, we have the tried and true way that we do this. The downside is you're going to have a big

85
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,760
scar and we're going to have to tear a bunch of muscle and your recovery is going to be longer.

86
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,880
But once we get in there, we know what to do versus we've got this minimally invasive way

87
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,040
that has all of these advantages, but the drawback is high failure rate. Right. So that was exactly

88
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,240
discussions. And there were, there was not a lot of, there was a little bit of FDA going on,

89
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,560
approval at that time, but not a lot in terms of using these sort of hemeri humanitarian devices

90
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,800
and so forth where you could go ahead and try it and the patients had to sign a release

91
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,200
and it was all fine. They were trusted surgeons that were doing it. So the, I wouldn't say there

92
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,800
were clinical trials. There were a lot of retrospective analyses going on. Oh yeah,

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,960
we did this in 107 patients and 47% failed. Yeah. And so in my early years of that, we were

94
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:22,360
actually just still doing mostly open and then kind of waiting for the devices for the science

95
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,360
or for the, for the industry to catch up with some better devices. And some of my colleagues

96
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,160
and occasionally me, uh, were, were adding little bitty innovative aspects of these,

97
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,760
whether they're application devices or the style of implants. So we've gone from today,

98
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:50,520
we've gone from, we went from purely metal to now often purely, um, braided polyester

99
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,320
as an actual anchor device, which is super cool because there's no metal in your body.

100
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,240
And then we, but in the transition through that was plastic and that plastic could be

101
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:07,560
either hard plastic, which stays in your body, but it's still benign or, um, or a bioabsorbable tax,

102
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,880
which I have my own issues with, um, because it does create an inflammatory response in the body

103
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,280
and creates a little cavity in the bone and so forth. So, uh, those are, that's kind of the

104
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:25,640
spectrum. So now we are using tiny drills, tiny suture anchors, and you can put many in and that's

105
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,320
what's nice about if you have to do a revision of some failed repair, you've got plenty of real

106
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,480
estate to work with and it's nice, but one other aspect, which I think shows so much how we change

107
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:47,880
and, and I was right at that inflection point, not by choice, just by happenstance was the slap tears

108
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,960
were not appreciated as a clinically relevant entity, but a slap tear, which meaning, um,

109
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,440
so we'll have to tell people what the labrum is in a second, what a slap is, meaning it was

110
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,960
they just were viewed as just another type of labral tear. Yes, but one that was benign that

111
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,080
didn't matter. I see. And people were coming in, a lot of overhead athletes were coming in with

112
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,840
secondary problems as a result of that. And the secondary problems were being treated without

113
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,200
treating the underlying and they were having recurrent pain. So this is probably a good

114
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,680
pivot for us to back up and make sure people understand the anatomy. You know, sometimes when

115
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm explaining to my patients, um, which exposes my own naivete, I sort of say, look, I don't know

116
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,440
a lot about orthopedics, but to understand and appreciate the complexity of the upper extremity,

117
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,760
you have to appreciate what we did during evolution, right? And when we stood up,

118
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,760
you know, that became an enormous force multiplier. You know, if you think about this through the

119
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,480
lens of like warfare, you know, people talk about, you know, having night vision is a force multiplier

120
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,920
in war. Well, for us to be able to stand and walk with amazing efficiency on two legs was a few,

121
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,680
a force multiplier. And then also to have these incredible upper extremities, but you got to pay

122
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,480
a price for it. So the price, the way I describe it and feel free to correct me or make this more

123
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,800
nuanced, the price was stability, right? We paid an enormous price in these joints. So they're not,

124
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,520
you know, not as strong, not as stable. Would you agree with that? Is that, is that a fair assessment?

125
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,320
A hundred percent, a hundred percent. And you're spot on on that. And frankly,

126
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,960
that shows you do know something about orthopedics. But the fact is that, yeah,

127
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:41,720
we went from the ball and socket joints or the very stable, simple hinge joints to these,

128
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,800
these cup and saucer type joints, right? Specifically the shoulder, which is intrinsically

129
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,040
very unstable. And just, and also our opposable thumb, our opposable thumb is the base of it,

130
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,240
the basal joint is terribly unstable. It's just a, it's, we call it a by concave saddle,

131
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,200
but it's barely that there's really no intrinsic bony stability. And similar to the shoulder,

132
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,600
I mean, we use an analogy that's slightly off, but a golf ball on a tee. It's the tee is a little

133
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,720
bigger, a little bigger, but that's what it is. It's very flat and shallow. And so we can talk

134
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,160
about the anatomy. So let's do that in whatever way you think makes the most sense. Let's assume

135
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,000
the audience doesn't know the names of any of the bones, let alone what they look like. Doesn't

136
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,600
know the vasculature, the musculature, the innervation. What would be a reasonable way? And

137
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,200
we, I know you and I spoke, we were going to do this with models. In the end, you thought you

138
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,200
could probably do an easier job sketching for folks. So maybe let's have you explain slash

139
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,720
sketch through any of these things. That'd be perfect. That'd be great. And we're prepared

140
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,760
for that. We have some diagrams in it. So I'm going to take it off the visual and draw some

141
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,120
quick pictures. And this is what I do, frankly, for all my patients that I don't like the models

142
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,880
because well, they're just, they're just models. So I'm not saying I'm a great artist, but if we

143
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,800
just look at just the Glenoid, that's the socket. That's the golf tee, if you will. And then you add

144
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:17,160
a humeral head to it. And that is the humeral head. This portion

145
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,320
to the right of the dotted line is, is what's covered by cartilage. So that's the nice, smooth

146
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Teflon cartilage and this space. So just to orient folks, what you're looking at is head on to a person

147
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,920
if you're looking straight out, then this is the right head and that little space we're going to

148
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:44,200
talk about the Glenoid fossa is that flat end of part of the scapula, which is a real complex

149
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,320
looking triangular bone with a big ridge on it. And it, the collarbone attaches to it and all that

150
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,120
crazy stuff. But the, the, the, the, the high level point here is in the hip, you have the

151
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:06,520
acetabulum, which creates a true socket for a big ball. And here the, the heavy lifting really is

152
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:14,040
done by soft tissue, not bones. Right. You've got a joint that's completely contained like that in

153
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:21,160
the hip joint versus a shallow one that just can slip and slide all over the place. So you, you've

154
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,640
pointed out it's a great, it's the best way to describe the shoulder joint being a delicate

155
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,840
balance of, of mobility and stability. And it's very easy to get out of whack because it is

156
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,240
biomechanically so complicated. So I'm going to add a few more things here, but this space that

157
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,320
we see between here is not a space. It's the, it's the space radiographically when you're

158
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:57,480
looking, that's occupied by the cartilage. So you have a thick, nice layer of cartilage on both sides.

159
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,880
I've left a little gap just to be able to see it, but it's the articular cartilage effectively there.

160
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,760
So there's a layer of nice thick cartilage there that, and when we have arthritis, of course,

161
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:14,600
that gets worn down, shipped away, and begins to, to fissure and, and then actually develop full

162
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,040
thickness loss to the point where then at some point it's not really functioning very well,

163
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,160
and it's very painful. So if we have this basic bony cartilage structure here, it's just,

164
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,760
it would just fall off if, if we were just left there, let's say you had a, well, if you had no

165
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,720
ligaments, no, what we're going to call the labrum, which are some additional structure,

166
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,040
stabilizing structures, or if we had, if we have the muscle tendon units that supply,

167
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,880
that support it. So I'm going to draw in a few more of that, of those.

168
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,800
And while you're doing that, we'll just remind people that ligaments and tendons are not the same.

169
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,360
Tendons are the connective tissue that connects muscle to bone.

170
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,960
Ligaments are connective tissue that connect bone to bone. Is labrum connect considered a ligament,

171
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,200
or is it kind of considered its own entity? It's kind of its own entity. Yeah. It's a,

172
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:20,200
it's a, it's a, it has a transition zone between fibrous tissue to ossius bone tissue. So it's a

173
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,480
fibrous ossius structure. And I liken it to, to calamari. That's the best. And it's rubbery,

174
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,520
just like that. And it, and that's the best analogy that people seem to get. So I've drawn

175
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,200
on two of the four rotator cuff muscles here. This is the one up above and this is the one in front.

176
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,800
And this is the big muscle that allows us to reach behind our back and pull our hand away

177
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:54,600
from our back. And this is also the one that helps us along with the pectoralis in front to

178
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,040
pull things together, like doing flies and so forth. The supraspinatus is the primary muscle

179
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,840
that initiates elevation of the shoulder. So it's very, very important. It also, so what we see here

180
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:17,800
is this zone and from here and about through here is where the muscle transitions into tendon. Yeah.

181
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:24,840
And then it becomes pure tendon. And it just so happens that this tendon, the supraspinatus tendon,

182
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:33,880
which is so commonly torn is actually, um, there's some physiologic downsides to its location where

183
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,360
it can be rung out. It doesn't have a great blood supply. The key is it gets, let me put here

184
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,880
where those two arrows are is essentially where the tendon tears most of the time.

185
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,480
And those two, and that is the part that's attached to the bone. It gets blood supply from

186
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,520
that bone. It gets blood supply, it gets nutrients, it gets growth factors. So our goal, and this is

187
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,360
jumping ahead a little bit, our goal is to get that reattached to that bone so it can get

188
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,440
all of those growth factors and that new healing back. And it absolutely can heal back, but there

189
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,040
are certain limitations to that. So, so let's, there's two other muscles, right? So we've got

190
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,400
the supraspinatus and the subscapularis there. There's two other muscles that make up the rotator

191
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,120
cuff. And I think everyone's heard of the rotator cuff. Yes. And yet it's probably not obvious to

192
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,320
people that it's, it's really four muscles that are doing this. What are the other two? So the other

193
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,680
two are the infraspinatus and the teres minor. And if you, you can kind of superimpose them over the

194
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,200
subscapularis, but they're on the backside of the joint and they are very important. They are the

195
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:55,400
external rotators that they give us our backhand and tennis. They give us a lot of stability for

196
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,920
the shoulder itself. And especially whether you're playing golf or lifting weights, they're a dynamic

197
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,000
stabilizer. They're very important doing bench press, pushups, all sorts of activities like that.

198
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,800
Archery.

199
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:16,040
Archery. Yes. Very important. So, so when a person quote unquote tears their rotator cuff,

200
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,200
that can be a very heterogeneous diagnosis. I mean, technically that diagnosis would apply to

201
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,800
a tear in any of those four muscles, which could be in the muscle, could be at the junction between

202
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,360
the muscle and the tendon. And could it also be just a complete separation of the tendon from the

203
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,400
osteostructure of the bone? Yes. So, and that's, that's critical to identify what that is. And

204
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:48,280
you can somewhat predict it based on the age of the person and their physiology and the mechanism

205
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,680
of the trauma. So we have, and we do broadly cast classify these into degenerative tears

206
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:05,160
and traumatic tears. So younger people, it's rare to see a young person really under the age of 40

207
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,800
to tear the rotator cuff. It's pretty proportionally rare, but it happens and it happens

208
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,520
traumatically. One of the, I had a young fellow who worked as a merchant Marine years ago,

209
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,120
and he was doing something with the anchor and the massive chain and his glove got caught in that.

210
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,960
And it basically, it almost ripped his arm off, right? But he was, he was okay, except that he

211
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:36,440
had torn traumatically as a, as a young 20, I think he was 26 or so. It ripped off three of his

212
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,840
four muscles and it just, you know, they had to be repaired, but he was okay. But it's, it's that

213
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,960
rare, dramatic circumstance that leads to traumatic tears in young people. And someone that young,

214
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,920
where's the weak link? Does it tear at the muscle itself or does it tear more at the tendon? That's

215
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,920
a great question. That's a great question because the younger you are, the stronger that linkage of

216
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:10,920
the tendon to the bone. So you often pull off some bone. And so, um, in the case of, you know,

217
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,720
a skier's thumb, just a common injury in the hand from skiers, the younger you are, the more likely

218
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,960
it is to pull off with a piece of bone. And, and that's actually great because bone heals to bone

219
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,440
itself much better than tendon to bone. I see. If you can get away with that, there are fractures

220
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,640
that occur that involve this area. There's, and I'll draw a picture here, draw a squiggly line

221
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,720
to represent a fracture and then I'll show it coming off. Uh, and that's a, that's a common

222
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:49,640
fracture. So right here, what I've drawn is this chunk of bone coming off right here.

223
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,320
That's the greater tuberosity. It's a prominence of the bone that the two, the biggest portion of

224
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,040
the rotator cuff attaches the super spinetis and the infraspinatus that you referenced that pulls

225
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:10,200
off. And so I would rather have that than a big, I would rather pull that off and have a good

226
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:19,960
quality repair of that than have my two tendons. And tell me the type of athlete or person that

227
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,640
presents with the, the fracture that you've depicted. So these are generally that isolated

228
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,040
greater tuberosity is generally a fractured dislocation. So you have a pretty violent injury,

229
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,600
you're rock climbing, you fall off, you, maybe you hit it directly, your arm is wrenched back,

230
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,760
or you have, let's say a football player who, who has a traumatic dislocation. They're hidden just

231
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:52,120
the right way mechanically. And it shears that off. And then, um, so it's, it's often most often

232
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,160
associated with the dislocation as well. The dislocation goes back, but the, but the two

233
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,360
drops dislocation, meaning a subluxation of the shoulder. Yeah. And let's explain to folks what

234
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,720
that is, how that happens. I didn't realize that we could use the word dislocation and subluxation

235
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,200
interchangeably. Well, technically we don't. Oh, technically a subluxation is an incomplete

236
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,440
dislocation. It's the shoulder coming out, but it pops back in easily. Got it. So dislocation is

237
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,800
usually, it comes out and it needs to be put back in most often, unless it's recurrent, the more

238
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:33,160
dislocations one has, uh, or subluxations, the more stretchy and compliant the tissues become sort of

239
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,920
like mine. Yes. And so then it can kind of slip and slide back in and out, uh, with, with regularity.

240
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,240
Let me draw a different picture. Yeah. What I've done here is taken the, the humeral head away. So

241
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,200
we're just looking at the socket and we're looking at it on FOS. Okay. So if you're looking at me,

242
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:59,800
you took my humorous away and now you are looking directly at the socket of this glenohumeral. Yes.

243
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:07,640
Uh, yes. Perfect. So yes. And so this, the central circle front of the person is to the front. That's

244
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,600
interior. We speak about that in posteriors to the back. Yeah. Superior is up above. Inferior is

245
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:22,920
down below. So the classic, um, oh, and so importantly around the outside, that second circle

246
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:32,520
is the, the outline of the labrum. So from here to here is the labrum. And that's a rubbery

247
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,680
calamari like structure. I love that. I love that. And it, I mean, it, it's sort of, you get some bad

248
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,480
calamari that's really chewy. That's kind of what I haven't chewed on labor myself, but it's what it,

249
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,840
I imagine it would be behaved by. And it's very strong. It's very strong. And what it does,

250
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,400
it has an amazing, you were talking about the evolution when it became bipeds. It's super

251
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:04,120
cool because it effectively developed as a way to decrease the depth of the socket, not by very

252
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,640
much, but it truly works like a suction cup. If you take a non arthritic cadaver specimen and dissect

253
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,360
away all of the muscle, all the ligaments, and you stick it on the humeral head on the labrum, it'll

254
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:27,160
sit there. It's crazy. It's fascinating. But just like a thermometer on a window, if you lift,

255
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,120
get your finger, break that seal up, break it, seal it, it falls away. But that's what happens here.

256
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:40,440
So we get a lot of static stability in our shoulder from this, the superior inferior anterior and

257
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,800
posterior labrum. And just to be clear, in a non-pathologic state, when you have that, you know,

258
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,480
that young person who has yet to be, you know, experiencing any trauma of the shoulder,

259
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,080
is that a contained space of fluid that is between those two cartilaginous surfaces of the

260
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,880
glenoid fossa, the humeral head, fully contained? Because usually to have a suction you want,

261
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,560
there has to be a fluid that sort of contains it or air that's incompressible, which is technically

262
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,800
fluid. But I assume there is an aqueous fluid that's normally in there? Absolutely. Yeah. You

263
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,280
have a nice viscous joint fluid in all of our joints like that. That's a great question. And

264
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,160
yes, you couldn't have that suction. As soon as you poke a hole in that, you lose that.

265
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:27,800
So when a person has a subluxation, it doesn't necessarily tear the labrum, does it?

266
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:35,000
Correct. And that's another huge point that will, it factors into our treatment recommendations and

267
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,520
mechanisms of injury. If you are a young woman playing soccer, generally young women have

268
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,000
looser joints. Women in general have looser joints, which is part of our difference in

269
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,600
physiology. But, and actually because of the weird nature of the shoulders, there are men as well who

270
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,520
have super loose shoulders at baseline born that way. But in general, if you think of someone,

271
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:08,440
whether male or female, who has super loose joints, then they can sublux out in and out without

272
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,080
tearing anything. They just ride up over that because it's just loosey goosey. So the tighter

273
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,280
the shoulder is, the more you have to lose. What happens to the fluid when they sublux? Nothing,

274
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,160
because they have just a more- Okay. It stays- They have a more- It's just expansive. It's the ligaments.

275
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,560
The ligaments are stretchy and they're bigger. It's more like a balloon that you've

276
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,200
keep blowing up repeatedly. So, but if you have someone who has a basically a pretty stable joint,

277
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,200
not loosey goosey, and then they sublux, the only way you can do that is either tearing the ligaments,

278
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,520
but usually you're also tear the labrum. And what I mean by tearing the labrum is you separate the

279
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:59,080
labrum, the inner arc, from its hard bony cartilaginous, perfectly fused attachment. Very strong.

280
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,000
It takes a massive force to, to dislocate the shoulder. It actually does, or perfect mechanics.

281
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:14,440
And so if you, if you have the classic, you're reaching up to get a rebound and someone grabs

282
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:23,640
your arm and jerks it backwards, that's a leverage, an unnatural leverage that makes the head tend to

283
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,600
go out this direction anteriorly, inferiorly like this. So the head is going to go down this way.

284
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,400
Yeah. It just, it just leverages it out.

285
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,640
And that's also a vulnerability based on where the muscles attach, right?

286
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:44,440
Yes. Yes. Very much so. And we'll get to that as the dynamic stabilizers, but man, this,

287
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,920
this labrum is tough, but it tears off. This is the classic location where you tear the labrum

288
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:59,400
there. Okay. And it takes either a small tear that then is repetitively increased in size just from

289
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,840
aggressive, but repetitive use, or it takes a one time significant dislocation.

290
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:15,320
The attachments of the four rotator cuffs are basically behind, above, like it's, it's basically

291
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,200
like you've got a big one there kind of at nine o'clock. Right. That's a great question. You ask

292
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,000
perfect questions that I forget to cover.

293
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,080
So these are kind of the cross sections of the muscles that are just outside. So these

294
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,400
encompass and in, and in shroud, the joint, and this is the cross sectional muscle bellies. And

295
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,880
this is where they, and then as they, as you come further out toward the head, which is out here,

296
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:49,400
they taper down and form the tendons. Yeah. Yeah. And that's so important because no shoulder can be

297
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:56,680
stable alone just by these static stabilizers, the labrum and the ligaments. And the ligaments

298
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,240
kind of lie in between the labrum and the rotator cuff in here. So the, when you're referring to a

299
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,600
slap tear, you know, obviously slap stands for superior, labral, anterior, posterior. Yes, exactly.

300
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,560
And that is up here. That is the super, and that's a odd injury that we,

301
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:22,680
um, um, the first person that really taught this well to us was a fellow named Steve Snyder in,

302
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,720
in Northern California. And he really kind of categorized these and started identifying these

303
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,880
as really actually clinically relevant entities, not for everybody, but certainly for younger,

304
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,200
very athletic people, uh, overhead athletes, weight lifters, people doing CrossFit, people doing,

305
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:51,400
um, all manner of, um, a more aggressive, uh, sports. And so unlike, and if you have a tear here

306
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,880
and you're active, you're going to keep re-dislocating at least subluxating. That was me.

307
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,800
Correct. I was kind of all the way around, but big, big, anterior, uh, inferior. Right. So I don't

308
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,240
know what your first injury was. I mean, maybe, so we've, you've talked about this. I believe

309
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:17,720
it was a subluxation in boxing when I was probably 17. Um, it's, so there's two injuries I remember

310
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,800
having in high school. I can't remember which one was first. You might have a sense. One was doing

311
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,800
absurdly heavy military press. I think that was the second one. Truthfully. I think the first

312
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:35,720
subluxation was boxing and just bad timing. Pun, hard punch thrown, guy gets out of the way,

313
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,760
probably smacked my arm on the way and out it came. And I believe that would have been followed

314
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:48,120
up six months later. I'm doing very heavy weight for me overhead. And I just remember, boom,

315
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,400
it just popped out and down. Yeah. And then from that point on, it was a vicious cycle of

316
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,760
never ending subluxations with each couple of years having a really bad one. Another

317
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,640
really bad one I had was in an open water swim race. I was, you know, we're swimming freestyle,

318
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,960
right? So I'm in the reach phase with right arm in front and the swimmer in front of me

319
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,840
kick down on that arm, which is not, I mean, that's a bit of force, but not absurd, but just

320
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,320
the down kick of that arm took me out. Yeah. Um, so it's so funny. I mean, you were describing

321
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,880
so many great, I'm sorry, you had suffered from them all, but, but so many great and differing

322
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,520
types of mechanisms that happen. I agree with you that it probably was the boxing. I've seen a lot

323
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:41,720
of those, the recoil, and especially if you don't hit something, your, your body is anticipating

324
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,520
and it's tightened up and it is ready for contact and it doesn't have the contact. It's no different

325
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,840
than, you know, you, there's an extra step in front of you that you don't know about and you step

326
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,000
and you go, whoa. And then you feel like it shutters your whole body. It's the same concept.

327
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,760
Your body unconsciously knows what it needs to do. And so you probably did have a posture

328
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,000
subluxation. I mean, I will say, and you know this, and this was why it was so important for you is

329
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,040
you had a tear going all the way from posture all the way around to there. So you had about a

330
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,960
240 degree tear and that's, you don't get that from one injury. It's almost impossible.

331
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,200
So it basically became looser and looser over time. And then it just now had too much laxity.

332
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,280
It could basically move in any direction. Exactly. And you were, you were compensating

333
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,800
well for most of the time because you're, you're very fit. You're doing all the right

334
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,360
upper body, specifically shoulder strengthening exercises. So you are using your dynamic

335
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:51,160
stabilizers to compensate for the loss of the static stability. And that's a critical,

336
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,760
critical problem. And it fits too with your weightlifting. So yeah, you had, you had a tear,

337
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,800
you weightlifting, you were fine. But what happens is if you're going kind of maxing out

338
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,960
and you're doing it repetitively, the dynamic stabilizers fatigue. And I see this,

339
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,840
one of the most common scenarios is the young, more often female than male, but both swimmers.

340
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,120
Right. So they're competing and they have a little bit of, they need the stability,

341
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:26,760
especially if they're doing fly and backstroke. They really need that. And they acquire all this

342
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,720
laxity in their shoulder and they're so strong dynamically that they're, they're fine. And it

343
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,320
gives them that extra pull, that extra inch or two. But when they fatigue, but they start out

344
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,280
fine on a Friday, if they have a, you know, a weekend long match and they have eight events

345
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,480
in three days, um, the first two days they're fine. Maybe they have a little pain at the end

346
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,440
of the second day, by the third day they're fatigued. And so then they start subluxing and

347
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,240
then they get all this secondary inflammation and pain. And that's when the damage occurs

348
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,360
and they have to sit out. And then we have to restrengthen rehab, sometimes even tighten up

349
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,080
the capsule when they get so loose. Now, one of the things I, uh, we're going to, you know,

350
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,560
talk about here is of course the physical exam on this, because the other thing we haven't talked

351
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:18,280
about on this diagram is that little pesky biceps head. Yes. And that tendon, um, boy,

352
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:26,760
if anybody who's experienced tendinosis there, uh, I mean, that's, that can be incredibly painful.

353
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,200
And I think to an average person, it's not entirely clear where that pain is coming from.

354
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,600
If they feel pain here, right? Right. That's a great point. And so yes, the biceps, which is a

355
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,800
weird structure and it's absolute part of that weird evolution that we have, the biceps is

356
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,200
one muscle in our arm, but, but it's two tendons at the, at the origin, which in the shoulder,

357
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,360
one of the tendons. So starts down here, single, single point of attachment in the, in the, in the

358
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,640
forearm, actually crosses the joint as one muscle and then kind of splits into two bellies with.

359
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,800
Exactly. And it has the long head, which is the one that so often gets inflamed and you're

360
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,680
absolutely right. It can be quite painful. I mean, and it can just affect every day life with that.

361
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,360
And the second tendon peels off over here and it goes outside the joint and attaches to a bony

362
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:26,360
prominence in that weird scapula that you talked about, which is such a weird looking bone. Um,

363
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,880
and it attaches there. That never tears. It literally never tears. Uh, so, but people often

364
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,680
do tear the other, this biceps and it can be from wear and tear. It can be acute dramatically,

365
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:45,080
but it leads to a classic Popeye muscle kind of half their muscle is, is balled up and that looks

366
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,120
weird. It's not really that much of a functional consequence. Usually it stops hurting when it

367
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:58,760
ruptures. And if I'm not mistaken, I mean, this has been, um, uh, in the orthopedic sort of, uh,

368
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:07,000
anecdotes for a long time was, um, great quarterback, um, from Denver, um, John Elway. John Elway.

369
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,480
He was having shoulder pain and was even thinking about retiring as far as I know his ruptured pain

370
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,640
went away and then he won another Super Bowl. So yeah, so it's not, it's a, it's a structure that's

371
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,920
not necessary, but it's, but, and there's a lot of argument in orthopedics and I don't need to go

372
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,280
into it about how important it really is. But the fact is it is anchored right up here at the superior

373
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,760
labrum. So when you tear that super labrum, that biceps does funky things. It becomes unstable and

374
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,560
it, and it gets more inflamed often. And then that you get all that secondary pain. So some people,

375
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm not one of them, some people who fix a lot of these will automatically just snip that biceps and,

376
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,480
and reattach it in the front. So it's not no longer a pain generator. So that's the tendinesis. Yes,

377
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,080
that's the tendinesis, but I don't do that. I do that only when I see tearing, splitting,

378
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,400
something structurally wrong with the biceps. I know that I can get a good repair as any,

379
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,720
any good surgeon can a good repair of the superior labrum. Once that's stable, the biceps is fine

380
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,000
again. It's not, it's no longer symptomatic and I'm not going to worry about it. I haven't had to

381
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,400
go back and tend to tease anyone who I had just repaired and left it intact. As long as I got a

382
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,720
good superior labral repair. So because we've got the beautiful anatomy here, let's go a little

383
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:32,120
deeper into this because I feel like the torn labrum is to the MRI with the disc herniation.

384
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,760
There is to the shoulder with the disc herniation is to the back, right? You know, we tell our

385
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:43,640
patients, I almost wish when I give you an MRI for another reason, I could ask the radiologist

386
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,280
not to show me your spine. In other words, you take somebody who's not having no spine issues

387
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,560
and you stick them in the spanner. There's nothing that bugs me more than having to sit there and

388
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,960
go through all of these asymptomatic herniations, which mean nothing. And I suspect the shoulder

389
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,480
with its labral tear has to be the same. Yes. You're absolutely spot on. And it is such a point

390
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,760
of frustration. The radiologists are doing their job. Of course. They're just reading everything.

391
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:18,840
The problem is that most of us walking around have, especially for my age, have plenty of

392
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:25,560
positive findings, but they're asymptomatic. I mean, I've never had a spine or originated symptom.

393
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,880
And so that's your, it's a very double edged sword to get those MRIs. Same thing in the labrum.

394
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,240
The labrum will naturally degenerate just by using it. So will the cartilage. And look,

395
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,080
every, we know there's a genetic predisposition to arthritis and by arthritis, I mean,

396
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:48,760
not just inflammation of the joint, but a true loss of the cartilage integrity. And that's kind

397
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,600
of those two terms are used interchangeably by different people in different subspecialties. But

398
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:02,120
for our purposes as an orthopedic surgeon, it's when the joint is degenerating and the cartilage

399
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,280
surfaces are no longer pristine, just like you're chipping the paint on your car.

400
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:13,400
And does that occur preferentially on the humeral head or in the glenoid fossa, or is it basically

401
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,440
one of those things where the second you get one chip, it's going to start happening on both sides?

402
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,200
Yeah, that's a great question too. You know, it's, we don't have a good natural history of that. We

403
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:31,240
know that, I mean, I've operated on, done total shoulders on people who had no cartilage left on

404
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,680
their humeral head. It was perfectly round and smooth. There was no cartilage left.

405
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:42,440
It was just a bony, just pure soft, I mean, pure hard ivory type bone with no cartilage on it.

406
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,520
Whereas the glenoid still had cartilage on it. Now that's a case where to your point, the loss

407
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,000
on the humerus was smooth enough and gradual enough to where it didn't dig in and, and sort of

408
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,480
eat away at the glen, the socket. It doesn't matter. You still have to replace the socket,

409
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:09,560
but we do for our younger athletic people who have a humeral head that's been damaged

410
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,520
and they have a big chunk, maybe a quarter size, maybe a 50 cent piece size of cartilage,

411
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,120
full cartilage loss. That's not great because that man, that just keeps sloughing off cartilage.

412
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,240
They keep getting inflamed. They're on the young side. You don't want to do a shoulder

413
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:30,280
replacement on them. So we will do just a humeral head resurfacing. They have a, get a nice new,

414
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:37,320
smooth metal head, but we leave the car, the, the glenoid intact and, and they have good cartilage

415
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,720
there. So it's, it's metal on natural cartilage. Yeah. What kind of metal is that by the way?

416
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,800
It's cobalt chromium alloys. So it's just like the hips. Yeah. And, and the nice thing about those

417
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,960
is if you can get five years, I have some people that have been, had those in 10 years and they're

418
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,080
fine and they're, they're keep their act, they can be much more aggressive with their activities.

419
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,680
And if it ever, if it ever does wear down the, the glenoid side, then you just go back in and

420
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:12,040
revise it and put a plastic cup for the glenoid. Yeah. So let's now talk about when you look at the

421
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:18,440
MRI finding and what you're looking for in the MRI and then how you're looking to contrast that

422
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,160
with what you see on the physical exam. And in a moment I'll have you examine me so you can,

423
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,480
and we'll do this for all of the pathology we talk about so that we can get a sense of this.

424
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,800
Cause I remember the very first time I saw you after having sent many patients to you,

425
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,080
it was probably a year before I had my surgery. I said, look, you know, Alton, I know I've got this

426
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,760
labrum. It's been torn to shreds for years. I really don't want to have surgery unless I need

427
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:52,520
to. You examine me and said, yeah, you're not ready yet. So yeah, walk through how you start to test

428
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,480
the surrounding structures to elicit sort of feedback on the labrum. Right. So I will preface

429
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,840
that by saying, I'm so glad you brought that up because we, one should never make their clinical,

430
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:14,120
especially surgical decision-making on just an MRI. And I've written a couple of book chapters on

431
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:20,360
that included a very complete examination of the shoulder, the basic exam, the provocative maneuvers

432
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,600
and so forth. And one of the things I've always stayed, I've never done this study. I've always

433
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,040
wanted to, but I believe that a good history and that involves the mechanics of injury

434
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,320
and the mechanics of use, whether you're, you're shooting a bow and arrow, whether you're driving

435
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,000
a race car, whether you're playing basketball, whether you're just lifting weights, a combination

436
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,200
of the mechanism, but also their symptoms when they have them and then their examination. And I

437
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:56,120
think if you do those compulsively and well, you will be 95% accurate on your, without any MRI.

438
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,560
I remember one of the things that had changed, because for me, remember, archery, the day before

439
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,960
I'm having surgery, I'm out there taking a hundred shots. That was never the issue. But in the months

440
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:12,040
leading up to surgery, I couldn't serve a volleyball with my daughter. I couldn't shoot one basket.

441
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,360
Like we, you know, I could not do that. And then I could pull a 75 pound bow back. Yeah.

442
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:23,320
Doesn't make sense. It doesn't. And it's just the mechanics of each individual. And that's where the

443
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:30,200
MRI does come in. I use MRIs more to corroborate. I would say, and I don't think I'm, maybe I'm

444
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,840
a little more into sort of the concept of making an accurate diagnosis before the MRI.

445
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:43,560
Kind of the old school. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To kind of prove a point. But, but I, I always use it to

446
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,960
corroborate because there are things that can be there and especially even just the difference

447
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,400
between a partial thickness rotator cuff tear and a full thickness or a full thickness small

448
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,040
and a full thickness large. And, and those are variable based again on the patient's activities.

449
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:07,240
Some, we know from good studies done with ultrasound and MRI that walking down the street,

450
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:15,480
the half the people age 60 have rotator cuff tears. Half the people over 60 have an asymptomatic torn

451
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,200
rotator cuff. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'll be big, but it can be. I've seen people. I mean, I don't doubt

452
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,760
it just based on what we see of herniations in the C spine and the L spine. And that's where,

453
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,200
to your point, it comes in. It's so important that yes, we don't want something. We don't want

454
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:38,920
to ignore something that can get much worse and make their treatment or recovery much more

455
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,560
difficult. But at the same time, we need to be more circumspect about who we're operating and who

456
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:50,280
we're not operating on. Are there ever situations where, I'll give you an example, right? So I mean,

457
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,880
I'm asking, I'm going to ask this question obviously on the shoulder, but if a patient

458
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,040
came in and had a totally asymptomatic aortic aneurysm of six centimeters, everybody agrees

459
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,520
you would operate because the mortality of a rupture is enormous. And frankly, you don't want

460
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,160
to wait until somebody's symptomatic that can be lethal. So there are certainly indications where

461
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,840
we operate on asymptomatic things. Are there any such indications in the shoulder? Oh, that's a,

462
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:23,480
that's a great, great question. I would say in general, no, unless you have obviously a tumor.

463
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,440
Not including oncology. Just the standard garden variety,

464
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:36,040
structural injuries that can occur. There are very few except if you've had someone who had,

465
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,240
well, I'll give you a good example. That's very personal to me. My dad, who he passed away at

466
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:47,720
95, we were swimming in Lake Travis when he was 94 and a half. He's really vigorous, mentally fit,

467
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:54,040
physically fit. And, but he did end up having pancreatic cancer and that's what killed him at

468
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:01,880
95. Great life. No, no complaints with anybody. But at 86, being a guy who could still do pull-ups,

469
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,640
who was still swimming in the lake, who does guys, my hero, all his own yard work, everything. And he

470
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,880
was running to get out of the way of the sprinkler, did a banana peel that had a dislocation of his

471
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,920
shoulder, ripped off two and a half of his four tendons. And remember one of them never tears. So

472
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,520
almost his complete functional rotator cuff. He was planning to come up to New York to visit.

473
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:31,240
And we did a little FaceTime and he couldn't lift his arm. It was like this. And I, and he's 86,

474
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,640
but healthy, never took a medication, so forth. So I said, dad, you need to come up early. We're

475
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,840
going to need to fix this. So we'll get an MRI, come up here. And so my partner and I fixed him.

476
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,120
And regional anesthesia, they didn't even give him much sedation. He was like talking to us during

477
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:54,760
the surgery. Got a good six anchor repair. He had great tissue to the point that you've,

478
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:03,240
you've just helped so many of us understand, but got a good solid repair at 95 and 94. You couldn't

479
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,400
tell he ever had a tear. He healed it back. He was, he went back to doing everything.

480
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,440
And what would have been the natural history, because I think a lot of doctors might have

481
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,840
left him alone. What would, how would he have evolved? Thank you. That's, that was the point.

482
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,160
If I, he would have been miserable for the next nine years of his life because he couldn't lift

483
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,560
his arm. It might not even have been that painful, but he wouldn't have been able to do everything

484
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,440
he wanted to do that kept him so far. So in other words, pain is not a pain, shouldn't be the only

485
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,840
symptom we look for. We have to look for function. No. And so what I would tell someone who came in,

486
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:38,120
let's say someone had a bad traumatic, a motor vehicle accident, and they tore their rotator cuff

487
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:45,240
at a badly and there were 60, 65. Would I tell them you absolutely have to have repaired? No,

488
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,800
but I would also tell them, look, if you don't repair this, those muscles have lost their

489
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:56,600
muscle tendon connection. So they're going to atrophy. And later, if you, I know you're not

490
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,360
painful now, but if you want to still do the things you're doing and the way you do them

491
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,160
before this accident, they need to have a repair. So this is effectively the discussion you had with

492
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:12,440
one of the patients I sent you six months ago who tore a rotator cuff playing tennis many years ago.

493
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:19,240
And basically once this patient stopped playing tennis, they had no more pain. So today they do

494
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,520
yoga and Pilates with no pain, but they can never pick up a racket again. I sent the person to you

495
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:30,120
and that's basically what you said was you don't have to have this fixed, but you will see a

496
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,200
continued diminution of your function as you age. Right. Exactly. And the second caveat,

497
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,720
which I'll tell them is, you may start having symptoms in six months, even doing those other

498
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,600
things. And if you do come back, don't ignore them. If you start having symptoms when you've

499
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,240
been asymptomatic, something has changed anatomically, physiologically, or something,

500
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:59,080
let's reassess. It's not a dynamic state over a long period of time. And so

501
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,400
you need to be flexible in that and as a clinician. So when a patient typically comes in,

502
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:15,000
basically they're just saying, Doc, my shoulder hurts. So again, on the exam, absent even an MRI,

503
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:21,000
we're going to show people how you can just based on where I'm weak or strong and what hurts.

504
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,040
You probably have a pretty good sense of this person has an intact cuff versus they don't.

505
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,920
This person has a labral instability versus they don't. This may actually just be bicep

506
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:36,600
tendon injury versus not. What else is on your differential diagnosis in the exam? You don't

507
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,280
have the MRI yet. The guy just says he's got shoulder pain. That's great. I'm going to draw

508
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:48,840
another picture. Okay. So I've drawn the shoulder again. I've added on a couple of things. I've

509
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:55,960
added on the clavicle, the collarbone, and I've added on this other structure up here, which is

510
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,760
the bony structure. If you tap on the top of your shoulder, that's the bony roof of the shoulder.

511
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:09,240
That's the acromion and yet another part of that super weird scapula. Okay. So the, the joint that

512
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,640
when you hear about someone separating their shoulder, it's this joint right here, which is

513
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:22,600
the acromioclavicular joint. And that is just a, it, it only rotates about 20 degrees. It's just a,

514
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,520
the way I liken this, especially being in Texas, you can talk about it because there's a lot of

515
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:33,240
car lovers and you know about it as a major car lover driver is it effectively is a McPherson

516
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,800
strut on, on a car. So it's a stabilizer bar. If you don't have those and there are people that

517
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:47,160
are born without, um, collarbones, they can bring their shoulders completely together right here in

518
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,840
the center, just like this. It's kind of super cool. Um, but it, it holds those out. So that's why,

519
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:58,760
you know, it's the one most commonly injured in cyclists who, who, who wipe out because they

520
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,840
fracture here because they land on the outside of their shoulder. But the AC joint, the acromioclavicular

521
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,440
joint is what happens when people separate their shoulders, which is also different from a

522
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,680
dislocation, different from dislocation. That's usually from a force coming down from the top.

523
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,280
So we're pitched forward. We land on the point of our shoulder and it jams it down. And we can talk

524
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,880
about that later. It's super interesting, but this acromion again is the bony roof and under that

525
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:33,640
roof is where the rotator cuff glides. And let me draw this. So I'm just drawing the arrows back

526
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,600
and forth arrows here. So as the head rotates back and forth around, the rotator cuff is attached

527
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:45,800
here and it goes back and forth here. So it's rubbing or moving underneath this. Any place in

528
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,600
our body that there's two structures and uh, anatomically in the limbs that move differentially

529
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,360
with one another, there's usually a bursa that forms in between. And so that bursa is here,

530
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:06,920
I'll draw it in green. That bursa lives right in there. And so it's just the thin filmy structure

531
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:12,520
that can thicken up and become very inflamed and become bursitis. And that's very painful.

532
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,360
So that's a common common diagnosis. Because otherwise the purpose of that is to allow these

533
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,960
things to glide past each other frictionless. Yes. Perfect. Yes, exactly. And then some of us

534
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:30,280
are born with an extra kind of down sloping of that acromion or a bone spur, or we acquire it

535
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,040
from repetitive athletic use. There are multiple reasons. If you have a big though bird beak coming

536
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,720
down and pointing into that, you can imagine if this is running back and forth there, it's

537
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:46,520
irritating the bursa creating bursitis. And it's also frictionally rubbing against the rotator cuff

538
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:53,960
tendon and you can get bursal sided upper part rotator cuff tears from that alone. I know because

539
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:00,840
I had, wow, I had a big spur like that in my shoulder. So to be clear, the spur occurred

540
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,600
because you were genetically predisposed to it based on the shape of the bursa. Yes. That's

541
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,040
really great that you said that you know, you should have been an orthopedic surgeon.

542
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,800
You can have a type one, a type two or a type three acromion. Type one is totally flat. That's

543
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,680
the majority of people. Type two, the second most common in type three is about, I don't remember

544
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:29,720
the exact numbers, but certainly it's not rare. I, 30% of people. And that's the one that really

545
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,000
predisposed you if, but only if you're an overhead athlete or lifting weights overhead or doing all

546
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:43,480
sorts of, you know, aggressive things. If you're sedentary, actuary who doesn't exercise, then

547
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,280
you'll never have a problem because you're just not repetitively loading it enough to wear down

548
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,600
or cause a tear. This is so, so interesting because you know, you'll often hear people talk about,

549
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:03,080
um, you know, well I can do so and so, and I've never had an issue, therefore it's okay. Right.

550
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,920
So if you're, if you have the top acromion there, you can probably get away with a lot more overhead

551
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,600
activity. And you might look at somebody who's in category three, every time they do excessive

552
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,640
overhead activity gets injured and you might be saying, well, like there's something wrong with

553
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,400
you. The round of it is it would be interesting if we sort of knew these things in advance and we

554
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,120
could maybe modify and temper our activity around our genetics effectively. Absolutely.

555
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,760
It's a super cool concept. I've always thought about that, that, that stuff, the predisposition,

556
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,080
and I'm not talking about a genetic predisposition to arthritis. I'm, you're talking about this is

557
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,080
anatomics, the mechanics and anatomy. And you're absolutely right. It's so important.

558
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:47,080
I'll give you another example of it. I know just from having MRIs for other reasons, I have a very

559
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:55,320
congenitally narrow C-spine. So I just don't have any wiggle room. And as a result of that,

560
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:04,360
I take my sort of tech neck protocol very seriously. Yes. You know, I also know that

561
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:10,120
I already have two small herniations. Now luckily they aren't doing anything to me, but

562
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:16,360
I know that nobody's going to go in and remove one without doing the other, which means they'd fuse

563
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:22,440
me out of the gate. Right. So, you know, I think knowing that is very helpful because what it tells

564
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:28,920
me to do is you're going to do a lot of sort of rehabilitative exercises even before having the

565
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,760
injury. Yes. And you know, I actually think it's very fortunate that I'm no longer a surgeon. Yeah.

566
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,480
Because I think a lot of my colleagues from surgery have ended up having neck surgery.

567
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,240
Oh yes. Because you're in this position all the time. Yes.

568
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:48,760
So yeah, I do. I think this is a very interesting idea. I'd never thought about it

569
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:56,200
in the orthopedic context, in the joint context that is. Yeah. And, you know, the other thing I

570
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,400
thought of when you said that is that when you have a, but this has been studied in the spine a

571
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,440
little bit, right? So if you have a congenitally narrow asthenotic spine and you're playing

572
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:12,120
football, you're way more at risk for catastrophic spinal cord injury. Yeah. Blunt, blunt, blunt cord injury.

573
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:17,880
So if you've had, that's why when we were, I was team doctor for almost 15 years at a college up in

574
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:24,120
New York and you know, you, everybody doesn't screen these guys, but if you have your first

575
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:30,200
stinger, then you need to be, need to be screened and see if you are. And if you are, then you have

576
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,120
a very serious discussion about what you're subjecting your neck to. There are a lot of,

577
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,600
a lot of sports to play and you don't necessarily have to be, you know, butting heads at high

578
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:44,440
velocity, you know? So, so that's exactly true there, but you're right. It hasn't been done in

579
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,440
the shoulder and yeah, it'd be a simple, easy screen and say, Oh, you know, I mean, I don't.

580
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,640
Well, especially I think when you take about, when you talk about kids who have lots of

581
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:57,400
athletic potential and they're 11 years old and you know, maybe there is a decision to be made.

582
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,280
Are you going to be a pitcher? Are you going to be a tennis player? Are you going to be a basketball

583
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,120
player? Are you going to play lacrosse? You're going to swim. If you knew you'd have a longer

584
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,600
shelf life in one over the other, would that at least weigh into the decision-making process?

585
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:15,000
That's fascinating. I love the way your mind works because yes, there are plenty of multi-sport

586
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,720
athletes who have ability and, and, and you could do an assessment. For instance, if you are,

587
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:27,880
yeah, if you're a, if you have super loose joints, then you're going to need to pick the ones that

588
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,880
you can keep dynamically stabilized, but are not going to be subjected directly to unnecessary

589
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,640
forces. Yeah. Yeah. It's great concept. So I'm guessing Alton, you drew this to expand our

590
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,120
understanding of the anatomy to then appreciate the shoulder pain that somebody shows up with.

591
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,240
Yes. So all these things that I've drawn on here can be pain generators. And another one,

592
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:57,320
which is exactly to the point we're talking about is this, this right here, the AC joint,

593
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,440
almost everybody through wear and tear middle age and beyond has arthritis in the AC joint.

594
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,440
And like we were talking about in the neck, it's almost always asymptomatic, but it can be

595
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,120
symptomatic. If it's, sorry, just to be clear, the little red structure you've drawn on there,

596
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:19,000
that ligament that is connecting the clavicle to the acromion, there's no fluid within that space.

597
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,120
Tiny amount. Any place there's cartilage, there's a tiny amount of fluid, but there's very little,

598
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,880
but it can expand. And it can, and so if it's arthritic, you can get more fluid. If you have,

599
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:38,760
you know, young weight lifters like you were, can, I'll draw it here, can develop in the end of the

600
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,680
clavicle from that repetitive, but not doing heavy bench and other types of activities can develop

601
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,840
distal clavicle osteolysis, that repetitive jamming or bruising of the bone and cartilage

602
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:56,920
causes the cartilage to disintegrate and the bone to lose its integrity. And it starts to kind of

603
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,040
get very soft and it gets very inflamed. As soon as you start breaking up cartilage,

604
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,200
all the macrophages from the body come in there and then you get a big inflammatory response. You

605
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,280
get a lot of extra fluid and a lot of pain. So from a chronic perspective, are you going to see

606
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,960
that more in somebody doing bench press or military press or which direction? Both, but you'll also

607
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,520
get it. I don't do these. I don't recommend it. My patients do them, but the people who love to do

608
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:26,760
heavy lat raises, that just jams up. It's just so much leverage on that, that joint. And if you

609
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,640
are to do it, I recall you, you're sort of more in favor of, if you're going to do it, thumbs are up,

610
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:38,600
not down. Yeah. And not directly lateral. More in the natural plane of the scapula. Exactly. That

611
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:44,200
minimizes stresses. The other thing about it is that joint, you can imagine it's like you under,

612
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,400
you're understanding the biomechanics. You lie directly on the point of your shoulder and it

613
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:54,200
jams that against. So they have a lot of pain there. That pain comes right down the front,

614
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:58,200
kind of follows the biceps. So you have to differentiate that between the two. Then you

615
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,760
look at an x-ray without an MRI or anything. And you see these spurs that are down there. Well,

616
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,240
those spurs aren't ever going to tear the rotator cuff because that's that tendon is out there. It

617
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,480
never gets that far, but it rubs you. We see it as an indentation in the muscle. So, you know,

618
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:19,480
every time you're working out, you know, you hypertrophy your muscles. And so if you have that

619
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,800
constantly rubbing there and then you hypertrophy around it, it's a true.

620
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,680
So that's an athlete who complains that when they're lifting, it hurts more.

621
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:34,040
Exactly. Exactly. And that's a crystal clear when they're, when they're relaxed,

622
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,040
they haven't been exercising, they have rock solid strength. If you get them after,

623
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,920
if you get them up into positions or if they've been working out, you test them,

624
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,920
they'll actually be weak. Not because they're truly weak, but because their brain is saying,

625
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,160
no, I'm not going to give you that. It's going to hurt me. It's going to hurt my body. So I'm not

626
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,520
going to give you enough electrical current to give you a full strength there.

627
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,760
Wow. You know, this reminds me when I was in medical school, once I decided I was going to

628
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,520
go into surgery, I read a book and I wish I could remember the name of it, but it was a book written

629
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:06,760
by a general surgeon who had long since passed away, but the entire book was based on diagnosing

630
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,000
appendicitis. And, you know, this was, this guy wrote, cope. Yes. Appendice. That's right.

631
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,720
That's early diagnosis of appendicitis. And I thought this was the most fascinating thing

632
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,120
in the world because you had this old school, old school general surgeon who said, you know,

633
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:28,440
this is before anyone was using a CT, but he was like, this is 100% a clinical diagnosis.

634
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,640
And you wouldn't, nobody today training would ever dream you could waste an entire book

635
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,440
to diagnose something that, by the way, incredibly prevalent. It's the single most prevalent condition

636
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,000
in general surgery when you just shove everybody in the scanner and get the answer today.

637
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,800
But the reality of it is this, this makes me think of copes appendicitis. A, this is more

638
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:54,280
complicated. And two, I don't think there'll ever be a substitute for the nuance of the exam.

639
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:59,720
And this the history, both the history of the injury and the history of what causes pain.

640
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:04,280
Yeah. Yeah. It's fascinating. I love that. And we're going to come up with Barron's, you know,

641
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:13,640
well, the guy that, that was my cope was our professor of cardiology at Tulane. He was super

642
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,080
old when he was teaching us, he was in his eighties at that time. That's not super old,

643
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:26,760
but back then, yes. And he had had, he had had, he had had thyroid cancer. So he, he spoke in a,

644
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,840
in a very hushed tone. His name was C Thorpe Ray and he was a cardiologist. He could diagnose,

645
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:40,120
he could tell you exactly what was wrong with which valve just by listening to with his

646
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:45,560
testico with his hand. Sometimes he just put his ear up there and exactly he could tell by the

647
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,400
nature of the subtle variations in the heart murmurs, what the diagnosis, what I just,

648
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:57,560
Yeah. This is a little off topic, but I do sort of lament the fact that that's a dying art.

649
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,600
And look, you know, the reality of it is I'm sure that today with echo and stuff were better. And he

650
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,680
was probably such an outlier that most people could never rise to that level, just like most

651
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:15,000
people could have never attained the clinical acumen of, of code. But it is a little bit sad

652
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,200
to think that, you know, we can't have both, right? It would be, you have to think it would

653
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:26,120
be great to have both. So it's interesting to think that in orthopedics, it might be one of those

654
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:33,560
specialties where this judgment of the exam is still really, really relevant.

655
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,680
Right. That's right. I mean, obviously you get pinpoint diagnoses with the various tests.

656
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,760
And in orthopedics, there's plenty of things you find that aren't symptomatic, but still thinking

657
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:52,600
back to, I do lament that as well about the loss of the clinical acumen that, that comes with all

658
01:05:52,600 --> 01:06:01,320
the advanced imaging. And, but I think that if you knew, if you have both, we don't, and I don't say

659
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,280
this self-servingly in the sense of I want to keep doing what I do as long as I can, because I love

660
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:15,160
it. But we, our patients need us to be able to still diagnose, listen to them, hear what they're

661
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,880
saying, because I mean, I don't know anything about general surgery, but there's got to be

662
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,240
things that come up positive that you don't necessarily have to have surgery on. Right.

663
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:28,280
Absolutely. And so you want to still be hearing and perhaps examining, but certainly hearing the

664
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:33,160
patient's story and knowing what's really going on to determine whether they need surgical or

665
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,560
non-surgical care or what kind of care they need. I feel like that was something that was,

666
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,320
if you were paying attention in residency, I think that was a very important message. I think

667
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:49,000
when you start residency, you're just so preoccupied with mastering the technical side of

668
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,560
things. I mean, there's so much to learn. It's, it's, it's like learning to master an instrument

669
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,200
and learn a new language at the same time. And you've only got five years to do it. But I

670
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:05,320
definitely remember the wisdom that was sort of spoken down to us, which is the single most

671
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,480
important thing that you will learn is when to operate and when not to operate.

672
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,520
Yes, that's true. That's true.

673
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,880
And, and, and, you know, I don't know how long that takes.

674
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,280
My guess is it's well after you finish your residency.

675
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,920
But unfortunately, and I don't want to go down this rabbit hole too much, but unfortunately,

676
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,960
there's. And there's some people who don't learn that.

677
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,520
Some people don't learn it or ignore it. And there are plenty of people who will operate

678
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:39,400
on any MRI, whether it's orthopedics or probably general surgery. I don't know whether it's.

679
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:47,640
We had one surgeon who the joke was if you rubbed betadine on the wall, he would operate on the wall.

680
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,680
Just, just don't, don't, don't let betadine near the wall. Right.

681
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,640
Because he'll start cutting it.

682
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,760
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. And that's, that's a perfect way to say it without being too pejorative.

683
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,320
And yeah, and there are economic incentives. There are even, and these are a version of

684
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:10,120
economic incentive, but there is even incentives in big institutions where it's an RV, RV, RVU,

685
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:15,080
RVU concept where you're going to do more because that's how you get your promotion and so forth.

686
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:21,160
And it makes it, I have to just suppress that information because it makes me too cynical.

687
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:30,840
And sad, but it's actually happens. And I'm sure you did when you were doing surgery. And I

688
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,160
certainly do now. I see patients that walk in with their MRI all the time and say, I'm scheduled for

689
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:42,760
this surgery in my shoulder or my elbow. And I'm scheduled for this by just my friend said,

690
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:47,640
I should just come get one more opinion. And I say, look, I'm looking at you, I examine them,

691
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,120
I do everything I go through. And I say, look, I wasn't there at the time of your examination.

692
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:58,440
So I can't speak for what that person saw and what their, their statement is. But today,

693
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:05,000
based on your MRI, your history and your physical exam, which I've done, I will not operate on you.

694
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,520
And if your friend said you should come to me because I have decent operative skills,

695
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:15,880
that's, I'm sorry, but I won't, I can't in good conscience operate on you. Maybe someday,

696
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,360
but not now. And I feel like I've sent you patients where that's been the patients that

697
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,320
have come from out of the country. And it's been a, I know that this surgeon is saying,

698
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:29,240
so I just want all to have a second look. Yeah. And you know, and that's,

699
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,360
I've never met a patient who didn't appreciate that, by the way. I mean, sometimes it creates

700
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,400
more confusion. Right. But, and I say that, I say, look, I'm sorry if this confused you. I'm sorry

701
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,360
if this is complicating your, your trajectory of what you you're planning for, but that's just

702
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:50,920
the truth. And yeah, the thing you always have to remember as a patient. And I think of this

703
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:57,880
myself is once you commit to doing something, it's the inertia to do it is huge. Right. And you can

704
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:05,640
always just say, look, there's an asymmetry in this decision to not have surgery doesn't remove

705
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,440
any options. You get to have surgery again later if it was the right thing to do. Yes.

706
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,160
Once you have surgery, it's not that you can't have surgery again, but the operative field never

707
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,960
looks the same a second time. That's a very good point. And so you want to keep in mind the asymmetry

708
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:25,240
of a pause. Yeah, that's very true. Very true. Right. So let's go back to our shoulder pain

709
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:31,880
patient. I think one thing we've established so far is a patient that has shoulder pain

710
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:38,040
can have so many things going on. Their AC joint can be the problem. They could have bursitis.

711
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,600
They could have a rotator cuff injury. They could have a labral injury. They could have

712
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,680
bicep tendon inflammation. And let's just leave it at that. They could have arthritis. We've got

713
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,800
all of these things that are going on. Now arthritis would usually be accompanied by one

714
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,920
of these other things that predisposed it. Okay. So we're going to go through an exam

715
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:03,560
and you're going to basically run me through these are the things you do. And this is what you look

716
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:10,760
to see on the MRI to basically correlate your findings and give you a set of confidence as you

717
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:16,120
go into the operating room. You named the bulk of them. I want to add two things to that before we

718
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:26,600
do our exam. And one of them I've drawn just kind of a red arc down there. And what I'm showing

719
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:33,320
there is the capsule. That's the best place to see the capsule when you're looking at an MRI

720
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:39,560
because it's thicker there and it's more distinct. There's not other structures obscuring it.

721
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:47,880
Normally if you have a super loose joint, you can have a very capacious capsule like that that

722
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,440
allows it to flop down and even sublux or dislocate. When it's very high and tight and

723
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,880
thick there, that can be representative of something called adhesive capsulitis. And the

724
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:07,640
reason I say that is because that's so common, one, and two, it can conflate all sorts of diagnoses.

725
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:16,840
And the frozen shoulder is the layman term for adhesive capsulitis. We don't know why this

726
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:23,640
happens. It's super common. I see probably two or three new cases every week in my office. It's

727
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:30,040
that common. But it's multifactorial. It's worse like many things are if you have diabetes,

728
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:37,640
but you don't get it with more frequency if you have diabetes. But it is and it's a full spectrum

729
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,960
and there's a lot of misinformation about it because the original old literature said that,

730
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:50,120
oh, all of these just get better with time. Well, they don't all. We know they don't all. And

731
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,360
even a subset of them, in my practice, about only one out of five actually ever need surgery. And

732
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:01,880
we never do that at the beginning. And it's just a simple little 30 minute release of the capsule

733
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:09,080
and a reduction in the inflammation. And then they're so happy. But that's the exception.

734
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:15,880
80% do not need any surgery. They need some way to control the inflammation. They need really good

735
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:22,680
physical therapy and a home program and some teams for mostly mobility. Yes. For mobility.

736
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:27,800
That's why I'm saying that is because you can get a stiff shoulder if you have impingement,

737
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,440
if you have a big bone spur, because your brain says, I'm not going to let you live there. And

738
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,800
then it just gradually stiffens up. That's a secondary stiffness or adhesive capsulitis.

739
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:44,840
It's not the weird primary adhesive capsulitis that could happen to you or me just suddenly.

740
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:51,720
And it just happens. It's a spontaneous, intense inflammation in the lining, inner lining. If you

741
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,800
take a little camera and stick it in there and just look, you see it's beat red. Normally,

742
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,480
everything when you're an arthroscopy, everything's kind of off white. And, but in the case of it's

743
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:09,560
just beat red and it's crazy. And we, and people have done all sorts of, of laboratory tests,

744
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:15,960
biopsies, evaluations have happened over a long period of time. I mentioned to you, there's a

745
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,920
colleague of mine in Northern California that wants to talk to you because you're so smart in this

746
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,440
about frozen shoulder because that maybe thinks some of the things you've said

747
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:31,000
might overlap with that biochemically. Yeah. So I was going to say, what are the,

748
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,080
I mean, do these respond to NSAIDs or is this a part of the body that doesn't have enough of a

749
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:41,080
vascular supply in the capsule that you don't get enough penetration? It has a rich vascular

750
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,280
supply, but I think in this case, I give NSAIDs when people want them and they're afraid of an

751
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,560
injection, but I think you, because it's that inner lining and it's so robust, I mean, if you

752
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:58,760
look at it microscopically, it's just these angry red fronds. And, and I think it's just not strong

753
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:04,280
enough. So I like to put a small dose of cortisone into the joint where you inject one time. I always

754
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:09,720
inject from the back for two reasons. One, this part is more richly supplied by the brachial

755
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:14,360
plexus. So it's more sensitive and two people kind of see you coming at them with a needle. So I

756
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:19,400
always go in the back and I never use an ultrasound. That's a whole other thing that a lot of

757
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,880
clinicians use the ultrasound just to see, but you can feel where you're going. You just get it in

758
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:30,360
there. And what's super cool about this is people come in with a lot of stiffness and a lot of pain

759
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,920
and then you inject them and put local anesthetic as well in there. They're free in 10 seconds. Oh,

760
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:42,440
my gosh. They walk out. They're saying, Oh my gosh, it's amazing. They still probably need physical

761
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:48,520
therapy, but the fact that they got such dramatic relief is such a simple treatment is so. So do you

762
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,960
recommend that a patient with frozen shoulder air on the side of earlier intervention with a

763
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:01,560
cortisone shot to then allow them to do more rehab sooner? Or do you say, I don't want to do a

764
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,040
cortisone shot till you've done three months of rehab. It's purely based again on their exam.

765
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:12,120
Well, and they're examining their history, how long they've had it and how acutely symptomatic

766
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:16,760
it is when I'm examining them. If I can stretch them and they start kind of saying, Oh, that hurts

767
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,920
a little bit at the end, but they've got decent motion. They're tight. Then go back and do the rehab.

768
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,920
Go to good PT who will really stretch you out. You don't need anything. You don't even need

769
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:31,240
insets. But if you, if I can't get them to move and they're just, they're screaming, you're not,

770
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:34,920
they're not going to get anywhere in PT because it's going to hurt you much to do it. So I'll

771
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,240
inject them, then send them to PT. And I always see them back at about six weeks. Most of them

772
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,200
are dramatically better, but not all of them. Very rarely they need a second shot. And then,

773
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:51,880
and then some of them are just recalcitrant and they just stay stiff. And then, then I'll do the

774
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:57,160
little procedure on them. So there was one other thing you wanted to mention. Yeah. What was that?

775
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,640
Oh yes. A big source of neck pain, which you and I have discussed multiple times is

776
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:10,680
referred pain from the spine, from the neck. And so we'll include that in our exam because it's so

777
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:15,000
important because you at least have to rule that out. Well, especially because someone comes in

778
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,680
with shoulder pain and I see that, you know, I take care of a lot of professional musicians

779
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,120
and their, their necks are doing all sorts of crazy things from all the violinists and the

780
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:29,560
philharmonic or et cetera, just all types of musical instruments that cause that lead to having to

781
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,960
maintain these certain postures that sometimes are very counterproductive to their overall

782
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:40,040
musculoskeletal health. But they'll come in with shoulder pain, going down their arm, maybe even

783
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:47,720
down to their hand and they'll have already gotten a shoulder MRI and they're 55 and they have four

784
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,360
findings on their MRI, but it's not coming from their shoulder. It's coming from their neck.

785
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,440
And so we have to make sure and differentiate that. And because the worst thing I could do,

786
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:03,560
the worst thing I could do to them is have them take time off from music to fix what doesn't need

787
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,800
to be fixed in their shoulder. And then it's, and they still have the pain. And they still have the pain.

788
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:13,800
And in that situation, is there something you see on exam that makes you think we better go look at

789
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,920
your neck first with the MRI because the symptoms fit as something I'm expecting to see. And then

790
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:26,120
you look and you see, well, I do see that. So now that's, yes, exactly. So that is so important. So

791
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,680
intrinsic shoulder pathology, whether it's a rotator cuff, whether it's impingement, whether

792
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:39,480
it's arthritis, almost never does the pain radiate down below the elbow. Whereas neck origin,

793
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:44,600
whether it's a pinched nerves at, you know, any, the lower cervical spine where it's more common to

794
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:53,880
have pathology almost always goes down below the elbow and into the hand. Now a low, the one odd

795
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:00,040
ball is C seven. And I learned this not that long ago from some really great cervical spine surgeons.

796
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,840
Is that if you have a deep posterior pain under your scapula, that can be C seven. And that's

797
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:15,640
right where it goes. And so I've had two musicians whom you know recently, both with that diagnosis.

798
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:22,520
Yeah, it's funny. The only time I've ever had a complaint of a neck issue, what turned out to be

799
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:28,360
a neck issue was not, didn't present as neck pain. So I, and this was several years ago. Now, again,

800
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:32,760
in the back of my mind, I've always known I'm susceptible. I'm susceptible. I'm susceptible.

801
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:41,240
And I woke up one morning and my left trap felt like it was in spasm. Interesting. And I kind of

802
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:46,280
ignored it. I was like, Oh, I slept over it. You know, whatever. This is super uncomfortable.

803
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:53,160
You know, the next day it was still in spasm. I just sort of ignored it. I might've taken some,

804
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:00,680
you know, NSAIDs and cup. This went on for like two weeks and maybe not two weeks. It might've

805
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,680
gone on week at that point. And at this point I'm thinking I've never had a muscle that's

806
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:12,760
this tense for this long. And in about that time, very abruptly, I started to notice a loss of tricep

807
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:18,920
strength. Wow. And yes, you know, I noticed it in the gym because it was subtle at first because I

808
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,960
was doing, you know, skull crushers where you have two dumbbells. So now the right arm can't

809
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,960
compensate for the left because using two dumbbells. And all of a sudden I couldn't move the weight

810
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,440
with this arm. So I, that's weird. I can move it this way. So I, and then it got to the, and then

811
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:37,800
it progressed so rapidly that within about two days I couldn't pull my bow back because this arm

812
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:43,800
couldn't support here. Wow. Yes. Yeah. So at that point I was kind of freaking out. I'm now down to,

813
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,560
you know, only being able to do a couple pounds. So I know, Hey, once you have those motors in,

814
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:54,120
but here's the thing, zero pain. Yeah. Not a lick of pain. Nope. Nope. No numbness tingly. No

815
01:20:54,120 --> 01:21:00,760
parasthesias anywhere. Nothing. My neck doesn't feel a thing. I just have this trap on fire.

816
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:09,560
Make a long story short, you know, I see a person who says, look, you know, we could operate on you,

817
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,480
but unfortunately this is a surgeon who shares your ethos. And she said, look,

818
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:21,080
um, let's rehab the heck out of this. I think if you want, we could do an injection. I wasn't

819
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,600
excited about it because it was an anterior injection. And I said, no way I'd rather do

820
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:30,680
prednisone and traction. Yes. And so we did prednisone traction and sure enough within three

821
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:37,880
months, the strength was back. It's never returned, but that was a real wake up call to me that I had

822
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,000
a cervical symptom that didn't present with any neck pain. Yeah. That's great. That's a great

823
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,960
story. It's so instructive and you're absolutely spot on. I mean, and, and yeah, I mean, I see,

824
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:53,400
when I see, especially the musicians, as long as you don't have, you did have some. So you were,

825
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,640
you were absolutely right. Getting more deeply studied to make sure, because you had triceps,

826
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:02,040
but if you have no weakness, but maybe you do have a little tingling or something, but I know,

827
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:08,040
I just know it's coming from the neck. I won't lurch in and get MRIs in the neck, x-rays and

828
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:14,200
MRIs in the neck. I'll often just give them a one very low dose of prednisone and it usually goes

829
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,520
away. I mean, it's, it's, and then they don't have to worry about it and they don't have to get,

830
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,280
go down the rabbit hole of worry and anxiety about that.

831
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:31,400
So as we were talking about a minute ago about the shoulder, I think that with a good history,

832
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:38,280
interactive history and certain questions and a good physical exam, I can be about 95% accurate

833
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:44,680
in making a diagnosis without an MRI, without a CT scan or without even the x-rays. And so I think

834
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:49,480
that conserves resources and also it just gets the information because those little tidbits are

835
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,800
what are critical, including to knowing what's going to make you the best, whether it's going

836
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,880
to be an injection, PT, surgery, maybe, et cetera. So the first thing I look at is, you know,

837
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:05,560
it's nice that you're fit so I can see any true abnormalities. I can look for atrophy. I can look

838
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:10,680
for asymmetry. Somebody who's had a shoulder, a separated shoulder will have a big bump on one

839
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:16,440
side. Yours are equal. I can look at the pecs and see, you know, some of the nerve problems we talked

840
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:22,200
about, the Parsonage-Turner, for instance, the mixed brachial plexopathy. I'll see someone with a very

841
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:28,760
indented pectoralis. I had a patient the other day who's a rock and roll guitarist and he was

842
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:35,400
lifting weights and ruptured his pectoralis tendon. And so I could look and see right away

843
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:42,840
he had bruising down the arm, not the chest wall. That means he tore the tendon from the bone here

844
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:48,760
instead of the muscle tendon unit here, which a lot of weightlifters will tear. But I could also see

845
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:54,120
gross asymmetry. So those are the kind of things you're looking for. And I also even care about

846
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:59,720
the sloping of the shoulders because that can potentially be posturally if it's an issue with

847
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:07,320
posture and so forth. Okay, so looking at your shoulder, I see nothing asymmetric. I just then,

848
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:11,480
so I'm looking at the asymmetry. I haven't checked motion yet. I'm just going to palpate.

849
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:17,320
So I can palpate the AC joint and see that those are tender or non-tender. I can palpate the front

850
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:23,000
of the shoulder. Now this area is always tender. It's where the brachial plexus is passing through.

851
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,160
So this is one of the most tender areas in the shoulder. So I don't press too hard and I'm kind

852
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:31,560
of looking for asymmetry, not pressing hard. I want to look at the pecs. I want to look at the folds

853
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,760
of the pecs and see if there's any asymmetry there. I want to look at the contour of the deltoid.

854
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:42,600
And then I want to palpate back here your acromium, the roof, the bony roof of the shoulder. And I

855
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,000
want to palpate that and see if there's any tenderness along that perimeter because the whole

856
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,200
deltoid originates all around there. So you can tear, especially weightlifters, especially very

857
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,640
active athletes, can tear a little portion of that origin. It ends up healing, but it can be

858
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:03,080
very much of a nuisance for six or eight weeks. And then I look at the upper trapezius, right?

859
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:08,760
I want to see if there's any asymmetry. If you've had neck surgery and had an injury to that nerve,

860
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:13,400
then you can get atrophy there and it'll be very asymmetric. And then I want to look in the back.

861
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:19,960
I want to look and palpate people who are working out a lot or texting a lot and have bad posture

862
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:26,760
or bad ergonomics and get a lot of strain here in the rhomboid minor, the rhomboid major, and the

863
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,960
levator up here. And so those are the things I'm looking at. So I don't see any abnormalities here,

864
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,920
but if I did, that would help with the diagnosis. Then we want to look at range of motion. So I'm

865
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,160
going to ask you just lift your arms straight up in the air. So you have great motion and I'm looking

866
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:47,080
for any subtle asymmetry. Sometimes an arm will be maybe just that far. That last bit, then I push

867
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:51,320
it up. You go, oh, that hurts. That means your shoulder is a little stiff. Why is it? Well, we'll

868
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:56,920
get to that, but that's your forward elevation. Yours is nice and fluid and equal. Then we look

869
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,960
at external rotation. You have beautiful external rotation. That's about 75 degrees. Everybody varies.

870
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:07,800
I only go out about 50 degrees. It's fine. Now, if you're a thrower, you're going to have, let's say

871
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:13,080
you're a left-handed thrower, you're going to acquire external rotation to get more of that

872
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:19,720
we talked about that angular velocity. So this arm would come out externally more in a thrower,

873
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:25,240
in a left-handed thrower. Whereas if I come up here and measure internal rotation, that would be

874
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,760
decreased. You've acquired that from a lifetime of throwing. So that's what we look for. And that's

875
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:37,720
normal variation based on your activity pattern. So we've done that. Then I look, we've done

876
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:42,920
external rotation. We've done a modification of internal rotation, which is here in full

877
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:48,280
abduction, seeing how far you internally rotate, locking that up, trying not to rotate the scapula

878
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:54,040
too much because that's a, we know that a lot of people with stiff shoulders can compensate. You

879
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:58,520
were talking about that before with all that scapula thoracic motion. Okay. The other way to

880
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,720
measure that is just having you reach behind your back, but that's often more painful and it's easy

881
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:09,880
to deduce. If you have a frozen shoulder, let's say you have a frozen shoulder on this side, it's

882
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:14,440
going to look completely normal to look at. You have pain, you have stiffness, you can't do all

883
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:19,160
the things you want to do. And I look here and I see that this one's 70 and I look here and it goes

884
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,800
only goes to 30 and it starts to hurt when I do that. That's that adhesive capsulitis in there

885
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:31,400
that's blocking motion. Abduction, which is this movement here. So we always test abduction and I

886
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:38,280
see this mistake made. You can abduct way up, but that's all secondary to, not all, but a lot of it's

887
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:43,880
from your scapula thoracic. So I hold your scapula down. I know it's there and I see how far your

888
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:50,120
glenohumeral, your shoulder joint proper can come up. You come up perfectly to 90 degrees. So that's

889
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,560
a really important distinction. If you have frozen shoulder, it's going to be stuck. If you have a

890
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,040
chronic rotator cuff, it's going to be stiff. And so those are the kind of things that we start to

891
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:06,520
put together. So we've tested range of motion. Now let's test strength. So we're isolating the

892
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:11,400
rotator cuff and then we can also check the deltoid. So there's two components to shoulder motion

893
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:18,040
primarily. That's the deltoid, which gives us so much flexion, extension and abduction. But we also

894
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,600
have the rotator cuff, which we had talked about before. So here in neutral with your elbows at your

895
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,880
side, push out to the outside. Super strong. Now someone who has a big rotator cuff to you, that's

896
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:33,160
going to go, oh, it's just going to give way. And then we know that something significant is going on.

897
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:38,920
Now we do internal rotation, pushing in. Now that you can see how your pecs fired.

898
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:47,560
Internal rotation is a composite of both the pec pulling across very strong and compensating for

899
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:53,080
maybe a rotator cuff problem. The subscapularis in the front. So we can't really test the subscapularis

900
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:57,000
that way. So we had to do it a different way. Put your hands on your abdomen this way,

901
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:04,120
push your elbow out against me. And that is all subscap. That is all subscap. So if you have a little

902
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:10,200
even partial tear, that's going to hurt. If you have a complete subscap off, this elbow will, when

903
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,280
you do that maneuver, will fall back. It'll just fall away. You literally can't maintain that

904
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:19,960
position. So that's a nice good way. Okay. We did, we did external rotation. We did internal rotation.

905
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:26,360
Now we isolate the supraspinatus, that, that, that elevator of the shoulder. It's so important.

906
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:32,680
And so here we push straight up hard, you're rock solid, and that isolates the supraspinatus. Then,

907
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:37,560
but your deltoid is a little part of that. So that's how we can then check. Okay, let's check

908
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:43,000
the anterior deltoid. Push against me here. And I'm just resisting so I can stabilize it. Okay.

909
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:49,560
Then push back against me so that you've got a great posterior deltoid, anterior deltoid, and now

910
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,600
the lateral deltoid pushed straight out. That's a composite of the deltoid. We can see that firing,

911
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:01,640
but also the supraspinatus because that initiates abduction. So, so we've got good. We've checked now

912
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:07,240
the, the, for the shoulder, we've checked the strength, range of motion, and palpation, and

913
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:12,040
look for any asymmetry. Now we're going to do some provocation. We have to do provocative maneuvers

914
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:19,880
to get to more pinpoint diagnoses. So in the case of a rotator cuff tear, we can check strength there.

915
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,920
It's not really a provocation, but if you, if I abject you here and then externally rotate from

916
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:31,400
there, that's all rotator cuff. And if that's weak as it is, then you likely have a rotator cuff tear.

917
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:37,480
It can be the supraspinatus. It can also be the infraspinatus. And so that's one. Then if I'm up

918
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:44,040
in this position and I just wrote this relax and I rotate you down and I hear crepitus in there,

919
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:50,120
that would indicate bursitis. If I cause pain there, that's the impingement sign. And that would

920
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:55,160
imply that you're bringing the head up and rotating it and irritating that inflamed bursa. That's

921
01:30:55,160 --> 01:31:00,200
impingement where you might have a spur. That's that. Now a variation on that theme is when we

922
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:06,680
come straight ahead, elbows fully up like this, keeping you up high and then push up against me.

923
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:12,120
That is your biceps. That isolates the long head of the biceps that we talked about because the

924
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:17,240
short head never comes into play and never tears and never gets irritated. So that tests the long

925
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:23,720
head of the biceps up there. Now we will cross over in one way. We'll cross over into the elbow

926
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:29,960
is by checking your other biceps, which is the distal biceps. And we kind of, we know that that

927
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:36,440
can be, if you have a normal distal biceps and a very inflamed long head in your shoulder, this will

928
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:43,080
hurt. This is the speeds where you're turning your palm up. Go ahead, supinate. You see that

929
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:48,280
really fires your biceps there. Good, strong. And I can, you're, you're being kind. I can,

930
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:53,880
I cannot break you and you can break me. So we test that that would hurt and you'd give way if

931
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:59,480
you had, and you, but you'd say it doesn't hurt here. It hurts here. So it's tugging on that bicep.

932
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:06,440
So that's a good, good indicator for that. Then we want to look at your labrum. That's a

933
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:13,640
common tearing thing that, that entity that can manifest. So the superior labrum, we have a good

934
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:18,440
provocative maneuver for that. It's called the active compression test. And we call it the SLAP

935
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:25,080
test, which stands for superior labrum anterior posterior. It's a funky, weird position. You're

936
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:30,440
across the body, it's thumb way down and then you push up against it. And that is rock solid. Now,

937
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:35,240
if you had a super superior labral tear, one, that maneuver would just hurt, but then it would just

938
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:41,080
give way. It would just fall away. And you know the firsthand about that. Okay. So that's the

939
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,800
superior labrum. Now, if we're looking for the anterior posterior labrum, we won't do that because

940
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:51,240
we don't have a, I would normally lie you down and then shuck your shoulder back and forth. But I can

941
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:58,440
get approximate with that. If you were sitting, I can stabilize your shoulder and scapula by

942
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:04,040
grabbing that. And then I can push, enter a posterior. Someone who's very loose, I can move

943
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:10,680
them excessively, posterior or anterior. And then I can even pull down on your arm and feel that head

944
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:16,760
go whoop, whoop. If you have that big capacious capsule, where it's inferiorly translatable,

945
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,840
then I can easily feel that from this position and I'll feel it just open up and go down.

946
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:29,640
So those are really the core parts of the almost full shoulder exam. And you can,

947
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:34,520
that's going to be about 95% corroborative and accurate based on what you've been telling me

948
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,000
in terms of your history and why you have shoulder pain.

949
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,560
All right, Alton. So now we have a sense of how complicated a nuance the exam is. So now let's

950
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,400
assume we have the diagnosis. Okay. So let's walk through some of the surgical treatments here.

951
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:53,800
Okay. So again, let's start with the operation I have. So a labral repair and

952
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:00,200
is the approach significantly different, whether it's a slap versus a complete tear like mine?

953
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,440
I assume it's just a number of ports or how does it?

954
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:09,640
Yeah, it's just a little more technically, right, to do. And you need a few more little,

955
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:14,120
and we do most of these now, as I was talking about the technology earlier, that we can do these

956
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:19,560
percutaneously. So we don't need five big, big, I mean, these are only a centimeter and a half.

957
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:24,040
The biggest ones are only about a centimeter, a centimeter and a half, but the others, they can be

958
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,640
percutaneous, tiny little holes that we use a little cannulas through and then put the drill

959
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:33,880
through and so forth. So, so that's, that's right. It's, it's more just adding a little time, you know,

960
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,520
it takes 10 minutes to do each anchor sort of thing. And so you just add on and you needed a bunch.

961
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,440
But it's also...

962
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:47,000
It's like the first thing, if I recall, that exam under anesthesia is crucial, right?

963
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:54,120
Yes. Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that. Yes. So even with a good exam, remember that a dynamic exam

964
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:59,160
you've got your, your brain has been dealing with this problem for a long time. You're naturally,

965
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:04,120
well, not naturally you work, but you're muscular, you have good muscle tones. So if I'm examining

966
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:08,840
you, I probably can't sublux your shoulder. I mean, you have to kind of, I have to kind of jump

967
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:15,880
up on top of it to do it. The rare case is somebody who's had such long standing instability that

968
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:21,560
their body's no longer responding to it. And usually I can get one or two subluxations,

969
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:28,440
but then they, they tense up, but I can usually get one or two. So that's one subset. But so yes,

970
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:33,960
so the great thing about an exam under anesthesia is once you're in your position where you're going

971
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:38,600
to have the surgery, you've got a regional block where your arm is super numb and you're sedated

972
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,720
so that you're relaxed and you can't control anything. And then I can just, it's as if your

973
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:48,360
muscles aren't really there. I mean, they have a little effect on it, but mainly I'm testing the

974
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:54,760
static stabilizers. In your case, I could take it pretty far out back and way I could completely

975
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:00,200
dislocate your shoulder out front. So, and that wasn't, still hurts for me to watch that video.

976
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:07,720
Yeah, right. It's super cool. And so then, you know, then that tells me, okay, I need to be

977
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:13,560
careful when I'm looking on the inside, I need to assess not just the labrum, which I know is torn.

978
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:20,280
I need to, in the case of the anterior, you've been like the balloon, you're blowing up repeatedly.

979
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:26,920
You've been also stretching out your capsule. You're still compensating, well, less well and

980
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:32,040
less well with the muscles, but you are compensating. So if that is stretched down the front,

981
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:37,400
I need to know that in addition to just repairing the labrum itself, I need to gather up some of the,

982
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:43,560
this capsule, which has become too capacious and, and do what we call a capsularophy, which is to

983
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,520
gather and tighten that up too. And that's kind of a judgment call. When you've done a lot of them,

984
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:52,520
you kind of know how much to gather. You don't want to gather too much because then it tightens

985
01:36:52,600 --> 01:37:00,520
them up too much. To that point, and this is a caveat about not, well, yeah, unnecessary surgery,

986
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:06,760
had a lovely violinist, professional violinist who I treated her whole family. They're all violinists.

987
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:17,000
And she had been up in Vermont, farther enough away to where when she had a frozen shoulder

988
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:24,600
or shoulder pain, she got an MRI, saw a sports doctor who saw, and again, she's 60 at that time,

989
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:31,880
62, 63, and had some degenerative labral tearing. Well, he said she needed to have a repair

990
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:40,840
of that, which, and then she presented with what pain? Just pain, a little stiffness. Okay. So just

991
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:46,520
read the MRI. It said labral tearing didn't really have anything else. So said you need a repair of

992
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:52,040
your labrum. Did a repair of the labrum. She came to me about six months later in tears, had not

993
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:57,480
been playing for six months, had the stiffest shoulder I think I've ever seen, basically didn't

994
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:03,400
move. So he tightened the hell out of the capsule. Right. And did a labral repair that in a 62 year

995
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:12,760
old, who's not an athlete, would never be necessary. It's just sort of universally true. And so I had

996
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:19,240
to go in and scope her. It was really hard because it was so tight. Had to just bit by bit, release

997
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:24,520
everything that had been done and release the capsule that was all crunched up and tightened

998
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:30,920
up. Even had to take some of the sutures out to free up her shoulder. Do you have a sense of what

999
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:35,160
her initial injury was even caused by? I mean, do you think it was just capsular? I think she just

1000
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:41,080
had a stiff capsule. Just had a stiff capsule. Wow. So someone that should have had PT plus or minus

1001
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:45,960
at most a single injection to reduce the inflammation has the exact opposite. They

1002
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:50,680
get a complete tightening of the capsule. And there's a school of thought and orthopedics that

1003
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:56,120
says, we just don't like repairing labrams and doing capsule repairs in older people because

1004
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,760
that's the outcome you get. Yes. And that's completely valid. I mean, it's completely valid.

1005
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:07,320
I remember some people that I spoke with who said, wow, at your age, Peter, you're basically 50,

1006
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:13,880
you're having a labral repair. Are you crazy? Now, of course, in my case, I think I don't,

1007
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,960
I haven't lost any mobility, which is kind of remarkable. No, no. And in fact, you know,

1008
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:23,480
you and I discussed that some, right? Yeah, that was one of my biggest fears. Yeah. And so one has

1009
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:31,240
to pay extra attention to that. For me, if we want to be specific about your case as just a case

1010
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:37,000
example, I don't think we had a choice because you, you're subluxation, you're so active,

1011
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,560
you're subluxation with all the different activities. We already had some arthritis,

1012
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:46,920
you're already wearing down some cartilage. I mean, it's, it's going to be, it's either that

1013
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:51,400
or the inevitability of having a shoulder replacement in another 10 years. Right.

1014
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:57,160
Yeah. I mean, I think when I saw the, a little bit of arthritis there, I kind of wished I'd done it

1015
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:04,360
sooner. Sure. Knowing what I know today, I almost wish I had more pain, you know, sooner.

1016
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:12,040
Because I really had a ton of pain 10 or 15 years ago, but with a lot of good tissue work and a lot

1017
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:16,440
of training, I kind of got out of it. Yeah. And I made some modifications, like there were certain

1018
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:21,000
things I just decided I couldn't do. But that's right. Yeah. But, but, but, but I think that's

1019
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:26,600
interesting. So, okay. But another component of that is, especially now, people are so much

1020
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:32,200
younger mainly because they're all rucking now. No, but they're people are so much younger

1021
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:37,080
physiologically in better condition. And we know that from whether it's cancer treatments and

1022
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:44,280
everything else and the advancements of science that a 50 year old now that would have applied

1023
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:51,240
to that data that we have, you know, 20 years ago is misleading. So I base it on, I mean, you're,

1024
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:56,680
you're, we're kind of an outlier. Yeah. You base it on biological age, biological age. And even

1025
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,000
look, there are some people that have, I'll, I'll scope them. They'll, I'll say, look,

1026
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,240
I don't have any other way than looking and seeing what's there. And in some cases they have

1027
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,120
better cartilage than what the MRI is indicating or the, and then I can go ahead and do a repair.

1028
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:16,360
And some of them are, I've done a couple, I mean, maybe I shouldn't say this on air. I've done a

1029
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,800
couple of like 58 year olds, 60 year olds, but their joint was pristine. I mean, it looked as

1030
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:27,000
good as a 25 year old. They just had a discreet, yeah, labor care. No, to me, look, this is what I,

1031
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,840
this is to me an extension of what I think of as precision medicine, which is we use evidence-based

1032
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:39,960
medicine, which is incredibly heterogeneous to make population-based assertions and general

1033
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:46,440
broad recommendations. But ultimately the only patient that really matters for most doctors is

1034
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,760
the one right in front of them. Exactly. And therefore you have to be able to make evidence

1035
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:55,880
informed decisions based on the appropriate physiology that you see. And it's also a

1036
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:00,760
conversation. It's a conversation with that patient, not a unilateral decision. It's, it's,

1037
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:05,640
okay, what do you want to do? What do you know about this? Here's what I know about this. Here's

1038
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:11,400
what I'm seeing with you. And we need to say, here are the possibilities and what do you want to do?

1039
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:17,720
So how often when you go in for, and let's just, I guess, just explain to people. So the biggest

1040
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:23,000
port puts the camera and do you have how many, and then you have like a few working ports, obviously.

1041
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,640
Yeah. So typically, typically since more of the pathology is superior and anterior,

1042
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:35,240
although you had some in the back, you, if you're working in the superior in the front,

1043
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:39,080
you go in through the back with the camera. So you just have a good panoramic view of everything.

1044
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:43,160
We have two different kinds of angled lenses. So we can see around corners if we need to,

1045
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:48,360
usually don't need them for most things. But then I can see the superior labrum.

1046
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:53,560
You know, in general surgery, we insufflate with carbon dioxide, right? So you're shooting

1047
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:57,080
carbon dioxide to blow everything up. I assume you're using saline to do the same thing. So

1048
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:00,760
you're making that capsule bigger. And that's a good point. So I don't use,

1049
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:06,120
I mean, I've done a lot of these, I don't use high pressure. Some people use around 50 millimeters

1050
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:11,880
of mercury pressure. I use 35. And that means less postoperative pain. It's less, it's less,

1051
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:19,560
yes. Distention of the whole shoulder and so forth. So that's what I do. And, and you can

1052
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,880
still put in little retractors, kind of pull tissue out of the way and so forth. So that's

1053
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:27,240
just a technique. I actually, that's more of an extension of what I do in the elbow,

1054
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:37,560
because there's a lot more peril because of the nerves. But, but in, so then usually you need two

1055
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:42,360
working portals in the front, which are just cannulas that are just basically canals to get

1056
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:48,040
in with instruments that are long enough to fit through the, through the, and do the work. And

1057
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:53,480
then in the case of, for instance, a superior labrum, we use a percutaneous right through the top,

1058
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:58,360
just underneath the kind of right here actually, where that red arrow is going. And that just

1059
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:02,600
gets you to the superior labrum. So that's a little percutaneous. You make a tiny little hole

1060
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,320
in the rotator cuff, kind of muscle tendon junction. It just spreads the fibers apart.

1061
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:13,080
So it doesn't do any damage to that. And then you've got a perfect bird's eye direction for

1062
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:18,120
the drilling and putting in those few anchors in the top. And then that's, that's really it.

1063
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:24,520
And explain how that works. So you drill a little hole in the glenoid fossa. What's the diameter of

1064
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:30,040
that hole? Yeah. So it depends on what kind of anchor you're doing. Usually roughly not more

1065
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:35,400
than three millimeters. And now we're down to 1.8. Okay. Even three seems big.

1066
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:42,280
Three seems big, but that's what you fit the plastic or the absorbable anchor in that you

1067
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:46,680
just kind of tap in with the mallet. All of them you tap in with the mallet and you're drilling

1068
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:52,040
into the bone. You're drilling around here, kind of this angle here.

1069
01:44:55,160 --> 01:45:00,280
And you have to get the angle right. It's a very three dimensional, but you put them in so that

1070
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:05,240
you're drilling into hard bone and then the anchor inserts through that. And so they're

1071
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:10,280
not circumferential. No, they're just straight in. Correct. We used to, if we did them open,

1072
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:14,920
we used to do them even with like a suture drill holes and a suture going through circumferential.

1073
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:19,640
So what holds the anchor in? Is it just the pressure you're putting an anchor in that is

1074
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:24,360
bigger than the hole? And so is there like a nail? Yes, exactly. And or a tense,

1075
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:29,480
not a screw, but they're not a screw. There were historically some that we screw in, but not anymore.

1076
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:37,880
And now the ones that are purely basically braided polyester, those go in as a, as just a,

1077
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:42,280
the suture goes in. And then as you carefully pull it back out, the way they're designed,

1078
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:46,840
they ball up and it creates a, I mean, they're super strong. You can lift the shoulder off the

1079
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:52,760
table. So it's super cool to use those. Wow. That's so interesting. So you have a lot of confidence

1080
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:58,040
in the integrity of that repair. Yes. Yes. I know that if I tug on it multiple times,

1081
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:06,360
it's not going to come out. And I mean, it would take a fully traumatic force to do that. Yeah.

1082
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:12,120
So before you do this, I assume you do an exam of the cuff while you're in there.

1083
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:16,680
Absolutely. So you go through and do a survey of the joint. You look at the cartilage surfaces from

1084
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:21,640
the nooks and crannies cartilage surface. You look at the rotator cuff inserting on the bone from

1085
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:27,800
inside out, and you can see that being smooth. If it's frayed, if it's notably frayed, you can

1086
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:33,160
probe it and you can see, oh, that actually has also, and I occasionally see that because they're

1087
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:39,080
athletes, a small, almost full thickness tear. Then I may put a sitch or two in that to fix that.

1088
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:44,120
You look at the biceps, you can pull the kind of the biceps into the joint and see a pretty good

1089
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:50,760
segment of it and see if it's inflamed, torn, something abnormal there. And you can see the

1090
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:56,920
tendon of the bicep really well to see, obviously, is it frayed? Yes. So how much damage do you need

1091
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:06,040
to see to do the tendinesis? Not a lot. If I see a combination of a modest amount of fraying and a

1092
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:11,160
lot of inflammation around it, and when I pull it in the joint, that extends further out, then I'll

1093
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:15,880
tendinesis. It's interesting. I think for people to understand how much your eyes are helpful here,

1094
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:20,280
right? As you said, when you look at these images, and we'll link to some images in the show notes

1095
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:23,720
of what these pictures look like. In fact, we can include my pictures and just other pictures we'll

1096
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:31,800
find online. It is just a very plain, banal, gray, white normal thing. And to think that

1097
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:37,240
inflammation just shows up is like, wow, that's really red. Yeah, exactly. And for me, some people

1098
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:42,760
don't like to waste the time, but I get a little electrocardi wand and I paint the internal and

1099
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:47,480
get rid of all that pink because it's inflammatory. It hurts. That's part of one of the big pain

1100
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:51,000
generators. So I just do that automatically. Now, theoretically, if you fix everything,

1101
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,800
that's going to go away anyway, but it helps them. I think early post-op, a recent patient I had,

1102
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:03,240
I did a pretty significant repair on and he, after five days said, I haven't had any pain. What's

1103
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:08,360
going on? It just, did you do anything to my shoulder? So I said, yeah, I did repair it, but

1104
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:11,960
yeah, but I think part of it is just getting rid of that inflammation and so forth.

1105
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:20,040
Okay. So now contrast that with the pure rotator cuff repair. Right. So let's do two examples.

1106
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:26,520
Let's talk about a patient who, what is the most common athlete's tear? Which one is it going,

1107
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:33,560
did we say it's going to be a subscapularis or a supraspinatus? Well, so it depends. It depends on

1108
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:38,760
if it was, if they're an overhead athlete, then it's going to be supraspinatus almost always.

1109
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:43,720
And sometimes it can be the infraspinatus. Right. So if a guy just has a straight up

1110
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:48,840
supraspinatus tear, you don't even need to enter the capsule necessarily, depending on how close it

1111
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,680
is. No, you do because you want to, first of all, you want to see everything. You want to make sure

1112
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:57,560
that you're not missing anything, which is common in the athletes. There's a couple of interesting

1113
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:03,720
various, I'm going to draw some pictures. Okay. So here I've drawn three sequential

1114
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:09,240
axillary views, which are a bird's eye view, looking straight down on the top of your shoulder

1115
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:14,600
if I were sitting on top, looking straight down. So we've got the glenoid, the socket here toward

1116
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:21,160
the head. And we've got the ball out here toward the outside where the deltoid lives. And then you

1117
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:28,280
I've drawn the, this is the supraspinatus I've drawn in here on the top in the back, as we talked

1118
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:33,800
about before, that's the infraspinatus. And then in the front is the subscapularis. So these are the,

1119
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:38,760
and those are the three, the Terry's minor, which is the fourth muscle, the rotator cuff. It's not

1120
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,560
really a relevant player in the pathology. Very true. Yeah. It almost never tears. Okay.

1121
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:49,240
This is actually really a cool way to look at it. It's not normal that we usually look at them from

1122
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:55,080
front and back, but the bird's eye view is what allows you to see how the subscapularis and the

1123
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:59,560
infraspinatus are stabilizing the front and the back while the supraspinatus is coming in over

1124
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:05,080
the top. Yes. Yes. Is the supraspinatus that wide, relatively speaking? Yeah, it's pretty wide.

1125
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:11,400
Wow. It's so interesting. Maybe more about here. Here it is, let, do it a little wide there.

1126
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,880
Okay. But that's interesting. Again, in anatomic diagrams, because you're looking at it from the

1127
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:20,360
front, it looks like a tiny little muscle. Yes, but it's broad. It has three dimensionality in it.

1128
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:24,760
That's about three, roughly three, three and a half centimeters of width going front to back. Yeah.

1129
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:30,360
Wow. Okay. Great. And so, um, there's three different views. The most common one is the

1130
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:36,280
middle one. And that's because that's anterior, the biceps is here. That's an anterior superior

1131
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:41,960
tear. That's the one that the overhead athletes get a lot, non-throwing athletes, but tennis

1132
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:50,040
players, um, volleyball players, um, and weight lifters. Um, and that is, is one of the critical

1133
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:54,040
zones where it can get rung out and not have good blood supply. And that's where they tear. That's

1134
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:59,160
where I had my little tears, um, on both shoulders, but that's the garden variety one. That's also the

1135
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:04,680
one that can be caused by the, the, the spur pushing down on it. And, and I've drawn a little,

1136
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:08,920
a little, um, arc because that's kind of the tear off and then they'll form a little arc of

1137
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:14,920
smooth tissue and you, you freshen that up, freshen up the bone and then put the sutures in that

1138
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:21,000
leading edge of the tendon and put it back just like you'd put a tarp with a tent stake back in.

1139
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,960
And that's how you repair it. You get it back to the good bony bed and you get that good biologic

1140
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:30,760
healing. And that's a small tear that I've drawn there and they can be bigger and bigger if you

1141
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:36,840
imagine in more chronic. Now the one down below shows the subscapularis in the front. And that is

1142
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:45,400
the one that can tear in young people or older people, uh, based on mechanism. So if you have a

1143
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:54,040
linebacker who has, he's going forward at full velocity to make, and then somebody is knocked

1144
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:59,480
into him and shoots him across, he's got his arms out there ready to go. And he gets eccentrically

1145
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:05,480
loaded into external rotation like that. That's how you can tear the subscapularis. The other way

1146
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:10,440
is people falling downstairs and grabbing the banister and wrenching back that way. That's the

1147
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:17,560
common, it's commonly torn with ease, an abnormal weird stretch where they're contracting and then

1148
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:22,200
it's just torqued on him. Now this upper one is very interesting because we were talking about

1149
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:29,000
throwing athletes. So when you, the throwing athletes, baseball players and football players,

1150
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:34,200
they externally rotate dramatically. That's how they get their extra angular velocity to really

1151
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:41,560
get that, that, that zip on the ball. So they, they acquire external rotation starting at a young age.

1152
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:47,800
They, so their arms are very asymmetric, their shoulders. One side will externally rotate to 90,

1153
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:53,000
the other one will go back another 45 degrees. And that's how they get that whip. One of the

1154
01:52:53,960 --> 01:53:00,600
consequences of that in a subset of them is that as this rotates and follows this area around,

1155
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:06,120
that area of the rotator cuff, which is at the junction of the infraspinatus and the superspinatus,

1156
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:13,720
abuts up against the hard bony rim of the glenoid and they get an internal impingement,

1157
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:20,520
ultimately get small partial thickness or even full thickness tears there. So we have to be super

1158
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:25,800
cautious with those. We have to repair those, but you have to be really careful because if they lose

1159
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:31,560
10 or 15 degrees of extra rotation, they lose, they lose. So where does the Tommy John fit into this?

1160
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,200
Yes. So that's the elbow. That's the elbow. But it does know as maybe that was just intuitive

1161
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:41,000
because since you are a good orthopedic surgeon is actually, it fits in because a lot of people

1162
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:45,880
add torque on their elbow because they have shoulder pathology.

1163
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:51,560
I see. So they transfer, they gain the external. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where they end up.

1164
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:55,880
If they have a little weakness or something going on on their shoulder, they will overthrow

1165
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:00,280
with their forearm and their flexor pronator mass. They'll overthrow with the torque and then they'll

1166
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:05,800
tear their medial collateral ligament of their elbow. It's crazy, but true. And vice versa,

1167
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:12,200
if they have a weak, if they have a partially torn, uh, medial collateral ligament that hasn't yet been

1168
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:17,720
identified, they can overthrow with their shoulder to compensate, to get more angular velocity on

1169
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:25,720
that because they can't, uh, muster it through the elbow. And so, uh, how many years ago would it

1170
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:31,400
have been the case that a torn rotator cuff was the end of a pitcher's career or a quarterback's

1171
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:38,760
career at the professional level? Great question. I would say easily, uh, not more than 20 years ago,

1172
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:46,200
probably even not, uh, 15 years ago, probably 15. And today that's not the case. No, no, no. What has

1173
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:51,880
been the advance that has changed? Because I can't think of anything that could be possibly more

1174
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,880
stressful. I mean, to me, throwing a baseball seems even more stressful than throwing a football

1175
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:01,400
because you do it more times in a game. Right. So what has changed that has made the, what's

1176
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:09,720
changed this earlier diagnosis. If people now, and certainly at the, at the, the division one collegiate

1177
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:17,000
level and the professional level, there's any pain is evaluate kind of over-evaluated and that can be

1178
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,600
good for them. I mean, it's, you know, it uses a lot of resources, but it, it identifies these very early.

1179
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:28,120
So that's one way. So you get to them earlier. So in other words, quarterback pitcher says,

1180
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:34,520
you know what, starting to hurt a little bit, you see a very small tear in the cuff.

1181
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:38,600
You're saying it's better to go in and repair that than let it become a bigger tear.

1182
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:44,360
Yes and no, it depends. You, you'd certainly watch it carefully, right. And you correlate the symptoms

1183
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:48,920
with, and that's why, you know, you should sometimes it's not the tear. It's just some

1184
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:53,960
inflammation that's related to it. If you can cool that down, the tear is not biomechanically

1185
01:55:53,960 --> 01:56:00,200
significant yet. So, but there are, I've said this to many people, I have full thickness tears

1186
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:06,440
in people that are minimally symptomatic and partial thickness tears that are very symptomatic.

1187
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,160
It kind of depends on what you're doing. And I think one thing that's kind of missing from this

1188
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:15,640
picture in the subscapularis in the infraspinatus is how long they are. So we're looking at the top,

1189
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:23,000
but these muscles cover the scapula. Totally. So when you say a full thickness tear,

1190
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:29,720
you know, I want to make sure people understand the size of the tear. Yes. So when I say full

1191
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:34,600
thickness, I mean like when we were looking on that other view, let me draw that again.

1192
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,920
Oh, actually I can just go back to the previous.

1193
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:49,080
So when I've drawn the supraspinatus tendon, that perpendicular distance through there is the

1194
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:54,680
thickness, the full thickness. And it's, it varies depending on the size of the patient, but,

1195
01:56:55,640 --> 01:57:01,560
but it could be across the entire four centimeters. It could be a whole four centimeters by

1196
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:07,240
half a centimeter. Yes. So you could have, but when we talk typically about, when we speak

1197
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:13,160
typically about full thickness, we mean the, the depth of it this way so that you can have a

1198
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:17,800
partial thickness tear. That's maybe half the tendon there or full thickness. Now, if you have

1199
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:23,160
half the tendon torn, you've lost enough biomechanics that if you're a high level throwing athlete,

1200
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:30,680
no way. Yeah. No way. So. Whereas a partial thickness tear off the tendon. Yes. Could easily

1201
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:38,360
be ignored. Correct. Exactly. So, so then when we talk about this, that yes, those muscle bellies

1202
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:47,240
are huge. Now, the reason you jog my, my thinking about that is you can have, if you, especially if

1203
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:52,360
you have these guys are so strong, like the football players and so forth, sometimes they

1204
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:58,120
have that wrenching injury. They don't rip the tendon off the bone, but they interstitially tear

1205
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:03,640
at the muscular tendon disjunction. And they have that, and they have a tremendous amount of edema,

1206
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:09,480
weakness, pain, but that will heal. That will heal without any intervention, just some tincture of

1207
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:16,760
time and some anti-inflammatory and just time to heal. What role do stem cells or PRP play in any of

1208
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:22,360
this? Certainly anecdotally, there are a lot of people saying, look, you know, stem cells aren't

1209
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:27,240
going to replace a labrum. They're not, you know, they're not going to work there, but you have a

1210
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:35,080
tear in the muscle. Stem cells can be valuable. Now I'm not really aware of RCTs that have looked

1211
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:39,960
at this, but I also haven't scoured the literature on the rotator cuff data. Are there people running

1212
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:47,960
clinical trials on stem cells in that indication? So I think so. I don't know that literature as

1213
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:54,680
well as maybe I should, but it's, I tend to, you know, I go to all the meetings and I stay fairly

1214
01:58:54,680 --> 01:59:01,320
abreast. There is obviously a lot of activity going on, but there's a lot of terribly designed

1215
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:08,680
studies all around that are being used to justify using whether PRP or stem cells. So one has to be

1216
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:14,840
careful to extrapolate it to your individual practice. And there's a lot of money involved

1217
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,760
in it too. I mean, I have patients routinely that fly to various places, including Germany,

1218
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:25,160
including, and I'm not pillaring. I'm not by any means because that they exist everywhere. I just

1219
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:30,680
happened to know a couple that just got back and they pay a lot of money to get stem cells injected

1220
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:35,400
for things that we've been talking about. And there's no data. I'm not talking about the

1221
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:38,920
musculotendinous. That's different. I want to talk about that. But I mean, let's say just a

1222
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:45,160
garden variety, small rotator cuff tear. There is no data ever. There are some, a few anecdotal

1223
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:51,400
reports where people say, look, there was a tear there on that MRI. I injected PRP and it's healed.

1224
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:55,880
It's gone. I don't know what to make of those. They're just one-offs. Well, also, do we know

1225
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:00,040
what the natural history of that injury would have been without the PRP? Of course not. Do we know?

1226
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:05,160
No, we don't. So we don't have enough of a series to say, if you took a thousand people that had

1227
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:10,760
that tear and you did nothing and came back and surveyed them two years later, this many,

1228
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:14,040
you wouldn't see the tear again. Correct. Do we not know that? We don't know that. Okay.

1229
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:21,880
And I have one of my best scientific things that I can relate that it goes down to the elbow,

1230
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:27,240
but I think it's important for this part of the conversation is I was speaking right before COVID

1231
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:34,040
at the AOSSM, the American Association of Sports Medicine. These are non-surgical general medicine

1232
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:38,280
doctors who do sports medicine and they're great. They're really knowledgeable. They do tons of

1233
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:45,480
studies and I was speaking, I was waiting to speak and the two papers presented before me were back

1234
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:52,440
to back. Really well done. Large numbers, over a thousand patients, double-blind, randomized

1235
02:00:52,440 --> 02:01:01,160
studies comparing for tennis elbow. Tennis elbow, lateral epicondylitis, comparing cortisone,

1236
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:11,400
PRP and placebo. And the placebo and the PRP were the same and the cortisone was much more effective.

1237
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:16,920
These were back to back studies, different institutions and it was informative for me

1238
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:22,680
because I've read the literature. Our literature is replete with studies that say, oh well,

1239
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:27,400
you know, PRP really helps. And I see patients all the time that have had PRP injections

1240
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:33,000
based on my current knowledge of the literature for rotator cuff repairs,

1241
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:44,520
for tendon ruptures, for lateral epicondylitis, certainly for Tommy Johns and medial epicondyl,

1242
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:52,840
medial tendon ruptures. I have a PRP machine in my office in Manhattan and I use it twice a year.

1243
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:53,320
For what?

1244
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,640
For when someone begs me to do it.

1245
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:04,840
Yeah. I mean, I guess, again, not to be skeptical, but I suppose a doctor can make more charging for

1246
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:07,480
PRP than cortisone. I mean, cortisone is pretty cheap.

1247
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:12,840
Cortisone, well, one, it's covered by insurance and two, yes, it's a couple hundred dollars for

1248
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:20,760
a shot. Typically, in my office, that's one of the reasons I don't use it, is a thousand dollars

1249
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:26,440
and it's not necessarily covered and people charge a lot more. Some people charge $2,500

1250
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:31,480
for a PRP injection. So until, look, I'm not saying that it doesn't someday.

1251
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:37,960
PRP, the concept is great. As you know, it has growth factors. It's, it's our own bodily,

1252
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:45,480
you know, fluids. And so it's perfectly reasonable, but it hasn't yet borne out to be a game changer.

1253
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:51,240
Now, if you take someone who's the highest level athlete and they have bursitis, sure,

1254
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:55,240
inject some PRP in there, some stem cells, whatever, maybe it'll be better. Who knows?

1255
02:02:56,040 --> 02:03:01,640
There's not really good data on it, but there's no downside to doing it. The only downside sometimes

1256
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:07,320
I see many more flare reactions from PRP injected into tennis elbow where people are really painful

1257
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:12,600
for a couple of weeks and they end up coming to me for either surgery or cortisone. They'd say,

1258
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:16,280
I don't want another one of those. I don't want another one of those. And that's just anecdotal

1259
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:18,520
for me. I don't have a, I don't have a comparative study.

1260
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:24,440
Yeah. I, I, I, and I probably need to spend more time in the literature, but I really,

1261
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:30,360
the few times I've kind of looked with some interest usually on the request of a patient

1262
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:36,680
who's kind of going through this. I just haven't found data that are convincing enough,

1263
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,800
even though again, mechanistically there's a high plausibility and,

1264
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:44,840
but I think the problem is we don't have that natural history. This is, this is the problem.

1265
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:51,640
There's lots of anecdotes that say this injury was present. Stem cells were injected. The injury

1266
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:55,720
is gone radiographically. Yes. The problem is we don't have the contra positive case.

1267
02:03:55,720 --> 02:04:03,240
We don't. The best natural history study we have on, and this has nothing to do with treatment. This

1268
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:10,600
is asymptomatic rotator cuff tears is came out of WashU. One of my best friends in orthopedics,

1269
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:15,560
Ken Yamaguchi was lead on that article. They looked at ultrasounds, which was great because

1270
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:20,280
they're non-invasive, non costly, and very effective. If you have a good ultra stenographer,

1271
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:25,720
and they looked at the natural history of these asymptomatic, asymptomatic tears, and they found

1272
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:31,320
that they obviously documented the percentage of, of, of asymptomatic tears in the general population,

1273
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:38,600
but they looked at them longitudinally and they never repaired on their own. They at very best,

1274
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:44,520
a subset of them stayed the same. The larger the tear, the more likely it was to become even larger

1275
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:49,160
with time. And become symptomatic? And become symptomatic. A subset of those became symptomatic.

1276
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:53,880
Yes. So, and that's, it was really well done. It got a lot of press. So none got better

1277
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:58,600
spontaneous. Correct. Okay. So that, so that would suggest that if people are saying, Hey,

1278
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:04,200
here's my MRI pre and post stem cells, and it got better, that, that would at least suggest that in

1279
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:08,360
that individual, it might've worked. If you had enough and they were done with the same, as you

1280
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:13,480
know, MRIs very significantly from, from machine to machine. So they would have to be very well

1281
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:19,720
controlled. Yeah. You showed, if you showed me even 20 patients done by someone that I know is

1282
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:27,800
legitimate and they did that and showed comparative MRIs that even 10 out of 20 showed healing

1283
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:34,360
reconstitution and I'd be in. Yeah. Well, I hope that study is being done. I suspect that there

1284
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:39,160
were a number of obstacles to it. If it's not being done again, it's always possible it's being done.

1285
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:43,720
I'm just unaware of it. But one of them would be, you'd have to standardize the process of generating

1286
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:48,120
the stem cell. Absolutely. One of the challenges of doing a clinical trial is everybody has to get

1287
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:54,760
the same drug. Yes. And if the drug differs, it becomes problematic. Do you know how standardized

1288
02:05:54,760 --> 02:06:00,440
the procedure is for capturing and processing stem cells? Yes. Non. It is. Non-stand-on.

1289
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:03,240
Yeah. So that's part of the challenge. It differs between the different companies

1290
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:09,320
that bring the machines in. It differs between the individual clinicians and so forth. So yes,

1291
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:14,680
that's one of the things that my colleagues and I discuss quite a lot is they, it's not,

1292
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:18,760
it can be apples and oranges. A couple other injuries I want to talk about in the shoulder

1293
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:25,320
before we move to the elbow. So the AC separation, when does it require a repair? When does it just

1294
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:29,560
get left alone and you're stuck looking with a little bit of deformation? Yeah, that's great.

1295
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:32,760
That's a great question because they're so common, the injuries. So let me draw a picture.

1296
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:42,760
Okay. So we have here a just, we've removed the glenohumeral joint and we just have the

1297
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:49,480
AC joint. This is the clavicle coming across. These are the two stabilizers of the clavicle.

1298
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:55,160
One is that's the coracoid process and these are the coracoclavicular ligaments.

1299
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:59,080
And we're just looking at that and done, which is why it looks like a little nub and circle,

1300
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:04,040
but of course it runs. Yeah. It's a thumb that sticks out from that yet another weird part of

1301
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:08,200
that scapula. It's got to be the weirdest looking bone in the body, right? Yeah. And so, and then

1302
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:12,840
secondarily we have the acromiocavicular joint that we were talking about and those are the

1303
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:18,680
ligaments that are circumferential around the chromiocavicular joint. So if you fall hard off

1304
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:28,280
your bike and you sprain your AC joint, we call that a type one. You sprain your AC joint,

1305
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:34,520
you stretch a little bit and injure these ligaments and maybe even stretch those a tiny bit.

1306
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:39,960
It's not displaced. But it doesn't look any different on x-ray. And that is a great one.

1307
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:44,520
Those can hurt and those can damage the cartilage a little bit and you can get a

1308
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:48,120
great one that persists and being painful, but generally they don't, they go away.

1309
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:54,360
I did this recently on some slime out in Dripping Springs riding a bike out there. I just,

1310
02:07:54,360 --> 02:08:01,240
low water crossing, just went out like, like it was on ice and, and it, that's exactly what I had.

1311
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:03,960
And it hurt for six weeks and then it was gone. It's completely normal.

1312
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,920
But it wasn't. Sorry, that diagnosis by the way,

1313
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:09,160
was just pressing right on it. That's how you know it.

1314
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:14,680
Well, I know it because by pressing right on it, it hurt like heck, but it didn't

1315
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:18,920
blot. It didn't move up and down and I could lift my shoulder and I wouldn't,

1316
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:25,160
I could feel it not moving. So one of the things that we, that, that are biomechanically

1317
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:30,680
interesting. We talked to the residents about when we're teaching is it's not that the

1318
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:38,920
clavicle pulls up. It's that the shoulder falls away. These is the primary suspension.

1319
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:44,360
One of the primary suspenders of the shoulder are these two ligamentous structures.

1320
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:44,840
I see.

1321
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:49,400
So if you tear them, the shoulder kind of falls away. So that's why we treat it by wearing a

1322
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:56,520
sling and get that weight of that heavy weight of the arm off. Now down here we have, I have a

1323
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:03,160
shadow drawn. Here's the ACE. Here's the clavicle. We have one acromion, which it's sitting up about

1324
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:09,320
30% or so. That's where you've clearly torn the AC ligaments and you've partially torn,

1325
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:14,760
maybe completely torn, but it just didn't distort it too much where you have, you know,

1326
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:22,120
you have a complete tear, but it's only up about 30%. That's a grade two, grade two. And that,

1327
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:29,480
almost all those can be treated non-operatively. Occasionally those will, again, like the ones

1328
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:33,880
they can hurt, persist, you might have to do something later, but they're basically stable.

1329
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:38,600
And when you treat it non-operatively, is the treatment that it will return to its position

1330
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,960
with elevation?

1331
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:44,840
Sometimes, but usually not. Usually it stays a little elevated, a little proud, but people

1332
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:50,520
don't really care. It's very barely asymmetric. Okay. Then you get here where you have a complete,

1333
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:58,520
it's completely up. And we measure that by the distance between the coracoid and the clavicle.

1334
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:04,840
I've drawn it here to just express that, that difference there in the height. And that is that

1335
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:11,160
coracocavicular distance. If it's here, if it's up to 30% widening increase in that space, then

1336
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:16,680
that's the grade two. If it's a hundred percent or more, then that's a grade three. If it gets up to

1337
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:25,960
a hundred percent, even those, there was a good study done a long time, probably 20 years ago for

1338
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:31,320
NFL athletes who had sustained these. And the prevailing wisdom for the doctors who were

1339
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:39,080
treating the NFL teams was that most of that type threes did not need treatment, surgical treatment,

1340
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:45,560
but a subset of them did go on to needing it later. Now in reality, when they're up that high

1341
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:51,400
and people want to get back sooner, we have met better reconstructive techniques now. And so you

1342
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:57,240
can kind of get back on the bike. And if you're a professional cyclist, if you fix them and get back

1343
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:03,640
on the bike in three or four weeks sort of thing. So there's a gray zone, but the type threes are

1344
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:07,720
that transition. Now, if they are the other- The four is more than a hundred percent cap.

1345
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:14,120
Yes. And then sometimes it can be trapped behind the scapula and all sorts of other things. But

1346
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:20,200
the threes are the sweet spot. The vast majority of the operative ones are in the three category.

1347
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:24,200
And I saw a guy the other day and I kind of presented both options to him. He's a, he's a

1348
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:31,320
athlete. He's a weightlifter, but he's, but he's, he was late forties. And I just gave him the

1349
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:36,920
options. I said, look, one of the things you might consider, and this applies to a lot of what I do

1350
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:42,520
is I said, look, yeah, we can fix this. We can fix it tomorrow or next week. But you could also

1351
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:47,400
wait and see how you feel in three or four weeks. I can do the same repair in three or four weeks.

1352
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:50,840
Yeah, you don't lose anything. You don't lose anything by waiting in that, in that realm. Now,

1353
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:55,080
you do if you wait three months or six months because you don't have the same biology going on.

1354
02:11:56,200 --> 02:12:01,480
And so, and he ended up not wanting it because he felt great. And so-

1355
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,080
How far out was he from the insurance?

1356
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:04,520
He was four weeks when he started.

1357
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:05,560
And the pain was already gone.

1358
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:09,720
Almost already gone. He saw the trajectory being so good that he decided that he wanted to wait.

1359
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:14,600
And the only issue that he's going to struggle with now is the asymmetry aesthetically.

1360
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:16,680
The asymmetry and yes.

1361
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:18,440
It won't have a functional impairment.

1362
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:24,600
Generally not. Except if you're doing certain types, like if you're heavy flies, heavy bench,

1363
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:31,480
even people who rest, you know, do the, I don't do squats, squatted, but you know, heavy-

1364
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:34,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But a high neck, high back squat.

1365
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:39,480
Yeah, high back squat. And those could, I presume that could irritate them and be

1366
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,560
problematic. So, and so there are some-

1367
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,480
And so the repair here is done how?

1368
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:50,040
Yeah. So this is where I differ from some. A lot of people just get in and get out quickly and they

1369
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:57,240
will- Let me draw it here. So if you have it fairly fresh and you have good ligamentous tissue in here,

1370
02:12:57,240 --> 02:13:02,920
then we do what's called a dog bone, which is basically two titanium grommets. And this is

1371
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:07,000
heavy polyester suture. We drill through everything, drill through the clavicle,

1372
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:13,240
drill through the coracoid, and then pass, it's just kind of using some little tricks,

1373
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:17,000
pass the suture up through, pull everything down, have your assistant pull it down,

1374
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,200
that you tie that over and it is rock solid. Rock solid. And they really do well.

1375
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:29,320
Interesting. So in other words, you sort of, you don't do it by going back to the acromion process.

1376
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:33,000
Right. Yeah. Right. You go, you get the anatomy, you get the-

1377
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,320
You line up the anatomy. You get the two one ligaments to be in continuity again,

1378
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:40,760
and then they can heal. And is that a biodegradable polymer? No.

1379
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:47,880
No. So that'll stay forever. Yeah. And so yeah, and it's super strong. And so you can really,

1380
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:52,440
I mean, you don't, you don't, this might go in a week, but you can, depending on what their sport

1381
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:56,440
is, you can let them get back at maybe three or four weeks, certainly six weeks. Six weeks,

1382
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:00,760
this thing is pretty strong where you can do most things. Before we leave the clavicle,

1383
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:05,320
I only asked about this because I just had a patient that went through it. When the clavicle

1384
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:11,400
and the mediastinum separate, I assume that's not as common. No, it is not. It's way less common,

1385
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:15,240
but it's, it can be very problematic. I'm going to draw a great picture. I think so that. Please,

1386
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:20,120
because you know, while you're drawing that, I'll explain the situation. This was a patient who,

1387
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:27,320
um, I'm trying to remember what the, what caused the injury. I,

1388
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:36,680
I wonder if it was a fall, a high fall. Um, it might've even been off a horse or something

1389
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:43,160
as possible. Um, but what surprised me was the patient who was in New York

1390
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:52,120
basically called that morning to say, look, I just saw two surgeons at HSS and they said,

1391
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:59,640
I need to have surgery right away. Um, and you know, I guess it's interesting, right? There are

1392
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:05,960
some things in orthopedic surgery that are, um, are, are a need for an emergent case. Uh, and this

1393
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:08,120
very few, but it's possible. Yes. Yeah.

1394
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:18,680
This is a, a, um, Lord Dottic view, uh, basically of the manubrium sternum, which is our breast

1395
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:24,280
plate there and our, where we can follow our clavicle across to that and we can feel the little

1396
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:30,520
nubs right there at the base. We can feel those sternoclebicular joints. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1397
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:37,960
So you can see it's even worse than the shoulder. It's a very shallow joint. So if you take a

1398
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:44,600
hard blow laterally, hockey players get slammed up against the glass. It's a common,

1399
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:48,920
more common injury in that the football players, the quarterbacks that get tackled by these

1400
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:55,480
300 pounders and their shoulders are wedged together like that. And just so happens that,

1401
02:15:55,480 --> 02:16:00,840
that's what the injury, not to this extent, but the injury that Quinn Ewers, the quarterback for UT

1402
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:06,520
suffer was knocked out in the Alabama game. He's now back. So he obviously didn't have this full

1403
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:12,200
dislocation, but that's what can happen in weird circumstances. And that's what you were talking

1404
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:19,160
about. The mechanics can be that, and it happens a little more commonly in kids, but it can, if the,

1405
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:24,040
the fall is just right and the cancer is just right, it will open this up, tear everything,

1406
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:30,040
and then displace it behind the manubrium. And that's where the, the major, you know,

1407
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:38,760
carotid artery, the drug, vein, lives. And that can be a huge, huge life threatening, not, not life.

1408
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:44,840
Well, it could be life threatening for sure. Yeah. So we have to be careful with those. But this one,

1409
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:51,320
where it's subluxes out the front, those are also problem. You can see that they, they, there's

1410
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:56,680
nothing, there's no way it's going to fall back into place there. So either they stay out, they

1411
02:16:56,680 --> 02:17:03,400
stabilize and people just don't do that much to irritate them or they have to be reconstructed.

1412
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:08,920
And I've had to go in and reconstruct these where I take a tendon from the forearm and make a figure

1413
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:12,840
of eight across the front and basically rebuild those ligaments to hold it back in place. And

1414
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:17,960
why do you do that as opposed to doing an anchor or something like that? Yeah, it's just stronger.

1415
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:26,360
You need some extra collagen there. So what is it about the insult laterally that will

1416
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:32,840
determine a separation here versus here. These are two weak points at each end of the clavicle.

1417
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:37,320
Much more frequently, you're right. Much more frequently here. Well, much more frequently

1418
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:41,560
there, but that's usually a top down. That's usually pitching forward and landing and having

1419
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:46,760
it be that way. But what happens more commonly than the SC joint, the sternoclebicular joint,

1420
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:52,680
is just a clavicle fracture, which are ubiquitous. And that just fractures somewhere, you know,

1421
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:59,400
over there. And then we fix them some and we don't fix others. But in those heel. But the joint,

1422
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:04,760
that weird little joint is very important. It's not common, but it's not rare. So let's talk

1423
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:08,680
briefly about a total shoulder replacement. I think a lot of people are pretty familiar with

1424
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:14,200
a total knee replacement and total hip replacement. To me, the hip replacement has been one of the

1425
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:18,760
modern marvels of orthopedic surgery in the last 30 years. When I think back to when I was in

1426
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:25,640
medical school, that was a brutal procedure. And today, these patients getting total hip

1427
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:31,320
replacements, I mean, they're laughing at everybody else. They do outpatient. Yeah. I mean,

1428
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:35,560
they walk out of the door. It is an outpatient procedure. I still don't, I have to save that

1429
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:40,680
for another discussion. I don't understand how that procedure is so easy today. First off,

1430
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:46,040
what is the indication for the total shoulder replacement? And then secondly, let's talk

1431
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:52,840
briefly about what is actually being replaced and what that recovery is like and what limitations

1432
02:18:52,840 --> 02:19:02,200
exist after the fact. That's great. It is also an outpatient procedure unless you have

1433
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:09,800
comorbidities. I do most of these. Okay. And I can even use a smaller picture now because

1434
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:13,080
the types of implants we're using now have evolved significantly.

1435
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:21,480
Yeah. All right. So when you've worn down the cartilage completely, either on one or both of

1436
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:30,200
the surfaces, then that's incompatible with good function, usually because of pain. And you ask,

1437
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:35,080
what is the primary indication? It's pain. I don't care. I see patients all the time who come in,

1438
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:41,160
who have the ugliest x-rays you've ever seen to your point about the cervical spine,

1439
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:46,920
which is so important. They have no pain and they can do whatever they want to do. As you know,

1440
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:52,440
that the scapula, the scapula thoracic motion can give us a lot of functions. So they're fine.

1441
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:56,520
And I just occasionally they'll say, Hey, you know, I'm going on a trip where I want to be able to

1442
02:19:56,520 --> 02:20:01,640
play golf for three weeks or two weeks with my, you know, family. Maybe could you give me an

1443
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:05,720
injection? Sure. Give them a cortisone shot and they rock on that. They get three months,

1444
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:11,240
four months of relief, and then they keep going. So it's only the very active people who need to

1445
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:19,320
be able to do separate certain things. And age is not a factor. My oldest patient who I did shoulder

1446
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:29,320
replacements on quite a long time ago was the, um, she was 97 and she was spry and healthy,

1447
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:34,040
walked the streets of Manhattan up and down. She actually still worked at 97. I won't say

1448
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:39,400
where cause it might give it away. She was the oldest and longest standing employee of a, of a,

1449
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:47,080
of a famous place. And she, um, and after I did that, I did them back to back and I'd see her on

1450
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:53,400
the street walking down 57th street and she'd say, Hey doc, I'm doing great. And she was 97, 98, 99.

1451
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:58,680
I lost track of that point. So it totally changed her life cause she couldn't use her arms because

1452
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:05,320
they were hurting so much. So age is not a factor to your, and just to be clear, was her arthritis

1453
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:13,800
the result of likely a labral repair that never, like what caused so much degeneration in her?

1454
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:18,360
Some people just get it. It's no different than you. Oh, so it's not constant subluxations

1455
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:23,960
necessarily that are necessary. These, you know, some people just have, I, one of my attendings

1456
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:28,440
when I was in either med school residency said, yeah, it's like a paint job. You can have a paint

1457
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:33,240
job. That's a Mercedes. You can have a paint job. That's a Ford Pinto. And I'm not saying anything

1458
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:38,600
derogatory to Pinto's, uh, but you know, the, the, the quality of the paint job can, uh, what you're

1459
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:45,480
born with. And, um, so that's the main thing. And that's the main source of garden variety,

1460
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:50,040
osteoarthritis of the shoulder. And then there are the athletes who are separate categories based on

1461
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:55,800
what you're wearing. So, um, the youngest you've ever done this on the youngest I've ever done a

1462
02:21:55,800 --> 02:22:02,520
replacement, a full replacement, almost 55. Yeah. I don't, I, I'm usually we'll do a work around.

1463
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:11,560
I saw a guy, um, about 15 years ago who came to me, he had, he had pretty, you can see it visually,

1464
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:15,480
but it wasn't terrible. And he said he was been booked for a replacement. I said, look,

1465
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:21,160
you're a little young and he was, he was about 48. And I said, you're too young for me. I wouldn't,

1466
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:25,240
I think we should at least give something else a shot. I said, what I would probably do,

1467
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:28,600
even though the data is not great. It's one of the few things I do that I know,

1468
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:32,920
but I tell him at the outset that you have about a 50% chance of getting better.

1469
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:39,080
And that's just a scope clean out. We know they have arthritis. They don't have instability and

1470
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:42,680
just try to clean them out and buy them some more time, kick this can as far down the road as

1471
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:49,880
possible. About 15 years later, he came back to me showing me shoulder motion was fine. He had,

1472
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:55,960
his x-rays had an advanced and he came for something else. So that was an example of what

1473
02:22:55,960 --> 02:23:00,440
I, you know, try to do, but he can't always effect that, but that was just an anecdotal

1474
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:05,960
and it's worth doing. It's such a minimal operation, right? No recovery. So, um,

1475
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:13,720
and oftentimes if people have bilateral osteoarthritis, they, um, they don't,

1476
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:17,880
they don't need both sides done. They're happy with one side to, they have a good one that they

1477
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:23,800
reach over dominant arm or something like that. But an example of sort of a very active to our

1478
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:29,640
point about physiology and biologic age and so forth. A really wonderful athletic woman who was

1479
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:37,800
an avid sailing. She sailed in regattas, raced, uh, still at the age of about 75. She was still

1480
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:43,080
going racing all the time, pulling lanyards, et cetera. And she said, I can't do this anymore.

1481
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:48,680
I just can't do it. And I want to keep doing it. Can I keep doing that? And I said, sure. So I

1482
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:53,000
replaced both of her shoulders and she, how much do you separate those two operations by? She was

1483
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,720
about four months apart. Yeah. It was kind of more. She said, I'm going to give up a year

1484
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:02,760
of the sailing. Yeah. I want to get back to it. So, um, you could do them a little closer together

1485
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:08,120
if you want. Um, and she, uh, she's still sailing. You still, so, so let's go over the anatomy here

1486
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:11,960
or the replacement. Obviously there's two pieces to it, right? There's the, the humeral side and

1487
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:19,080
the glenoid side. Yeah. So, um, well, you know what? Let me, I'm going to draw another picture

1488
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:26,200
real fast that will show what a arthritic shoulder looks like. And then that'll help. Yeah. I'll do

1489
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:34,200
it small. So in the little picture, uh, to the left, I've drawn an arthritic shoulder, not well,

1490
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:38,440
but I've drawn it to make a point. So it kind of, the head kind of flattens out. You have no space

1491
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:42,840
in there at all. You get a bone spur down here. You get some spurring around the perimeter of the

1492
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:49,480
glenoid and all of that conspires to greatly diminish the motion of the shoulder and,

1493
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:54,920
and cause pain. So they get two, there's two reasons they come dysfunction because they can't

1494
02:24:54,920 --> 02:25:00,840
do what they desperately want to do, whether it's recreational or work sometimes. And number two,

1495
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:07,080
pain, uh, either one of those is a solid indication for it when the radiographic findings are there.

1496
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:11,960
And if we do that, then what we do is, is go in and now we do these through incision that big,

1497
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:21,320
you know, uh, it's just a very small interior incision and take down part or all or part or

1498
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:27,160
most of the subscapularis, the tendon in the front, we have to have a window in. Now we can work

1499
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:33,720
through the interval, the space between the super space and the subscapularis, but only if it's a

1500
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:37,960
more limited replacement. And, but anyway, you take some of that off, you have a window there,

1501
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:43,880
you have retractors in and you use an oscillating saw and just take that arthritic head off of there

1502
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:50,920
like that. And all the bone spurs. Then, um, with that space that that creates, you use another

1503
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:56,600
retractor, push the head, the, the shaft and what's left of the shaft, what's left of the shaft away.

1504
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:01,320
And then you get in and work on the glenoid and you ream that down to where it's all smooth,

1505
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:07,320
get the bone spurs out of the perimeter and then put in this little, um, high density polyethylene

1506
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:11,640
solid ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. Exactly. Very durable. I mean, you wear out.

1507
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:15,880
It's the same thing. That's the tibial plateau. Exactly. Exactly. Same. It's great. And then

1508
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:21,000
these have little pegs, you drill holes, you maybe, uh, usually cement those in just a little bit,

1509
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,960
uh, some are press fit, but usually cemented in a little bit, just that part. And it just,

1510
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:31,000
it's a perfect, nice new Teflon surface for them, this cobalt chromium or whatever,

1511
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:37,240
alloy it is, uh, for the head and you, the, you know, the bone has a central core and you clean

1512
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:41,720
that out, get it fixed. And this is press fit. We don't cement these anymore unless people have

1513
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:47,960
really bad bone or supervision, just press fit it into that can sell us bone. And, uh, and it's super

1514
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:53,480
solid. The rotator cuff is kept intact. The rotator cuff is still intact on top. You're working

1515
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:59,960
around that reattach the subscapularis. And so if you're going to transect the subscapularis,

1516
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:03,640
what is the least traumatic place to do it completely within the muscle I'm assuming?

1517
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:08,200
Yeah. No, no, actually on the tendon where it inserts. Oh, you have to because you're reattaching.

1518
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:13,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. And, uh, we leave a sleeve so we can suture tendon to tendon,

1519
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:19,720
but then we also put this heavy suture into bone. So you get bone reinforcement and you've got tendon

1520
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:25,400
to tendon healing. You also, by doing that, you maintain the normal length. So you get. So the

1521
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:30,120
only thing, I mean, this is oversimplification, but the biggest thing this person is missing is a

1522
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:36,840
labrum. Yes. Yeah. And they don't really need it. So what stabilizes this joint? The fact that it's

1523
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:43,400
arthritic, it's already stabilized itself, unless it's a weird dislocating joint, you know, which is

1524
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:47,000
a different entity and you have to address that differently for the garden variety one, they've

1525
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,920
already kind of stiffened up all the tissues, even though. So what does their capsule look like when

1526
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:57,160
you go in typically? It's thick, super thick, super thick. We resect some of it even. It's so thick.

1527
02:27:57,160 --> 02:28:03,000
Okay. It's kind of space occupying almost. And what is this person's in a good case? Yeah. What

1528
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:10,760
is the limitation on this person a year out from surgery? Yeah. Really nothing except heavy weights.

1529
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:15,640
Like I don't want people doing bench press. I don't want them doing the, you know, iron cross

1530
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:21,080
type things. And they're using not, I had one patient. Can they throw a ball? Yeah. Yeah. I think

1531
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:24,920
throw a ball. They can play catch. I'm saying they can play catch with their grandkids and play catch

1532
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:31,320
with their grandkids for sure. They can play tennis. They can play tennis and play tennis and play

1533
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:37,640
golf. They shoot a basketball. Yeah. Can they swim? Yes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's one of the big,

1534
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:42,520
the big ones. People love swimming. You know, later in life, it's such good. Yeah. Fantastic.

1535
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:47,480
And they can swim until they're a hundred and, and you can absolutely, oh yeah, you can swim

1536
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:52,520
until the cows come home here. Yeah. So this is just another one of those game changing operations.

1537
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:58,280
Right. Yeah. But it's a, it's different than the hips and the knees. The hips and the knees allow

1538
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:05,880
people to live in the world again. These are game changer quality of life things. Yeah. And I won't

1539
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:10,920
do them if I know I can manage them and kick the can down the road and just inject them once

1540
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:16,360
a year with cortisone. I want them, I want them to be dragging that arm in. I want them to be

1541
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:20,520
saying, you got to do it now. I'm not getting enough relief from the cortisone and do it.

1542
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:27,080
Yeah. All right. Well, let's, let's pivot now to talk about another piece of anatomy down the arm,

1543
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:33,560
which is the elbow. So let's take a moment and just go back to the anatomy. Do you want to draw a

1544
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:39,720
little sketch of how the humorous lines up with the ulnar and the radius? Very much so. All right.

1545
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:46,120
So the big diagram is looking straight at the antecubital fossa. And then obviously the side

1546
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:52,440
diagram is, is showing the arm flexed. So walk people through what these, these three bones are

1547
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:58,440
and then the sort of overlaying muscles. So this is, as you said, the, the, the front of the elbows

1548
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:02,840
here, the humorous bone, which is the arm bone is coming down. And you see, it's a super weird

1549
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:08,600
undulating structure there, which makes it intrinsically quite stable. So much different

1550
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:12,920
because there's more to dig into. Exactly. There's all these fun little, you know,

1551
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:19,160
almost jigsaw puzzle pieces that stick together. We have the radial head, which is the rotating

1552
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:26,360
bone of the forearm. And then we have the ulna, which is the fixed straight bone of the forearm.

1553
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:35,000
And then we have, what's, what's cool about the elbow is the tendons that go down to the forearm

1554
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:41,320
into the hand originate above the joint, more or less, right. Close juxto, articulate close to

1555
02:30:41,320 --> 02:30:47,560
joint, but above it. And then the ones that go from, from the shoulder and arm down, uh, attach

1556
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:53,560
below the joint. And this is the biceps tendon here, the big biceps muscle here, the biceps

1557
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:59,320
and attaching to the radius. And we'll talk about that. This is the lateral side, the outside of

1558
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:05,720
your elbow. And the, the blue is the muscle tendon units that are attached there, anchored to this

1559
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:12,840
little circle or oval. And then the red part is where tearing typically occurs in tennis elbow

1560
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:19,000
on the inside of the elbow, where our funny bone nerve is the funny bone nerve is the ulnar nerve.

1561
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:24,680
And that's, that's the green structure in cross section. And then overlying that as the muscles,

1562
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:32,520
the flexor pronator muscles that, that help bend the elbow and, and pronate the forearm.

1563
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:38,920
And those can tear around in this region. And that's actually where we get golfer's elbow and

1564
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:45,080
what it's known as golfer's elbow, which is medial epicondylitis, medial. And then the lateral side,

1565
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:51,560
which is the tennis elbow is lateral epicondylitis. And those are the most, these three, the biceps

1566
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:59,960
tendon. And these two are the most common tendon injuries by far. The fourth, which is less common,

1567
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:05,560
is shown in the lateral, which is the triceps coming down and attaching to the tip of our elbow.

1568
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:15,480
We talked about the bursa before, and there is a bursa right here that lives over the tip of our

1569
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:22,200
elbow and we can get the big golf ball size or filling of fluid. And that's the olecranon bursa.

1570
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:28,040
And so, um, I think it's beyond what we're talking about today to go into the fractures,

1571
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:34,920
but any parts of these can be broken. And, uh, the elbow is a very finicky joint. You can see because

1572
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:39,880
it's stable because of those undulating surfaces, but because they're undulating,

1573
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:45,160
there's less wiggle room, there's less. And they, if you don't get those things perfect,

1574
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:49,480
when you fix them, they can quickly lead to arthritis. And some of the, even the subtle

1575
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:55,480
fracture patterns that happen and aren't seen or appreciated can lead to rapid destruction of the

1576
02:32:55,480 --> 02:33:01,640
joint. So it's a finicky joint. It is also, oh, I've drawn this blue structure here,

1577
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:07,320
which is a very thick ligament on the inside of the elbow. That is the Tommy John ligament. It's

1578
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:11,880
not really Tommy John and even, uh, well, I'll clarify that in a minute, but that's the medial

1579
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:16,040
collateral ligament or the owner collateral ligament. And that's the one that's torn and

1580
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:22,520
throwing athletes. Um, and that's can be a career ending except now because of the reconstructive

1581
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:31,880
surgery, it's generally not. Um, so let's talk just briefly about why the, um, lateral epicondyle,

1582
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:36,680
if there's inflammation in that tendon, we sort of think of that as the, the injury a tennis player

1583
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:41,160
gets, whereas inflammation in the medial tendon is more attributed to what a golfer gets. Of course,

1584
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:45,640
people who have never played tennis or golf often get these things, but it could be illustrative

1585
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:52,120
just to explain the movement patterns. Great. So those are not dissimilar from the super

1586
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:58,040
splenatus tendon where they have a little ringing out and they, they kind of can become degenerative

1587
02:33:58,040 --> 02:34:03,480
and partially tear. Just like we talked about rotator cuffs, there are tons of people walking

1588
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:09,400
down the streets with partial tears and those tendons and they're asymptomatic use patterns are

1589
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:15,720
significant for that. The reason the lateral was historically associated and called tennis elbow

1590
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:23,560
is because of one handed back hands. It's a much less mechanically sound and it's, we have less

1591
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:28,920
strength with our external rotators than we have with our pectoralis and our subscapularis for

1592
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:36,760
forehand shots. So it's under more stress and, and you can get them at any age, but the sweet spot of

1593
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:43,240
seeing treating this is 40 to 60, 40 to 60. Now that, that is creeping up to the 70s and so

1594
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:48,520
forth because again, people are so active. So that's why it's been associated with tennis elbow.

1595
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:55,000
Ironically now I'm seeing justice in tennis players and competitive tennis players. I'm seeing

1596
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:00,680
justice much medial epicondylitis, which is traditionally golfer's elbow. And the reason

1597
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:08,520
is because everybody is trying to hit massive topspin and they are hit using their pronator

1598
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:15,000
so much more than they used to when we were, when I was a kid and playing, I try to hit topspin now.

1599
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,920
And, and so that's a reason why it's stimulated more. Why does the golfer get it? I don't play

1600
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:23,960
golf. So I don't appreciate it enough. So historically, historically,

1601
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:29,240
even though golfers were getting it, I don't know why, because you're not supposed to be,

1602
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:34,840
it's overheating with your, your trailing arm. Most people play right-handed and they were getting

1603
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:40,840
it on their right medial epicondylitis because they were overheating, hitting stomps, hitting rocks,

1604
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:46,680
you know, duffing. And it was that Joel, again, the eccentric load on these tenants, which our

1605
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:54,680
on these tenants, which our tenants don't like, but I'm seeing now because people are hitting so

1606
02:35:54,680 --> 02:36:00,280
much harder, they're hitting bigger clubs, especially drivers and such, they're getting

1607
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:07,880
more left leading arm lateral epicondylitis in golfers. On the leading arm. On the leading arms.

1608
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:11,080
Because that, and that, that's more logical actually. Yeah. But they're just trying to hit

1609
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:15,480
harder and farther. And you know, once these big hitters are on there, they're trying to mimic them

1610
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:22,760
and so forth. So is the first line treatment for that rest followed by, you know, rest and NSAIDs

1611
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:29,720
presumably followed by cortisone and things of that nature. Right. So the first line of treatment

1612
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:34,440
is always is rest, good stretching, just like you stretch your hamstrings to keep from tearing

1613
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:40,280
them as frequently or injuring them as frequently. And, and usually just NSAIDs by mouth. If they're

1614
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:45,400
on, rarely do I use physical therapy for these formally because it's just not much to do.

1615
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:52,200
But if the, if they're just too painful to even, some people wake up in the morning, they can't

1616
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:56,760
even straighten their elbow out. They're so painful. They're so spongy and really inflamed.

1617
02:36:56,760 --> 02:37:02,600
So those, I still don't splint them, but I have them stretch. But more often because they can't

1618
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:07,480
use their arm, I will go ahead and give them kind of a half dose of cortisone just to cool everything

1619
02:37:07,480 --> 02:37:14,520
down. Yeah. You injected me probably four or five years ago when I was sort of in the transition of

1620
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:21,560
really learning how to control my scapula and had sort of overcooked too many pullups. Yeah. And

1621
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:29,960
all this pull up pain was translating into tennis elbow. Yeah. I was surprised at, and it was stubborn.

1622
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:35,720
I mean, I, this thing, I, I came to you after six months of pain, but that one injection cooled it

1623
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:40,200
off. That never hurt again. Yeah. Because basically I had already fixed the underlying

1624
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:45,640
movement pattern. I just needed to cool the fire off. Is that a common scenario? It really is. It

1625
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:51,240
really is. I, and again, I don't operate on, I mean, because it's so common, I ended up doing a

1626
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:57,800
lot of these procedures, but I don't operate on, I'd say one out of five at the most, 20% at the

1627
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:04,280
most. Most people get better. And so operating on the lateral versus the medial side, what are the

1628
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:11,160
indications? Yeah. The indications are the same, failing conservative treatment, a lot of stretching,

1629
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:16,760
a lot of strengthening. A lot of people get these, in your case, it was mechanics overdoing,

1630
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:22,040
but a lot of people get these because they're, they're getting back into something that they

1631
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:26,840
haven't been doing in a long time and they overdo it. And it can be just weights and weightlifting,

1632
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:31,080
but honestly, it's something as mundane. I'll see these after people have gone traveling for two

1633
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:37,160
weeks, just lifting their luggage, dragging their luggage around. So it's all comers, but

1634
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:45,320
the theme is that conditioning, if they've had it chronically, not in your case, of course, but

1635
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:48,840
a lot of people come in and they're already kind of weak. They don't have strong grip strength. They

1636
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:54,680
don't have good tone. And so strengthening is a critical component. If I can get, if they can

1637
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:59,800
squeeze my, I have one of my devices, if they can squeeze that without just a little pain, then I

1638
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:05,080
just have them do that first, stretching and strengthening. And, and, and sometimes that'll

1639
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:09,800
cure it and often it'll cure it. Then, but if they can't squeeze it without undue pain, I give them

1640
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:15,800
a little dose of cortisone. If it's chronic like yours was, then there's not that much to do. Your

1641
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:21,480
fit, your, your gut great tone and you've got full motion. So it's only, yeah, give it a little

1642
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:27,560
booster dose just to knock it out. We think sometimes we haven't ever done the study to prove

1643
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:32,280
it, but we think sometimes just sticking the needle in a few times kind of stimulates a healing.

1644
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:37,160
Yeah. I've certainly seen a lot of anecdotal stuff around dry needling, just getting the dry needle

1645
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:43,640
in there. I believe in that. Yeah. And just, uh, increasing the influx of inflammatory, uh,

1646
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:49,960
uh, cells and cleaning up getting macrophages to come and clean it up. Yeah. So outside of fractures,

1647
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:56,520
how often are you seeing acute injuries to the elbow that ultimately are surgical cases?

1648
02:39:56,520 --> 02:40:05,320
So one of the common ones is the, um, middle age, but very active fit person who

1649
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:11,720
maybe had a little antecedent elbow pain or forearm pain. They didn't quite know what it was,

1650
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:17,080
but they did workarounds and then they ruptured their distal biceps. And so they get a Popeye

1651
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:22,760
muscle. It's all weird and even quivering and they come in and they go, Oh my God, you've got to do

1652
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:29,640
something. And, um, the cool thing about the bicep, we think of the biceps as, as being, you know,

1653
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:35,480
we do biceps, but it's an elbow flexor and it is a secondary elbow flexor, but it's the primary

1654
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:41,160
supinator of the form. So people come in and they lose when they, when they tear their biceps,

1655
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:47,960
they don't lose that much flexion strength, but they lose most of their supination strength. So

1656
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:54,280
if they are used to turning screwdrivers, wrenches, um, even surgical instruments, maybe

1657
02:40:54,280 --> 02:41:01,400
depending on what they do, um, then it can be really disabling. So that factors into the physical

1658
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:05,960
exam then, doesn't it? Oh yeah. And it's funny, they'll come in, they won't be painful to say,

1659
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:10,040
I think it's better. And yeah, I've got this, but I can live with the deformity,

1660
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:16,440
which I don't care about the formity either. Um, and then I will pronate them to wrap that tendon

1661
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:21,080
kind of around the radius. And then I have them pull up like they're doing a pronated curl

1662
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:27,400
and they scream. And it's just, you get it just isolated. And that's a very good point about that.

1663
02:41:27,400 --> 02:41:31,320
And then you test their supination. They didn't know that they didn't have any supination strength

1664
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:34,600
and you test their other side and they can lift you off the table. And then this side,

1665
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:40,120
they can't even do it. So, um, so when you surgically repair that, are you reattaching

1666
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:45,560
the tendon? Yeah. Same place. So it's like a tendinesis. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's great.

1667
02:41:45,640 --> 02:41:50,120
It's great operation. So that's a good outcome operation. Oh yeah. Uh, I had a guy on the other

1668
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:55,320
day, it just looks just like you, you know, good, good, strong arms and everything. And he's doing

1669
02:41:55,320 --> 02:42:01,320
this all the time and he ruptured his and, um, he came back in for, uh, actually with his son.

1670
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:05,560
And he said, he said, man, if you need anybody to, he said, my arm is stronger than it's been

1671
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:11,240
in a long time. And that's, I'll speak to that. But he said, he said, yeah, if you need somebody

1672
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:16,040
to, to, to call anybody to talk to him about how great this operation is, just let me know.

1673
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:21,480
But he was, he said he was, a lot of them say, you know, I feel almost like I'm stronger than

1674
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:25,720
I was before. Well, you're only putting it back where it came from, but they probably had a

1675
02:42:25,720 --> 02:42:30,840
partial tear for a long time. They're working around, they were little deconditioned in their

1676
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:35,080
biceps. They were compensating for the, with their brachialis, the big muscle underneath that.

1677
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:40,920
And, um, so that, and then they get even stronger because they have a good tendon again.

1678
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:45,880
Wow. We talked, you want to just briefly talk about the Tommy John, which again has kind of

1679
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:51,400
revolutionized major league baseball. So when this tears, um, and this tears, the, uh,

1680
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:59,000
on the medial side, you all of, and in fact, it's super physiologic torques that ligament is subjected

1681
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:06,040
to super physiologic in throwers and high level throwers who are throwing 90 plus miles per hour.

1682
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:11,160
It is subjected to such, such forces, traction forces that it will rupture.

1683
02:43:11,960 --> 02:43:19,880
And the way they keep from rupturing in general is by fitness, by steady long-term fitness.

1684
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:27,160
And that's flexor pronator fitness, that shoulder, streakness, uh, shoulder strengthening and, uh,

1685
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:32,280
biceps, triceps, and so forth. By strengthening everything around it, you can protect that ligament.

1686
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:38,360
And if you don't, then it can rupture because it's being subjected repetitively over and over

1687
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:46,760
over again, year after year to super physiologic loads. And, um, so when it ruptures, it's easy

1688
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:51,240
instantaneously. They lose it, they can throw, but they lose 10 miles per hour on their fast ball.

1689
02:43:51,800 --> 02:43:55,640
They just, it just immediately downgrades their ability to throw.

1690
02:43:56,200 --> 02:44:00,440
That's so interesting because most of us wouldn't, I mean, like, I don't think I could throw a ball

1691
02:44:00,440 --> 02:44:05,880
50 miles an hour. So to think like, does that mean I would go from 50 to 40? No. Or it just

1692
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:10,680
means I could never get, I wouldn't notice it. Is that the difference? Yeah. And so we don't,

1693
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:16,040
that's the, that's the common fallacy of people coming in all the time and they, all of us playing

1694
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:21,960
tennis, uh, playing, uh, certainly golf, throwing balls, playing catch. We don't need it. We don't

1695
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:26,520
need the ligament. So that is literally an operation that is only designed for the most elite

1696
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:31,480
throwers. Yes. Period. Awesome. And that's a common misconception. Of course, one of the,

1697
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:36,120
are there some shady people, sorry to interrupt you, are there some shady people out there that

1698
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:43,960
are doing that operation on non-athletes? Sure. Sure. But more importantly, and I say this,

1699
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:50,200
I'm sure they have love in their heart, but there's some shady parents too, who will bring their kids

1700
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:57,800
in who say, you know, we know our kid has this great potential. Can you do, because the stories

1701
02:44:57,800 --> 02:45:03,160
about Tommy John surgery, which this is not Tommy John surgery anymore. What was done on Tommy John

1702
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:07,800
was not the same operation. It was the same ligament, but it's totally different now.

1703
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:12,280
But it's good to refer to it as that. I, it's nothing, the guy who invented it was brilliant.

1704
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:20,520
But parents will come in and say, you know, my, my kid needs five miles per hour on the fast ball.

1705
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:26,920
And because so many people like the biceps have had partial tears, they've finally torn, had a

1706
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:33,960
reconstruction and they gain six or seven miles faster than they've thrown as an adult. It's,

1707
02:45:33,960 --> 02:45:39,560
it's because they had a partial tear and never could get that final extra velocity. And then once

1708
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:47,640
they have a reconstruction, they can. And so that travels through the chat rooms and lore. And then

1709
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:52,520
parents come in and say, Hey, can, and their kid has no problem. And they say, can, can we do it,

1710
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:58,280
Tommy John so that we can get more velocity. And you have to explain to them that there's

1711
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:04,040
nothing wrong with their kid's elbow. There's just something that the kid is not destined to be,

1712
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:11,240
you know, Nolan Ryan. Yeah. Interesting. So, and it's, it's with best of intentions,

1713
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:16,920
but you know, things get distorted. What about the tricep tendon? Does that ever,

1714
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:24,040
what, what type of injury will, will injure that tendon to the point where it's coming off the

1715
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:30,280
electron on? You already know. It's what you, you talk about all the time. It's the eccentric loading.

1716
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:37,160
So it's the, they almost always tear falling, skiing where they're trying to stop themselves

1717
02:46:37,160 --> 02:46:43,480
from smashing their face. Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They rip off like that. I see them

1718
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:48,680
every winter and how clean a break is it? It varies. Some people, if they've had chronic

1719
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:52,760
condition, we'll have a little bone spurs in there and it'll pull off kind of part of the bone spur

1720
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:58,680
and everything. Usually it pulls off the bone or leaves a little stub there. And it's pretty clean

1721
02:46:58,760 --> 02:47:06,360
usually, but man, it is the triceps is a huge muscle. Bigger than biceps. Yeah. Yeah. Huge muscle.

1722
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:11,480
And so it's really disabling. People can't even push up out of chairs. You have to fix those.

1723
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:17,880
Yeah. I mean, you have to, I mean, there's, they're not ruptured in sedentary, non low functioning

1724
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:22,520
people. They rupture in active people. You've got to fix them. Okay. So maybe now we could just kind

1725
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:27,800
of have you examine my elbow and go through all of these planes of motion. Cause obviously you want

1726
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:34,040
to know how I'm flexing, how I'm extending supinating and pronating and my strength,

1727
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:38,120
eccentrically and concentrically, I guess. Yeah, that's right. And in the elbow, it's,

1728
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:43,560
it's very distinct. There are very specific stresses you can put on the elbow that will

1729
02:47:43,560 --> 02:47:49,400
guide you, guide us directly to what is hurting. And again, it goes back to a lot of middle-aged

1730
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:55,480
athletic people have some changes in the lateral epicondylate, condon muscles, the medial epicondyl

1731
02:47:55,480 --> 02:48:01,320
muscles, some even in the triceps and the distal biceps. You have to isolate those and make sure

1732
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:12,040
they're symptomatic. Okay. So as we were discussing, the elbow is a super weird, complicated joint

1733
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:15,880
and there's a lot of things going on there. So let's cover that a little bit and see what's,

1734
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:20,680
what's going on. So one of the cool things about, as we talked about is that carrying angle. And I'm

1735
02:48:20,680 --> 02:48:27,320
going to look and see, do you have symmetry? Do you have any swelling? Do you have any things that

1736
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:32,360
look atypical? Well, I can tell you one that's super easy to just to see. If you rupture your

1737
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:37,880
distal biceps, as many people who are doing CrossFit, being pushed by people that are half their age in

1738
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:43,320
the gym and being pushed too much, they rupture the distal biceps here and then your biceps

1739
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:50,120
contour shifts up. So if we come right here and we look, you have a nice distal, distal muscle

1740
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:55,880
belly that's way, way down, which is what you want that level. You're about two finger breasts

1741
02:48:55,880 --> 02:49:02,120
will go up for finger breasts and it just, it's disconnected. And what's weird about that is

1742
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:06,760
it's not. So if I test you in supination like that, whether you have a good biceps or not,

1743
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:11,080
you're going to be super strong and it's not going to hurt because that's mostly brachialis,

1744
02:49:11,080 --> 02:49:17,880
that underlying broad, strong muscle that gives us our basic curling capability. The biceps

1745
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:23,160
is cool because, and we can watch your biceps because it's well defined, is we go from pronation

1746
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:27,560
supination with a little resistance. I'll just resist a little bit. You go there, you can see it

1747
02:49:27,560 --> 02:49:34,600
ball up a little bit. So it's contracting and pulling up. That biceps is the primary supinator.

1748
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:39,560
So I'm testing that now. If I have you supinate and it hurts or it's weak, then we know something's

1749
02:49:39,560 --> 02:49:46,360
going on right there. Secondarily, if I have you do a pronated curl in that position, that will hurt

1750
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:51,880
like crazy if you have even a partial tear of the distal biceps. In that pain, people say,

1751
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:56,440
well, it's not my biceps, it's down in here, but that's where it attaches. It's way down in here.

1752
02:49:57,160 --> 02:50:02,600
It attaches to the radius and rotates the radius. So that's a super cool, super great, easy way to

1753
02:50:02,600 --> 02:50:09,480
chest. Now, if we look at the lateral epicondyle, we talked about tennis elbow, lateral epicondylitis,

1754
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:14,600
that's down here. Very pinpoint. People say, how did you know where it was? Well, it's not hard

1755
02:50:14,600 --> 02:50:20,680
because that's where everything happens. And it's right there. The ECRB tendon lies deep right next

1756
02:50:20,680 --> 02:50:27,880
to the bone and it will often be swollen, spongy, very tender. So we palpate that. We can see it,

1757
02:50:27,880 --> 02:50:32,920
we sponge it. And sometimes I can feel if it's a medium sized partial thickness tear, I can feel

1758
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:37,400
the defect in there just with my thumb. And people don't like that. You don't keep torturing it. Then

1759
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:44,040
with the elbow straight, I have you pull up against me and like that. And that will hurt badly.

1760
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:48,680
Now, for some reason, when we flex this way and pull up again, it hurts a little less. I don't

1761
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:53,080
even know why that is. I've never been able to figure that out. But both of those will hurt with

1762
02:50:53,080 --> 02:50:57,160
tennis elbow. And that's a pretty simple, straightforward diagnosis. Now on the inside,

1763
02:50:57,160 --> 02:51:04,520
I'll use this elbow. The medial epicondyle, which is golfer's elbow, is it tends to be even more

1764
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:10,200
tender. And I think that's because the ulnar nerve lies so close to it. And it's very spongy,

1765
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:15,000
very swollen, very tender right there. It's a little bit different anatomically in terms of

1766
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,640
the way the tendon inserts. So these need surgery much less. But man, when they're on fire, they

1767
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:24,680
really hurt. People can't even press, you know, it's this movement here. That's what really

1768
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:30,200
causes that to hurt there. Now in your case, and we're going to talk about the nerves, I think

1769
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:38,200
later. But you have, I want to feel your nerve and I can, you can see that I can roll your ulnar nerve,

1770
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:43,240
the funny bone nerve up over that medial epicondyle bone. So you have a very mobile

1771
02:51:43,240 --> 02:51:48,520
ulnar nerve. And we'll talk about that a little more. But that's a normal variant. And that's

1772
02:51:48,520 --> 02:51:55,080
just what it is. And that's fine. Okay, let's see now, very importantly in the elbow, we want to

1773
02:51:55,080 --> 02:52:01,000
look at range of motion. It's very common for athletes, long time weight lifters, football

1774
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:09,080
players, you know, all sorts of people to have a contracture of the elbow. So you have nice,

1775
02:52:09,080 --> 02:52:15,240
full, mild hyperextension, not dramatic. If you have genetic laxity, sometimes that'll go back

1776
02:52:15,240 --> 02:52:22,520
45 degrees. You don't, it's just nice, full, easy motion, minus, I would call it minus 10 degrees

1777
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:28,200
at the most. And then I look at your flexion, which is normally up around 150 degrees and so forth,

1778
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:34,840
again, from that zero position. Very important to look at that. We need, we know a functional arc

1779
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:39,480
is about a hundred degree arc, we can function well, but we have to get up to about 130 to be

1780
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:47,400
able to get to our hair and face and mouth. And so that's a common result of minor fractures in

1781
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:54,840
the elbow, inflammation in the elbow, and so forth. Professional pitchers, almost all of them have

1782
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:59,640
about a 15 to 20 degree elbow contracture from all the loads that have been put on the elbow,

1783
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:05,080
and they're functional, they're fine. We're going to talk about the nerves later. So that's really

1784
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:10,600
the, oh, the triceps. So the triceps attaches here on the olecranon and you've got a big,

1785
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:15,800
well-developed triceps here and we've got, we've got your triceps inserting there. Now we can

1786
02:53:15,800 --> 02:53:20,920
watch that and people who are doing a lot of weight lifting, especially been out of it for

1787
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:24,360
a long time or they're doing a lot of pushups things, that's where they'll get the triceps

1788
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:30,840
tendonitis or a partial rupture. You talked about the eccentric loading. If you land hard and you

1789
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:37,720
have that eccentric load, you can tear off part or all the triceps. That's a miserable, always

1790
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:42,520
surgical diagnosis because you just can't do anything. You can't even push up out of a chair.

1791
02:53:42,520 --> 02:53:47,880
You need that big triceps. So we look at that. Now, if you just have tendonitis, what I'll do is

1792
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:54,920
hyperflex and then have you push against me like this, push hard. That hurts like crazy if you have

1793
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:59,240
any inflammation there because there's such a biomechanical disadvantage when it's trying to

1794
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:07,160
extend from a very flexed position. You know better than me. And so what do you think is the ideal,

1795
02:54:07,160 --> 02:54:11,000
since you do a lot of this and talked to a lot of your patients about it, what do you think is the,

1796
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:15,640
I don't know the answer to this, the ideal position for doing triceps workouts?

1797
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:23,560
I mean, I think the literature actually suggests that you want to be in an extended position of

1798
02:54:23,560 --> 02:54:29,080
the humerus or flexed positions. You want a humeral flexed so that to stretch the

1799
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:33,400
stretch the triceps, you want the tricep to be under a stretch. So it's better than doing them

1800
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:39,240
down here. Correct. Interesting. So basically if you're on your back doing like a skull pressure,

1801
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:44,600
or if you're using a pulley, you're doing it kind of overhead. That's informative for me.

1802
02:54:44,600 --> 02:54:48,280
It just assumes your shoulders can tolerate it. So for example, when I was recovering from my

1803
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:55,320
surgery, the only thing I could do, I'm having a towel between my arms. I'm doing this way,

1804
02:54:55,320 --> 02:54:59,800
and I'm doing this way. So it's really just a functioning area. Okay, that's great. I did not

1805
02:54:59,800 --> 02:55:06,040
know that. And I hadn't really thought about that before. That's good enough. Okay. So that's

1806
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:10,920
pretty much all of the muscle tendon units that are commonly injured around the elbow.

1807
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:17,400
All right. So we've got the shoulder and the elbow behind us. That leaves us with the hand

1808
02:55:17,400 --> 02:55:22,600
and the wrist, which is effectively how we mediate contact with the outside world and our extremities.

1809
02:55:24,360 --> 02:55:31,080
I would say this to me is like a black box. I didn't actually do a rotation in orthopedics or

1810
02:55:31,080 --> 02:55:38,360
plastics, so no exposure to that. Now in general surgery, you cross cover plastics sometimes, so

1811
02:55:39,320 --> 02:55:44,520
new enough to know what not to do when someone came in with hand trauma. But it's obviously

1812
02:55:44,520 --> 02:55:49,960
a highly specialized field. You've done a fellowship just in hand. It basically seems

1813
02:55:49,960 --> 02:55:54,040
anybody who wants to operate on the hand has to not only complete the orthopedics program or

1814
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:58,680
plastics program, but then go completely do that dedicated program. That's right. Yeah. I mean,

1815
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:07,480
I suppose you could pick it up, but to be able to do that in certainly a big city or a dense

1816
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:11,080
metropolitan area, you would need to have fellowship training. And it's just there's so

1817
02:56:11,080 --> 02:56:17,400
much as we talked about before, just like in the shoulder, just like in biologics, just like in

1818
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:21,480
everything you do, there's such an explosion of information. It's hard to keep track of everything.

1819
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:29,640
Before we get into the hand, what do we know today about the hand in terms of repair or injury

1820
02:56:29,640 --> 02:56:34,040
that you didn't know when you finished residency? And I don't mean you personally, but I just mean

1821
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:39,640
wasn't known then that is known today. You know, that's a fascinating topic because well before

1822
02:56:39,640 --> 02:56:44,680
I started starting in the 50s and 60s, they had developed microvascular techniques. And that's

1823
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:52,520
really the, that was the holy grail of so much in the hand. You could have a laceration or a war

1824
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:59,320
injury or something. And there really wasn't much to do for many of those injuries, especially nerve

1825
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:05,400
and blood vessel related. So you would do a lot of amputations. You do it just were not reconstructable.

1826
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:11,400
And so the war experience actually did develop that. And one of my forebears,

1827
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:17,000
Jay William Littler, who was one of the most famous, if not the most famous living hand surgeon for

1828
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:23,880
for a few decades in the world, was exposed to that at Valley Forge and elsewhere during the war.

1829
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:29,640
And that's how they, that he and other really luminaries in the field developed these techniques

1830
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:34,440
that brought us where we are today. I'd say the most significant advancement since I

1831
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:41,480
graduated and went into private practice has been the hand transplantation, the complete

1832
02:57:41,480 --> 02:57:47,720
hand transplantation, which is a very, very, as you know, it involves general surgeons, it involves

1833
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:56,440
hand surgeons, it involves so many, a huge team to be able to do that and to achieve that. And,

1834
02:57:56,440 --> 02:58:04,040
and the results are mixed. But how many have been done? I don't even know now. But it was as recently

1835
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:10,440
as five years ago, only a few had been done. So it's all been in these last several years that,

1836
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:15,320
that these teams have been built up at the larger institutions to be able to handle that. But even

1837
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:23,480
there, it's fraught with peril in that you have to have a perfect patient, physiologically speaking,

1838
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:29,640
and you know, co-morbidities greatly decrease the likelihood of success there. And, and it requires

1839
02:58:29,640 --> 02:58:36,680
a huge investment for the patients themselves. And so even a single hand amputation is not nearly

1840
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:44,360
as reasonable of an indication as a bilateral hand amputee. Those are the ones that generally

1841
02:58:44,360 --> 02:58:49,400
can qualify and they have to meet all the physiologic parameters and so forth. So it's,

1842
02:58:49,400 --> 02:58:53,480
it's, it's, you know, I don't even know that much about it. One of my partners has been on one of

1843
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:59,320
those teams and he knows much more about it, Luke Catalano. And where is the, where is the,

1844
02:58:59,320 --> 02:59:04,840
are they joined at the mid point of the wrist? Right. Is that the distal, distal forearm?

1845
02:59:04,840 --> 02:59:09,480
I'm sorry, the distal forearm, right. Where you can get that, you're beyond that transition zone

1846
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:15,480
and you can link up tendon to tendon usually. And then of course the nerves can be linked as well.

1847
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:19,640
And so it's, yeah, it's fascinating. So that's the biggest. And it's the same immunologic process.

1848
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:24,520
You have to HLA match these things because they're all cadaveric, of course. Exactly. Exactly. And

1849
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:28,920
that's, as you well know, and you know way more about that than I do because of the general

1850
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:33,640
surgical background, but obviously the immuno immunologic suppression to allow these things to

1851
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:41,000
not be a graft versus host disease. And it's, it's, it's a wild, wild time really. And we will get

1852
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:46,760
better. I think the other thing, the only other thing that's changed a lot is that relates so

1853
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:51,480
much to the hand. As you mentioned, it's how we interact with the world is the, you know,

1854
02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:59,320
spinal implants and the various types of full muscle transfers that can, that can restore

1855
02:59:59,320 --> 03:00:05,160
function in the hand for someone who previously had no ability to control even a prosthesis,

1856
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:10,920
these electro electrical prostheses now that are linked to the brain. And so it's, it's, it's cool.

1857
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:16,840
So what type of injuries does someone have in the forearm that are there injuries where they will

1858
03:00:16,840 --> 03:00:21,640
take a muscle from the leg or something like a sartorius and attach it there? Absolutely. Yeah.

1859
03:00:21,640 --> 03:00:27,240
Yeah. And it's really intended to just give some primitive function back to be able to flex the

1860
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:32,440
elbow, for instance, or extend the elbow or flex the wrist. And so it's really more the elbow more

1861
03:00:32,440 --> 03:00:37,320
than anything because most of these injuries that people, patients can still control the shoulder

1862
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:44,040
can position the arm somewhere. But as you know, I mean, if you just even forget about a very

1863
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:49,640
devastating injury, but if you just have an elbow extension contracture where you cannot flex better

1864
03:00:49,640 --> 03:00:54,600
than 90 degrees, you can't get your hand to your mouth, to your hair, to your face. You can't do

1865
03:00:54,600 --> 03:01:02,040
a lot. There's many, many limitations to that. So, and that's just to get through an average day,

1866
03:01:02,040 --> 03:01:06,440
not anything specialized such as playing an instrument or throwing a football or something.

1867
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:13,640
So when we talked about the shoulder and the elbow, do you have a sense of what fraction of

1868
03:01:13,640 --> 03:01:20,200
those injuries that require surgical intervention are the result of an acute trauma versus a chronic

1869
03:01:20,280 --> 03:01:25,000
injury where, now obviously a lot of the chronic stuff is on top of an acute event, like a

1870
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:29,240
subluxation that happened, you know, that over and over and over again leads to, for example,

1871
03:01:29,240 --> 03:01:33,640
my injury. But do you have a sense of like what that division is?

1872
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:40,200
Yes. And the division I do, but it also varies depending on where you are. In my practice now,

1873
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:46,520
I took trauma call for a couple of decades, but I no longer take. So I see cold trauma that still

1874
03:01:46,520 --> 03:01:53,560
needs plenty of surgery, but it's not that it's not acute, it's subacute and then needs to be

1875
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:59,800
fixed in a delayed fashion. So if you are in a practice such as a county hospital where there's

1876
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:06,760
trauma coming in from the hot, the, the, whether it's hunters, whether it's highways and et cetera,

1877
03:02:06,760 --> 03:02:12,600
then you're doing a lot, you're a much higher percentage of your day and your week is spent

1878
03:02:12,600 --> 03:02:18,600
repairing acute traumatic, often poly trauma injuries. And I've been there and done that, but

1879
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:29,080
the, and someone who has a mature metropolitan type practice, that's, it's more in the area of 50-50.

1880
03:02:29,080 --> 03:02:37,400
There's plenty of, of arthritic conditions of wear and tear conditions of, of whether it's from,

1881
03:02:37,400 --> 03:02:43,080
you know, any sort of gym work or, you know, getting back into various forms of exercise or

1882
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:48,120
the weekend warrior phenomenon. And those are sometimes injuries, but they're not dramatic,

1883
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:53,480
traumatic injuries. And then there are the people that are falling off the scooters and the, and

1884
03:02:53,480 --> 03:03:00,360
water skiing, dislocating their shoulders, all, all that spectrum. But the actual, the, the actual

1885
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:06,600
acute, any, and something as mundane as, as cutting avocados. I see tons of nerve injuries and

1886
03:03:06,600 --> 03:03:13,960
tendon injuries in the palm. The Sunday morning bagel injury. And so, so, but, but it's usually

1887
03:03:13,960 --> 03:03:21,960
spread pretty evenly between arthritic and sort of sports related ruptures and injuries. And then

1888
03:03:22,520 --> 03:03:28,520
fractures and dislocations and ruptures due to traumatic events. Well, if there's a,

1889
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:34,360
well, if the bony anatomy of the shoulder is a little more straightforward, it starts to get a

1890
03:03:34,360 --> 03:03:38,360
little more complicated in the elbow and it gets a little more rigid. I mean, the hand is really

1891
03:03:38,360 --> 03:03:42,920
complex. So how do you, how do you even go about beginning to explain the anatomy of the hand,

1892
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:46,760
which has, I don't know, how many bones does the hand have? Well, you know, that, that even varies.

1893
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:52,200
But if you think about it, you have, you have five fingers and you have in those each finger has

1894
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:57,880
three bones except for the thumb, which has two. So you there, you've got the 12 plus two is 14.

1895
03:03:57,880 --> 03:04:02,120
And then you have the, the next layer, which are the metacarpals. And that's of course,

1896
03:04:02,120 --> 03:04:09,480
five of those. And then the carpal bones, which are all these small bones. We, we had a resident

1897
03:04:09,480 --> 03:04:15,880
that used to make fun of hand surgeons who would say, never operate on a bone you can swallow.

1898
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:26,040
And so he was just in a fun way, pillaring the, the fine sort of smaller caliber things that

1899
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:31,800
we're dealing with in the hand and wrist region. And the wrist has the bones that are held tightly

1900
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:37,480
together. And there are, there are multiple bones there. Some of, there are often what are called

1901
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:44,360
coalitions where they're fused together. So that's why I mean that it varies. But the, the wrist owns

1902
03:04:44,360 --> 03:04:50,680
the one bone that is the hardest to heal in the body. And that's the scapoid bone, because it's,

1903
03:04:50,680 --> 03:04:57,800
it's like a carob coated cashew. It's almost all encompassed by cartilage. So there's only a couple

1904
03:04:57,800 --> 03:05:04,520
of little areas where tiny blood vessels can get into that bone. And unlike almost all the other,

1905
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:11,320
if not all the other bones in our body, the, we don't have what we call anti-grade flow into that

1906
03:05:11,320 --> 03:05:17,160
bone. It leaving the heart going down through the arteries and the capillaries and going into

1907
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:24,840
the bone from point A distally to point B, it goes in retrograde. So if you, if you crack that

1908
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:30,200
bone in the middle at baseline, it has very little blood supply. Then you crack it and you probably

1909
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:35,080
disrupt the blood. Exactly. And so there's a high risk of non-union. It takes the average bone in

1910
03:05:35,080 --> 03:05:43,240
the body in an adult takes six weeks to heal. And these generally take 10 to 12 weeks to heal the

1911
03:05:43,240 --> 03:05:47,720
scapoid bones. And what's the common injury that breaks the scapoid? Yeah, there's, there, it's

1912
03:05:47,720 --> 03:05:53,240
mainly a hard fall with the, just the right position of the wrist where it's leveraging on that. And

1913
03:05:53,240 --> 03:06:00,360
it's the scapoid spans the two rows of bones in the wrist that we call the, the distal row and the

1914
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:07,000
proximal row of these arcs of bones. And, um, and it spans that. So it gets leveraged on in a certain

1915
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:12,280
way with certain positions and then a directed force. Usually it's a wrist extension force.

1916
03:06:13,880 --> 03:06:19,320
And does that patient typically present with a lot of pain or? That's a great question. So no,

1917
03:06:19,880 --> 03:06:24,600
often they know they injured their wrist and they'll get some swelling there, but it's not that bad.

1918
03:06:24,600 --> 03:06:29,000
And there's nothing, there's no great distortion of the wrist. So that's not, when you, when you

1919
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:34,200
fracture your distal radius and it's like a ball, it's up and it looks like a dinner fork and you

1920
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:38,280
know, something's wrong and you, you know, you, sometimes people get a lightheaded and pass out

1921
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:42,600
and they just look at their wrist. This doesn't happen with the scapoid. And, and it's often

1922
03:06:42,600 --> 03:06:47,320
young athletes, right? So they don't, they shake it off. They shake it off. They're used to pain

1923
03:06:47,320 --> 03:06:51,160
and then they come in often they'll come in at six weeks. They can't lift weights. They can't

1924
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:56,760
do a clean and jerk. They can't shuck somebody, you know, on the offensive line. And then that,

1925
03:06:56,760 --> 03:07:03,000
then they get evaluated and we find the scapoid fracture and we've already lost six weeks there.

1926
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:08,440
And if, am I remembering correctly, is the scapoid fracture, the one that's really easy to miss on an

1927
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:13,400
X-ray, you kind of need the MRI to see it. Yeah. Yeah. Or is it a CT? Which one is the

1928
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:21,080
modality? MRI is where we detect occult hidden fractures of the, of the scapoid. And, and why

1929
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:26,040
is that by the way? Because normally CT is the imaging of choice for bone. Great question. It's

1930
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:30,760
just that you don't have enough. The bone's not big enough. Yeah. And so we can see. So you're

1931
03:07:30,760 --> 03:07:35,960
looking for the signal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're looking for the fat signal. Yeah. Yeah. That,

1932
03:07:35,960 --> 03:07:40,280
that's, and I, and I've, I've seen a number of people who have had that issue missed and a lot

1933
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:46,200
of times they don't even necessarily tie it back to the fall. Right. Right. But it's been long enough.

1934
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:51,800
So, so what is the treatment plan for that patient? So it's evolved a little. Historically,

1935
03:07:51,800 --> 03:07:58,840
we treated all of these nonoperatively. And then there was a period when, actually an Australian

1936
03:07:58,840 --> 03:08:05,640
fellow named Herbert came up with a really ingenious screw that was, had two sets of threads on it.

1937
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:10,440
And they were different pitch. So when you'd screw it down the middle of the bone and turn it,

1938
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:17,240
and when it engaged both bones, it would actually compress them together because they were different

1939
03:08:17,240 --> 03:08:23,480
pitch. And that was called the Herbert screw. And that was a game changer for us to be able to treat,

1940
03:08:23,480 --> 03:08:28,520
especially athletes. And show folks where this bone is and where you access it operative. Right.

1941
03:08:28,520 --> 03:08:34,040
So the, there are different schools of thought on that. When I was coming out of training,

1942
03:08:34,840 --> 03:08:40,920
everybody made an incision down here to fix these in a full incision to expose everything.

1943
03:08:40,920 --> 03:08:45,800
You had jigs that you can put those screws down. I do almost all of mine percutaneously

1944
03:08:46,520 --> 03:08:51,240
through it. I mean, literally an incision this big, and I'll go either retrograde often

1945
03:08:52,360 --> 03:08:58,440
or anti-grade. And it's just a, it's, it's really a 3d effort to just get it in the right position,

1946
03:08:58,440 --> 03:09:04,520
get a central core guide wire down. And then, and then you use a little, um, a little drill

1947
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:09,240
hand drilled to drill out that and then put the screw down over the wire. And it's really great

1948
03:09:09,240 --> 03:09:15,880
because patients already hardly feel that they've had any surgery. They heal very quickly, faster,

1949
03:09:15,880 --> 03:09:21,160
and you can even start movement earlier so that when it is healed, you already have your movement

1950
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:25,240
back. So you're not stiff and then having to do a lot of physical therapy on top of that.

1951
03:09:25,320 --> 03:09:29,080
So what are other scenarios when you would not operate on a scaphoid fracture?

1952
03:09:29,080 --> 03:09:32,680
There are many, if they're non displaced, then we can expect them to heal.

1953
03:09:33,240 --> 03:09:37,880
Would you put a cast on or would you put a, at least a splint? We know that you can just basically,

1954
03:09:37,880 --> 03:09:41,880
as long as you mobilize the wrist, even if you leave the thumb, thumb and fingers free,

1955
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:48,520
that these will heal. Um, then you look at comorbidities and you look at life, um, life,

1956
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:54,520
needs. So the athletes often get a screw because they just can get back faster,

1957
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:59,560
even with protection. The, um, surgeons often want to have them fixed, uh,

1958
03:09:59,560 --> 03:10:03,080
fixed a number because they just want to get back to be able to operate, which they can do.

1959
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:07,640
And what would be the time course to recovery? If you, let's just say you're in that lucky camp where

1960
03:10:07,640 --> 03:10:12,840
the day it falls, you're smart enough to, to, you know, know that it's the scaphoid and you go and

1961
03:10:12,840 --> 03:10:19,480
get the MRI, confirm it, you have surgery the next day. How long until you're, um, catching a ball

1962
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:24,280
again? Yeah, catching a ball generally about six weeks for that. Operating if you're a surgeon.

1963
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:29,080
A week. Oh wow. Yeah, it's really fast. So as long as it's not contact, you're doing it within a week.

1964
03:10:29,080 --> 03:10:33,960
Right. And that's the nice, that's the, that's the game changer really that we have now.

1965
03:10:34,840 --> 03:10:40,040
Um, you, a moment ago alluded to something that is one of the few things I do remember from residency,

1966
03:10:40,040 --> 03:10:46,200
which was the position to make this splint. What is it about having the wrist in this position

1967
03:10:46,760 --> 03:10:52,200
that, you know, for us general surgeons would be basically, let's just let the hand guys look at

1968
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:56,120
this tomorrow morning. We don't have to call them at two o'clock in the morning if this is a

1969
03:10:56,120 --> 03:11:00,360
non-operative or non-urgent issue, but let's at least put them in this safe position. What is it

1970
03:11:00,360 --> 03:11:04,680
about that position that's safe? So the, the essentially neutral position, which looks like

1971
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:09,320
actually, have you shown some wrist extension, but it's really neutral in terms of the carpoise.

1972
03:11:09,880 --> 03:11:16,280
What that does is that, um, one of the important things it does is when we are in too much flexion

1973
03:11:16,280 --> 03:11:20,040
and we see this occasionally where people just aren't thinking about it. They just slap a splint

1974
03:11:20,040 --> 03:11:25,240
on and don't really know that what you're talking about is, uh, too much flexion or too much

1975
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:30,040
extension. Then that increases the pressure on the median nerve and the carpal tunnel. So people

1976
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:35,720
can get, especially with some extra swelling from the injury, they can get actually acute carpal

1977
03:11:35,720 --> 03:11:41,080
tunnel syndrome that can be quite substantial in those more extreme positions. So a neutral

1978
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:47,640
position is great for that. It's also best for function in terms of just if you're in a splint,

1979
03:11:47,640 --> 03:11:51,240
but at least trying to get some finger movement, maybe typing at a keyboard or something, then

1980
03:11:51,240 --> 03:11:57,800
that's a good neutral position. I will, on occasion, if I have to mobilize, um, uh, someone, I will,

1981
03:11:59,160 --> 03:12:04,440
and they have a unique, uh, a musician, for example, I will immobilize them in the position

1982
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:08,680
they need, for instance, to be able to at least play their electric bass. I just had a patient

1983
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:16,280
the other day who plays both upright bass and electric bass. And so he asked me, I said, well,

1984
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:19,560
how are you? We're just playing electric bass. He said, fine. I said, then show me the position

1985
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:24,120
your hand. I'll put you in that splint in that position. So he's able to keep playing and even

1986
03:12:24,120 --> 03:12:30,280
doing gigs that way. So, um, you know, it's, everybody's different. Um, but it's, it's an

1987
03:12:30,280 --> 03:12:36,360
important consideration. All right. So what do we need to understand about the anatomy of the radial

1988
03:12:36,360 --> 03:12:42,040
bone, ulnar bone, and these two big nerves? I'm guessing the median nerve, if I recall, runs there

1989
03:12:42,040 --> 03:12:47,400
and the ulnar nerve runs on the pinky side, correct? That's right. And we'll, we'll go,

1990
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:52,760
we'll see that in our exam shortly. But yes. And then the third nerve, which is completes the hand

1991
03:12:52,760 --> 03:12:57,240
is the radial nerve and that's purely sensory along here, but it is important and provides

1992
03:12:57,240 --> 03:13:02,200
sensory on the backside of the hand and the thumb and most of the backside of the hand,

1993
03:13:02,200 --> 03:13:09,880
but the ulnar nerve, um, you're right. And both of those are at risk for lacerations, um, far, um,

1994
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:16,280
and they're at risk even when you distort the anatomy with through a fracture. And so those

1995
03:13:16,280 --> 03:13:21,160
are the two big ways. I kind of remember the median nerve being bigger than I expected. What's

1996
03:13:21,160 --> 03:13:27,000
the approximate size of the median nerve? Yeah. So it's, it's a, it's an oval shape and cross section.

1997
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:30,760
And it, it varies obviously on the side. It's about three or four millimeters wide,

1998
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:35,480
by two millimeters deep, right? Even, even bigger. That would be, you know, a smaller

1999
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:41,240
petite person would have about that size. And I've seen them as large as almost a centimeter wide

2000
03:13:41,240 --> 03:13:48,200
and four or five millimeters thick in a large hand. Oh yeah. I mean, just insane, which I guess

2001
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:55,320
speaks to the innovation of this unbelievable part of our body that occupies so much of our

2002
03:13:55,320 --> 03:14:00,600
homunculus, right? Yes. Yeah. So I've always said this because, uh, you know, I've talked about this

2003
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:07,160
that I've in terms of using meaningful hand use is so important for cognitive development and

2004
03:14:07,160 --> 03:14:14,280
wellbeing and sick, over 60% of our higher cortical neurons are devoted just to our hand

2005
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:18,600
through the homunculus. And you know, you've seen that homunculus on the UNI seen it many times,

2006
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:26,840
but it's big ears, um, and you know, big eyes, but huge hands and then a tiny torso, you know,

2007
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:32,920
little shriveled up tiny torso. And so that's what's super cool. So yes, I mean, we need to

2008
03:14:32,920 --> 03:14:39,480
keep using our hands to keep our minds vital in whatever form we're doing. And actually some great

2009
03:14:39,480 --> 03:14:45,000
studies have been done on that to show what's the effect of just typing at a keyboard. And it doesn't

2010
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:53,240
stimulate our, our, our cortex very much at all, uh, typing, nor does texting, uh, handwriting,

2011
03:14:53,240 --> 03:14:59,640
which is an art form, even though it's, doesn't feel like it for, for many of us. Um, but, uh,

2012
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:06,120
handwriting still does stimulate our brain. Uh, they did a study a long time ago at university of,

2013
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:12,840
I believe it's in Virginia, I think, or maybe Indiana. And they looked at kids who were

2014
03:15:13,640 --> 03:15:20,760
asked to handwrite versus type, uh, the answers to, uh, essay questions and the kids who were

2015
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:28,200
handwriting used longer sentences, bigger words, more ideas, and, and produce it faster than the

2016
03:15:28,200 --> 03:15:31,720
kids who were typing. And they're, and they were measuring their cortical activity and their

2017
03:15:31,720 --> 03:15:36,600
core activity was way more with the handwriting. That's digression, but it's important to your

2018
03:15:36,600 --> 03:15:41,400
point that, that there's so many nerve endings concentrated in our hands that we really need to,

2019
03:15:42,040 --> 03:15:45,800
to keep them functioning and get them back to function as quickly as possible.

2020
03:15:45,800 --> 03:15:52,360
So you mentioned already the carpal tunnel. Let's talk about what this carpal tunnel syndrome is.

2021
03:15:52,360 --> 03:15:57,640
It's come up a couple of times and, and obviously there's, there's technically what's carpal tunnel

2022
03:15:57,640 --> 03:16:01,960
syndrome and then there's the symptoms of it, which can be produced by compression or injury

2023
03:16:01,960 --> 03:16:07,640
elsewhere. But, um, what creates the tunnel per se? Yeah. So it's great. It's super cool. When you

2024
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:12,040
look in cross section, if you, if you took a cross section through the hand right here,

2025
03:16:12,040 --> 03:16:18,360
the carpal tunnel is created by a Roman arch of bones, just like the Roman arches where that

2026
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:23,560
central core, I can't remember the name of the bone keystone, maybe, uh, it wedges in and keeps

2027
03:16:23,560 --> 03:16:28,840
that arch intact. And that's exactly what we have in the reverse. Then we have a tie bar across the

2028
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:35,560
top, which is a very thick transverse carpal ligament, and it holds that together and that creates a,

2029
03:16:36,200 --> 03:16:44,840
a just a, a U-shaped, uh, parabolic inverted parabola tunnel through which the nine flexor

2030
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:50,600
tendons and the median nerve pass and occasionally a medium sized artery. Now explain why there are

2031
03:16:50,600 --> 03:16:56,120
nine flexor tendons. Right. So there's two to each finger, lesser finger, and then there's only one

2032
03:16:56,120 --> 03:17:03,400
to the thumb. And, uh, and those are, it's, it's fascinating to, to look into that and see it just

2033
03:17:03,400 --> 03:17:11,000
so happens that, uh, um, position wise, if we look at our palm up, the median nerve is running

2034
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:18,680
down almost the center of the wrist and it is the most superficial so that if we then flex our

2035
03:17:18,680 --> 03:17:25,000
wrist down, those flexor tendons are trying to bow string down, they will press that median nerve

2036
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:32,520
up against that rigid transverse carpal ligament. If we have swelling edema, inflammatory tissues,

2037
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:38,040
such as in rheumatoid arthritis, where that builds up, that becomes a space occupying lesion

2038
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:44,040
in a fixed, confined cross-sectional area. And then it compresses that nerve, the nerve,

2039
03:17:44,040 --> 03:17:48,840
the tendons aren't really vulnerable in that way. Uh, but the nerve is very vulnerable to compression.

2040
03:17:48,840 --> 03:17:54,920
That's why it's such a ubiquitous problem. And so from a motor standpoint, the median nerve controls

2041
03:17:54,920 --> 03:18:00,440
which function versus the ulnar nerve. That's great. So important of a question. And, and by the

2042
03:18:00,440 --> 03:18:06,200
way, there is some confusion. People, people very often come to me and say, I think I have

2043
03:18:06,200 --> 03:18:14,200
median nerve. I mean, I think I have a carpal tunnel syndrome and, and the thing they don't,

2044
03:18:14,200 --> 03:18:19,000
you know, just because it's such a ubiquitous bandied about term, but you must have numbness

2045
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:26,040
and tingling in the median nerve distribution, which is the palm side of the thumb index middle

2046
03:18:26,040 --> 03:18:30,600
and usually half of the ring finger. If you don't have numbness and tingling there, you,

2047
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:37,080
you're very unlikely to have carpal tunnel syndrome. However, if you have an arthritic process,

2048
03:18:37,080 --> 03:18:44,280
you can, without having as much numbness and tingling, you can have isolated atrophy of the

2049
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:51,560
muscles, the thenar, the thumb muscles here that give us our opposable thumb. You can have atrophy

2050
03:18:51,560 --> 03:18:55,720
that looks like an indentation right there. And some people can have that quietly. It can

2051
03:18:55,720 --> 03:19:02,360
be just a very gradual, just from the encroachment on that nerve of the bone spurs that grow through

2052
03:19:02,360 --> 03:19:07,160
the arthritic process. So that's the exception where sometimes you can have isolated motor.

2053
03:19:07,720 --> 03:19:14,280
And very rarely in a younger person, I will see where they have an odd motor branch, which is the

2054
03:19:14,280 --> 03:19:18,840
nerve that comes off the median nerve that goes to those muscles. They'll have a weird compression

2055
03:19:18,840 --> 03:19:23,960
of just that. So a younger person who doesn't have any numbness and tingling, and then has isolated

2056
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:29,960
atrophy. So that needs to be addressed surgically as well. But the, the thing that fits with the

2057
03:19:29,960 --> 03:19:36,280
carpal tunnel is that if you're pregnant, there's a lot often in third trimester when women are

2058
03:19:36,280 --> 03:19:40,120
dealing this is just because of swelling, just because of swelling, the fluid imbalances that

2059
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:45,800
are going on there, that's a possibility. People who use jackhammers or people who are cyclists,

2060
03:19:45,800 --> 03:19:50,440
and they're always pressing down and putting extra pressure on that area can get carpal tunnel

2061
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:55,880
syndrome only when they're cycling. So it's a dynamic situation. Weightlifters can get it

2062
03:19:55,880 --> 03:20:01,640
depending on what the style of what they're doing. But the stereotype is people who are typing a lot,

2063
03:20:01,640 --> 03:20:07,080
isn't it? Yeah, that is. Is that a true carpal tunnel syndrome? So generally speaking,

2064
03:20:07,080 --> 03:20:12,360
most people don't get carpal tunnel just from typing. There was a massive class action lawsuit

2065
03:20:12,360 --> 03:20:18,360
against IBM 100 years ago. I don't know how long and they lost because they couldn't prove, I mean,

2066
03:20:18,360 --> 03:20:23,160
IBM didn't lose the, they lost the case because they couldn't prove that it was

2067
03:20:23,160 --> 03:20:28,680
caused. There was no data suggests that it was caused by just using a keyboard. However,

2068
03:20:28,680 --> 03:20:35,080
if you already have it, absolutely that activity will exacerbate it. And, and that's why ergonomics

2069
03:20:35,080 --> 03:20:39,800
are so important, you know, sitting there, how you're sitting. I mean, during COVID, everybody

2070
03:20:39,800 --> 03:20:46,600
went back home and worked from home and worked at a sometimes random, the kitchen table or their

2071
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:53,720
bed with their laptop and their, so there's a lot more of these both wrist tendonitis and carpal

2072
03:20:53,720 --> 03:20:58,680
tunnel syndrome after that, which you don't, that doesn't affect the ulnar nerve, which is the other

2073
03:20:58,680 --> 03:21:04,120
nerve that we're talking about. The ulnar nerve is so important because while our opposable thumb is

2074
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:11,080
critically important, that's governed mostly by the, by the, um, median nerve. The ulnar nerve

2075
03:21:11,080 --> 03:21:15,960
supplies almost all the rest of the muscles, small muscles of the hand. And those we call

2076
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:21,160
the intrinsic muscles of the hand, which are basically what allow us to spread our fingers

2077
03:21:21,160 --> 03:21:27,320
apart, pull our fingers together, do these weird funky positions that we do, like the intrinsic

2078
03:21:27,320 --> 03:21:33,080
plus position there, that, that position, being able to do that with your hand is almost all ulnar

2079
03:21:33,080 --> 03:21:40,200
nerve. And if you cut the ulnar nerve right here at the wrist, your hand will do just that. And you

2080
03:21:40,200 --> 03:21:45,720
will not be able to do anything but, but a little bit of that you can't. So the, so the flexors of

2081
03:21:45,720 --> 03:21:53,320
each finger are all ulnar. Well, the, the intrinsic flexors are ulnar. The extrinsics are split between

2082
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:57,720
the median more approximately in the form are split between the median and the ulnar. But lifting a

2083
03:21:57,720 --> 03:22:04,360
finger this way is intrinsic. Yeah. Lifting them. Yes. This way at the sort of the, this knuckle

2084
03:22:04,360 --> 03:22:10,200
level is in all intrinsic, all intrinsic. And we don't have extenders, extensors we, or we do.

2085
03:22:10,200 --> 03:22:16,600
We do, but not intrinsically. We have, well, not for the, these level, the MP joints, that's

2086
03:22:16,600 --> 03:22:22,520
extrinsic extension. But what I mean, the, the, I'd love to draw a picture of the finger mechanism.

2087
03:22:23,240 --> 03:22:31,320
It's made, so it just, I just find it so cool. It's so much more complicated than biomechanically

2088
03:22:31,320 --> 03:22:37,000
than the flexors. The flexors are pretty simple. And what's fascinating about the hand is despite,

2089
03:22:37,800 --> 03:22:45,160
you know, being able to play Rachmaninoff or a violin concerto or be able to do so many,

2090
03:22:46,040 --> 03:22:53,640
build a watch, the hand is actually more primitive of a structure. It's, it's still,

2091
03:22:53,640 --> 03:22:58,200
it's pretty much unchanged except for the opposable thumb. It's a pretty primitive structure

2092
03:22:58,200 --> 03:23:08,440
in the sense of evolutionarily speaking. Our foot is a, is a fantastically adapted and modified

2093
03:23:08,440 --> 03:23:12,920
over evolution to walk. We were talking about that before when we started walking on all fours,

2094
03:23:12,920 --> 03:23:17,000
our, I mean, when we stood up and became bipeds, our foot completely changed.

2095
03:23:17,560 --> 03:23:21,720
So the, is, I mean, I know we joke about it, but is the opposable thumb the primary difference

2096
03:23:21,720 --> 03:23:26,840
between us and a primate? Yes. Well, it depends on, we're, we're part of the higher prime. Yeah.

2097
03:23:26,920 --> 03:23:30,280
Between the lower primate. The lower primates, exactly. That's really, and that's why, you know,

2098
03:23:30,280 --> 03:23:36,600
we're not, once we were no longer arboreal where our thumb was in the plane of the palm and we

2099
03:23:36,600 --> 03:23:42,360
would hang from, you know, tree limbs, then when we came around, we could start making tools and

2100
03:23:42,360 --> 03:23:46,440
developing our, I mean, and that's, that's the thing. Our brains grew and we started using our

2101
03:23:46,440 --> 03:23:52,280
hands and making tools. That's when our brains, our heads enlarged. I mean, it's just so cool.

2102
03:23:52,280 --> 03:23:57,720
Yeah. So I mean, I consider and talk about the hand all day, especially given how little I

2103
03:23:57,720 --> 03:24:05,720
understand it. So what are some of the other injuries that are pretty common? Either, again,

2104
03:24:06,520 --> 03:24:12,520
the injury you'll see more commonly in the 60, 70 year old versus in the athlete, the kind of the

2105
03:24:12,520 --> 03:24:17,880
wear and tear injuries, what are the most common fractures? Yeah. So yeah, I think we would break

2106
03:24:17,880 --> 03:24:23,400
it up into the acute traumatic events, which are most often fractures, but can be also

2107
03:24:23,400 --> 03:24:30,280
dislocations. And then we, then we would say the wear and tear type injuries, which are usually

2108
03:24:30,280 --> 03:24:40,680
start in middle age and go on into older age. And then the, and then the actual, what was the third

2109
03:24:40,760 --> 03:24:47,720
we were talking about? We said that for, oh, oh, and then, and then the, the absolute degenerative

2110
03:24:48,520 --> 03:24:53,000
arthritic types of problems that are inevitable for many of us. And they vary among individuals

2111
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:59,400
based on genetics and lifestyle and so forth. And so the fractures, the most common by far

2112
03:24:59,400 --> 03:25:04,360
is the distal radius fracture. That's just the big bone of the radius. Now the radius, the form is

2113
03:25:04,360 --> 03:25:09,640
super cool because we already talked about the elbow. We looked at that really complex, weird,

2114
03:25:09,640 --> 03:25:16,360
undulating structure there. The ulna that we talked about is the elbow bone that we feel the

2115
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:21,400
prominence of our elbow. And that's a straight bone. And that goes down and forms the, the bump

2116
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:27,240
here that we've seen on the back of our wrist. And that's the ulna. The radius is, is, is a curved

2117
03:25:27,240 --> 03:25:35,080
arching bone that is curved so it can get around the radius as we pronate and supinate. So the

2118
03:25:35,160 --> 03:25:40,600
radius is flared and provides the biggest structure at the wrist level. And, but it's

2119
03:25:40,600 --> 03:25:48,680
much smaller at the elbow level. And so it rotates around through a fixed ulna. The ulna never moves.

2120
03:25:49,240 --> 03:25:53,800
It, I mean, it moves this way, but it doesn't move or it's relatively, and, and the radius just

2121
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:59,640
rotates back and forth. So any disruption of that can dramatically alter our ability to hold a, a,

2122
03:26:00,200 --> 03:26:07,880
a bowl of soup or to, to pronate and type and write. And so, and that can be disrupted in many ways.

2123
03:26:07,880 --> 03:26:14,680
The fractures, the radius is, is super common to fall and have a bending moment on that. And it,

2124
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:20,680
and it fractures and displaces. And, but then you can often, you know, something falls hard on you.

2125
03:26:21,320 --> 03:26:25,320
You fall. I mean, we see them commonly in kids who are falling off the jungle gems. They'll have

2126
03:26:25,320 --> 03:26:30,360
a both bone form fracture in the mid forearm. And that's just another bending moment. Those

2127
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:35,160
bones break in half or sometimes they bend. One of them breaks, one of them bends if they're,

2128
03:26:35,160 --> 03:26:42,120
the kids are young enough. And so that very, can very much disrupt the function there. And so at

2129
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:47,560
any different point along the form, depending on the mechanism, these bones can break. And when

2130
03:26:47,560 --> 03:26:52,360
they do, if they're displaced, we have to often fix them except in very young kids.

2131
03:26:53,160 --> 03:26:58,120
That reminds me by the way, I don't know what it is. I vaguely remember this from,

2132
03:26:58,120 --> 03:27:02,120
from medical school and I never saw them in residency, although I told it was very common,

2133
03:27:02,120 --> 03:27:07,560
but I guess I just didn't do enough to, to see it where a parent grabs a kid by the arm to yank

2134
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:11,000
him across the road. And what, what is that injury that's supposed to be pretty common?

2135
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:17,800
That's nursemaid's elbow. And that is a subluxation of that. Yeah. That round radial head at the elbow.

2136
03:27:18,440 --> 03:27:25,400
And I had the, I guess, interesting and informative experience to create one in my own daughter.

2137
03:27:26,440 --> 03:27:31,560
She liked to be my first, first daughter. I would spin her around, you know, like you see people.

2138
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:36,440
Yeah. And I remember spinning around, she was giggling and so forth. And then I felt just the

2139
03:27:36,440 --> 03:27:43,480
tiniest little weird movement in her elbow. It kind of threw her hand and I saw her face start to

2140
03:27:43,480 --> 03:27:49,080
scrunch up. I set her down her face. And then I just had this vision. I knew what it was. I

2141
03:27:49,080 --> 03:27:54,920
quickly did the reduction maneuver so fast that she hadn't even started crying. And then

2142
03:27:56,200 --> 03:28:01,800
it just immediately stopped hurting. And she wanted, I could tell she was getting ready to

2143
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:05,960
start crying, but then she had no reason to because it didn't hurt. So it was kind of,

2144
03:28:05,960 --> 03:28:10,680
we were in that. And remind me what that reduction is again. So what's happening? So the radius,

2145
03:28:10,680 --> 03:28:17,880
which is on this side, the outer side. Exactly. When you pronate and you pull and kind of give a

2146
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:22,600
various moment, it will cause that radial head just to slip out this way a little bit. So the

2147
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:30,200
easy maneuver because the stable position is just you supinate and you put a little pressure on that,

2148
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:35,240
you supinate and then flex the elbow up. So this is the most stable position of that bone. And it

2149
03:28:35,240 --> 03:28:41,560
will pop back in every time. Now, if you, if there's stay out and then you go sit in an

2150
03:28:41,560 --> 03:28:46,360
emergency room for eight hours or six hours, harder and harder to get back in, you often have

2151
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:51,640
to do an under anesthesia to this day. I am still paranoid. Anytime I have to grab one of my boys,

2152
03:28:51,640 --> 03:28:56,840
but I'm going to do it. And I'm always like trying to figure out how to reduce it. If I ever

2153
03:28:56,840 --> 03:29:04,520
screw it up. So yeah, I've seen, I've seen a lot of radial fractures in, in friends and kids. And

2154
03:29:05,560 --> 03:29:09,640
it doesn't, it really seems like one of those awful luck things sometimes. Like if you fall

2155
03:29:09,640 --> 03:29:14,040
out of a tree, you fall out of a tree. And if you're, if you slip on ice that you don't see

2156
03:29:14,040 --> 03:29:18,920
and you're totally not ready for that fall, it can happen to the best person. There's, there's,

2157
03:29:18,920 --> 03:29:22,920
yeah. And then the older we get, of course, if we have a little osteoporosis,

2158
03:29:22,920 --> 03:29:29,320
osteopenia on x-ray and osteoporosis, then it takes less and less force to fracture those bones.

2159
03:29:29,880 --> 03:29:33,000
And yeah, what breaks the ulnar bone? Does it ever break on its own?

2160
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:39,080
So there's the most common one is a direct blow via, it can be in football. It can be a weight

2161
03:29:39,080 --> 03:29:45,480
falling. It can be a door smashing into you is a, what's called a nightstick fracture. And it's

2162
03:29:45,480 --> 03:29:50,360
named for that because especially the, the Billy clubs in, in the UK where, you know, that, that

2163
03:29:50,440 --> 03:29:55,160
would strike you when your hand was up and it cracks the ulnar along there. That's the most common.

2164
03:29:55,720 --> 03:30:01,640
And, but it can often be fractured also in association with the distal radius. The

2165
03:30:01,640 --> 03:30:06,920
styloid part can come off, it's attached to a ligament or the just the, they can just both

2166
03:30:06,920 --> 03:30:11,960
snap at the same time. And that complicates the treatment, but it's, so those are the most common

2167
03:30:11,960 --> 03:30:17,080
ones. And then the other one, which is really more of an elbow fracture, but it's the ulna is the

2168
03:30:17,080 --> 03:30:22,360
olecranon. And that's a common, common fracture. And that's really simple. I see those in very,

2169
03:30:22,360 --> 03:30:28,200
when you're falling your elbow, the only other way you can kind of pull that bone off is if you

2170
03:30:28,200 --> 03:30:34,360
fall really hard, say snow skiing, you're falling hard. And as you talk about the eccentric load,

2171
03:30:34,360 --> 03:30:40,600
that triceps pulls it right off. And yeah, I mean, you're the expert on eccentric loading. And I love

2172
03:30:40,600 --> 03:30:46,280
the fact that you educate so many people about that because it's way more, um, injurious in a way.

2173
03:30:47,080 --> 03:30:52,920
What about the chronic sort of injuries of the hand and wrist that ultimately require

2174
03:30:52,920 --> 03:30:58,760
surgical care? Yeah. So there's, there's, you can break them down into sort of overuse patterns,

2175
03:30:58,760 --> 03:31:05,240
which are more tendonitis. And if you have a long enough standing tendonitis, you can start to it.

2176
03:31:05,240 --> 03:31:13,320
The tendonitis is an tino sinovitis. So those are subtle differences. A tendonitis is just inflammation

2177
03:31:13,320 --> 03:31:18,040
in the tendon. And if it's beginning to wear and tear and degenerate, you'll get some longitudinal

2178
03:31:18,040 --> 03:31:23,400
fissuring in those, those collagen fibers. And then it fills in with some inflammatory tissue,

2179
03:31:23,400 --> 03:31:30,440
and then that can envelop the tendon. And so you're getting kind of a constant rubbing and

2180
03:31:30,440 --> 03:31:34,840
further degeneration of that. You get chronic pain, you can inject it with cortisone, but then

2181
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:40,680
ultimately they can rupture. And, and depending on how much and how much force they're being

2182
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:47,000
subjected to and for how long it's been there. So that's one. Then the tino sinovitis is a subset

2183
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:54,200
of that where we have these effectively watertight tubes, specifically in our flexor tendons. And

2184
03:31:54,760 --> 03:31:58,760
those tendons are gliding beautifully in there. There's a little bit of fluid our body produces

2185
03:31:58,760 --> 03:32:03,400
to keep them gliding smoothly and a little bit of what we call tino synovium, which is just a

2186
03:32:03,400 --> 03:32:10,200
filmy structure that gives them some lubricating Teflani feel. If that gets inflamed from overuse,

2187
03:32:10,200 --> 03:32:14,280
whether you're a violinist or a heavy weight lifter doing all sorts of things over and over

2188
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:19,400
again, you can develop inflammation there. And then that becomes trapped in there and it really

2189
03:32:19,400 --> 03:32:25,400
hurts. It can eliminate mobility and it can even cause them sometimes to lock down. And those are

2190
03:32:25,400 --> 03:32:32,920
super common. And we can often cure them with just cortisone shots or rest or both, but then

2191
03:32:32,920 --> 03:32:37,880
ultimately a subset of them, because they're so ubiquitous, require surgery, which is very minor,

2192
03:32:37,880 --> 03:32:44,040
but it's important because the hand function, if you have one finger that's really stiff,

2193
03:32:44,040 --> 03:32:49,720
whether you dislocated it or even just sprained it, the other fingers, they're all linked so

2194
03:32:49,720 --> 03:32:54,120
indelibly together that actually it will make your whole hand feel stiff.

2195
03:32:54,120 --> 03:32:57,960
Yeah. So it's funny you say that. So as you know, I'm really obsessed with grip strength and all

2196
03:32:57,960 --> 03:33:07,320
sorts of crazy shenanigans. And maybe about a year ago, I started experimenting kind of like

2197
03:33:07,320 --> 03:33:12,760
training sort of the way that rock climbers do where you're using only finger strength. And

2198
03:33:13,800 --> 03:33:22,760
what blew me away was how much weaker I felt all the way through my lats when I would restrict

2199
03:33:22,760 --> 03:33:29,640
the amount of fingers I could use to pull up. So if you just said do pull ups, you can use your

2200
03:33:29,640 --> 03:33:35,320
whole hand, do pull ups, no problem. You just barely noticed that. I feel like I'm perfectly

2201
03:33:35,320 --> 03:33:40,920
connected from the bar to my lats. And now you say, okay, Peter, you're not going to get to use

2202
03:33:40,920 --> 03:33:45,480
your whole hand or your thumb, just use your four fingers. Actually that gets a little harder.

2203
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:45,800
Way harder.

2204
03:33:45,800 --> 03:33:50,760
It took me a while to work up to 10 four finger pull ups.

2205
03:33:50,760 --> 03:33:53,800
Well, that's impressive that you can do that because yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

2206
03:33:53,800 --> 03:33:59,560
It took a long time. I mean, it took a couple months. Then I moved to three finger pull ups.

2207
03:34:00,520 --> 03:34:03,480
I mean, it's an order of magnitude harder.

2208
03:34:03,480 --> 03:34:04,360
It's crazy, right?

2209
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:08,200
And I don't think I've been able to, I don't know, I don't know that I even got to try two finger

2210
03:34:08,200 --> 03:34:14,840
because I was still really nowhere near getting to 10 three finger pull ups. And so why is that?

2211
03:34:14,840 --> 03:34:23,480
Because I'm no less strong in my lats, in my biceps, in all these other muscles. Why is it

2212
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:28,040
that simply take, and by the way, it was the pinky that I was removing of all fingers. You'd think

2213
03:34:28,280 --> 03:34:34,680
it does nothing. Why when I can only have these three fingers, does all of my strength fade away?

2214
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:39,320
I've never been asked that directly, but I have a couple of theories on that. One is,

2215
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:45,640
and it applies to sort of the weakness I feel and detect asymmetrically in,

2216
03:34:46,840 --> 03:34:51,080
let's say a rotator cuff. If you have a small partial thickness rotator cuff tear, well,

2217
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:56,360
that's tiny. It's mechanically not relevant. And yet you can be quite weak.

2218
03:34:56,920 --> 03:35:04,440
Your brain is the smart, so smart, it knows it doesn't want to overstress that area. So I,

2219
03:35:04,440 --> 03:35:10,040
my instinct is that the first reaction, especially when you've never done that before,

2220
03:35:10,040 --> 03:35:14,440
is for your brain to say, whoa, that's putting way too much tension on the other one. So I'm going

2221
03:35:14,440 --> 03:35:18,600
to relax everything. I'm not going to give you what you need because they may rupture. Interesting.

2222
03:35:18,600 --> 03:35:23,640
Right. I think that's probably the biggest explanation for that. But specifically,

2223
03:35:23,640 --> 03:35:29,640
when you're talking about grip strength, what's ironic is that the, the ulnar nerve,

2224
03:35:29,640 --> 03:35:35,880
which is only these two fingers, is much more important for grip strength than these.

2225
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:42,280
Interesting. So if you have these, if you have, let's say you have an ulnar nerve that's completely

2226
03:35:42,280 --> 03:35:48,360
in and a median nerve that's out, you're going to be pretty strong still. Whereas if you have an

2227
03:35:48,360 --> 03:35:52,760
ulnar nerve out and a median nerve that's still in, you're going to be much weaker.

2228
03:35:52,760 --> 03:35:56,360
Wow. So just for people listening to us, which hopefully nobody's just listening to this podcast

2229
03:35:56,360 --> 03:36:03,640
because it's hard to, but you're saying pinky and ring finger matter more to grip than middle finger,

2230
03:36:03,640 --> 03:36:09,880
four finger thumb, which is under the median distribution. I don't, I agree with that. I mean,

2231
03:36:09,880 --> 03:36:15,800
that even just feel, I feel like I can engage my forearms much more with my pinky and ring finger.

2232
03:36:15,800 --> 03:36:21,720
Oh yeah, for sure. Absolutely. Why is that? I mean, it's evolution, I guess.

2233
03:36:21,800 --> 03:36:29,000
That's insane. You know what? It makes me wonder if I should be doing these three fingers.

2234
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:33,000
That's what I think. That's what I think. Yeah, because I was doing, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's,

2235
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:37,720
I'm going to try that today. Good. Report back to me. I'll let you just learn that rather than me

2236
03:36:37,720 --> 03:36:43,240
having to learn it. That is amazing. I just, you know, I'm endlessly fascinated by what our hands

2237
03:36:43,240 --> 03:36:50,600
are capable of. And I think of it as such a, well, such a force multiplier for our species.

2238
03:36:50,840 --> 03:36:58,840
Right. It's an unbelievable asset and our ability to carry things is, you know, Michael Easter has

2239
03:36:58,840 --> 03:37:02,680
written about this at length in his book, The Comfort Crisis, which of course is what has

2240
03:37:02,680 --> 03:37:08,920
introduced us all to rucking. But, you know, other animals can carry a lot if they're domesticated

2241
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:13,240
and you put it on their back. But in terms of like, you know, we can carry our body weight and

2242
03:37:13,240 --> 03:37:19,320
our hands. Crazy. And that is mind boggling and it speaks to kind of remarkable engineering and

2243
03:37:19,320 --> 03:37:25,720
to think that a lot of that is made possible by this opposable thumb as well is pretty cool.

2244
03:37:25,720 --> 03:37:31,000
And even going back to the elbow anatomically, when you look at the Vitruvian man and when you

2245
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:39,720
look at the standard anatomic position of, in medicine, the elbow has a carrying angle built

2246
03:37:39,720 --> 03:37:45,240
into it to get whatever we carry away from our body. So we can carry more. So we have a 12 to 15

2247
03:37:45,240 --> 03:37:52,840
degree natural built in what's called valgus or away from our bodies to give us more area to carry

2248
03:37:52,840 --> 03:37:57,480
heavy things with. It's super cool. So let's talk about the final category of these, which are the

2249
03:37:57,480 --> 03:38:04,360
arthritics. And here you have really two, you have this rheumatoid or autoimmune form of arthritis,

2250
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:10,600
which, you know, I think anybody who's seen patients with that recognize it is just looks

2251
03:38:10,680 --> 03:38:17,000
like an awful affliction. Yes. Where it's not only functionally impeding, but also physically

2252
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:22,040
deforming of the fingers and the joints. Yes. Versus the much more common osteoarthritic,

2253
03:38:22,040 --> 03:38:26,280
which I assume is more aware and tear than just a, you know, it doesn't have that autoimmune

2254
03:38:26,280 --> 03:38:30,040
component. So first of all, what's the distribution and breakdown of those and which one of those

2255
03:38:30,040 --> 03:38:36,680
ultimately can require surgical intervention? Right. So historically, just in my orthopedic

2256
03:38:36,680 --> 03:38:45,000
lifetime, I see very few now rheumatoid, arthritic, and what we would call the, the, um,

2257
03:38:46,920 --> 03:38:53,240
RA negative, uh, where the testing, we know they have the, the visible, yeah, the phenotype,

2258
03:38:53,240 --> 03:39:00,200
but they don't necessarily have all the lab stories to lab abnormalities to back them up. But I see

2259
03:39:00,200 --> 03:39:06,200
way more now less than I ever saw before because of the medical therapies, just so much biologics

2260
03:39:06,200 --> 03:39:11,400
are so amazing. They've been absolute game changers and keep people normal for such a long

2261
03:39:11,400 --> 03:39:16,360
time. So that's one thing, but in general, I mean, when I started practice, I would see,

2262
03:39:17,720 --> 03:39:24,440
I would have to operate as often in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and those deformities

2263
03:39:24,440 --> 03:39:31,240
that happen and you're trying to beat them, beat the body to addressing the deformities so they

2264
03:39:31,240 --> 03:39:36,200
don't get bad enough to where they really require joint replacements and much more complicated

2265
03:39:36,200 --> 03:39:41,480
recoveries and so forth. So it's always, it was always a battle and kind of like you racing a car,

2266
03:39:41,480 --> 03:39:45,720
you know, you're just trying to get, get just a little bit ahead and just do whatever you can do

2267
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:55,560
to, to win that. And now, I mean, I would say I probably see maybe one a month that needs surgery

2268
03:39:55,560 --> 03:40:00,840
and that's pretty rare. So, and the surgery is because of such a significant functional

2269
03:40:00,840 --> 03:40:06,920
limitation. Yes. Yeah. It's always in the case, I mean, it can be in the elbow, it can be in the

2270
03:40:06,920 --> 03:40:15,160
shoulder, but usually in the hand and it's a tendon subluxation joint deviation that then

2271
03:40:15,160 --> 03:40:21,080
weakens their hand and decreases their ability to remain independent. The goal obviously,

2272
03:40:21,080 --> 03:40:26,440
and to the point of what our hands do for us, if we maintain reasonably good hand function,

2273
03:40:26,440 --> 03:40:32,600
we can remain independent. As soon as we lose our hand function, we become dependent on others,

2274
03:40:32,600 --> 03:40:40,600
period. And so that's what our whole goal is to maintain that, that fierce independence. So yeah,

2275
03:40:40,600 --> 03:40:48,760
that's that. But then on the other hand, then we have the wear and tear osteoarthritis concept and

2276
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:55,560
and that varies among individuals. Some people have really good hands till the, till the very end.

2277
03:40:56,680 --> 03:41:03,480
And they have, I liken it to a paint job, you know, on a car, a cheap one. We talked about that before

2278
03:41:03,480 --> 03:41:08,840
and versus a very nice thick paint job that that holds up, but there is a big genetic component.

2279
03:41:08,840 --> 03:41:15,160
I see patients come in that'll maybe be, you know, only 50, very young. They'll come in and they'll

2280
03:41:15,160 --> 03:41:21,480
already have a lot of the visible alterations, not terrible functionally, but they're getting

2281
03:41:21,480 --> 03:41:26,520
the nobbiness. They're getting a little bit of inflammation in the joints out here, maybe down

2282
03:41:26,520 --> 03:41:33,960
at the thumb base. And they'll say, hey, so what can you do? My hands look exactly like my mom's

2283
03:41:33,960 --> 03:41:40,520
did or my dad's did. And there's, there's, there's real evidence to support that. Some people are

2284
03:41:40,520 --> 03:41:47,160
more predisposed than others. Now, the one exception is the ubiquitous about 50% of all

2285
03:41:47,160 --> 03:41:53,400
of us will develop arthritis at the base of our thumb. And that's that opposable thumb. And that's

2286
03:41:53,400 --> 03:41:59,240
the problem with that is it's all about biomechanics. It has to do too much. There's six degrees of

2287
03:41:59,240 --> 03:42:05,560
freedom. It's just this biconcave saddle joint that in order to come back and forth this way,

2288
03:42:05,560 --> 03:42:15,000
radial and ulnar deviation, then straight up, palmar abduction that way, and then rotating around

2289
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:21,960
and pronating in order to oppose the thumb tip to the fingertips. It's doing three different

2290
03:42:21,960 --> 03:42:29,000
directional movements. And this joint is doing this and this and this, and it just wears out.

2291
03:42:29,640 --> 03:42:37,400
And so it's just subjected to so many odd stresses and it's unstable like the shoulder by definition.

2292
03:42:37,400 --> 03:42:43,320
We couldn't have it. It gives it that amazing mobility. And so, so what do we, so 50% of people

2293
03:42:43,320 --> 03:42:47,800
in their lifetime, if I'm hearing correctly, will experience osteoarthritis of that joint. Yes.

2294
03:42:47,800 --> 03:42:53,880
In what fraction of those people will it pose a functional limitation that is, you know, not

2295
03:42:53,960 --> 03:42:59,800
something that's just treatable with some of leaves here and there. So we, we know that obviously we

2296
03:42:59,800 --> 03:43:05,000
don't know what percentage of the population that all of us as a group are treating, but we do know,

2297
03:43:05,800 --> 03:43:10,840
what we do know is that we don't know the exact subset. We know that there's many people walking

2298
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:15,080
around with basal arthritis that never have pain. They have some stiffness, some deformity, and they

2299
03:43:15,080 --> 03:43:19,800
don't hurt. We know that we don't know that exact number. However, what we do know that, and we've

2300
03:43:19,800 --> 03:43:27,240
published papers on this, is that of the people that present with some pain, about 25% of those,

2301
03:43:27,240 --> 03:43:32,920
which would be, I guess, 12 and a half percent of the overall population potentially are, are going

2302
03:43:32,920 --> 03:43:39,160
to need surgery on that at some point. So one fourth, one fourth of the people that present with

2303
03:43:39,160 --> 03:43:43,640
pain in the thumb are going to need surgery. And what is the surgical procedure? It varies,

2304
03:43:43,640 --> 03:43:49,240
depending on what stage they present at. And we've done staging systems and so forth, but it's some

2305
03:43:49,240 --> 03:43:57,400
form of reconstruction. Unlike the hips and knees that are so ubiquitous and so wonderful, they've

2306
03:43:57,400 --> 03:44:03,480
kept people back to their fully active lives by, by doing them, we don't have those kind of great

2307
03:44:03,480 --> 03:44:08,840
implants for this. That just doesn't, they don't work. There's very high failure rates. If, if a,

2308
03:44:08,840 --> 03:44:13,960
if a hip replacement or a knee replacement has a 5% failure rate at five or 10 years,

2309
03:44:14,760 --> 03:44:22,360
the thumbs are 70% failure rate of all the previous. So what we do and was invented by my

2310
03:44:22,360 --> 03:44:27,640
forebearers and we've modified them over time, but it's basically doing a reconstruction using your

2311
03:44:27,640 --> 03:44:36,680
own tissue. And that's what's super cool, which we didn't mention is because of the way our limbs

2312
03:44:36,680 --> 03:44:43,400
evolved, we have so much protective redundancy. We have so many tendons, like all of the flexor

2313
03:44:43,480 --> 03:44:47,560
tendons that flex the fingers also flex the wrist and give a strength just like you were talking

2314
03:44:47,560 --> 03:44:52,120
about with the pull ups. Well, you have wrist flexors that only attach right here that also

2315
03:44:52,120 --> 03:44:57,000
give you that flexion and we, and those all are housed in the forearm. And then you have the

2316
03:44:57,000 --> 03:45:01,560
extensors that do that. And then you have some that are just, we have multiple tendons that pull

2317
03:45:01,560 --> 03:45:07,720
the thumb out. They do subtle differences, but we can use those and we do use those to transfer

2318
03:45:08,440 --> 03:45:14,200
and to use them as tendon grafts. Now, a cool thing that goes back to the evolution

2319
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:19,560
is if you look at your hand, hold your hands out and pull and flex your wrist a little bit.

2320
03:45:23,560 --> 03:45:27,640
I can't tell from yours. You can see here, you can look on yourself. You can see here,

2321
03:45:27,640 --> 03:45:32,760
I had this big tendon that comes up when I, yeah. So on this side, I don't have one.

2322
03:45:33,560 --> 03:45:35,640
It's just missing. Oh, I have huge ones. Yeah.

2323
03:45:36,200 --> 03:45:40,760
I have huge ones on both sides. Okay. So evolutionarily, that's the, that's the

2324
03:45:40,760 --> 03:45:46,040
palmaris longus. Those are hugely developed in quadrupeds and horses and so forth. The

2325
03:45:46,040 --> 03:45:50,600
big important muscle. Well, don't do anything in us. They don't do anything. So we use that as a

2326
03:45:50,600 --> 03:45:54,760
tendon graft all the time. We just take it. I mean, it's just, it's attached to a little whipped

2327
03:45:55,400 --> 03:46:01,720
small muscle. I'm closer to the horses. I knew that about me. And so mine, we're evolving away.

2328
03:46:01,720 --> 03:46:07,320
15% of people don't have any. So does that mean you're not actually addressing the surface of

2329
03:46:07,320 --> 03:46:11,720
the saddle joint, which is arthritic in this procedure? Good point. You're not recreating

2330
03:46:11,720 --> 03:46:17,560
some artificial joint. What we're creating is a pseudoarthrosis. We stabilize it, get it

2331
03:46:17,560 --> 03:46:22,680
stabilized back on top. In my case, I take a little bit of the bone off to create a space and

2332
03:46:22,680 --> 03:46:26,520
then I roll up the rest of that tendon and put it in there. And that relieves the pain and restores

2333
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:31,720
function. Yes. So this is a high success operation. Very high success. Yeah. Very high.

2334
03:46:31,720 --> 03:46:38,680
I don't know how I didn't realize you could make a case that roughly five to 10% of the population

2335
03:46:38,680 --> 03:46:44,120
will require this at some point in their life. Yeah. If their activity, obviously a subset are

2336
03:46:44,120 --> 03:46:47,720
very sedentary and don't do much and they're not going to need it and they'll wear a splint for

2337
03:46:47,720 --> 03:46:54,920
the rest of their days. But if they're presenting with the pain, that's the point. We don't know

2338
03:46:54,920 --> 03:47:00,440
what the end is, but other than being the general population as a whole, but people who present with

2339
03:47:00,440 --> 03:47:05,320
pain are active enough. So would you say this is the single most common non-traumatic surgical

2340
03:47:05,320 --> 03:47:12,920
repair of the hand? Non-traumatic, other than a, well, and even a trigger finger you could

2341
03:47:12,920 --> 03:47:20,440
attribute to, so of the major surgery done in the hand, yes, by far. Okay. By far. So you mentioned

2342
03:47:20,440 --> 03:47:23,240
trigger finger. What's that? Well, trigger finger is what we were talking about before,

2343
03:47:23,240 --> 03:47:27,720
where the inflammation of the sheath. And then right in the middle here, there's a series of

2344
03:47:27,720 --> 03:47:33,880
pulleys and these are super cool. I'm going to draw a picture if I may. Yeah. Okay. So we're

2345
03:47:33,880 --> 03:47:38,920
looking at the side of the hand. Yes. So we're looking and let's just say this is the middle

2346
03:47:38,920 --> 03:47:45,640
finger. It's the longest and this is the metacarpal. This is the first of the three bones of the finger

2347
03:47:45,640 --> 03:47:51,720
proper. And what I've drawn here, this black line coming underneath is the flexor tendon.

2348
03:47:52,360 --> 03:47:57,160
And that's the one that does curls. All our curl allows you to do all your pull-ups. So there's

2349
03:47:57,160 --> 03:48:01,320
four bones there, just so people can see. I don't want them to miss the one. This one is kind of

2350
03:48:01,320 --> 03:48:05,960
hidden within the hand because that's through here. Yeah. And so then there's the three

2351
03:48:06,680 --> 03:48:13,320
successive. And so if you just, if you had a muscle attached to this and you pulled on it and

2352
03:48:13,320 --> 03:48:19,880
didn't have those blue structures, then this would bowstring just like a fishing pole. If you don't

2353
03:48:20,680 --> 03:48:27,480
put the fishing line through the islets, then it just stays way away. And it's actually stronger

2354
03:48:27,480 --> 03:48:33,960
that way, but you lose all the mobility. So you lose the capacity to really curl your fingers

2355
03:48:33,960 --> 03:48:42,360
tightly. So that's what they're gliding through. And those are fibroosseous tunnels and just fibrous

2356
03:48:42,360 --> 03:48:48,840
tissue, very strong, which you mentioned rock climbing, they can rupture because you're putting

2357
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:55,640
so much force on those in such funky positions and isolating two fingers, one finger and so forth.

2358
03:48:55,640 --> 03:49:02,280
So I see that a lot in rock climbers, but the point here is that as you're rubbing constantly

2359
03:49:02,280 --> 03:49:07,480
going back and forth, whether you're playing a concerto or you're rock climbing, you can get

2360
03:49:07,480 --> 03:49:13,000
inflamed along that sheath. This particular pulley here is down in the palm. And that's the

2361
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:18,600
most common site to have inflammation to where you can even get some nodular swelling in the tendon

2362
03:49:18,600 --> 03:49:22,920
and that thickening up of that pulley. And then it just actually catches and we call it a trigger

2363
03:49:22,920 --> 03:49:30,840
finger because it's like pulling a trigger on a gun. It has that feeling. And we frequently have

2364
03:49:30,840 --> 03:49:37,320
to inject those with cortisone and frequently have to operate on their ubiquitous. And about half of

2365
03:49:37,320 --> 03:49:41,960
them recover with just a cortisone injection. Yeah. I always say actually more in the order,

2366
03:49:41,960 --> 03:49:46,520
depending on how, if we get to them, if you take someone who presents within say six weeks of onset,

2367
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:54,440
there's about a 75% cure rate with one or two injections. So the longer you wait, the more

2368
03:49:55,000 --> 03:49:59,800
likely potential damage you cause and the more chronic inflammation that ensues. Correct. But

2369
03:49:59,800 --> 03:50:03,960
we don't, and this applies kind of a general consensus. I think we talked about this before

2370
03:50:03,960 --> 03:50:09,640
when we were talking about cortisone shots is in these types of soft tissue procedures, we don't

2371
03:50:09,640 --> 03:50:15,480
keep injecting cortisone, cortisone, cortisone, because it can lead to soft tissue degradation

2372
03:50:15,560 --> 03:50:19,560
and ultimately even tendon ruptures. I've never seen one in my practice, but we know they can

2373
03:50:19,560 --> 03:50:23,480
exist. And what do you use as a rule of thumb for how many times you'll put three, three,

2374
03:50:23,480 --> 03:50:28,760
at three in the lifetime of the joint, three in the lifetime of that tendon sheath, unless it's

2375
03:50:28,760 --> 03:50:33,160
very, very broad. Usually you don't see someone back 10 years later who needs another injection.

2376
03:50:33,160 --> 03:50:37,720
But if I did, I'd be willing to do that again because everything has normalized physiologically

2377
03:50:37,720 --> 03:50:41,560
at that point. Now, the other cool thing that I was talking about before when we were talking about

2378
03:50:42,280 --> 03:50:49,880
you asked about the extensors versus flexors. So if we look at the red, this is the extrinsic

2379
03:50:49,880 --> 03:50:55,160
extensor tendon that will straighten up the knuckles. But then we look further out and we

2380
03:50:55,160 --> 03:51:01,560
see, well, that only stops, that tendon stops at the middle knuckle, but what allows, what pulls

2381
03:51:02,120 --> 03:51:07,800
the whole finger straight? And it's actually this intrinsic muscle here that's tapering down

2382
03:51:08,360 --> 03:51:16,920
and has a very thin tendon. It turns into a lateral band and it travels from the palm side

2383
03:51:17,800 --> 03:51:23,720
up above the middle knuckle, above that axis of rotation. And then it goes all the way on

2384
03:51:23,720 --> 03:51:32,280
attaches to the tip. And so it's a super cool mechanism that through a series of mechanical

2385
03:51:32,280 --> 03:51:37,560
placements, it's able to extend the finger even though contracting by contracting. It's

2386
03:51:37,960 --> 03:51:41,800
very counterintuitive. I mean, most people wouldn't immediately get that. You have great

2387
03:51:41,800 --> 03:51:46,760
biomechanical sense because yes, by contracting, it's straightening up the finger. It's super cool.

2388
03:51:48,360 --> 03:51:54,840
But it doesn't take much. Like if you take a direct blow to that knuckle right there and that tendon

2389
03:51:54,840 --> 03:52:01,240
just slips because you've disrupted some soft tissue, it can slip below the axis of rotation.

2390
03:52:01,240 --> 03:52:06,600
Then it becomes a flexor and you get a near deformity, which looks like that. You cannot

2391
03:52:06,600 --> 03:52:11,400
straighten your finger up because those lateral bands that are used to extending the finger have

2392
03:52:11,400 --> 03:52:17,880
slipped down. Now they become a flexor just like you said. So it's super cool and just so intricate.

2393
03:52:18,440 --> 03:52:23,160
And I vaguely remember one sort of surgical emergency in the hand where that sheath would

2394
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:30,040
become infected. Yes, very good. Yes. It's one of the few really orthopedic emergencies in the hand,

2395
03:52:30,040 --> 03:52:37,560
which is, yes, tenosynovitis and then it becomes supporative or infected and pus in there.

2396
03:52:37,560 --> 03:52:42,920
And those people, I mean, there's so many nerves in our hand anyway. When you get even a few drops

2397
03:52:42,920 --> 03:52:49,720
of purulent pus in the finger sheath, it hurts like crazy. And your posture is down like this.

2398
03:52:49,720 --> 03:52:55,080
You can't straighten your finger up at all and it's exquisitely tender and it looks swollen just

2399
03:52:55,080 --> 03:53:01,880
along that sheath. And yeah, it's an operative urgency or emergency. And how does a person get

2400
03:53:01,880 --> 03:53:06,040
that infection? It's usually an open injury or? Yeah, sometimes just a little, it can even be a

2401
03:53:06,040 --> 03:53:14,600
pinprick. It's sometimes an insect bite, you know, with a stinger and often just a tiny little, you

2402
03:53:14,600 --> 03:53:20,120
know, you can be like a graph if you're using sports equipment, you can get a little graphite,

2403
03:53:20,840 --> 03:53:25,480
tiny stiff graphite puncture. How often, how many times a year do you see one of those?

2404
03:53:25,480 --> 03:53:30,360
I don't see them as much. I'm not in the ER, but they're ubiquitous. I mean,

2405
03:53:30,360 --> 03:53:36,120
they're coming all the time, year round. Okay. Should we do an exam of the hand and wrist now?

2406
03:53:36,120 --> 03:53:37,480
Yes, let's do. Let's do. Great.

2407
03:53:42,760 --> 03:53:47,640
Okay. So now, you know, we've, we've been talking a lot about the kind of a forearm

2408
03:53:47,640 --> 03:53:51,640
wrist and hand. And so we can go through some of the common diagnoses of those.

2409
03:53:52,840 --> 03:53:58,200
Again, inspection is so important. We look for swelling. If you have what's called dequeurvains,

2410
03:53:58,200 --> 03:54:04,120
tenicinovitis, you'll see swelling here. If you have basal joint arthritis, you'll see bulging

2411
03:54:04,120 --> 03:54:10,760
here. If you have a torn radial collateral ligament, then you'll see a resting deviation of

2412
03:54:10,760 --> 03:54:20,360
the thumb and it's very prominent. If you have some arthritis or tenicinovitis of the big extensor

2413
03:54:20,360 --> 03:54:26,200
tendon through here on the owner side, that'll be prominent. A ganglion cyst, of course, sticks out

2414
03:54:26,200 --> 03:54:31,560
like a big, you know, well, goose egg there on top, usually most commonly right here.

2415
03:54:33,720 --> 03:54:37,560
We look for atrophy. Very important. We were talking about that before. So if I look at your

2416
03:54:37,560 --> 03:54:43,880
hand, there's three places that I look for atrophy. I look over here and I see that that's

2417
03:54:43,880 --> 03:54:52,200
plump and not flattened out. What it'll do is it'll look like a gaunt, you know, face. And then over

2418
03:54:52,200 --> 03:54:57,960
here, I look here, this also can develop an atrophy there. I had a young woman a long time ago,

2419
03:54:57,960 --> 03:55:04,280
had never been reported, who had traumatically, very active athletic person, had traumatically

2420
03:55:04,280 --> 03:55:10,280
torn off that first dorsal neurosius muscle. So she didn't have a nerve problem. She tore the

2421
03:55:10,280 --> 03:55:15,800
insertion right off of there, which is what gives you that strength there. And so she had just

2422
03:55:15,800 --> 03:55:20,440
already atrophied. This was at four weeks, it was already atrophied. So I reattached it and it came

2423
03:55:20,440 --> 03:55:25,160
back. It's fine. Then, and very importantly, looking at the thin arm muscles, we want to see

2424
03:55:25,160 --> 03:55:31,800
a nice plump, convex surface. If it starts to flatten or even just be soft when you palpate it,

2425
03:55:31,800 --> 03:55:37,160
then we worry about the nerve, not enough nerve signal going to that and developing the early

2426
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:44,440
atrophy. So we look at that, we look at the rotation. So again, we've inspected. I'm not

2427
03:55:44,440 --> 03:55:50,760
going to test strength yet. I'm going to look at rotation, I mean, wrist and finger motion. So

2428
03:55:50,760 --> 03:55:57,720
we look at the full pronation, full supination, very subtly between individuals, but more or less,

2429
03:55:57,720 --> 03:56:03,160
we're looking for 90, 90 of pronation, supination. And then we look at the wrist, and we want to see

2430
03:56:03,160 --> 03:56:09,320
that you have roughly, that can vary a lot, but somewhere between 70 and 90 of extension and 70

2431
03:56:09,320 --> 03:56:14,120
and 90 of flexion, we want to know if that hurts or if we feel crepitus, that crunchy feeling that

2432
03:56:14,120 --> 03:56:20,520
can indicate inflammation in the joint. Similarly, when we're pronating supinating, we're feeling for

2433
03:56:20,520 --> 03:56:27,080
inflammation there. If you walk in and you have a very prominent distal ulna, especially asymmetrically,

2434
03:56:27,080 --> 03:56:31,320
that's important to me because, and especially if you had a traumatic accident, these are commonly

2435
03:56:31,320 --> 03:56:38,280
missed. There's some thick ligaments here, the DRUJ ligaments, and those can allow the ulna to

2436
03:56:38,280 --> 03:56:43,960
rise and the radius to fall away from that. And it's very disabling, especially for athletes. And

2437
03:56:43,960 --> 03:56:49,800
so I see it in hockey players who take the slam. And so I'm checking that and looking for that

2438
03:56:49,880 --> 03:56:59,000
stability there as I rotate and watch it. Then, so we've looked at range of motion. Now, for the thumb,

2439
03:56:59,000 --> 03:57:04,920
this joint right here, the MCP joint, where you have a skier's thumb for the ulnar-clouded ligament

2440
03:57:04,920 --> 03:57:10,280
and a radial-clouded ligament tear, though that's the most variable joint in the body in terms of

2441
03:57:10,280 --> 03:57:17,000
varying among individuals. So you have minus 30 passively, and you flex nicely down to about 70.

2442
03:57:17,000 --> 03:57:22,920
We look at my thumb. I hyper-extend a lot more, but I only flex down to about 40. And that's just,

2443
03:57:22,920 --> 03:57:29,000
everybody's different. So we want to compare the two and see. And especially on laxity, even side

2444
03:57:29,000 --> 03:57:34,360
to side, if I'm testing this and you have a tear, it'll go way over sometimes to 60 degrees, 70

2445
03:57:34,360 --> 03:57:39,240
degrees, either direction. We know that's asymmetric and that's not going to withstand

2446
03:57:39,240 --> 03:57:44,440
and need to be repaired. Fingers, you know, we want to just simply see if you make a tight fist,

2447
03:57:44,440 --> 03:57:48,360
which you can, you can really nicely curl those fingers down. If you've had various injuries,

2448
03:57:48,360 --> 03:57:52,840
that's going to be altered. When you straighten them back up, if one of them stays stuck down,

2449
03:57:52,840 --> 03:57:57,480
then you probably have a locked trigger finger. And I have to pry that open. And then I feel

2450
03:57:57,480 --> 03:58:02,200
in palpate, I feel a nodule, I feel the swelling in the tendon, the tenderness. And then we know

2451
03:58:02,200 --> 03:58:08,200
that's what you have. It's very easy. Now, next, we need to remember that for a lot of overuse

2452
03:58:08,200 --> 03:58:14,360
strain, whether you're a professional musician or working out in a gym regularly or irregularly,

2453
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:20,360
more commonly, there's two sites where you can get the most common injury. And you know this

2454
03:58:20,360 --> 03:58:26,200
in spades is the musculotendinous junction. You talked about the eccentric loading. And there's

2455
03:58:26,200 --> 03:58:31,160
two spots for that. There's one right here and there's one right here. There's these short

2456
03:58:31,160 --> 03:58:35,560
tendons that attach to the bones up here and you can get the muscle tendon junction injured there.

2457
03:58:36,200 --> 03:58:42,360
And you can get where the tendons become the long tendons and the muscle, that, that, that

2458
03:58:42,360 --> 03:58:46,200
transition zone. And those are the two places. So we're going to test those. A lot of patients

2459
03:58:46,200 --> 03:58:51,080
come in and say, I'm having pain here. Every time I try to work out or play tennis or whatever,

2460
03:58:51,080 --> 03:58:56,680
or here. And so that's what we're feeling for. Now, I can test this. You pull up against me hard,

2461
03:58:57,320 --> 03:59:03,400
rock solid, pull down against me, down this way, hard. And that's great. We have your thumb pull

2462
03:59:03,400 --> 03:59:09,480
up this way, super strong, have you spread your fingers out real stiff. That's very strong. Now,

2463
03:59:09,480 --> 03:59:15,240
that is overlaying into the nerve exam that we look for. And that those are the intrinsic muscles.

2464
03:59:15,240 --> 03:59:20,920
That's the ulnar nerve. If you have a bad ulnar nerve from here to here, it's going to give away

2465
03:59:20,920 --> 03:59:25,880
and just fall away and they'll be weak. Similarly, I want to look at your thenar strength and have

2466
03:59:25,880 --> 03:59:30,440
you come bring your thumb right up out of the palm, like you're a good higher primate, and then push

2467
03:59:30,440 --> 03:59:36,920
against me. And that's rock solid. And that's, we see this bulge up there. And so that tells us that

2468
03:59:36,920 --> 03:59:43,160
your thenar muscle and your median nerve are working fine. Let's see what other common things.

2469
03:59:43,160 --> 03:59:48,200
You know, something is simple. We didn't talk about this too much, but so common and ubiquitous

2470
03:59:48,200 --> 03:59:53,400
are just sprained fingers. People jam their fingers, baseball, softball, working out, whatever.

2471
03:59:54,040 --> 04:00:00,600
And what's crazy is you sprain these joints and we can palpate those. And we can test them. Some

2472
04:00:00,600 --> 04:00:05,480
people tear them, but we test them. They feel fine. They're strong, but they're swollen. They're

2473
04:00:05,480 --> 04:00:11,400
bulbous. They tender. And that can take months and months to go away. So you just have to counsel

2474
04:00:11,400 --> 04:00:16,680
people, your patients, my patients, to just be patient with it. Keep using them. There's no harm

2475
04:00:16,680 --> 04:00:21,560
in using them. The cool thing about ligaments is they heal with motion. So we don't want to mobilize

2476
04:00:21,560 --> 04:00:26,680
them too long. That's a common misconception. I see patients who have had bad sprains, even

2477
04:00:26,680 --> 04:00:32,440
dislocations, and they they're put into a splint. They come see me three weeks later, they're already

2478
04:00:32,440 --> 04:00:37,480
stiff. I would move those immediately, maybe one to two days to rest them a little bit and then get

2479
04:00:37,480 --> 04:00:43,080
them moving. Okay. So we've done, we've done and remember that, and well, you know this and not

2480
04:00:43,080 --> 04:00:47,880
remember, but we were talking about the fact that we have the extrinsic tendons, both the extensors

2481
04:00:47,880 --> 04:00:53,880
and the flexors. And those are muscles through here and then tendons through here all the way

2482
04:00:53,880 --> 04:01:00,040
out to the fingertips. So we, we can isolate and find, let's say you have a little, you're cutting

2483
04:01:00,040 --> 04:01:04,760
an avocado and you poke right in there. You have maybe numbness along here. We know you cut the

2484
04:01:04,760 --> 04:01:11,000
digital nerve there. And this finger, when you make a fist, this one just stays up like that.

2485
04:01:11,560 --> 04:01:15,240
And that, that tells me that there's something wrong with the tendon. Then I try to isolate

2486
04:01:15,240 --> 04:01:20,120
that, say, well, can you bend the tip? And you say, oh yeah, I can bend the tip. But then I say,

2487
04:01:20,120 --> 04:01:25,800
and that isolates the long flexor, but then I do this and you, and you can't bend it. Then that

2488
04:01:25,800 --> 04:01:31,320
says, okay, you cut the superficial one of the two tendons there. So it's really easy anatomically

2489
04:01:31,320 --> 04:01:38,280
to figure these things out. And I think that's about it. If you have it, we talked about the

2490
04:01:38,280 --> 04:01:42,920
dinner fork deformity. If you have a distal radius fracture across here, it comes up here and goes

2491
04:01:42,920 --> 04:01:49,240
this way. I mean, there's a true notable deformity. And so we're, you know, the, the population with

2492
04:01:49,240 --> 04:01:55,400
your help is becoming younger and younger. And so we are more and more aggressive because there are

2493
04:01:55,400 --> 04:02:01,000
70, 80, 90 year olds who are working out, who are playing sports, and we want to keep them

2494
04:02:01,640 --> 04:02:06,760
going as long as possible because I'm getting close to that. And so, you know, so we fix those,

2495
04:02:06,760 --> 04:02:13,880
we get them back. My mom was 80, 82, and she broke her wrist, put a titanium plate on there.

2496
04:02:13,880 --> 04:02:17,800
And she was, she, right. You didn't even know that she had it and she was using it the, you know,

2497
04:02:17,800 --> 04:02:25,080
two weeks later. So, okay. So the final thing you wanted to talk about was kind of all of the

2498
04:02:25,080 --> 04:02:32,440
nerve pains that can presumably not just wreak havoc down here from a pain and, you know,

2499
04:02:32,440 --> 04:02:39,480
suffering standpoint, but also from a diagnostic standpoint. Yes. Yes. So, so many people present

2500
04:02:39,480 --> 04:02:48,520
with numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in the upper limb. And it can be, it can start from the

2501
04:02:48,520 --> 04:02:55,000
neck where the nerve roots exit and travel under our collarbone through the brachial plexus in

2502
04:02:55,000 --> 04:03:01,240
between the scalene muscles, and then travels through our armpit and then comes down in through

2503
04:03:01,240 --> 04:03:09,640
the arm and into the hand. And the, and they, it can be confounding. A perfect example of how

2504
04:03:09,640 --> 04:03:17,000
confounding it can be is a, is a now more commonly known, although it's, I wouldn't call it rare,

2505
04:03:17,000 --> 04:03:25,240
but it's uncommon, is Parsonage-Turner syndrome. It's a fascinating study in that whole process

2506
04:03:25,240 --> 04:03:33,480
from the neck down. And the other term for it is a brachial neuritis, as in brachial plexus neuritis.

2507
04:03:34,040 --> 04:03:40,120
And it's an inflammation of those nerves. We think it's probably viral related because there's

2508
04:03:40,120 --> 04:03:46,840
usually a viral prodrome associated, but doesn't have to be, but it's an acute dramatic onset

2509
04:03:46,920 --> 04:03:54,600
of pain all through here. And then some, what we call mixed plexopathy, some mixed bag of

2510
04:03:55,320 --> 04:04:03,080
palsy, weakness, numbness, and it can be in multiple different nerves. It can even lead to,

2511
04:04:03,080 --> 04:04:08,440
and one of the most common presenting ways is long thoracic nerve, which is part of the brachial

2512
04:04:08,440 --> 04:04:15,480
plexus, and you get scapular winging. So you, you lift your arm up and it just falls down because

2513
04:04:15,480 --> 04:04:22,360
your scapula cannot support the shoulder and arm weight because the muscle of the, the, the,

2514
04:04:23,640 --> 04:04:30,040
of the shoulder girdle cannot support that. And it's super cool. And, and it, and it presents as

2515
04:04:30,040 --> 04:04:37,080
a mix. So it affects multiple nerves because those nerves are more common up here and then they

2516
04:04:37,080 --> 04:04:42,680
diverge into the different nerves, which I still, you know, you remember in med school trying to

2517
04:04:42,680 --> 04:04:47,480
learn the brachial plexus and it was, it was brutal because it's really complicated. Okay. So,

2518
04:04:48,520 --> 04:04:53,720
so these are people who show up and they, you, you certainly couldn't attribute what they're

2519
04:04:53,720 --> 04:05:00,200
experiencing to any one thing. That's the point. Like it's not like they have one or two discs

2520
04:05:00,200 --> 04:05:04,040
that could be bulging and causing that symptom. It's not like they could have even transacted

2521
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:08,280
their long thoracic nerve. Like a woman who has a mastectomy, you're always looking out for that

2522
04:05:08,280 --> 04:05:13,240
post-mastectomy. It's like they would have to have six lesions simultaneously. Exactly. And it

2523
04:05:13,240 --> 04:05:19,000
just doesn't happen except with that. So that's a, that's a great lead into what the majority.

2524
04:05:19,000 --> 04:05:22,040
By the way, is that just a self-limited thing or do you give these people steroids?

2525
04:05:22,040 --> 04:05:28,040
Steroids. Yeah. And the neurologist now, they make the diagnosis if you send them to them

2526
04:05:28,040 --> 04:05:32,920
and we give steroids and most of them recover completely. A few have some residual deficits

2527
04:05:33,240 --> 04:05:41,480
forever, at least long-term. Okay. So then that takes us to people presenting. I have a ton of

2528
04:05:41,480 --> 04:05:47,320
patients who present with shoulder pain and they may have a little something on their MRI that they

2529
04:05:47,320 --> 04:05:53,960
may have brought in with them, but that shoulder pain is actually coming from their neck from,

2530
04:05:53,960 --> 04:06:01,560
and so then I'll have someone who will present with carpal tunnel syndrome, but it's, there's

2531
04:06:01,640 --> 04:06:05,800
a little extra stuff going on. Maybe some ulnar nerve and the little finger,

2532
04:06:05,800 --> 04:06:12,840
maybe some shoulder pain, maybe some arm pain. And the cool thing about, diagnostically speaking,

2533
04:06:12,840 --> 04:06:20,120
is an intrinsic shoulder problem such as a rotator cuff tear or inflammation, bursitis, etc.,

2534
04:06:20,680 --> 04:06:25,240
usually travels down underneath the pain, underneath the delt, the big deltoid muscle,

2535
04:06:25,240 --> 04:06:31,640
but almost never goes below the elbow. So if I see pain that's in the shoulder going below the

2536
04:06:31,640 --> 04:06:40,520
elbow, I'm thinking maybe neck or maybe something else. Then, secondarily, if someone complains of,

2537
04:06:40,520 --> 04:06:45,800
let's say they come in and they say, yeah, I've got numbness here, but I've also got some numbness

2538
04:06:45,800 --> 04:06:51,720
on the back of the hand. The radial nerve is rarely involved in association with carpal tunnel

2539
04:06:51,720 --> 04:06:59,080
or cubital tunnel. And, oh yeah, my neck's been really stiff. Just subtle little cues that you can

2540
04:06:59,080 --> 04:07:04,600
get by speaking with them. Well, they could have something that I know you know about and that can

2541
04:07:04,600 --> 04:07:10,280
be called double crush. And that is where you get pinching of the nerve in the neck, maybe through a

2542
04:07:10,280 --> 04:07:15,480
disc, maybe through a foraminal osteophyte that narrows that little canal that passes through.

2543
04:07:16,200 --> 04:07:26,760
And then, because the axoplasmic flow or the nerve tube, the communication of it is disrupted

2544
04:07:26,760 --> 04:07:35,160
or compressed, it renders them more susceptible to milder compression down at the carpal tunnel

2545
04:07:35,160 --> 04:07:41,400
or the cubital tunnel at the elbow. So they're getting a double crush. Now, for those, I don't

2546
04:07:41,400 --> 04:07:46,360
treat necks other than treating them initially with some PT and maybe steroids or something.

2547
04:07:46,360 --> 04:07:51,800
And I refer those out. But many patients will then see a neck surgeon who will say, well,

2548
04:07:51,800 --> 04:07:57,160
you don't really need surgery. Yes, I think you do have double crush, but you can go ahead and treat.

2549
04:07:57,160 --> 04:08:01,000
I can go ahead and treat, let's say they have moderate carpal tunnel. I can do a carpal tunnel

2550
04:08:01,000 --> 04:08:05,720
release and they'll still get better. They may not get all the way better, though most of their

2551
04:08:05,720 --> 04:08:11,320
carpal tunnel will go away, but they'll still have some of the upper nerve pain.

2552
04:08:11,720 --> 04:08:17,960
So the double crush phenomena is real and true. And that's another category of patient.

2553
04:08:18,520 --> 04:08:26,280
Then there's the weird lower cervical that I just learned not that long ago from a really smart

2554
04:08:27,880 --> 04:08:33,640
neck surgeon is it's pretty consistent that the lower level, the C7 nerve root level,

2555
04:08:33,640 --> 04:08:38,520
if they have compression down there, then that that goes deep under the scapula and gives them

2556
04:08:38,520 --> 04:08:43,480
that deep scapular plane. And in the problem there, and what's been so great for me to learn

2557
04:08:43,480 --> 04:08:49,960
this later in my career is I often would see patients will develop scapulothoracic bursitis,

2558
04:08:49,960 --> 04:08:54,680
and you can clearly get that from lifting weights, especially if you've been out of the weight room

2559
04:08:54,680 --> 04:08:59,960
for a long time, you go back into it, you can get a lot of upper trapezius periscapular rhomboid

2560
04:08:59,960 --> 04:09:06,280
type pain from overuse and those overlap. So you really have to do the diagnostic work

2561
04:09:06,280 --> 04:09:10,680
and talk to the patients and listen to the patients to differentiate that. And then of course,

2562
04:09:10,680 --> 04:09:18,920
in our exam, we can we can see that too. And I think that's more or less what I would want to say

2563
04:09:18,920 --> 04:09:28,360
the one patient that I would I think illustrates this how complicated it can be with someone who

2564
04:09:28,360 --> 04:09:33,480
had a bad shoulder fracture is treated in the emergency department, put into a sling, but then

2565
04:09:33,480 --> 04:09:39,480
also may be told to do pendulum exercises. Well, it was an unstable fracture, very unstable. And so

2566
04:09:39,480 --> 04:09:43,000
the weight of our arm, I mean, I'm sure you've did that in general surgery way more than me,

2567
04:09:43,000 --> 04:09:47,880
the weight of the arm is enormous if you have to amputate an arm for a tumor or something. And all

2568
04:09:47,880 --> 04:09:53,960
that weight pulling on an unstable fracture, well, that put tremendous traction on the nerves ended

2569
04:09:53,960 --> 04:10:02,360
up killing his ulnar and median nerve. Ulnar and median nerve are out. He came in his hand was like

2570
04:10:02,440 --> 04:10:08,760
that. He couldn't he couldn't oppose his thumb. He couldn't do anything. And I all I had left to work

2571
04:10:08,760 --> 04:10:14,920
with was the radial nerve innervated, which are the wrist extensors and the supinators. And I was

2572
04:10:14,920 --> 04:10:21,960
able to transfer some things and give him back some pretty good function. And but it was all just

2573
04:10:21,960 --> 04:10:26,440
due to track. What was the what was that length of time it took for that for those nerves to under

2574
04:10:26,440 --> 04:10:33,880
traction die? Yeah, it was fast, super fast. Oh, probably within I saw him eight weeks post-op. So

2575
04:10:33,880 --> 04:10:38,680
he was fully there. But he started saying he started losing hand function at about three weeks

2576
04:10:38,680 --> 04:10:45,160
within three weeks of the fracture. And no one picked up on this? No. Yeah, it was it was pretty

2577
04:10:45,160 --> 04:10:51,160
tragic. Yeah. Well, do you want to do an exam and kind of go over some of those things as well?

2578
04:10:51,160 --> 04:10:53,320
Yeah, we wrap up. Okay, great. Let's do that. Okay.

2579
04:10:56,600 --> 04:11:00,760
Okay, so we talked about kind of the nerve compressive neuropathies, nerve injuries that

2580
04:11:00,760 --> 04:11:06,120
can happen. And so this is very brief, but just to kind of go through the route of the nerves for

2581
04:11:06,120 --> 04:11:11,320
your viewers. And so if we look at your neck, we want to say maybe you have some neck stiffness,

2582
04:11:11,320 --> 04:11:17,160
maybe not, but we look and see and we say this side it goes, I'm going to take it less. Let's say

2583
04:11:17,160 --> 04:11:22,840
it only goes to 30 degrees horizontal rotation, whereas this side goes farther than we say, oh,

2584
04:11:23,320 --> 04:11:29,080
maybe there's some asymmetry there. Any tightness and asymmetry in the neck can actually cause

2585
04:11:29,080 --> 04:11:33,240
pinching of those nerves come out of your neck and give a lot of neck pain, but also pain down

2586
04:11:33,240 --> 04:11:37,240
there. You can go ahead and extend your neck that way. That's great. And then chin to your chest. So

2587
04:11:37,240 --> 04:11:41,960
I want to just basically look at that. The last one of that is just horizontal rotation that way

2588
04:11:41,960 --> 04:11:47,560
in that way. And that gives me a sense of maybe there's a component of that. Then, you know, we

2589
04:11:47,960 --> 04:11:54,520
send patients to neurologists to look at the nerves, the function. They do two kinds of

2590
04:11:54,520 --> 04:11:59,400
testings and the electromyography, and then they do nerve conduction, but we can do a poor man's

2591
04:11:59,400 --> 04:12:04,680
test quite well. Poor man's neurologic exam, just like this. So we know the nerves come out of the

2592
04:12:04,680 --> 04:12:10,200
neck. They go through between the anterior and middle scaling muscles. These secondary respiratory

2593
04:12:10,200 --> 04:12:14,600
muscles that are up here and they pass us through there. And if I roll through there and you have a

2594
04:12:15,240 --> 04:12:20,520
disc, you will say, oh, that's sending, that's going down to my left arm, my right arm, both

2595
04:12:20,520 --> 04:12:26,120
arms. So it's a real easy palpation of those irritated nerves. Then we look at that. They're

2596
04:12:26,120 --> 04:12:30,680
coming under the collarbone. They're coming down through deep to your pectoralis here and then

2597
04:12:30,680 --> 04:12:36,280
coming in through the axilla. The next place I can get access to those nerves is here medially.

2598
04:12:36,280 --> 04:12:41,000
We know the ulnar and median nerve and well, the radial nerve comes over here, but the owner and

2599
04:12:41,000 --> 04:12:46,760
median nerves right here. So I'll palpate right up against your bone and see, and that too. Oh,

2600
04:12:46,760 --> 04:12:52,680
yeah, that's definitely giving me stuff here. If you tell me that is giving you numbness and

2601
04:12:52,680 --> 04:12:58,920
tingling to there or to your thumb, then when I get down here, I know that it's not just carpal

2602
04:12:58,920 --> 04:13:04,120
tunnel or cubital tunnel. I know it's got to be some component coming from your neck. It's a very

2603
04:13:04,120 --> 04:13:09,320
simple, easy way. Anything above the elbow is irritated from up here. Anything below it could

2604
04:13:09,320 --> 04:13:17,000
be both. And we almost never from your neck, we almost never just see a pure ulnar neuropathy just

2605
04:13:17,000 --> 04:13:20,200
coming from your neck. Usually there's something else, like a little radial nerve, a little medial

2606
04:13:20,200 --> 04:13:24,520
nerve, something else. So then we come down to your ulnar nerve. Let's use this elbow because

2607
04:13:24,520 --> 04:13:30,600
it's better. So I've already checked your motion and then I feel your nerve and the groove there,

2608
04:13:30,600 --> 04:13:35,400
the funny bone nerve. And yours is, as we said, pretty mobile. I can kind of pull it up over the

2609
04:13:35,400 --> 04:13:40,440
edge, but it's not bad. Now I would tap on that lightly and see, does that cause electrical shocks?

2610
04:13:40,440 --> 04:13:44,920
And does that give you, oh, oh, I don't like that. Now a lot of us can have a little irritation,

2611
04:13:44,920 --> 04:13:50,040
so we want to compare and see what you have. Secondly, I want to flex up and see what that

2612
04:13:50,040 --> 04:13:54,840
nerve does. Now you have a very well developed triceps. I have seen people who are super avid

2613
04:13:54,840 --> 04:14:00,520
and that have these huge triceps and throwing athletes as well, where they are pressing their

2614
04:14:00,600 --> 04:14:05,960
triceps is overdeveloped here and it's pressing up against the nerve. So it's a different form

2615
04:14:05,960 --> 04:14:10,120
of cubital tunnel syndrome. It's not really in the cubital tunnel, but I've seen that a lot in athletes.

2616
04:14:11,000 --> 04:14:15,880
This ulnar nerve, I want to test and see what it's doing. If you're a throwing athlete and your nerve

2617
04:14:15,880 --> 04:14:20,120
slips back and forth, you can get snapping nerve and it's really irritable. You can no longer feel

2618
04:14:20,120 --> 04:14:25,640
the seams on your slider or your fastball. And so that is often needs surgery and even the weakness

2619
04:14:25,640 --> 04:14:30,600
of grip. Now we come down here and then I can press on that. I can flex it up and hold it.

2620
04:14:31,160 --> 04:14:37,000
And if that starts to cause numbness and tingling in your hand, then that's a secondary. You will

2621
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:42,200
have already probably told me, yeah, you know, I get this. I wake up with my hand on an nerve

2622
04:14:42,200 --> 04:14:47,880
quite numb and that's, we all tend to start out this way and end up this way. And the only problem

2623
04:14:47,880 --> 04:14:54,440
there is that that can happen to any of us, but if it's regular and frequent and lingering,

2624
04:14:54,440 --> 04:15:01,720
or if we get it when we're typing or playing a piccolo or a cello, then that's a different

2625
04:15:01,720 --> 04:15:08,200
issue. And when you look further, lastly, coming down the form, there's two more nerves that we

2626
04:15:08,200 --> 04:15:14,600
can look at. The ulnar nerve rarely is involved down here. It's almost always 98% of the time at

2627
04:15:14,600 --> 04:15:21,320
the elbow. The radial nerve comes out from under here. It's just the sensory terminal branch of

2628
04:15:21,320 --> 04:15:26,440
the radial nerve that does so much good work for extending our wrist and our triceps and everything.

2629
04:15:26,440 --> 04:15:31,320
And it goes down to here and provides sensation in this part of the hand. And we can tap on that

2630
04:15:31,960 --> 04:15:36,840
and come down and then it will give electrical shocks down here. It can be very nerve wracking.

2631
04:15:36,840 --> 04:15:42,360
I've seen a lot of musicians with that. You have a loose wristband on now. Some people wear heavy

2632
04:15:42,360 --> 04:15:46,200
watches, heavy bracelets, and you can get that. Or if you've been arrested and they put their

2633
04:15:46,200 --> 04:15:50,120
handcuffs too tight, you haven't been arrested recently. Not recently. Not recently, okay.

2634
04:15:50,760 --> 04:15:57,320
And so that will cause a lot of numbness. They're really aggravating. So we look for that.

2635
04:15:57,320 --> 04:16:01,640
And then the last one is the median nerve, which is here. This is the carpal tunnel. Now,

2636
04:16:01,640 --> 04:16:07,160
the most sensitive and specific test for carpal tunnel syndrome is just to put thumb pressure

2637
04:16:07,160 --> 04:16:11,960
directly over that transverse carpal ligament. I'm effectively doing what you're doing when you're

2638
04:16:11,960 --> 04:16:17,560
driving or maybe riding a cycling. I'm putting extra pressure. And you're going to tell me

2639
04:16:18,280 --> 04:16:24,040
if that causes numbness, tingling, pain sometimes, but mainly numbness and tingling

2640
04:16:24,040 --> 04:16:29,000
in the median nerve distribution, that thumb, index, middle, and half the ring finger. And if

2641
04:16:29,000 --> 04:16:33,960
it does, then that's golden. We know you have carpal tunnel syndrome. And then the others that

2642
04:16:33,960 --> 04:16:39,960
we look for are these tenile signs. I'll go along here and tap. And the nerve, if you have bad carpal

2643
04:16:39,960 --> 04:16:46,680
tunnel, that median nerve can be irritable as it's lying in between these muscle bellies. And so we

2644
04:16:46,680 --> 04:16:52,200
can tap along there and you get a tenile sign and it sends electrical shocks. That's the second

2645
04:16:52,200 --> 04:16:57,640
way we can test it. The third way is just to have you mimic what you would do and the

2646
04:16:57,640 --> 04:17:03,160
phalines test where you hold them down like that and that reproduces as well. The most one is the

2647
04:17:03,160 --> 04:17:07,240
most sensitive and specific as the one I already did, but those are other. And that's pretty much

2648
04:17:07,240 --> 04:17:13,880
it for the, oh, there's one other component is we always want to look, if you have winging of the

2649
04:17:13,880 --> 04:17:19,000
scapula, you can do a push up against the wall. We can see if one side sticks out and that's that

2650
04:17:19,000 --> 04:17:23,320
upper cervical nerve rate, the long thoracic nerve. And that's really about it.

2651
04:17:24,760 --> 04:17:29,000
So, Walton, the last thing I want to talk about, and we've been talking for quite a while, so I

2652
04:17:29,000 --> 04:17:32,520
really appreciate you making the time, is I want to talk about the Musician Treatment Foundation,

2653
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:40,680
which you founded almost six years ago. In fact, I feel like it's indirectly how we met

2654
04:17:41,320 --> 04:17:48,280
because one of the doctors who introduced me to you in New York City got to know you,

2655
04:17:48,280 --> 04:17:53,960
I think indirectly through your involvement with taking care of some of the best musicians in the

2656
04:17:53,960 --> 04:18:01,000
world. And that led to us meeting and such and such. And obviously I've been to some of the

2657
04:18:01,000 --> 04:18:06,600
concerts you've held. So, I mean, just tell folks a little bit about what is it about music that has

2658
04:18:06,680 --> 04:18:10,680
been such a passion. It seems to be as much a passion for you as orthopedic surgery.

2659
04:18:10,680 --> 04:18:15,000
Yeah, it is. And thank you for bringing it up. Thank you for wanting to talk a little bit about

2660
04:18:15,000 --> 04:18:23,880
it. I'm always happy to talk about it. I was lucky enough, we historically as orthopedic surgeons

2661
04:18:23,880 --> 04:18:28,760
treat a lot of athletes, but I was fortunate enough to start my practice in New York City.

2662
04:18:28,760 --> 04:18:33,320
And I was lucky enough to sort of inherit the caring of the New York Philharmonic and the

2663
04:18:33,320 --> 04:18:42,200
Metropolitan Opera orchestras, which are mainstays of that classical music echelon really. And then

2664
04:18:42,200 --> 04:18:48,120
that spilled over into Broadway, the musicians who are all manner of genres because there's so many

2665
04:18:48,120 --> 04:18:53,880
diverse shows there, and then the jazz musicians in rock and roll and so forth. So, yes, I've always

2666
04:18:53,880 --> 04:18:59,160
had a passion for music and love it. And to be able to take care of these is both very stressful

2667
04:18:59,160 --> 04:19:06,600
initially and also incredibly rewarding, right? And they are, they're like musicians and, I mean,

2668
04:19:06,600 --> 04:19:11,480
they're like athletes and that they're doing this day in and day out. It's their livelihood. And if

2669
04:19:11,480 --> 04:19:19,480
it's disrupted their way of being and then their, both their mental health and their financial health

2670
04:19:19,480 --> 04:19:25,400
is greatly jeopardized. And like athletes who give us so much entertainment in the world,

2671
04:19:25,400 --> 04:19:31,080
musicians speak the universal language of medicine, which obviously bypasses some of the

2672
04:19:31,080 --> 04:19:36,760
horrible political infighting that goes on. And it's just beautiful. Of music. And they give it

2673
04:19:36,760 --> 04:19:44,680
back to us. And so, but if you're not in the Philharmonic or not in the Metropolitan Opera orchestra

2674
04:19:44,680 --> 04:19:51,400
or in a long running show on Broadway, you're a freelance. And you're a freelance who doesn't

2675
04:19:51,480 --> 04:19:55,320
know when your next gig is going to happen and you can't afford insurance. And it's,

2676
04:19:56,120 --> 04:20:02,280
so I've, for my whole career, I've been taking care of freelance musicians and some of them

2677
04:20:02,280 --> 04:20:07,400
maybe have spouses or significant others who have insurance or some of them have, but many of them

2678
04:20:07,400 --> 04:20:15,080
don't, most of them don't frankly. And so I was always discounting my, my cost sometimes down to

2679
04:20:15,080 --> 04:20:22,520
nothing depending on who it was. And, or I'd take a chicken or a signed CD or something that they

2680
04:20:22,520 --> 04:20:29,400
would bring to me, some, some home baked cookies. And, but the costs are absolutely exorbitant for

2681
04:20:29,400 --> 04:20:33,560
healthcare. Right. Cause you can't waving your costs is one thing. You can't wave the anesthesia's

2682
04:20:33,560 --> 04:20:37,720
cost. You can't wave the Surgeon Center cost. Thank you. That's exactly right. And the average

2683
04:20:37,720 --> 04:20:44,040
cost for a rotator cuff repair is about currently just to, if you pay out of pocket, about the best

2684
04:20:44,120 --> 04:20:49,800
you can do through a surgery center, which is less cost on a hospital is about $25,000. Well,

2685
04:20:49,800 --> 04:20:56,920
the average income for a fully professional but freelance musician in Austin pre-COVID was

2686
04:20:56,920 --> 04:21:03,800
$16,000 a year. One six, one six. So they can't even think about it. So this was what was going

2687
04:21:03,800 --> 04:21:09,240
on for years. And it was always in my mind, always upsetting me. And that we, that as a culture,

2688
04:21:09,240 --> 04:21:14,760
we don't support the arts more. And I don't need to get political about that. It's not political.

2689
04:21:14,760 --> 04:21:24,040
It's just cultural. And so then I had my cousin Thor, who's a mainstay of the Austin music scene,

2690
04:21:24,040 --> 04:21:28,600
cut his digital nerve of his finger. He's a percussionist of course, cause his name is Thor.

2691
04:21:28,600 --> 04:21:34,200
And, and he couldn't play because it was so, he had such a neuroma that it formed and he didn't

2692
04:21:34,200 --> 04:21:38,920
have insurance. And he called me weeks after he had just had a simple closure. And he said,

2693
04:21:38,920 --> 04:21:44,520
I can't feel my finger and I can't play. And I said, well, you have, you have miles? And he said,

2694
04:21:44,520 --> 04:21:48,680
yeah, I've got plenty of miles cause I tour. And I said, we'll fly up to New York and we'll fix it.

2695
04:21:48,680 --> 04:21:54,120
So I, since I, um, know the surgery center and know the anesthesiologist, I said, look,

2696
04:21:54,120 --> 04:21:57,640
this is my cousin Thor. I need to, you know, I need you to throw him a bone. So they didn't

2697
04:21:57,640 --> 04:22:02,280
charge him. And of course I didn't either. And so fixed it. He was fine. He was my patient zero,

2698
04:22:02,280 --> 04:22:06,360
if you will. That was kind of your aha moment. That was the aha moment. And then I'm lucky enough,

2699
04:22:06,360 --> 04:22:11,640
as you said, to treat a lot of other musicians and know a lot of other musicians. So one day,

2700
04:22:11,640 --> 04:22:17,960
Elvis Costello and Diana Kral were in and, and I just kind of said, Hey, look, I'm thinking about

2701
04:22:17,960 --> 04:22:22,440
doing this officially. Uh, would you guys help me in some way? Anyway, I didn't care. Just put your

2702
04:22:22,440 --> 04:22:26,280
name on a website or something. They said, sure. What do you have in mind? I said, well, you could

2703
04:22:26,280 --> 04:22:31,880
just be an advisor or if I could just use your name, you're so well-loved and beloved. And they

2704
04:22:31,880 --> 04:22:36,600
said, well, let us be full, you know, full board members. And he said, my only stipulation is I

2705
04:22:36,600 --> 04:22:42,280
have to do all the boating because Diana's the busiest woman in show business. So, um, uh, so

2706
04:22:42,280 --> 04:22:50,760
I said, yes. And in 2017, we got, uh, IRS, uh, nonprofit status. And then Elvis said, I'm going

2707
04:22:50,760 --> 04:22:54,920
to do the first concert. I'll, I love the Paramount theater in Austin. Let's do it in Austin. I'll do

2708
04:22:54,920 --> 04:23:00,760
a two hour solo show. And we raised about a quarter of a million dollars with that. And that was our

2709
04:23:00,760 --> 04:23:07,800
seed money. And people came pouring in here in Austin. Ham is a big organization that does so

2710
04:23:07,800 --> 04:23:12,840
much as for so long, but it's the, you know, it's the health Alliance for Austin musicians,

2711
04:23:12,840 --> 04:23:18,280
but they don't provide the actual care. And they were struggling to get specialists to actually

2712
04:23:18,280 --> 04:23:23,240
discount their care or provide the care. And orthopedically speaking, having not having your

2713
04:23:23,240 --> 04:23:28,920
upper limb, your shoulder, elbow, or hand, you can't make music. Yeah. So just give us a brief

2714
04:23:28,920 --> 04:23:33,000
sense. Cause I know you and I have talked about this so much cause I'm so fascinated by this topic,

2715
04:23:33,000 --> 04:23:39,400
help people understand the physical demand of, you know, playing a violin or playing the drums.

2716
04:23:39,400 --> 04:23:42,920
I know you see my daughter plays the drums and get some sense of that, but, um,

2717
04:23:43,640 --> 04:23:49,400
a it's a very asymmetric activity, but what are the types of injuries that you're seeing

2718
04:23:49,400 --> 04:23:53,400
the high level musicians coming with that are a threat to their livelihood? Well,

2719
04:23:53,400 --> 04:23:57,240
one of the things I say, uh, I've lectured on this quite a bit as I say, you know,

2720
04:23:57,320 --> 04:24:02,920
musicians are people too. And so they do all the stupid things that we all do to injure ourselves.

2721
04:24:02,920 --> 04:24:07,560
That's a separate category. And those are injuries and they need to be treated though.

2722
04:24:07,560 --> 04:24:14,040
The unique aspect of that is that they can't necessarily take the same rest when they know.

2723
04:24:14,040 --> 04:24:19,320
And they have to be a hundred percent because if, if you're a violinist in the Philharmonic

2724
04:24:19,320 --> 04:24:25,720
and you are, there are 15 other highest level musicians waiting in the ranks,

2725
04:24:25,720 --> 04:24:29,400
waiting for you to screw up once a little shot and Freud there. They don't think ill of you,

2726
04:24:29,400 --> 04:24:34,200
but they would love to have the opportunity to sit in your seat, your chair on the, on the stage.

2727
04:24:34,200 --> 04:24:38,520
So there's all that tension, all that stress of having worked so hard and then having it.

2728
04:24:38,520 --> 04:24:43,880
And you have to be a hundred percent. You can't be, you can't, like I can do surgery with probably

2729
04:24:43,880 --> 04:24:51,080
three fingers, but you know, if you can't flex down your index finger or whatever, uh, on the,

2730
04:24:51,080 --> 04:24:57,800
on the, on the fret, then you can't make the music. So, uh, that's one aspect of it. And the other

2731
04:24:57,800 --> 04:25:04,440
aspect is that by comparison, they're not trying to jump higher, hit the ball farther, drive the

2732
04:25:04,440 --> 04:25:11,480
car faster. All the different ways that athletes like you are trying to maximize your output.

2733
04:25:11,480 --> 04:25:14,920
They are submaximal athletes, but they, but they have to be there.

2734
04:25:14,920 --> 04:25:21,720
So repetitious. Yeah. I mean, you think about how many, I think what there's in a, in a standard

2735
04:25:21,720 --> 04:25:30,040
NFL game, they're about 30 passes, 35 passes. Well in a typical one Mozart violin concerto.

2736
04:25:30,040 --> 04:25:39,640
It's 20,000 bow strokes in one playing of a, of a, of a huh. Concerto. And they do that repeatedly

2737
04:25:39,640 --> 04:25:44,600
over and over and over again. And to your point, yeah, it's a lot of these are very unnatural.

2738
04:25:45,560 --> 04:25:50,200
And we think about violinists, we think, oh, they're in their hands. Well, their shoulders,

2739
04:25:50,200 --> 04:25:56,120
they are adducted. They are externally rotated. Their other one is up in the impingement zone,

2740
04:25:56,120 --> 04:26:02,920
which we'll see from our exam. They're living eight hours a day doing this. That is terrible

2741
04:26:02,920 --> 04:26:07,160
for the shoulders. And then you think of the drummers, high hats, and every, which way they're

2742
04:26:07,160 --> 04:26:13,240
going and every, and going massively for three hours straight. It's just uncanny that they even

2743
04:26:13,240 --> 04:26:21,640
survive in my opinion. And so, so it's very, very different. I mean, I don't even know how many

2744
04:26:21,640 --> 04:26:26,440
passes Tom Brady has thrown in his career, but it's not that huge of a number. Right.

2745
04:26:26,440 --> 04:26:34,520
Relative to this. Right. And so, so anyway, so it, it, we, we were flooded with patients initially.

2746
04:26:34,520 --> 04:26:39,960
There was this backlog of patients who hadn't played for six months, nine months, and they were

2747
04:26:39,960 --> 04:26:45,400
just fallow. They were trying to get odd jobs. They weren't getting any gigs. They couldn't take

2748
04:26:45,400 --> 04:26:49,800
gigs. I had one patient, the very first patient who we've talked about. So I can mention her name,

2749
04:26:49,800 --> 04:26:55,080
Jennifer Jackson. She's a great singer songwriter in Austin and tours around. Did she play last year

2750
04:26:55,080 --> 04:27:01,240
at the concert? She did. Oh no, no, I'm sorry. She did not. She was on our, our, kind of our,

2751
04:27:01,240 --> 04:27:07,080
our movie about it. Okay. Got it. She had bilateral full thickness rotator cuff tears.

2752
04:27:07,880 --> 04:27:13,160
Bilateral. And she came in, she had already gone to try to see somebody. It was going to cost her

2753
04:27:13,160 --> 04:27:19,800
$10,000 or more. She had some very minimal insurance. And I said, look, you need, we need

2754
04:27:19,800 --> 04:27:24,440
to fix these. Let's do it. Get you back. And she goes, well, how much is it going to cost me? I said,

2755
04:27:24,440 --> 04:27:28,840
it's not going to cost you anything. And she just start crying. So now it's not going to cost you

2756
04:27:28,840 --> 04:27:35,000
anything. So we've in, in the five years, almost now coming up, well, yeah, uh, five plus years,

2757
04:27:35,000 --> 04:27:41,160
we've provided over $2 million in free care to under an uninsured professional. And how many,

2758
04:27:41,160 --> 04:27:48,040
how many musicians have had surgery? Oh, we've had probably I've done, um, four dozen, probably four

2759
04:27:48,040 --> 04:27:53,720
dozen, uh, around, around 50, um, musicians. And that doesn't include the ones that I've been

2760
04:27:53,720 --> 04:27:57,320
discounting that these are the ones that we've actually funneled through the, through. Yeah.

2761
04:27:57,320 --> 04:28:02,920
But we've got hundreds of non-operative because a non-operative is just as bad. I mean, right. So

2762
04:28:02,920 --> 04:28:06,600
if you can get a cortisone shot in there and get them totally better. Yeah. So we have hundreds

2763
04:28:06,600 --> 04:28:13,560
more of that. And, um, you know, it's, it's, it's been mind boggling. And the cool thing,

2764
04:28:13,560 --> 04:28:18,680
we have an upcoming concert in December with Elvis, with Roseanne Cash, John Levin,

2765
04:28:18,680 --> 04:28:27,560
fall Jason Isbell, a bunch of great people. Um, the, um, the cool thing about our, our,

2766
04:28:27,640 --> 04:28:35,960
our situation is that I've now been able to recruit over 60 colleagues who I know I trust.

2767
04:28:35,960 --> 04:28:40,520
They have the same ethic. They want to give back who are shoulder, elbow, and hand surgeons at the

2768
04:28:40,520 --> 04:28:45,720
best places around the country. We're going to have, we're launching that in December. It's called

2769
04:28:45,720 --> 04:28:51,240
the P4M, the Physicians for Musicians Network. They're going to do be doing so far. I've provided

2770
04:28:51,240 --> 04:28:56,280
all the care and now they're going to be helping provide care. So now really, we just need more

2771
04:28:56,280 --> 04:29:02,520
dollars coming in to help cover the other costs. Cause so basically you're always getting the

2772
04:29:02,520 --> 04:29:08,360
physicians to waive their fee. You now need to be able to basically use the nonprofit resources to

2773
04:29:08,360 --> 04:29:11,960
fund the surge of centers and anesthesia fees. And actually, I'm sure you're getting some

2774
04:29:11,960 --> 04:29:17,240
anesthesiologists who are musicians as well. We've been unsuccessful in that. It's ironic and

2775
04:29:17,240 --> 04:29:21,480
a little embittering for me, but I know we will be able to, once I'm hoping that people listening to

2776
04:29:21,480 --> 04:29:25,800
this who are anesthesiologists, someone's going to be like, wait a minute. I need to find fellow

2777
04:29:26,360 --> 04:29:29,320
anesthesiologists and we can start to pair those services.

2778
04:29:30,440 --> 04:29:37,960
And, and nice thing is that most surgeons, including myself, have some either participation

2779
04:29:37,960 --> 04:29:43,480
or partial ownership of a surgery center. So I happened to have built one here in Austin

2780
04:29:43,480 --> 04:29:48,920
and we provide that at one, I think it's one 10th of Medicare. So it's basically nothing.

2781
04:29:48,920 --> 04:29:54,760
It's our biggest cost by far as the anesthesia. Yeah. What's your vision for how big this can

2782
04:29:54,760 --> 04:30:00,200
get and what has to get there? I mean, so you have the big fundraiser every year, which is a

2783
04:30:00,200 --> 04:30:06,280
huge concert, gala, amazing. Each year it seems to be getting more and more incredible. What type

2784
04:30:06,280 --> 04:30:11,960
of fundraising goes on outside of that per year? It's actually been, I'm kind of a one man

2785
04:30:11,960 --> 04:30:16,280
fundraising machine because of all my generous patients, especially in New York and in Austin

2786
04:30:16,280 --> 04:30:20,520
too. And I tell everybody, I can't scream it from the mountaintops, but we're starting to get some

2787
04:30:21,080 --> 04:30:25,960
some grants, some grants were applying for grants, which is great. But anybody who knows

2788
04:30:25,960 --> 04:30:31,560
any organizations that provide community, you know, grants and so forth, we are right in the

2789
04:30:31,560 --> 04:30:37,080
thick of communities because it keeps, holds communities together. It develops relationships

2790
04:30:37,080 --> 04:30:42,840
that weren't there before and it's all ages, right? It's just. So this is a huge deal this year,

2791
04:30:42,840 --> 04:30:47,320
Alton is that you've now recruited other doctors because the scalability of this was limited when

2792
04:30:47,320 --> 04:30:52,840
you were the only surgeon. Exactly. But now that you've got how many more surgeons? We have over 60

2793
04:30:52,840 --> 04:30:58,040
signed on now. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. So that's going to be a game changer. That's an amazing success.

2794
04:30:58,040 --> 04:31:05,160
And my idea, and they all have their own pods of, I mean, I treat more musicians and maybe anybody,

2795
04:31:05,160 --> 04:31:11,720
but in what I do, but they all treat some and they can access those. They can access donors in the

2796
04:31:11,720 --> 04:31:16,200
different towns. We have Seattle, we have LA, we have Nashville, we have New York, of course,

2797
04:31:16,200 --> 04:31:22,440
Chicago, New Orleans, the list goes on and on. And so yeah, when we can access that,

2798
04:31:23,960 --> 04:31:29,400
it will build the support, I think, significantly. Well, Alton, I could sit here and talk for about

2799
04:31:29,400 --> 04:31:34,440
another two hours, but I know you have a flight to catch to New York. It's probably apparent to

2800
04:31:34,440 --> 04:31:39,480
people listening to this, but you practice bicostally. Yes. So you, you, or not bicostally

2801
04:31:39,480 --> 04:31:45,800
rather, but you practice in two cities. So you're, you're Monday, Friday, you see clinic and you see

2802
04:31:45,880 --> 04:31:49,960
patients in clinic and operate in Austin. And then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you're in

2803
04:31:49,960 --> 04:31:53,640
New York city and you do this over and over and over again. I've had the privilege of seeing you

2804
04:31:53,640 --> 04:31:57,480
in both cities. I've had the privilege of sending patients to you in both cities. I don't know how

2805
04:31:57,480 --> 04:32:03,960
you do it. I used to do that and I can't do it anymore, but I'm so grateful for this discussion.

2806
04:32:03,960 --> 04:32:07,080
I think a lot of people are going to help from it. And obviously I'm so grateful for you personally

2807
04:32:07,080 --> 04:32:11,320
for the help in my life and obviously that of my patients. So thank you. Yeah. The gratitude is

2808
04:32:11,320 --> 04:32:17,480
likewise. Actually, I just want to give you a shout out. You at some point in one of our many

2809
04:32:17,480 --> 04:32:23,000
meetings, you said, you know, you mentioned rucking and I, you know, I didn't really know

2810
04:32:23,000 --> 04:32:28,360
that much about it, but you gave me the link. I bought it. I'm only carrying 35 pounds. That's

2811
04:32:28,360 --> 04:32:33,960
awesome. But I've been actually run rucking because I love running. I've always run. It has

2812
04:32:33,960 --> 04:32:39,960
changed my body in, in I've, I've only been doing it about three months and I only get to do it two

2813
04:32:39,960 --> 04:32:44,840
or three times a week. It's changed my body. I feel so much lighter, so much stronger and better.

2814
04:32:44,840 --> 04:32:50,520
And although I'm pretty old, I feel great and it, I commend you and I thank you because it's been a

2815
04:32:50,520 --> 04:32:55,080
game changer for me. Yeah. I'm the rucking evangelist. Well, thank you very much all. And this was

2816
04:32:55,080 --> 04:33:06,680
fantastic. Great. Thanks.
