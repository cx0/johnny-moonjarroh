00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Hi, everybody.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to today's episode of The Drive.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,360
My guest today is my good friend Navdeep, or Nav as we like to call him, Chandel.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,600
Nav is a professor of medicine and cell and molecular biology at Northwestern in Chicago,

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,400
which is where I actually met him to do this interview.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,000
Some of you may recall that name because Nav is one of the cast of characters that I went

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,040
to Easter Island with in the fall of 2016, the other being David Sabatini and Tim Ferriss.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,160
And we actually spoke about this stuff at length on a podcast that Tim recorded while

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,960
we were on Easter Island.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,240
Nav's real area of expertise is in the mitochondria and in metabolism.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,520
And in fact, he wrote a book called Navigating Metabolism, no pun intended, in 2015, which

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,000
I highly recommend for anybody, especially people who A, want to understand this stuff

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,960
and B, don't want to have to buy 17 textbooks and get into every unearthly detail.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,280
In fact, this book was written more for a general audience than a very specific audience.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,420
And I have a copy of it and love it.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,200
In this episode, we talk about a bunch of stuff, but we talk about what got Nav interested

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,360
in the mitochondria.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,060
We get into Ross or reactive oxygen species, something that I think many of you will have

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
heard of.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,020
And then we talk about some really nuanced stuff like this stuff about mitochondria being

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,660
actual signaling organelles and Ross maybe being beneficial for that signaling.

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,260
In other words, we get into this idea that reactive oxygen species may not be all bad.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,060
It might not be a black white thing, which anyone who listened to this podcast realized

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,540
we love to explore things that aren't just binary.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,660
We talk about antioxidants and whether they're harmful or not harmful.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,080
And I suspect that a lot of people will have a point of view on that.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,480
And we get into mitochondrial DNA, which in and of itself is super interesting because

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,640
some of you may already know this.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
And if you don't, that's fine.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
You'll learn it on this episode.

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,660
But the mitochondria have their own DNA distinct from the cell.

43
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,420
And that DNA is of bacterial origin.

44
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,920
It's also transmitted to us maternally.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,160
So there's a whole bunch of weird stuff going on genetically with the mitochondria that

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,280
makes it super interesting.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,800
We get into a little bit of a discussion around cortisol.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,560
Nav is super interested in the role of cortisol in health.

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
And then we talk, of course, about metformin.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,960
And I suspect that for some people listening to this, that's the only thing they're going

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,380
to care about because these days everybody's asking me about metformin, which means it's

52
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,440
front and center on a lot of people's minds with respect to longevity.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,160
Now we don't even go as deep as we could on metformin.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm saving that for another guest that's in the queue who I'm not going to even say too

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,600
much about that, but there's a lot more coming on metformin.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,880
This however, will be a great primer for that because you'll certainly understand how metformin

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,360
works and how it may play a role in longevity.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,720
We talk about the role of the mitochondria in cancer.

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,720
And again, we take a different view here from what you will have heard from other guests

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
potentially.

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,560
We talk about NAD and NAD precursors.

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,520
And that again is another thing that people I think are pretty excited about.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,960
At the end, somehow Nav jiu-jitsu's me and turns the tables on me and asks me the, so

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,960
what should I eat question, which anybody who knows me knows.

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,160
I can't stand being asked that question, but because it's Nav, I humored him a little

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
bit.

67
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,360
Before we jump into that, please keep in mind we have an email list every Sunday morning

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,320
I send out an email and that email has a whole bunch of stuff in it.

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,920
It's usually pretty short though, but it's basically something I've read that's interesting

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,240
that pertains to longevity, science, lipidology, performance, or just something that really

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,720
interests me beyond those things.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Keep in mind we put, I would say an ungodly amount of effort into preparing show notes.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,000
And when I say we, I'm using that term very liberally.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,160
I actually do none of that, but I have a team that does that and that is spearheaded by

75
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
Travis and Bob.

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,960
So the people who do spend time on those show notes always come back to us with feedback

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,520
like this is freaking awesome.

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,760
Please keep doing this.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,540
And our intention is to keep doing that.

80
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,260
So give us a reason to keep doing that by going and checking them out, especially when

81
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,660
it comes to understanding some of the technical stuff that we talk about here and getting

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,340
some of the references.

83
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,820
And lastly, if you are digging this podcast, please head over to Apple podcast reviews

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,300
and leave us a review, especially if it's positive, but if it's negative, at least have

85
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,220
the courtesy to give us some constructive feedback so we can improve upon whatever it

86
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,640
is you don't like.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,340
So without anything further to add, please welcome Nav Chandale.

88
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,900
Hey Nav, good to see you again, man.

89
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Great to see you Peter.

90
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,580
The last time I saw you, me, you and David Sabatini were hanging out near the airport

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,340
in San Diego playing patty cakes.

92
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,020
You guys were drinking some really lame stuff.

93
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Oh, Rosé's.

94
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
Rosé.

95
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,620
I like sparkling stuff.

96
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,040
So what got you interested in mitochondria?

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,500
So when I was in college, I was a math major.

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I loved math, right?

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,460
I probably did math because as an immigrant, you moved from the Himalayas to Miami, got

100
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
a funny accent.

101
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,460
Math.

102
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,900
He's a universal language, right?

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,260
So I became a math geek, but everybody's got to make a living.

104
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,760
And so I worked in a laboratory, which was in a hospital and it was a transplant laboratory.

105
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,220
And the biggest thing in transplant is how do you preserve organs?

106
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
I mean, you have an MD, I don't have an MD.

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,980
I think that's a fair statement.

108
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,560
And there's this Wisconsin solution that was used to...

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,020
We used it liberally.

110
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,860
And so I wanted to make a better version of it as a 19 year old.

111
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,020
And if you've got to do that, then you've got to think about metabolism.

112
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,880
The first set of experiments we did, and I went to a FASIP meeting and it's called three

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,060
phosphoglycerate protects against anoxia injury of hepatocytes.

114
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,900
Anoxia is low oxygen, the absence of oxygen.

115
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,520
And then that got me interested in metabolism.

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,340
If you're a mathematician and you start working metabolism and eventually like mitochondria,

117
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,380
it's electrons, it's enzyme kinetics, right?

118
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,380
There's math.

119
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,640
And in fact, my PhD is on enzyme kinetics.

120
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,460
And so I'm doing a PhD on an enzyme that's very critical for respiration.

121
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:54,040
So like the enzyme that uses oxygen in every cell is what I did my PhD on and how that

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,020
enzyme works under different oxygen levels.

123
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,780
Again, lots of math.

124
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,180
And then Michaelis-Menten, but much more sophisticated enzyme kinetics.

125
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:12,300
And then after that, the thing that was probably the most influential discovery in the mitochondria

126
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,980
field for me, and I still think this is one of the three greatest discoveries in the mitochondria

127
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,860
field, of course, it'll be contentious because lots of people might take issue with it.

128
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,660
So the first one is Hans Krebs in the TCA cycle in 37.

129
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,040
There's the 60 paper by Peter Mitchell, how you make ATP.

130
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,900
So those are the two big things, right?

131
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,380
C, bioenergetics and biosynthesis, because the Krebs cycle eventually makes carbon molecules,

132
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,740
which are the backbone for lipids, nucleotides, amino acids.

133
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,780
The third big experiment came out in 1996.

134
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:52,860
So Xiaodong Wang, when he was at Emory, found that the protein that I used every single

135
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,300
day to do enzyme kinetics.

136
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,500
So I worked on cytochrome C oxidase.

137
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,980
That's an enzyme.

138
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,620
Everybody tells you cytochrome C oxidase means that it uses cytochrome C as a substrate.

139
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,560
Let's take a step back for someone who's going to be listening to this who doesn't know everything

140
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
about it.

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,620
Before we get to Wang's experiment, tell us who Hans Krebs, what he did, what the TCA

142
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
is.

143
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,360
A lot of people will think, I kind of remember this from high school biology, but give me

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,820
a quick refresher course.

145
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
So I'll prime you a little bit for it.

146
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
A cell brings glucose in just to make it easy.

147
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,960
It turns glucose through a number of steps, enzymatic steps, into two smaller three carbon

148
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,180
units called pyruvate.

149
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,460
Assuming the demand for ATP is not extraordinary and there's sufficient cellular oxygen, what

150
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,740
would be the most efficient way to get energy out of that?

151
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,580
Pyruvate has two choices.

152
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,500
It can either become lactate, and usually that happens when there's not enough oxygen.

153
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
All right.

154
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,300
The other thing I always like to say to people, and or when the demand for ATP is exceptional.

155
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,860
But the other place where it really goes is pyruvate goes into what's called the TCA cycle.

156
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,380
And it's really a cycle.

157
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,940
So where glycolysis is a series of linear steps, A, B, C, D, E, then you get to pyruvate,

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,860
and pyruvate actually goes in a circular fashion.

159
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,180
And this occurs in a part of the cell called the cytoplasm.

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,700
The glycolysis part does, but the TCA happens in the mitochondria.

161
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Which we're going to get to.

162
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,620
So pyruvate to lactate is all in the cytoplasm, but pyruvate then gets imported through a

163
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,100
pyruvate mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.

164
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,460
And that's important because it could be a target therapeutically in certain diseases.

165
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,980
I think most of us appreciate, and this is what you're getting to while you're focusing

166
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,300
on pyruvate, pyruvate has two choices.

167
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,160
Go to lactate or the mitochondria.

168
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,580
So clearly, the pyruvate to lactate is cytoplasm.

169
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,280
It going into the mitochondria and eventually becoming acetyl-CoA, that's an important reaction.

170
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,820
So where pyruvate goes and how it gets in and out is quite important.

171
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,060
And discovery of that transporter gives you a way to maybe target that.

172
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,180
So now pyruvate's in the mitochondria.

173
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,900
It's in the mitochondria.

174
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,260
And then it's a three carbon, and it becomes acetyl-CoA.

175
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,580
Acetyl-CoA is very important, and we can get into it later.

176
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,920
Because acetyl-CoA can acetylate.

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,080
To acetylate, the eight means you put it on, basically.

178
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
Ace is an enzyme.

179
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,880
It's the end of an enzyme.

180
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,840
Take it off.

181
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,640
And then it goes to the TCA cycle.

182
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,800
Which stands for?

183
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,120
So some people call it the Krebs cycle because Hans Krebs discoveries, I'm going to try carboxylic

184
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
acid cycle.

185
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Some people call it the citric acid cycle.

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,220
So we'll use those interchangeably.

187
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:47,140
And so the TCA cycle, as it's going in the mitochondria, it generates NADH and FADH.

188
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,940
These are these reducing equivalents which then feed electrons to the electron transport

189
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,940
chain.

190
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,780
And the electron transport chain can pump protons, which is basically like a battery,

191
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,880
to generate ATP, which is the currency that makes cellular functions work.

192
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,440
So the way I like to explain this to people, because I think it's such, it's just so damn

193
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,480
elegant.

194
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,240
You look at a piece of food, and all you see is this potential energy.

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,360
You see, and of course, within all the bonds that exist in food, which is where we get

196
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,840
our energy from, you have carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-hydrogen bonds, carbon-nitrogen bonds,

197
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
carbon-oxygen, nitrogen-oxygen.

198
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,200
I mean, there's only a finite number of covalent bonds that exist.

199
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,800
But the two most energy dense, I think, are carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen, correct?

200
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,560
Isn't that where the majority of the chemical energy is liberated?

201
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,760
Those electrons have to eventually be accepted by something, right?

202
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,000
And oxygen is the final acceptor of all of those.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,240
So in some sense, the whole purpose of eating is to take a potential energy that is in a

204
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,960
chemical form, turn it into an electrical potential energy inside the mitochondria,

205
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,800
and then eventually pull a little jiu-jitsu and turn that back into a chemical electrical

206
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,120
energy via the conversion of ADP to ATP.

207
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,640
I mean, to me, that's the simplest way to explain this.

208
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,880
It's just like a battery, right?

209
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Yeah.

210
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
It's kind of amazing that we exist.

211
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,440
Well, that's why they call it a power plant.

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,560
What is the, you know, in the public domain, what do people call mitochondria?

213
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,120
The power plant of the cell.

214
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,000
Power house, power plant, right?

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,360
And for exactly the elegant explanation you just gave.

216
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,720
So we're already talking about the dogma, right?

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,360
Which is, it's all about ATP.

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,720
So if you asked in 1996, what is the major function of mitochondria?

219
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Make ATP.

220
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
That's it.

221
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,320
And for good reason, because let's call us bade to spade.

222
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,440
As we know, if you interrupt that cycle for even moments, it's uniformly fatal.

223
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Most people are familiar with a toxin called cyanide.

224
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Cyanide is fatal at incredibly low concentration.

225
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,280
There are only a handful of toxins that are more potent, more lethal at lower concentrations.

226
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,960
And they all tend to, you know, like the trytotoxin, I think, blocks a sodium channel transporter.

227
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,800
It might be even more lethal.

228
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,520
But why cyanide is so lethal is it disrupts that process you just described.

229
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Indeed.

230
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,520
But it's not clear which organ fails right away.

231
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,960
So we'll get into that in a second.

232
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,360
The genetic experiments don't totally confirm that idea.

233
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Interesting.

234
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
I'd like to hear more about this.

235
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,840
Let's get into that in a little bit.

236
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,200
So in 1996, if you ask that question, it's all about ATP.

237
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,680
And so there is this protein, cytochrome C, that's part of this energy generating system,

238
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,560
which is ATP.

239
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,880
And Xiaodong Wang and colleagues found that if that protein gets released from mitochondria

240
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:57,380
into the cytoplasm, which had never been detected before, it can rapidly kill a cell.

241
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:04,660
So now the decision for life and death is based on the localization of cytochrome C

242
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,820
between the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm.

243
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,420
So if it's in the mitochondria, it helps you generate ATP.

244
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,340
If it's out, it kills you.

245
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,700
And I assume it only escapes when the mitochondria is under the most intense duress and destruction.

246
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:29,180
So when a cell is under some sort of toxin stress, could be low oxygen, complete absence

247
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,420
of oxygen, could be a growth factor, which is telling the cell to live, is not present,

248
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
death by neglect.

249
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
Let's call it that.

250
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,380
When the cell is being neglected, either by nutrition, starvation, complete depletion

251
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,940
of nutrients or complete depletion of growth factors that keep them happy, the positive

252
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,260
signals then cytochrome C gets released.

253
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,780
But it's a very profound discovery because this is a protein that we were all convinced

254
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,100
had only one role.

255
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,980
We call it the day job now, make ATV.

256
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,860
It's got a moonlighting job that sometimes it leaves the mitochondria and doesn't make

257
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,620
ATP and bam, it starts a cascade, which is called apoptosis cell death.

258
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,700
I was just about to say, is this part of a programmed cell death as apoptosis?

259
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,340
This is programmed cell death.

260
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,580
So here I am in 1996, I'm 26 years old, very happy doing enzyme kinetics, bioenergetics,

261
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:32,540
and I see this finding and all of a sudden I stopped caring about ATP because in part,

262
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,460
a lot of that how it works was more or less discovered.

263
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,060
I didn't have the insight, because obviously why would I be still working on it?

264
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,000
I still thought there was more to be discovered, but the reality was I was probably just cleaning

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,200
up little side things in that field at best.

266
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,600
That's not hopefully to disparage the bioenergetics field, but there's still some important questions

267
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,640
there, more at a structural level and there's some beautiful work there.

268
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,480
But what I was doing was-

269
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,960
The kinetics had been worked out now.

270
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,840
Some of it had been and not, but this was great because this connected the mitochondria,

271
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,760
just not for energy and what the mitochondria does almost in a cell, like in an autonomous

272
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
way.

273
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,840
But this says it starts to control cell biology and function, like the decision of life and

274
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
death.

275
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,680
So obviously, the first thing we think about is it can't be selected just for death, right?

276
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,760
It must be doing something interesting.

277
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,600
So let's think about what else it might release.

278
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,720
And one of the first things that we thought about, which is something that people had

279
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,560
noticed for almost 40, 50 years before, they release superoxide and hydrogen peroxide,

280
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,360
reactive oxygen species, oxidants, free radicals.

281
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:55,560
And most people in the mid-90s assumed that mitochondria only released this so-called

282
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:04,280
cleaning molecule, a toxic molecule, when the mitochondria is damaged, maybe in neurodegeneration,

283
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,840
maybe in aging, we'll get into this, maybe when a heart failure, when there's low oxygen

284
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
ischemia.

285
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,480
So in other words, is there almost as a way that the mitochondria, when it's not working

286
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,640
well, it just spills out.

287
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,400
Because mitochondria has all these electrons and they have to, they're not working, those

288
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
electrons just spill into superoxide and eventually to hydrogen peroxide.

289
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,560
And what we thought about is, well, maybe nature could have used that as a signaling

290
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
molecule.

291
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,080
In other words, to dictate cellular function.

292
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
And so there were some papers just right as we were working that came out and it showed,

293
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,840
in fact, H2O2 could be a signaling molecule, but they didn't think it was necessarily mitochondria.

294
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,880
So there's a neat little story that there's another system in the cytoplasm that can generate

295
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,280
H2O2 and they thought that's all about signaling.

296
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Signaling basically means it's making decisions in the cell to die, to live, to proliferate,

297
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,520
to grow, if you're an immune cell, to make cytokines, to do inflammation.

298
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,400
But the mitochondria only did it when it's not working and it's spilling all these electrons

299
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
into hydrogen peroxide and it's causing damage.

300
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,080
And we actually showed that, in fact, under physiological conditions, you can make hydrogen

301
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,400
peroxide, which has a beneficial effect.

302
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,240
And so from that point on, the first paper was published in 98, now almost 20 years,

303
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,320
there's my group and lots of other people continue to show that mitochondrial generation

304
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,360
of this cleaning molecule can actually cause cellular functions to happen.

305
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,040
For example, we've shown our T cells, which are part of the adaptive immune system, right?

306
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,160
They fight off pathogens, right?

307
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,480
Or innate immune cells as well, just immunity in general, right?

308
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:06,280
They fight off viral infections, bacterial infections, that H2O2 is used by those immune

309
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,240
cells to properly function.

310
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
And what's the profound implication?

311
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,560
Which is what you're going to get into is antioxidants.

312
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Are they beneficial?

313
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,080
Are they harmful?

314
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,880
So already to the audience, it should be obvious, if I'm saying that something you think is

315
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,920
a cleaning molecule only, then antioxidants are great.

316
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,360
You're getting rid of this toxic molecule, cleaning molecule.

317
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
You're getting rid of this bad stuff.

318
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,280
But if it's also there for good purposes, like immune function.

319
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,320
Paradoxically could be bad to have an antioxidant in your system at a time when you need enhanced,

320
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,800
especially adaptive immunity.

321
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,120
And so one of the clinical trials that came out was in the ICU sepsis, that's the big

322
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,600
disease, which is basically on a simplistic level, tons of inflammation.

323
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,640
And those trials failed.

324
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,840
They made them worse, antioxidant trials.

325
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,600
In cancer, again, in lung cancer, vitamin E trial, it didn't have a curative effect.

326
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah.

327
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,480
Do you think it's overly simplistic to say that there ought to be a balance in the body

328
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
between pro-oxidative and anti-oxidative stress?

329
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,740
And it's never the case that one is absolutely good or absolutely bad.

330
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,560
It depends on the state of the organism.

331
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,960
So under perhaps a normal state, a more anti-oxidative, i.e., let's reduce the ROS is the right thing

332
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
to do.

333
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,760
And that's to your point, when the immune system is required to take the front step,

334
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,620
cancer and sepsis being two enormous examples, that having too much antioxidant property

335
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,640
can actually be harmful.

336
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,240
And that's a moment when you actually want to be able to inhibit that process.

337
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,800
So one of the interesting antioxidant trials, now again, caveat in this experiment I'm going

338
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,720
to tell you is an exercise experiment.

339
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,840
So we all agree that if you do vigorous exercise, it has benefits.

340
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,640
And you can take a biopsy and look at all the genes that exercise turns on.

341
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,560
And these are genes we think are beneficial to the host, to the rest of the body.

342
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,960
If you give high doses of antioxidants, so that's the caveat, it's high doses, probably

343
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,960
not the doses that most people use, it actually turns off that beneficial response.

344
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,640
So in other words, to your point, I think what you're making is that when the system

345
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,520
is stressed and the mitochondria integrates that stress, how does it pass that information

346
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,280
back to the cell?

347
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,600
We think that perhaps it releases hydrogen peroxide.

348
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,680
So clearly exercise is a good example, right?

349
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,920
That's a stress to the system, to your muscle.

350
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,080
And how does that muscle then turn on all these genes and blah, blah, blah?

351
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,400
We think it does it perhaps by releasing hydrogen peroxide.

352
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,920
Prior to this insight, Nav, is it the case that people knew the mitochondria was signaling,

353
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,120
but assumed there was a different molecule that was used to transmit the message, or

354
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,440
the people didn't actually think the mitochondria were playing any role in signaling and we're

355
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,280
still back in the ATP only paradigm?

356
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,720
They did think about signaling only in the context of pathology.

357
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,840
So in other words, so there are these childhood diseases like Lee's syndrome where there's

358
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,840
a mitochondrial mutation in a particular protein and there's a devastating disease,

359
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
the kids don't live that long.

360
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,920
And it's clearly that's a mitochondrial mutation and a protein that gets mutated, doesn't function

361
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,760
properly in the mitochondria and you get a childhood disease.

362
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
So how does that work?

363
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,880
So people say, well, probably ATP or maybe too much ROS.

364
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,040
So in that context, there was some idea of signaling, right?

365
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,640
But this is saying under physiological conditions.

366
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,800
This is not pathology, it's physiologic.

367
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,440
When you get a pathogen, in other words, when you get a virus or bacteria, that happens.

368
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,820
You get a cold, your immune system has to be activated.

369
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,600
That's not pathology, that's a good normal response.

370
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,520
So under all those conditions, the mitochondria is playing a signaling role.

371
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,680
And so I've coined this term, so there's the mitochondria as powerhouses.

372
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,640
So my talks never talk about that.

373
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,880
The title of every talk I give all around the world is the same.

374
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,800
Not very original anymore, mitochondria as signaling organelles.

375
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,920
And H2O2 is one way, cytochrome C is another way, right?

376
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,320
That's probably maybe the most original because that's for cell DAT.

377
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,840
By the way, 22 years later, do we still think that that work out of Emory is what has been

378
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,800
added to that body of knowledge about the role of in apoptosis and program cell DAT?

379
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,280
They know the whole pathway.

380
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,240
But it is still coming from the single enzyme?

381
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Wow.

383
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,120
There are these proteins called BACs and BAC that make these pores in the mitochondria

384
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,560
and it releases this 13 kilodalton protein.

385
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,400
It just releases that protein right out and then it binds to a whole bunch of other proteins,

386
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,120
apath1 and caspase-9 and starts this proteolytic pathway which eventually causes cell DAT.

387
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
So they've worked out all the biochemistry.

388
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,960
But the main point remains?

389
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Conceptually, yes.

390
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Wow.

391
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,400
You don't get that all the time in biology that 22 years later the punchline is still

392
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
the same.

393
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
The punchline is the same.

394
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,560
I mean, there's a lot of details that I have to say, but conceptually, yeah.

395
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,960
Are there other ways, by the way, that cells can undergo apoptosis?

396
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Oh, yeah.

397
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,760
Now there's a whole industry.

398
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,640
Every day there's a new version of it.

399
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,120
And in fact, we can talk about one new one which I'm very excited about.

400
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:44,440
So clearly, we can show that H2O2 in many contexts will signal for positive responses,

401
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,320
immune functions as we just talked about, the exercise response.

402
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,080
But clearly, there must be cases where H2O2 or other reactive oxygen species cause cell

403
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
DAT.

404
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,800
How does that work?

405
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,200
And there is a new form of cell DAT that was just discovered by Brent Stockwell and Scott

406
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,480
Dixon at Columbia in 2011 or so, 2011.

407
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,960
And it's called ferroptosis.

408
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,280
And it's basically taking H2O2.

409
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,960
If there's free iron, you can make a hydroxyl radical, an OH.

410
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,680
And that will then make a lipid hydroperoxide.

411
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:29,480
So if you have polyunsaturated fatty acids, it will basically make it into a lipid hydroperoxide

412
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,720
which can be very toxic.

413
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,880
So the bottom line is there are times where hydrogen peroxide with iron and lipids, the

414
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,880
three can come together and make something called a lipid hydroperoxide which will cause

415
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,660
cell DAT in ferroptosis.

416
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,400
The good thing is your body is full of an enzyme called GPX4 that gets rid of it all

417
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
the time.

418
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,600
Now, if you don't have that enzyme, you're in big trouble.

419
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,280
So there are places where clearly H2O2 is positive and it can become very lethal by

420
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,000
making another form of reactive oxygen species.

421
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,720
But again, nature has selected, I can't count all of them, but at least 30 enzymes which

422
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,200
are constantly mopping up these reactive oxygen species, keeping them quite low so you don't

423
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
get to those toxic levels.

424
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,800
So when we go back to apoptosis, which I didn't think we were going to even talk about this,

425
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,200
but it's so great to be able to bring it up because I think for many people that they're

426
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
still probably thinking, what are we talking about apoptosis?

427
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,840
So if a cell undergoes a genetic mutation, nuclear genetic, we'll come back to mitochondrial

428
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,580
genes later, but if a cell undergoes a genetic mutation in the nucleus that's unrecoverable,

429
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,000
it will on a good day kill itself.

430
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It will commit suicide.

431
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,520
I mean, that would be one of the things that would drive apoptosis.

432
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,320
You're getting to tumor suppression mechanisms.

433
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Yes, exactly.

434
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,520
That's where I'm going.

435
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:55,920
Do we know if this mechanism you just described of apoptosis plays a role in the type of cancer

436
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,240
apoptosis that we want to see?

437
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,400
And if so, the implication is the nuclear genome must be communicating with the mitochondria.

438
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,480
Yes.

439
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,040
So there is a drug that targets that Abbott made, a good friend of mine, Steve Fesek,

440
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,280
was involved in it, who's now at Vanderbilt.

441
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,400
And so in the 90s, they figured out the structure of a particular protein that controls cytochrome

442
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
C release.

443
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:30,320
And so they've made a drug against that protein, and specifically in cancer, to make the cancer

444
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,080
cells sensitive to chemotherapy, basically.

445
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Right?

446
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,040
So what do cancer cells love to do?

447
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,480
They upregulate anti-epoptotic proteins, right?

448
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
So what does that mean?

449
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,880
It means they turn on a whole program, which is basically an anti-death program.

450
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Right.

451
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,080
Protects them from everything you just described.

452
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Yeah.

453
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
This release of cytochrome C and all of that stuff.

454
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,360
And so one idea is why don't we target those anti-epoptotic proteins, these anti-death

455
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
proteins?

456
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,280
And it's because if we can target them and prevent them from functioning, then when we

457
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,840
give them chemotherapy, now the cells will die a lot quicker.

458
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,400
The problem with chemotherapy is all these anti-death proteins are there.

459
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,120
So a normal cell, like, you know, so doxyarubin is a good case.

460
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,200
A normal cell being a heart gets toxicity at the same time you're trying to kill the

461
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
cancer cell.

462
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,360
So it's not selective.

463
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,640
It's not selective, right?

464
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:29,480
And so people have been targeting these anti-epoptotic proteins in cancer as a mechanism to make

465
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,040
chemotherapy more effective.

466
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Yeah.

467
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,960
So this mechanism we were talking from 1996, anything we would get into this, but it's

468
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
been a long time.

469
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,280
This is my previous life.

470
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,840
I haven't thought about this in a long time.

471
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,760
But yeah, it still applies and it's very important for cancer.

472
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,920
So while we're still going on history, I just alluded to something a moment ago that I think

473
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,880
is an important point for the listener to understand, which is, you know, everybody

474
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,440
knows or I guess most people who were thinking about biology would understand that the part

475
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,480
of the cell that contains your DNA is called the nucleus.

476
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,520
And we've got lots of genes in there, about 20,000 genes.

477
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,360
But the mitochondria has genes too.

478
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Not that many.

479
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,880
What is like 35 or something?

480
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
37.

481
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,840
And there's the key point there is there's 13 genes that are essential for the respiratory

482
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,440
chain to work.

483
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,640
And the respiratory chain is where all that oxygen is being consumed.

484
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,640
That's the one that makes that energy, that electrochemical energy we talked about that

485
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,020
ultimately gets converted to ATP.

486
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:35,960
So the key subunits of the respiratory chain, which generates that battery that we've been

487
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,120
talking about, it holds on to those 13 genes that are critical for it.

488
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,680
So for example, complex one, and it's one of those respiratory chains, there's these

489
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
five complexes.

490
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,120
Well, one of the complexes has 45 subunits, but a few of them, which means 45 proteins

491
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,940
make this huge complex.

492
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,720
But a few of them are in the mitochondrial genome.

493
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,920
Complex three, very important, my favorite complex.

494
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,600
Everybody's got to have a favorite complex.

495
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,000
And so my favorite complex.

496
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,440
I see a t-shirt here.

497
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Yeah.

498
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,960
My favorite complex is complex three, and it has one gene that's still in the mitochondria.

499
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,360
By the way, are you saying that just to be contrarian because complex one is actually

500
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
the coolest?

501
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,880
Because like, how can complex one not be your favorite mitochondrial complex?

502
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I'll tell you in a second.

503
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,120
It's just because you're cool and you're too cool for school because you study this.

504
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,120
The rest of us who are in the peanut gallery, we default into complex one being the coolest.

505
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
So you're saying I'm a mitochondrial hipster, right?

506
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
I think you are.

507
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,200
You're leading the charge, Janice.

508
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,480
No, but complex three is very interesting because it has 11 subunits.

509
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,960
Only one subunit is in the mitochondrial, encoded by the mitochondrial genome.

510
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,200
So at one point, the mitochondria, so going back in evolution, we think there was an alpha

511
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,440
proteobacteria and an archaea, probably a metagen.

512
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,040
These two prokaryotes got together and had a symbiotic love affair.

513
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,400
And just to explain to you, so we are eukaryotes.

514
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
And what does that mean again?

515
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,960
We've got a nucleus, we've got a bunch of organelles.

516
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
And what's a prokaryote?

517
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,760
It doesn't have those organelles.

518
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,120
So bacteria.

519
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,280
So you got a bacteria and you got an archaea and they got together.

520
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,080
So we think the archaea is kind of where the nucleus came from and the alpha proteobacteria

521
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,040
is the modern day mitochondria.

522
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,480
And one of the best evidences is I remember an experiment that I did as a graduate student

523
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,880
was I took a bacteria that somebody had discovered in the 70s, a beautiful paper in nature, and

524
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,640
this bacteria, if you gave it like succinate, like a mitochondrial substrate, it'll grow

525
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,440
on it and it would respire very similar to modern day mitochondria.

526
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Modern day mitochondria.

527
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Wow.

528
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,920
A nice, elegant proof of concept that the mitochondria are basically bacteria.

529
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
They came from bacteria.

530
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,360
Yeah, they came from bacteria.

531
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Yeah.

532
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,320
And you know, those who doubt evolution, I always tell them that every organism I know

533
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,800
burns glucose very similarly.

534
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
It is hard to make that.

535
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,360
Yeah, if you're not, I don't want to go down this path because we'll simply alienate a

536
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,640
million people.

537
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,660
But it is interesting to think like it strikes me as it's very hard to come up with an alternative

538
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:24,000
explanation for why you would have this effectively foreign DNA inside every cell.

539
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,120
And I just, I'm so intrigued by this mitochondrial DNA thing because again, it's such a tiny

540
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,240
number of genes on a relative scale, but yet they're so critical.

541
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,600
And to my knowledge, I don't think there's any other organelle that carries its own genes

542
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
with it.

543
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Is there?

544
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
No, it doesn't.

545
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,000
And what's interesting is that it only encodes for like a 1% of, you know, there's, I don't

546
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,600
know, 1,000 proteins in the mitochondria.

547
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
But it's absolutely critical.

548
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Absolutely.

549
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
You knock those 37 genes out.

550
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,440
You knock out any one of those genes out.

551
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
You're done.

552
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
You're done.

553
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,240
And so why did the mitochondria hold on to those?

554
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Right?

555
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,600
So it basically gave up, you know, if it has a thousand proteins, it said, you know what,

556
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,680
the nuclear genome, you take 990, right?

557
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,400
I'm going to hold on.

558
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,600
And they're all the critical catalytic subunits in all of this.

559
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,840
And then there was, they're really essential for the function and I'm going to hold on

560
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
to them.

561
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,360
It's almost like it doesn't trust its symbiotic partner.

562
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Right.

563
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
It's like a love affair, right?

564
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Yeah, I love you.

565
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,720
But I'm going to hold on to a few things.

566
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Yeah.

567
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,080
And it's very interesting because I believe I could be wrong, but I, you could make the

568
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,160
case and correct me if I'm wrong, that that we pay a price for that lack of trust.

569
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,480
In many ways, don't you think the nucleus would be a better steward of those genes?

570
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,240
Doesn't the nucleus have more ways to protect the genome than the mitochondria?

571
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,920
And therefore, don't we run a greater risk of disease when the mitochondria with its

572
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,640
beautiful stewardship over its precious 37 genes gets under stress?

573
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Yeah, this is a very important point you're making.

574
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,400
Basically we have a lot of DNA repair enzymes, right?

575
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,040
They're all in the nucleus.

576
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,280
There's these proteins called histones that cover the double strand DNA.

577
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,800
So you know, and there's many mechanisms to protect our genome.

578
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,640
And the mitochondrial DNA is just like this round little circle.

579
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
It's so vulnerable.

580
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:30,360
It's totally vulnerable and is especially vulnerable because the sight of those free

581
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,400
radicals we've been talking about is right there.

582
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Exactly.

583
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
That's the worst part.

584
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,600
You put these very exposed, fragile, not protected genes in the presence of a potential toxin.

585
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Right.

586
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,320
I mean, I wish I had more time to think about it.

587
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,880
I wish I was quicker on my feet because I think I could think of an elegant analogy

588
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,640
of how counterintuitive that is, right?

589
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,560
Leaving the keys to the kingdom in the hands of the guy next to the, you know, I can't

590
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
even think of it.

591
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,040
I'm not smart enough, but like, it doesn't make sense.

592
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,240
It's like a hen house next to where the fox is like.

593
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

594
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
That's a better idea.

595
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
So what's the advantage of it?

596
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:14,920
One thing I should stress is that potential molecule that could be damaging in superoxide,

597
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,600
hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, the mitochondria where the mitochondrial DNA

598
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,600
resides in the mitochondrial matrix, there's tons and tons of antioxidants there.

599
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,560
So even though that the DNA itself can be protected, it's protected from a variety of

600
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,040
these toxins because there's so many proteins that clean them up, essentially.

601
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,880
The highest level of antioxidant activity sitting in the mitochondrial matrix, and I

602
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,040
think that's because to protect that almost naked DNA.

603
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
So one other little-

604
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
If that makes sense.

605
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
Yeah, no, it really makes sense.

606
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Thank you.

607
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,480
Because this has been on my mind a lot lately because I saw a paper recently, I may have

608
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,640
even sent it to you about another hypothesis around inflammation, the effect that inflammation

609
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,840
can have on the mitochondria and the mitochondria starts to shed its DNA, which actually kicks

610
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,840
off an immune response as it exits the cell.

611
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,400
And that's what got me thinking about this.

612
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,520
I was like, wait a minute.

613
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,640
That's a really good point.

614
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
That must happen an awful lot.

615
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,560
And actually, what did they peg it to?

616
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,800
They pegged it to hypercorticillemia, which we're going to come back to because you're

617
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,640
kind of a cortisol guy too when it's all said and done.

618
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,280
You're a cortisol file if such a word exists.

619
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,280
No, in the hormone world, I call people like you insulin prophets.

620
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,280
And many of your other former guests, I'm the cortisol prophet, right?

621
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,720
I think that's the missing link for a lot of stuff.

622
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,560
Not any real data, but it's just my own intuition.

623
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,440
Well, these data that I saw actually suggested that the hypercorticillemia, not just cortisol,

624
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,240
but other glucocorticoids and including other hormones from the adrenal glands could really

625
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,580
become toxic to the mitochondria at high enough doses.

626
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:04,000
And it was basically jettisoning broken strands of mitochondrial DNA that basically kicked

627
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
off immune responses.

628
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,440
And sort of you had these inflammatory responses that resulted from an immune response to mitochondrial

629
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,480
DNA being damaged by cortisol.

630
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,600
So bringing it back to kind of dinner table trivia, the other thing about mitochondrial

631
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,200
DNA that's interesting is it comes from one parent.

632
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,320
So tell us what that's all about and why that's the case and what the...

633
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
Well, we don't...

634
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,640
Yeah, I mean, again, two big questions in the field.

635
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,920
One is why we still keep those genes.

636
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,640
We just went over, it's kind of like it doesn't trust.

637
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,920
And then the other one is why does it come from the mom?

638
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,800
And there's an implication there, which is you have far less dilution by generation.

639
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,760
You do, but why did nature select that?

640
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
I'm asking you.

641
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
I don't.

642
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
I don't.

643
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I don't have a good explanation.

644
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,920
Even teleologically, you don't have a good explanation?

645
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,200
I really don't.

646
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,320
We think more about the function of mitochondria.

647
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,200
I mean, there's a whole group of people who think about the bottleneck of mitochondrial

648
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,000
DNA being passed on.

649
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,760
But I actually, I don't have a good explanation to it.

650
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,000
It's a fascinating...

651
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,680
I think lots of people have very interesting ideas around it.

652
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,880
But to be honest with you, why we continue to have those genes and why does it come

653
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
from the mom?

654
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,680
I think these are still outstanding questions in the field.

655
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,160
Something that my lab doesn't work on.

656
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,400
And as you know, Peter, I don't comment on things that I don't work on just because you

657
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,280
can speculate, but you want to have good data.

658
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,760
But I do want to talk about one aspect of mitochondrial DNA.

659
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,520
And this is in my wheelhouse, which has nothing to do with those two questions, which is a

660
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,760
third role, but going back to signaling.

661
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,960
So if you think that H2O2...

662
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,160
So what does mitochondria dump into the cytoplasm ATP for energy?

663
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,320
We think H2O2 for signaling to do immune responses, exercise, etc.

664
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,480
What else could it release?

665
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,520
Well, one of the things that could release is mitochondrial DNA, which would then kick

666
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
off an immune response.

667
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,800
The only thing about that hypothesis that I struggle with is how do you release mitochondrial

668
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,080
DNA in a physiological way without not releasing cytochrome C?

669
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,400
So you're saying maybe all the damage that's...

670
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,320
Well, okay, I'll give you an answer.

671
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm making this up now.

672
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,000
But maybe you are also releasing cytochrome C. The cytochrome C results in the apoptotic

673
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,140
death of this cell, but the DNA gets into the plasma, which is where the immune system

674
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,380
begins to recognize it.

675
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,660
So you could still have apoptosis at the cellular level, but globally, so locally apoptosis,

676
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,820
globally you have the immune response.

677
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,780
So it depends on that cell dying.

678
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,460
Yes, which makes sense.

679
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,460
That's okay.

680
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,300
You're saying, I don't see a way that that could happen with an intact cell just willy

681
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,340
nilly passing off its mitochondrial DNA.

682
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
That makes sense.

683
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:57,620
Yeah, and people have sort of proposed that it could do that, and maybe it can.

684
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,980
And I'm open to the idea, but someone's got to show me how you selectively release some

685
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,960
mitochondrial DNA without releasing everything else.

686
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Where H2O2 and ATP get released in a much more benign fashion without cytochrome C.

687
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Now, ATP has an active transporter.

688
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
It has an active transporter.

689
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,680
H2O2 goes by diffusion?

690
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,380
We think so.

691
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,640
Probably maybe VDAC channels, voltage-dependent anion channels could maybe release the super

692
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,500
oxide, which then gets converted quickly to H2O2 right outside the mitochondria.

693
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,180
So again, the mechanisms of, it's kind of like water, right?

694
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,860
Before the aquaporins, we just thought water just went back to diffusion.

695
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,500
Now there's active transport.

696
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,180
Actually, Pioneer was at your institute at Hopkins, right?

697
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,900
Got the Nobel Prize for the aquaporins.

698
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,200
I didn't know that.

699
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,820
And so when we think about signaling, the simple idea is what gets released?

700
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,800
ATP, what gets released without cytochrome C getting released?

701
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,880
That's the key, right?

702
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,320
Because cytochrome C gets released.

703
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
It doesn't matter.

704
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
It doesn't matter.

705
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,420
Everything is the cells on its way to die.

706
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,520
So what gets released?

707
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,640
So we know hydrogen peroxide, ATP, and metabolites.

708
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,760
Metabolites are always being released.

709
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
So citrate.

710
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Well CO2.

711
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
CO2, yeah.

712
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,320
Or obvious reason.

713
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
But citrate, right?

714
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,640
So citrate is very interesting molecule.

715
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,780
Citrate gets exported from the TCA cycle into the cytoplasm where it can get broken

716
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,940
down back into acetyl CoA, which can then be a primer for making new lipids, new fatty

717
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,780
acids, right?

718
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,840
But also that acetyl CoA can cause acetylation reactions like on histones to control gene

719
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,900
expression in the so-called chromatin modifications.

720
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,740
Meaning it goes back to the nucleus.

721
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,740
Yeah.

722
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,340
So citrate could be a signaling molecule, right?

723
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,600
Well, if it's doing what you just described, it would be.

724
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
It would be, right?

725
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,120
And so there's a bunch of...

726
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:59,480
So in my wheelhouse, the ones that I like to think about, H2O2 and TCA cycle metabolites

727
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,760
that get released, and they do.

728
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,620
They're in constant flux between the cytoplasm and the TCA cycle, and they can control gene

729
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,680
expression through chromatin modifications, through histone modifications.

730
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,500
So because we're going to come back to this through a totally different lens, I want

731
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:24,500
to also have you and or me explain somewhat to the listener what this idea means of histone

732
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,100
deacetylation.

733
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,940
And basically, because those terms I think are largely foreign to even reasonably informed

734
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,180
folks, but I think the reasonably informed folk will understand what epi genome means,

735
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,580
what a modification of a gene means, and how genes are potentially silenced or upregulated.

736
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,820
Is that happening often in the mitochondrial DNA as well, or are they pretty much just

737
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,820
on their own?

738
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,820
They don't have...

739
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,200
So what transcription factors tell those genes when to turn on?

740
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,680
Again, they're all a nuclear encoded and they have to be...

741
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,800
Oh my God, this is so staggeringly inefficient.

742
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,320
There has to be a reason for this that hasn't...

743
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,320
Why?

744
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,640
I mean, I know you're fascinated by mitochondrial DNA, and I don't have good answers for this.

745
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,720
That's why we didn't want to talk about this.

746
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,500
Which is, why does it continue to have those genes?

747
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm hoping there's a college student out there or a graduate student out there who's thinking,

748
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,740
I want to understand what could be the reason for this.

749
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,940
Because if you can find in my somewhat simplistic way of thinking about problems, I think when

750
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,820
you look at something in nature and you don't have a clue why it's occurring, if you could

751
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,020
get a clue why it's occurring, you will unlock a whole bunch of other knowledge as well.

752
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:39,140
That might not be true, but that's like kind of a working hypothesis.

753
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,400
In this case, think of like you're one of the world's experts on this topic, and yet

754
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,740
you're acknowledging there are so many fundamental obvious questions.

755
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Like a high school biology student could ask the questions I'm asking on this topic.

756
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,640
These are not like super nuanced questions, and yet the field doesn't know the answer.

757
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,960
That's really interesting.

758
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,720
To be fair, there are people who think a lot about this and they have opinions on it, but

759
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,420
what I'm just simply saying is what is well established is that mitochondria generate

760
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,900
ATP and they generate metabolites for growth.

761
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,980
All of this stuff, including my signaling hypothesis, it's still a work in progress.

762
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,140
Like everything we've talked about, just full disclosure to the audience, it's a work in

763
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,140
progress.

764
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,720
So if you're a high school student, come on and join the party.

765
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,020
There's a lot to be discovered here.

766
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,180
Well that's the beauty, right?

767
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,460
It's not like we're ever going to run out of questions that need to be answered.

768
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,440
I think the difficulty in the field historically has been the bias about ATP and thinking about

769
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,880
energy and solving that problem.

770
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,600
The great biochemists did that.

771
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,480
They figured out how we make ATP, fundamental to life.

772
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,520
They figured out how we make the metabolizing TCA cycle, but now it's getting much more

773
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,680
challenging because those same processes can control gene expression.

774
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,000
Well, how does that work?

775
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:05,860
I have some reasonable hypotheses we're testing, but I'm very careful as you know to not give

776
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,060
a strong opinion on a work in progress.

777
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,340
So let's shift gears a little bit to talk about some other broad mitochondrial questions

778
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:17,640
because I do think that people today, and maybe it's just the bias I experience because

779
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,660
of what I'm looking for, so this might not be the case, but it seems that the interest

780
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,260
in mitochondria has exploded.

781
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,040
I think people are realizing there's a lot going on here.

782
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,360
It's more than we realize.

783
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,240
Mitochondrial function is now a term people use all the time, but they're not just talking.

784
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,840
I don't think they're just talking about oxidative phosphorylation.

785
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,800
I think they're talking about broader things.

786
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,960
And when we talk about aging, we talk about some things changing in the mitochondria as

787
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,520
we age.

788
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,320
When you think of hallmarks of aging, we can debate the merits of some of them, but something's

789
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,540
different in the mitochondria of an 80-year-old versus an 8-year-old.

790
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,860
What are some of those changes?

791
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:07,060
Well, so this is going to get contentious now because the data suggests that you have

792
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,860
a decrease in mitochondrial DNA.

793
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:20,240
Some of that mitochondrial DNA has deletions that the capacity to do maximal ATP generation

794
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,800
goes down, oxidative phosphorylation.

795
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,960
The key there is maximal.

796
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,120
So one of the perplexing things, and this is really perplexing for me, a much more...

797
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,940
So I don't think much about mitochondrial DNA, and that's why I didn't have good answers

798
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,420
for that, but this is the one that really is...

799
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,720
And this is fundamental to the aging.

800
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,020
When you're born, let's say, you have 100% capacity.

801
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:52,780
And then as you age, that capacity, if you're giving 100% mitochondria, you get an A+,

802
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,040
100%, how far do you go as you age?

803
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,000
Just to actually make sure I understand what you're talking about, are you saying amount

804
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,240
of ATP generated per mole of oxygen as a metric?

805
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,240
As a metric.

806
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,300
We could use ATP generation as a simple one.

807
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Its ability to...

808
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,880
For every mole of oxygen, you generate X mole of ATP, and whatever your maximum is, it declines.

809
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,700
And you can burn it through fat, glucose, carbohydrates, protein.

810
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,100
It's working at its maximal efficiency.

811
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,640
Everything's fine.

812
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,700
And that efficiency now declines with age.

813
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,980
The question is, is it ever rate limiting?

814
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:39,260
So you and I, I mean, again, these are loose terms, at any given point, are using maybe

815
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,820
10% to 20% of our maximal activity.

816
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,760
Hey, speak for yourself, dude.

817
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,000
I mean, I do wind sprints every day, man.

818
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Okay, so when you do that, you might go up to 40% or 50%.

819
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I didn't realize that.

820
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,080
You don't hit that.

821
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,980
And so when we knock out a protein in the mitochondria, and we knock out it completely

822
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:09,500
from 100% to 0% pathology happens, we go from 100% to 50%, we never see any pathology.

823
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,740
Even under stress?

824
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,280
Even under stress, if anything, they behave better.

825
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,920
So yeah, this is very interesting, right?

826
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,560
And so then when I look at the data on aging sometimes, you know, in some tissues, it goes

827
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,600
down by 50% of maximal, maybe 70%, 80%.

828
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,360
But is that ever rate limiting?

829
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,000
Well, if what you said is true, then it would not be rate limiting within a certain band.

830
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,320
So I am on this full disclosure again.

831
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,160
I am in way out of space on this idea.

832
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,140
I don't think mitochondrial function, and if you don't have a disease, let's be clear,

833
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,100
normal aging, we're talking about, right?

834
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,680
You don't have cardiovascular disease, you know, you're just sort of pretty healthy.

835
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,060
And I don't think a healthy heart, you know, is rate limited for mitochondrial function.

836
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:04,580
The implication there is that most people think, again, this is like dogma, like with

837
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,580
antioxidants, right?

838
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,140
They're good for you.

839
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,920
So that mitochondria are declining, let's give supplements that boost mitochondrial

840
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
function.

841
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
Is that a fair statement?

842
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Heck yeah.

843
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,400
I think there's no evidence to support that.

844
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,520
What is the most popular of said supplements?

845
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,600
Would that MITOQ be a popular supplement?

846
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,400
No, that's an anti-mitochondral targeted antioxidant.

847
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,640
So we can talk about MITOQ in a second, actually.

848
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,640
We should maybe talk about MITOQ.

849
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,760
Well, let's go back to it, but let's go back to your question.

850
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,920
What is, well, no one actually has, you know, people have been trying to have these, what's

851
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,900
called mitochondrial biogenesis activator, something that will make more mitochondria.

852
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,800
And I'm not quite sure what supplement people use that they think is the best one.

853
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,020
But I would argue the opposite, which is that they're not rate limiting.

854
00:49:53,020 --> 00:50:00,100
And if anything, maybe you can decrease mitochondrial function in certain tissues a little bit to

855
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,500
activate stress responses, which will then fight off if you do get a disease.

856
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,360
And this is going to go into metformin.

857
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,240
I was just, how do you read my mind?

858
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,260
I didn't even start mouthing the word yet.

859
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,120
Why did you know I was going to bring up metformin?

860
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,000
Because we think metformin is a weak mitochondrial complex one inhibitor.

861
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yes.

862
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,520
Another, which is part of the respiratory chain.

863
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,120
That's why complex one is my favorite complex.

864
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,440
That's why you're a complex one is your favorite.

865
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
But I'm a poser.

866
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,080
I'm a mitochondrial poser.

867
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,200
So okay.

868
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,480
Because what I was going to actually ask you was on the heels of that, when you give metformin,

869
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,540
you inhibit complex one, you are now reducing mitochondrial function.

870
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,540
That mitochondrial function.

871
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,820
And if what you're saying is correct, you would need a lot of metformin to generate

872
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,340
actual ETC toxicity.

873
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,500
Do we ever see that?

874
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,500
No.

875
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,220
I mean, you do if you go to certain doses, obviously.

876
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,460
Not physiologically, we can't, do we?

877
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,100
The anti-diabetic dosing that is given to people, I mean, there's some toxicity can

878
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,960
happen due to certain patient populations.

879
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,660
But it's a very safe drug, right?

880
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,460
It's used by almost what, 300 million people now.

881
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,020
It's estimated to be used by half a billion people as the diabetes epidemic explodes in

882
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,780
China and India.

883
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,520
So no one quite understands how metformin works.

884
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,060
We think it's a, you know, it has three effects.

885
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,360
Clearly, it lowers glucose production in the liver.

886
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,340
It has some anti-inflammatory effects and it has some anti-cancer effects.

887
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,480
Well, let's talk more specifically about it.

888
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,680
We were joking around when we were at Easter Island that our next trip actually needs

889
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,680
to be to France.

890
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,040
To see the goats.

891
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,400
To see the lilac from where, wasn't that in France where that metformin came from?

892
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,720
So two sentences on how metformin was discovered?

893
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,760
They noticed these goats that were eating were pretty healthy.

894
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,680
I love these stories.

895
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
But you know-

896
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,160
Yesterday, I was talking to Ted Schafer about goats as well.

897
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,440
So I love that the two Northwestern guys, the only two podcasts that will ever have goats.

898
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,800
The votes are going to be these ones.

899
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,620
So what's interesting about metformin, I think, is it got approved as an anti-diabetic drug.

900
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:13,320
People went back and looked at people who were taking different diabetes and epidemiologically

901
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,040
found that there was a lower rates of like prostate cancer.

902
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,120
So you're probably talking to Ted Schafer about this, right?

903
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,980
So and they're lower in breast cancer.

904
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,340
So then people started investigating as an anti-cancer drug.

905
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,200
Then some people started noticing, wow, it has anti-inflammatory effects.

906
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:37,360
I've talked to a friend, David Sabatini, that isn't it interesting that rapamycin, anti-inflammatory

907
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,720
somewhat, anti-cancer promotes metabolic health.

908
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
So how does that all work?

909
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,120
Well, he'll argue it's all mTOR.

910
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:51,480
I said, well, I would argue how can metformin do three very disparate effects?

911
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,280
Anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, just like rapamycin would, it must be hitting

912
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,040
a node that's very important for the cell.

913
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,380
So metformin doesn't hit mTOR.

914
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,380
Does though.

915
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,380
AMPK does.

916
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:09,720
AMPK, but that's due to first hitting mitochondrial complex one and then activating AMPK, which

917
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,540
can repress mTOR.

918
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:17,440
But the analogy that I'm using basically is mTOR we know is the master of the universe.

919
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,100
So is mitochondria, right?

920
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:24,400
So if you inhibit mitochondria, not to the point where you cause toxicity, just enough,

921
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,320
you can activate a variety of pathways, which can promote, have anti-cancer, anti-diabetic

922
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,920
and anti-inflammatory effects.

923
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,860
Now metformin is somewhat tissue specific.

924
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,340
It seems to have a preference for the hepatocyte.

925
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,840
So it gets into the kidney and the liver.

926
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,540
I think we've talked about this before about mTOR, right?

927
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,240
So mTOR and rapamycin, right?

928
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,400
Why wouldn't you use rapamycin?

929
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,120
Well, it might get in everywhere.

930
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,760
I think David's arguing, you've argued, wouldn't it be great if you can get metformin to go

931
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,760
to the liver?

932
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,800
But not to the skeletal muscle.

933
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,960
So metformin already has a little bit of that property.

934
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,920
It only gets selectively into, it doesn't get into the heart that well, right?

935
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,140
So it doesn't infect your heart function, not directly.

936
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,160
It affects your liver, your kidney.

937
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,560
It actually accumulates quite a bit in the gut.

938
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,620
And some people get diarrhea with metformin.

939
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,120
And so some people think metformin is affecting your microbiome.

940
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,260
And there's a huge literature now thinking that some of how it's having its effects.

941
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:26,060
So I think the liver, so I think there's three places that are important.

942
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,060
The liver, and that can account for some of shutting down the glucose production and having

943
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,140
the so-called anti-diabetic effect.

944
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,580
The colon, and affecting your microbiome.

945
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,580
And I think the immune cells, I think that's the big one we're missing.

946
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,860
So that's the one that I'm very fascinated.

947
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,980
In other words, metformin getting into your macrophages or your, probably maybe not your

948
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,460
T cells, but at least some of your immune cells that might be causing high levels of

949
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,980
inflammation.

950
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:59,020
And if you look at the three drugs that people like to use, aspirin, metformin, and statins,

951
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,860
globally use combined maybe what, a billion people?

952
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,860
Probably more.

953
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,860
Probably more.

954
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,620
The Venn diagram where they all overlap is inflammation.

955
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:11,220
So let's talk a little bit about the anti-inflammatory properties of metformin because the first

956
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:14,700
thing is the one I guess we would understand the most, which is, you've alluded to this,

957
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,900
but I just, I want to orient the listener a little bit.

958
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,200
The mitochondria, you said, have these five complexes.

959
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,420
Each of them have multiple subunits.

960
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,280
And what happens is these are basically the chains between the inner mitochondrial membrane

961
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,480
and the inner part of the mitochondria, where these reducing agents like NAD, NADH, NADP,

962
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,600
and NADPH are transferring the electrons and building up that gradient.

963
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,100
So by the time you get to the end of this thing, you've got so much potential energy

964
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:47,160
in all of those electrons and you run that transfer of phosphates from ADP to ATP and

965
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,300
everybody wins the game.

966
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,680
So this is essential, this electron transport chain, like messing with that, probably not

967
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,580
a good idea.

968
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,540
Metformin comes along and it blocks complex one.

969
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,160
Now it doesn't block it completely, it blocks it partially.

970
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,920
Now complex one, the chemical reaction that's occurring on the inner part of the mitochondria

971
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,160
is the transfer of NADH to NAD.

972
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,560
Now we're going to come back to NAD, but for totally unrelated reasons.

973
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,800
When you do that, what is that telling the cell?

974
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,120
By inhibiting that, the cells read out is what?

975
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,120
Physiologically.

976
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,760
Three things.

977
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:34,840
First, that battery that you're talking about that generates to make ATP, less charged.

978
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
So then what happens?

979
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:41,760
ATP goes down, ADP goes up, there's a kinase called AMPK.

980
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,360
Kinase, AMPK is the AMPK, hence AMPK.

981
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,000
It gets activated and in part that.

982
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,880
That enzyme is activated is a signal that says I'm not fed enough.

983
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,640
And one of the major things it does is it promotes autophagy.

984
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,640
My favorite word.

985
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,320
Your favorite word, right?

986
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,840
It's one of the dominant things it does.

987
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:11,120
That's why when AMPK gets activated, we get another little benefit, a la Rapamycin's effect

988
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:19,040
on mTOR, which is it says, hey man, I'm telling you from an ox-foss standpoint, energy is

989
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,520
low, shut things down.

990
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Nutrients are scarce.

991
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,700
Right, and this is happening in the liver.

992
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,520
So for example, glucose production that happens in the liver starts to shut down in part,

993
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,280
or lipogenesis, making new lipids in the liver.

994
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,440
And that's why for fatty liver, it might have some benefits.

995
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
So that's one.

996
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,200
Something is, which you alluded to NAD to NADH.

997
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
Sorry, NADH2.

998
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
NAD to NAD.

999
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,200
Right?

1000
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Making NAD.

1001
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,880
So that ratio also gets transmitted back to the cell.

1002
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,000
And what's that signal?

1003
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,560
How does the low NAD to NADH get transmitted?

1004
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,400
So the biggest one is lactate to pyruvate.

1005
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Right?

1006
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,600
It's a lactate to pyruvate.

1007
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,880
It is a source of, so there's many ways you can feed pyruvate.

1008
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,920
So we talked about glucose to pyruvate.

1009
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:19,960
So glucose to pyruvate uses NAD to NADH, and usually pyruvate to lactate will go...

1010
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,080
Go ahead and explain what I'm doing.

1011
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:32,480
So I have to tell you, and I think we're both, because we're not on camera, one of the difficulties

1012
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,000
of really getting into the nitty gritty of metabolism is it's so much easier to write

1013
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it in diagrams.

1014
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Right?

1015
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,680
I mean, when you write it in the diagram in simplistic ways, it's just like...

1016
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,680
It's easier.

1017
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,680
It's just easier, right?

1018
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,680
I mean, it's just...

1019
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,280
So Nav's laughing at me because I'm closing my eyes, drawing it.

1020
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,200
And as I'm saying it, you know, NADH, no, it's the NADH.

1021
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,080
I mean, I'm getting confused.

1022
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:02,920
I promise you, this will be one of those episodes where the show notes will be handy because

1023
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,680
we'll have all the diagrams.

1024
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,480
Well, they can actually, you know, what they can really do, right?

1025
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
There's a book I've heard.

1026
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,480
Yeah, there's a book.

1027
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,960
You want to give a plug?

1028
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,960
This is a good moment.

1029
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
I'm happy to give a plug.

1030
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:21,480
So for all you metabolite lovers out there, Nav wrote a book called Navigating Metabolism,

1031
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,560
wah, wah, wah.

1032
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,240
And I actually picked up a copy as soon as we got back from Easter Island.

1033
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,080
In fact, I probably ordered it from the airport in Santiago.

1034
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,120
And it's a fantastic resource.

1035
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,640
And we will absolutely be sure to link to that.

1036
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,240
I would say it is, and I'm not just saying this because you're sitting here, but if you

1037
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,600
are a person who's interested in this area, but you're not going to devote your life to

1038
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,520
it, it's a fantastic...

1039
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,280
It's the one book you need to get.

1040
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,720
Obviously, if you're someone who's doing a postdoc in Nav's lab, it's something you need

1041
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,120
to read, but it's not going to be sufficient to get you to the next level of understanding.

1042
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,560
But for the knuckle draggers amongst us, you can get pretty far on understanding this stuff

1043
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,560
through Nav's book.

1044
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,120
And it's actually a pretty quick read.

1045
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,880
It's not like reading Stryer's Biochemistry where...

1046
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,880
That's a very good book, by the way.

1047
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,880
Stryer was my professor.

1048
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,840
As was the Leninger book.

1049
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,640
So anyway, yeah, a little digression, which is to acknowledge this is hard.

1050
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,840
Apologies for it.

1051
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,200
But I think this topic is so important, and I just know I get asked about this stuff

1052
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,400
all the time.

1053
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,720
I'm, on a personal level, professional level, so interested in this topic that you just

1054
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,840
have to pay the price.

1055
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,760
You have to be willing to get into the details.

1056
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,080
And the reason is we're going to talk about other things.

1057
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:40,960
If I had a dollar for every time I've been asked, should I be taking NR, NMN, and should

1058
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,040
I be going to a clinic where they do IV, NAD, and all these things?

1059
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,400
If you want to be able to think through those things and read the papers that are asking

1060
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,360
those questions, you have to understand how this stuff works.

1061
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,080
There's no shortcut.

1062
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,000
So unfortunately, we have to continue doing this the way we're doing it, and that might

1063
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,840
mean that I have to close my eyes and pretend I'm drawing Complex 1.

1064
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,360
So I guess we should just talk about NAD then, NAD and NADH ratio.

1065
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,600
I sort of interrupted you, though.

1066
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
No, no, no.

1067
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,600
Let's go back to metformin.

1068
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,600
Yeah, the NADH.

1069
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
Right.

1070
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:18,040
So what metformin doesn't allow is it starts to weakly inhibit Complex 1, so your NADH

1071
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,120
to NAD is going to be slowed down.

1072
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:28,160
And how that gets transmitted to the rest of the cell is not fully understood, so I

1073
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,400
have many ideas around this.

1074
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,180
And we can talk about one of them later because it has to do with neurodegeneration potentially.

1075
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:41,520
But the big thing is that NADH to NAD ratio is very important.

1076
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:47,520
And one of the important things is that when lactate, which can come from the muscle, the

1077
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,800
liver takes it up and the lactate becomes pyruvate, and that can then eventually become

1078
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,360
glucose, that's gluconeogenesis, it needs NAD.

1079
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:03,040
But if you have metformin, you don't have as much NAD, so lactate to pyruvate slows

1080
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,960
down and therefore you don't make as much glucose.

1081
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:12,000
And that's another reason why metformin has its anti-diabetic properties.

1082
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,920
That just gave me an interesting idea.

1083
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,640
We have a friend in common, Josh Rabinowitz at Princeton, who's a classmate of mine in

1084
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,720
medical school, a colleague of yours.

1085
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,960
Brilliant metabolism scientist.

1086
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,240
Off the charts, incredible guy.

1087
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,460
He had a paper that came out, I've talked about it on the podcast very briefly.

1088
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,880
I actually want to interview Josh and I just have to drag my ass down to Princeton or he

1089
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,000
has to drag his up to New York City.

1090
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,320
But this paper in Cell Metabolism, which we'll be sure to link to, took orally administered

1091
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:44,480
NR or NMN, both precursors to NAD, and it showed that the liver could take those up

1092
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:52,760
in significant quantities, combine them with tryptophan and make lots of intrahepatic NAD,

1093
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,560
but none of it made it into the cell.

1094
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,880
So the NAD wasn't making it into the cell and the NR and the NMN were not being taken

1095
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,160
up by cells other than hepatocytes.

1096
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,760
But what you just said made me think of something.

1097
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,240
If the liver in the presence of NR and NMN is making a lot of NAD, that means it's making

1098
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,100
lots of substrate to enzymatically force gluconeogenesis.

1099
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,080
Or is that never rate limited and this becomes irrelevant?

1100
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,080
The latter, what you just said.

1101
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,720
I said, so we're never too low on NAD?

1102
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,520
No, no, we are.

1103
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,320
We are the maximal amounts.

1104
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,280
And so there's two things about NAD.

1105
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:37,600
One is just the quantity of NAD, which then is utilized by sirtuins, PARP, a variety of

1106
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:43,640
other reactions that are important biologically, especially the sirtuins, which are NAD dependent.

1107
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,800
But that's just simply NAD.

1108
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,620
What I'm talking about is the ratio of NAD to NADH.

1109
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:56,240
And so these supplements, I don't think, they don't drastically change that redox ratio

1110
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,240
of NAD to NADH.

1111
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,920
It's just the absolute amount of NAD, which is then utilized by sirtuins and PARP.

1112
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,640
And there's something to be said about this because people talk about how NAD ratios decline

1113
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,040
in the mitochondria as we age.

1114
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,040
Does that-

1115
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,040
Is that rate limiting?

1116
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,240
Yeah, exactly.

1117
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:21,200
Does it matter if it affects the enzymatic chain at complex one?

1118
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,320
Comes back to, is a 50% decline in NAD rate limiting for complex one activity?

1119
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,600
Because that would mirror what metformin is doing.

1120
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:35,000
Metformin is lowering the ratio of NAD to NADH, which would seem to parallel what we're told

1121
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,720
happens when we age.

1122
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,720
That's a bit counterintuitive.

1123
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,720
Exactly.

1124
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,720
Bingo.

1125
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,380
So this is my argument.

1126
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:46,160
Most of the people say you got to boost your mitochondria because NAD is declining, the

1127
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,840
respiratory chain is declining, mitochondria rate limiting.

1128
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,520
But how does that jive with this metformin inhibiting complex one theory then?

1129
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:01,160
If you think that mitochondria and NAD and everything around mitochondria is declining,

1130
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,460
you want to boost them.

1131
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,360
If you think they're declining and maybe it's adaptive, that's why it is declining, which

1132
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,360
is my favorite theory.

1133
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
Wow.

1134
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
That's a little out there, man.

1135
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,360
That's way out there.

1136
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,760
That this is, there's a reason.

1137
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:19,240
And if you can then give something like, and it's never rate limiting really, at least

1138
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,120
for normal physiology, not maybe for stress.

1139
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:28,280
And then if you can give something like metformin, you can now stress out that mitochondria at

1140
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,880
times and turn on some adaptive responses.

1141
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,020
So that's a different theory, right?

1142
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:40,520
So the best evidence for it really is we have to really nail down whether all of these effects

1143
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:45,560
of metformin happen by complex one inhibition.

1144
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,400
There's wide disagreement in the literature.

1145
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:57,500
Just to be clear, all these roles of metformin for cancer, for diabetes, for inflammation,

1146
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,740
does it require complex one inhibition?

1147
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,920
So how would you test that?

1148
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,280
Well, it's hard to have a complex one knockout.

1149
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,280
Exactly.

1150
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,380
Because that's incompatible with life.

1151
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,080
So that would be the obvious answer that doesn't work.

1152
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:17,920
Well, so I would argue for any drug, the best experiment is to make a mutant of that particular

1153
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,360
complex that doesn't bind metformin.

1154
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,360
Bingo.

1155
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,360
Yeah.

1156
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,800
So I'm not a good structural biologist, but we did something really clever.

1157
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:34,920
We noticed that the yeast has a protein, single protein, which will catalyze NADH to NAD.

1158
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,600
What complex one does in part?

1159
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Yes, exactly.

1160
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,820
It doesn't proton pump, which means it doesn't contribute to ATP generation.

1161
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:51,180
We have engineered cells and mice to get rid of complex one and put back this yeast.

1162
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,980
Complex one, which is refractory to metformin, but ask this question.

1163
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:58,700
But the phenotype of that cell is what?

1164
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,460
What is its electron transport chain doing if it's basically losing anything at complex

1165
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,460
one?

1166
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,900
Basically complex two through five still can't work.

1167
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,900
No, no, no.

1168
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:11,780
So what this protein, this yeast complex one homolog, the single protein.

1169
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,740
Well, it does everything except the electron transport.

1170
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,700
No, it does the electron transport.

1171
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,100
Sorry, it doesn't do the proton pump.

1172
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,100
Okay, got it.

1173
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,660
So you basically reduced your battery charge a little bit, but you haven't interrupted

1174
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:23,820
the electron transport.

1175
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:24,820
Oh, that's elegant.

1176
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:25,820
Thank you.

1177
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,820
That's very elegant.

1178
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:27,820
It's clever.

1179
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:28,820
Yeah.

1180
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:33,300
This is about the geekiest moment right now.

1181
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,580
This is like, this is, yeah.

1182
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,900
It's one of those aha things.

1183
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:38,900
It's clever, right?

1184
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:39,900
Very clever.

1185
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,900
Very clever, right?

1186
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,620
So the first experiment we did is we did the cancer experiment.

1187
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:49,940
So people had noticed, at least in laboratory settings, if you give metformin, you can reduce

1188
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,260
tumor burden in mice, the classic sort of experiments.

1189
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,700
So what we did is we took those cancer cells and put back the yeast version.

1190
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,580
But I want to say something here before you say, you tell us what happened, which is in

1191
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,140
fairness.

1192
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:07,180
And we did a lit review of this in 2014.

1193
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,580
So it's very dated.

1194
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,580
I know what's going to happen.

1195
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,100
A bunch of people are going to say, Peter, can you please link to it?

1196
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,420
It's an internal document.

1197
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,420
I may link to it.

1198
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:19,420
I got to go back and look and see how ridiculous it is, but it's now four years old.

1199
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:24,820
But it was not clear at the time of this review if the anti-cancer benefits, which seemed

1200
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:31,540
real, were either due to the inhibition of complex one or due to some other mechanism

1201
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,700
by which AMPK was activated.

1202
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,020
And to my knowledge, that is still not clear.

1203
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,020
Oh, it's clear.

1204
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,260
You're going to sell me it's clear.

1205
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,260
For cancer.

1206
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,340
Okay, keep going.

1207
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:47,260
So I'll tell you the experiment in cancers and then I'll tell you for diabetes, does

1208
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,340
main effect anti-diabetes, I think that's still up in the air.

1209
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:55,120
For inflammation, I think there's some strong evidence for complex one as well.

1210
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:05,700
So the simple experiment we did was we said, let's put back in cancer cells, human cancer

1211
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,620
cells, we put it in a mouse and it grows rapidly, right?

1212
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:14,400
And you can do it in colon cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer cells, typical cancer

1213
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,020
biology experiments.

1214
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,220
And we put the yeast complex one in.

1215
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:26,860
And okay, so when the yeast complex one is not there, metformin decreases tumor burden.

1216
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:31,300
If the yeast complex one is there, it does metformin can bind to it.

1217
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:36,780
So the mitochondria still continues to work and voila, the tumors don't go down.

1218
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:41,340
So what you demonstrated through that experiment, assuming we're not being fooled by some other

1219
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:48,940
artifact, which is always possible, is that when you prevent metformin from this one particular

1220
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:54,460
issue, which is binding to complex one and inhibiting that, its anti-cancer properties

1221
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,380
cease to exist.

1222
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:01,780
Did you assess the effect in that setting on AMPK?

1223
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,500
How much was AMPK activity upregulated?

1224
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,740
Yeah, so we don't think the anti-cancer effects are due to AMPK.

1225
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,940
Fair, but do you have an answer to the question?

1226
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,940
Do you know what happened?

1227
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
Yeah, so we-

1228
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,340
Because they should go down a little bit, but not off.

1229
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,780
Yeah, so we didn't think about that.

1230
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:23,820
We looked at other properties like NAD, NADH ratios, which we think is the more important-

1231
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,260
And how much did the NAD-

1232
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,260
Oh yeah, no.

1233
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,780
You could shut it down.

1234
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:28,780
Yeah, yeah.

1235
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,620
With metformin, you could decrease it.

1236
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:35,340
When the yeast complex, you can recover that ratio, the NAD to NADH ratio.

1237
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,660
And all the metabolomics that go with it.

1238
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:44,140
So when you inhibit complex one by metformin, the TCA cycle slows down and you can capture

1239
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:49,500
that by mass spec classic, what's called metabolomics, which is basically looking at metabolite

1240
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,260
profiling.

1241
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,460
And what's cool about that is there's a very good scientist, give him a shout out, Jason

1242
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:00,980
Locasal at Duke University, again, kind of a younger version of Joshua Benelitz.

1243
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:06,780
And what Jason- and hooked up with the University of Chicago Ovarian Cancer, a very famous Ovarian

1244
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:12,500
Cancer doctor, Ernest Lengel and his fellow Iris Romero at that point.

1245
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:18,540
And they were giving metformin to patients and then they gave these biopsies to Jason.

1246
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,940
And Jason could detect TCA cycle.

1247
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,180
He could see if met- he could ask two questions.

1248
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,660
Did the metformin get actually into the tumor?

1249
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,660
Yes.

1250
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,660
Yes.

1251
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:33,940
And the second one was, if our mechanism of complex one that we showed is correct, then

1252
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:40,140
the TCA cycle metabolites should be altered and they were in those human cancers.

1253
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,100
This is cell metabolism paper you can, people can look in.

1254
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,100
What year was that?

1255
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,180
That was so we published our metformin paper in 2014.

1256
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,660
I think Jason's paper was in 2016.

1257
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:55,300
I think we did the simple elegant experiment which shows the necessity of complex one inhibition.

1258
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,660
But I think Jason did the- as close as you can, if that mechanism is correct, then the

1259
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:05,420
humans he did the best- the next best thing you could do, which is show that TCA cycle

1260
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,420
metabolites.

1261
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,580
So clinically, it begs a question.

1262
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:18,340
Is that working because hepatic glucose output is going down and insulin is going down and

1263
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,140
presumably IGF is going down.

1264
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,580
If insulin is going down, IGF-BP3 should go up, insulin should go down, even if there's

1265
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:27,260
no change in the amino acids.

1266
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:32,820
Those things should all, if you had a little like on off switch, more glucose or less.

1267
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,820
Less is better.

1268
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,820
More insulin or less.

1269
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:35,820
Less is better.

1270
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:36,820
More IGF, more or less.

1271
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,820
Less.

1272
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,820
For cancer.

1273
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,820
For cancer.

1274
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:43,460
All of those things would move in the right direction if hepatic glucose output went down.

1275
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:49,900
So do we believe that that is the vehicle through which that transduction is becoming

1276
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,860
clinically relevant?

1277
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:59,020
Or do we believe that somehow inhibiting complex one in a cancer cell is deleterious to a cancer

1278
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,020
cell?

1279
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,460
I think both mechanisms are working in concert.

1280
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:11,500
And so clearly metformin, as you pointed out, lowers glucose, insulin, IGF, and insulin

1281
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,780
and IGF, and certain tumors can be a mitogen or something that promotes cancer proliferation.

1282
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,740
It seems that about two thirds of cancers seem sensitive to insulin and IGF.

1283
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,380
So that mechanism is still in play.

1284
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:28,460
But what we showed is it's equally plausible for cancers that have transporters of metformin,

1285
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:32,140
and they're called organic cation transporters.

1286
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,460
Not every tumor has it.

1287
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:38,120
And that's why metformin doesn't work clinically as a great anti-cancer agent because lots

1288
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,980
of tumors just don't have them.

1289
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:43,700
But if they do have them, they'll take them up, they'll inhibit complex one, and that

1290
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:49,300
will have anti-cancer effects right into the cancer cell.

1291
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:55,900
The reason that's important, again, is our work genetically is shown when we knock out

1292
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,340
complex one or three, tumors don't grow.

1293
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,540
If we give them metformin, we can show it's anti-cancer effects are due to complex one

1294
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,540
inhibition.

1295
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,300
So if that's right, then could we design complex one inhibitors?

1296
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,620
Wait, let me ask you a question.

1297
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:11,040
Sorry to interrupt now.

1298
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:17,020
What you just said a moment ago, when you inhibit complex three and tumors don't grow,

1299
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:22,340
you have to inhibit complex three in a tumor cell or in a hepatocyte to produce that cell.

1300
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:23,940
And the hepatocytes are normal.

1301
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:24,940
Well, the way we...

1302
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:30,180
These are genetically engineered where the complex three or one is only lost in the cancer

1303
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,180
cell.

1304
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,560
So this is the next experiment you have to do.

1305
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,520
You have to be able to separate.

1306
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,180
Listen to me telling you the experiment you have to do.

1307
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:42,540
It's important, I think, to separate out how much of this is tumor specific versus

1308
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,100
global metabolic.

1309
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:49,420
And the reason is the implications are profound, not just for other therapeutics, but frankly,

1310
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,980
for a more fundamental question, was what the hell should people be eating?

1311
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,980
Right?

1312
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:59,580
If in as much as you believe that nutrition can impact cancer therapy, the answer to this

1313
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,580
question is relevant.

1314
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:06,220
So we have now generated an unpublished work.

1315
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,060
Can you talk about unpublished work on a podcast?

1316
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,060
I don't know.

1317
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,820
It depends when is it going to be published?

1318
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,540
Not for a while, but it doesn't matter.

1319
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:21,340
So we've generated a mouse that contains the yeast complex one in the liver.

1320
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,260
Ah, okay.

1321
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:25,740
So this is where you'll be able to do the experiment because there's really a two by

1322
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,340
two that needs to be done here.

1323
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:33,500
I think they're both working in concert, but the major thing is in that metformin may have

1324
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:39,380
some anti-cancer effects, but what it's led to because of our work and others is the idea

1325
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:45,140
that maybe we should target mitochondria inhibition for cancer therapy.

1326
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,500
Now that's a little counterintuitive.

1327
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Yeah.

1328
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,260
So this is again, you know, I mean, I'm sure the audience is like everything this guy says

1329
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,260
is contrarian.

1330
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,500
So let's just turn them off now.

1331
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,340
But you know, our data is very clear.

1332
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,900
Mitochondria are necessary.

1333
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,660
Mitochondrial function is necessary for tumor genesis.

1334
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,660
All right.

1335
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:05,740
So let's take a step back and explain to the listener who hasn't heard what you just said

1336
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,300
why that is going to rock some people's world.

1337
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,820
I think you've talked about in some other podcasts.

1338
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:16,860
So there was a observation made in the 1920s by a gentleman named Otto Warburg, one of

1339
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:21,160
the giants, actually trained on scrubs, for example.

1340
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:29,140
He won a Nobel Prize in 1931 or 32, basically for discovering an enzyme for respiration.

1341
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,900
So he loved measuring respiration.

1342
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,300
But he did it in cancer.

1343
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,300
He did it in normal cells.

1344
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:41,420
And he noticed that cancer cells, at least on the benchtop, not in vivo, not in a real

1345
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:48,060
tumor, not in humans, just taking tissues out, that they made a lot of lactate and they

1346
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,820
didn't consume as much oxygen.

1347
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:53,900
And this didn't make sense to him because he's like, there's plenty of oxygen.

1348
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,300
Why should it do that?

1349
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,300
And it led him to think about perhaps that maybe the mitochondria are being suppressed

1350
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,280
in cancer.

1351
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:08,260
And this led to this long, long, long dogma that a very elegant, simple theory.

1352
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:13,580
Normal cells use a lot of mitochondria and mitochondrial ATP, very little glycolysis.

1353
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:18,140
So in other words, very little glucose to lactate, tons of oxygen.

1354
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,420
Your heart does it, your brain does it.

1355
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:24,420
But when you become cancerous, the mitochondria sort of shuts off and you upregulate tons

1356
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:31,080
of lactate and you can see that huge uptake of glucose uptake by a FTG pet that the clinicians

1357
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,200
do and you can see lots of lactate.

1358
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,300
And that was this theory.

1359
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:40,460
And then you target glycolysis for cancer because it'll specifically hit cancer cells

1360
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:44,860
because they're so glycolytic and spare all the other cells like your heart, your brain,

1361
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,300
your liver, because they're all mitochondrial dependent for energy.

1362
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,300
Keep it simple.

1363
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,300
Right?

1364
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,300
Right.

1365
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,300
So far so good?

1366
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,300
Absolutely.

1367
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,140
And I'll get into that story about 10 years ago and I've talked about this paper on the

1368
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:00,500
podcast but Thompson and Matt Vatterhahn was the lead author.

1369
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,300
But so, so Van der Heiden and Kant, Lee-

1370
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,520
Just saw him last night in Madison.

1371
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,520
He was here last night?

1372
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,520
No, he was in Madison.

1373
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,520
Oh, oh, you heard that.

1374
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,520
Sure.

1375
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,020
So Matthew and Lou Kantly and Craig Thompson wrote this paper in Science almost exactly

1376
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,900
10 years ago and it proposed a different reason for the observation.

1377
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,740
So it said the observation that Warburg put forth is what you just described, but maybe

1378
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:24,540
a different reason is that the cancer cell is not optimizing for energetics because that

1379
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:28,940
was always viewed as an energetically very inefficient and wasteful thing to do.

1380
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:31,940
But the argument they put forth was, well, it's not doing it for energetic reasons, it's

1381
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,740
doing it for growth reasons.

1382
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:37,900
It's doing that to get the throughput of building blocks for cells.

1383
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,140
So same observation, different explanation.

1384
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:46,420
The one thing I will say is for whatever reason and including that beautiful review in science,

1385
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:52,700
which the part that people don't highlight is what is the mitochondria really doing?

1386
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:58,960
So people sometimes assume, oh yeah, all that glycolysis and it's for biomass and building

1387
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,960
blocks.

1388
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,160
Oh yeah, the mitochondria has a negligible contribution.

1389
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,540
It's just sort of in the background.

1390
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,900
It's the potato, as we call it.

1391
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,900
In the Sabatini world.

1392
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,900
Yeah, right.

1393
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,140
It's just, it's a bystander.

1394
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:15,360
And we did a simple genetic experiment said, let's just test this.

1395
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,160
So we're going to take in a mouse with an intact immune system.

1396
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,800
We gave the mouse, made it have poor mouse, got lung adenocarcinoma, lung cancer, right?

1397
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,880
The biggest cancer in the most prevalent cancer in the world, obviously due to smoking.

1398
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,520
And we genetically knocked out the respiratory chain.

1399
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,740
So it can respire.

1400
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:37,620
So now it's 100% glycolysis.

1401
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,640
It's exactly what a tumor that Warburg would love.

1402
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,760
Do you make bigger tumors?

1403
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,240
According to him, yes.

1404
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:49,160
If it's all about glycolysis, or do you make smaller tumors?

1405
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:54,440
We made very smaller tumors, little, little, tiny little tumors, which told us that mitochondria

1406
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:59,880
are necessary or mitochondrial respiration is necessary for tumor genesis.

1407
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,600
But van der Heiden's hypothesis would explain that because if you knock out the mitochondria,

1408
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,600
you don't have the biomass through.

1409
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,600
But he didn't say that in that.

1410
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,600
No, no, no, I know, I know, but I'm extrapolated from what-

1411
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,600
Yeah, it's consistent with that.

1412
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,680
Yeah, no, Matt and I completely agree.

1413
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,840
It's just the way that review was written 10 years ago.

1414
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,560
It was more glycolytic centric.

1415
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,440
So I will give a cheap plug to a review that I wrote with Ralph Debradinis.

1416
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,520
It's a very elegant review by the way.

1417
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,600
2016, where we updated this.

1418
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,800
It's called Fundamentals of Cancer Metabolism.

1419
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
And it's really simple.

1420
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,080
It just says, if you go back to your biochemistry books and you ask, how do you make a nucleotide?

1421
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,080
Let's keep that simple.

1422
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,240
You need to make new DNA because cancers proliferate.

1423
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,840
You make one to two daughter cells, to four.

1424
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,120
And there you go.

1425
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,960
So where does that nucleotide, it looks like a structure.

1426
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,480
It has a ribose as a backbone that comes from glucose.

1427
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,060
Bingo.

1428
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:54,560
It needs a variety of nitrogen atoms put on it.

1429
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,760
What does that all come from?

1430
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,240
Some of it comes from like a spartan and glutamine.

1431
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,200
Where do they all come from?

1432
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,120
They can come from glucose and they're amino acids.

1433
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,120
But they're amino acids, but they'll come from mitochondria.

1434
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,120
Yeah.

1435
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,120
Right?

1436
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,280
So in other words, they both are...

1437
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:14,440
One of my favorite words, they're both necessary for tumor genesis, but neither is sufficient.

1438
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,560
Oh, can we just pause for a moment?

1439
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,480
Unnecessary but not sufficient.

1440
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:23,920
If there's one thing that I loved in medical school when you were doing the basic science

1441
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,920
classes before you got into the clinic, it's that when you were doing your physiology classes

1442
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,440
and your molecular biology and things like that, these professors, they were so great

1443
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,160
at explaining the importance of very elegant experiments that can demonstrate whether something

1444
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,240
is necessary but not sufficient, sufficient but not necessary, neither necessary nor sufficient,

1445
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,280
you know, all those other things.

1446
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Something happens in medical school when you leave the classroom and you start to go into

1447
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,360
clinical medicine.

1448
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,400
People start to forget that logic.

1449
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,440
I would say the real logic people forget, everybody does.

1450
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,520
We're all guilty of this.

1451
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:04,520
And this is what you and I have talked extensively about, correlation versus causality.

1452
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:10,880
So my daughter can bitch all she wants about how her papa hasn't taught her any math, but

1453
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,200
her papa has taught her one thing, correlation versus causality.

1454
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,080
But this goes even deeper than that, right?

1455
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,080
You got to start there.

1456
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,080
Oh, yeah.

1457
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,080
Fundamentally.

1458
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,080
But I think people...

1459
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
I mean, this is...

1460
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:29,820
And right now, even in my world where people see like mitochondrial function go up or down.

1461
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,120
So like take your aging one.

1462
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,440
Yes, mitochondrial function goes down.

1463
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,440
So that's a correlation with aging.

1464
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:42,520
That doesn't mean that decrease in mitochondrial function causes aging or drives aging.

1465
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,520
It's just a correlation.

1466
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,560
It could be adaptive or maladaptive.

1467
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,560
That's right.

1468
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,560
I mean, that's...

1469
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,000
So see, to me, the second order point is the right point.

1470
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,600
The obvious point is you can't infer causality.

1471
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,480
But the second order point to that is if there is causality, it doesn't tell you if it's

1472
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,880
adaptive or maladaptive.

1473
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,160
That's the nuance.

1474
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:03,880
And this idea of necessary but not sufficient to me is very important in biology because

1475
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,880
you can have things that are causal, necessary but not sufficient.

1476
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,880
I just told you one.

1477
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,880
Exactly.

1478
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,680
Causal, sufficient but not necessary.

1479
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:19,120
And most of all, causal neither necessary nor sufficient.

1480
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,560
And people love to dismiss those things.

1481
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,800
I'll give you an example.

1482
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,640
Smoking and lung cancer.

1483
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,840
There's never been a trial.

1484
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,120
I'm going to argue smoking is causal with lung cancer, just as I'll argue that smoking

1485
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:36,080
is causal with cardiovascular disease through different mechanisms, endothelial dysfunction

1486
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,240
in the latter.

1487
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,520
But no one in their right mind would say that smoking is either necessary nor sufficient.

1488
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,260
Lots of smokers don't get lung cancer.

1489
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,280
Lots of smokers don't get heart disease.

1490
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:50,240
Lots of people who get heart disease and lung cancer don't smoke.

1491
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,920
So isn't it interesting that you can have something that is neither necessary nor sufficient

1492
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,360
and yet can play a causal role in a disease?

1493
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,800
Again, people might be listening going, what the hell is he making such a big deal out

1494
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,800
of this for?

1495
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,040
I make a big deal out of this for because when you get to complex diseases like cancer

1496
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:12,280
and Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis, it is very unlikely you will find something

1497
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,760
that is necessary and sufficient.

1498
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,280
They're very rare to find those exceptions.

1499
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,480
These are such multifaceted diseases and there are so many different ways to skin a cat.

1500
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:25,680
You know, when you talk about cardiovascular disease, you've got like four completely different

1501
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,440
things that have to be going on to cause this disease.

1502
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,160
You have to have lipoproteins trafficking the sterols into the sub endothelial space.

1503
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:38,360
You have to have the endothelial dysfunction to enable that to get in there and get retained.

1504
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,820
You have to have the inflammatory response.

1505
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,720
You take one of those things away, you change the dynamic of the disease.

1506
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,360
And your other point is a great one.

1507
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,800
Even if you can infer causality, it's not entirely clear what's adaptive and what's

1508
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
maladaptive.

1509
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,880
So our experiments really showed this mitochondria's necessary tumor genesis.

1510
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,080
So it's interesting that paper you referred to, Mandarhan and I were graduate students

1511
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,240
together in postdoc.

1512
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,320
When I was starting my postdoc, he was sort of finishing his graduate training with Craig

1513
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,840
Thompson and we were in the same lab and we actually worked together.

1514
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,280
So he's an old friend of mine and obviously Craig's a former mentor and I like Luke Antley

1515
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,280
a lot.

1516
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:21,960
But that paper when it came out in 2009, right around at that point when it came out in science,

1517
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:28,360
we had sent our paper to science and showing that mitochondria and is a tumor genesis,

1518
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,360
they didn't send it out.

1519
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,760
They said, oh, come on, this is no.

1520
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:38,240
So then we sent it to 11 other journals.

1521
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,200
No editors sent it out.

1522
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:47,040
Cancer cells, cell nature, nature medicine, you know, nature cell biology, general clinical

1523
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:54,840
medicine, nobody sent it out because the review didn't say mitochondria are not functional.

1524
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,800
It just didn't mention anything about mitochondria.

1525
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,160
It sort of just provided an explanation of the glucose, like glucose to lactate.

1526
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,720
Why do tumors show that?

1527
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,760
And it's for the biomass, not the energy, right?

1528
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,520
That was the point.

1529
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,160
And it didn't say it was sort of agnostic about mitochondria, right?

1530
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:16,040
And the review if you go back, but people misinterpret that and saying, oh yeah, mitochondria

1531
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,040
are not necessary.

1532
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,480
It's all about glycolysis.

1533
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,080
Let's target glycolysis.

1534
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,000
So eventually the paper did get published in PNAS.

1535
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And I think that sort of started, I would argue, the revolution of looking at mitochondria

1536
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,080
and cancer.

1537
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,280
Other people were doing it as well.

1538
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,520
But I sort of became a preacher just pointing it out.

1539
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,280
Look, if you inhibit the respiratory chain, you can decrease tumor genesis.

1540
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:44,200
Ten years later, to the best of my knowledge, and this is really important because it goes

1541
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:50,640
back to the clinic, as far as I know, there are no clinical drugs in the clinic that are

1542
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,040
necessarily targeting glycolysis.

1543
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:57,320
Right now, there are potentially two drugs that target the mitochondria.

1544
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,480
What do they target specifically?

1545
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:04,560
So one of them is a complex one inhibitor that the folks at MD Anderson have generated.

1546
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,160
And they just published two papers in Nature Medicine showing-

1547
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,680
Different from Fennformin.

1548
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,680
They're Fennformin, yeah.

1549
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,200
They're different from Metformin and Fennformin.

1550
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,680
They're much stronger.

1551
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,680
They know the binding side.

1552
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:20,560
By the way, they use the same yeast, NDI1, complex one that doesn't bind to Metformin

1553
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,040
but doesn't bind to their drug as well to show-

1554
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,040
Test it.

1555
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,040
Test it.

1556
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,960
So how will they prevent toxicity?

1557
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,760
Yes, yes.

1558
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,800
So now they're doing a trial in AML.

1559
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,360
And so this is a million dollar question.

1560
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:39,600
And can you find a therapeutic window where maybe the drug gets taken up preferentially

1561
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:46,000
by, just because of the properties, by leukemic cells or prostate or lung cancer cells, but

1562
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,040
spares the brain, the heart and other organs where you could have toxicity.

1563
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,920
So that's the big issue.

1564
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,720
The good news is if you inhibit complex one, it will decrease tumor genesis.

1565
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,960
The bad news is it might kill you, right?

1566
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,320
So we've got to find that window.

1567
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,200
And does it also work well with immunotherapy?

1568
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,240
That's an open question, right?

1569
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,560
Which is then the new kid on the block.

1570
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:14,600
Does it help synergize with immunotherapy or does it prevent the immune function?

1571
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,120
So all of this has to be worked out.

1572
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,380
But my point is that there's some space in this area.

1573
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:25,560
The other one is a drug by Rafaela Pharmaceuticals and full disclosure, I sit on their scientific

1574
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,560
advisory board.

1575
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,560
Thank you.

1576
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,240
And I'm not pitching anything here simply.

1577
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,560
In fact, they were already doing this stuff.

1578
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,420
We're just sort of giving them some, you know, my little biological insight, which is I'm

1579
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,420
trying to provide today.

1580
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:40,820
But they've already done a clinical trial and I'll send it to you.

1581
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,820
It was published in Landsend Oncology.

1582
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:45,420
And it was in panicuretic cancer, just a safety trial.

1583
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:46,420
Phase one.

1584
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,420
Phase one.

1585
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:50,140
And it targets alpha-keto, TCA cycle enzymes.

1586
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:55,340
So it's preventing the TCA cycle from functioning to build that biomass.

1587
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:59,660
And did they generate any data on the tissue specificity of that agent?

1588
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:00,660
Not yet.

1589
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,860
So this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done to try that drug and do the kind of

1590
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:10,700
experiments where you can see TCA cycle metabolites changing pre and post drug treatment of a

1591
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:16,100
particular tumor and then correlating that with success of remission and, you know, all

1592
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,580
the usual parameters.

1593
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:22,420
Now what's interesting about that drug, again, is why would that be safe?

1594
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,420
Any of this.

1595
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:26,660
The only way these drugs can be safe is they somehow preferentially are getting more into

1596
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,660
the tumors than-

1597
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:32,820
Or they're just so weak that they're not bringing you below the threshold of shutting

1598
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,820
off the TCA.

1599
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,820
Yeah.

1600
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:35,940
And maybe they combine well.

1601
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:42,300
So I can tell you, if you give the standard care of therapy cisplatin, one of the chemotherapies

1602
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:47,540
or targeted therapies like BRAF inhibitors, is what happens, as you know, the primary

1603
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,020
tumor sort of debulks, right?

1604
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,780
It slows down and slowly you get resistance and then it comes back.

1605
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:58,420
During that slow resistance phase, at that point, they're really dependent on mitochondrial

1606
01:29:58,420 --> 01:29:59,540
function.

1607
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:04,660
So there might be a window to attack it with like BRAF inhibitors or cisplatin.

1608
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:07,660
And again, like everything else, they're going to have to find that sweet spot.

1609
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:10,020
See, to me, that's where I think this has to go.

1610
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:14,060
I mean, I've always found immunotherapy to be the most elegant of all approaches to cancer.

1611
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:17,420
I'm highly biased because that's what I studied.

1612
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:23,060
But ultimately I think the Swiss cheese approach has to be the approach too, which is why would

1613
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:25,380
we only take one modality of therapy?

1614
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:29,940
If you're David and you're trying to slay Goliath in the fairy tale, one stone to the

1615
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,940
head does it.

1616
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:35,900
And in the real world, to take a Goliath down, I think you need to bang him at the knees

1617
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:39,180
and when he bends over and complains about it, bang him in the other knee.

1618
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:41,540
And when he's complaining about that, whack him in the hamstring.

1619
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:47,420
And in other words, you've got to be able to do successive blows to a vulnerable cell.

1620
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:51,100
And that's going to be, yeah, when is it most dependent on the mitochondria?

1621
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:54,020
Okay, well, bang, now you hit with that therapy.

1622
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:58,580
And then all of a sudden, to your point earlier, maybe at some point you begin to weaken it,

1623
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:02,780
you make it more identifiable from an immune perspective and bang, that's when you would

1624
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:04,220
hit with the immunotherapy.

1625
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:09,140
The last point I really like, would the immune system recognize that tumor better if the

1626
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:12,260
mitochondria of that tumor was not working properly?

1627
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:16,180
Yeah, see that's, I mean, I'm super- Or maybe release that mitochondrial DNA, for

1628
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,860
example, as it's dying.

1629
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,140
As long as it were specific, right?

1630
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,940
As long as it didn't create a diffuse immune reaction, but instead-

1631
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:23,940
A localized-

1632
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:27,060
Allowed the body to say that's not self.

1633
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,060
Right.

1634
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,700
And I haven't done a podcast yet on immunotherapy.

1635
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:34,060
I want to have Steve Rosenberg on to talk about this because, I mean, who better to

1636
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,060
talk about this with?

1637
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,180
But anyway, so let's talk about another issue in cancer, right?

1638
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:44,500
Which is, I mean, I think everybody agrees that most cancers involve somatic mutations.

1639
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:48,060
There are very few cancers that involve germline mutations.

1640
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,660
Those are the exceptions.

1641
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:53,580
But the general one is these are acquired mutations.

1642
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:58,660
Now some have argued, and this is a very minority opinion, but some have argued that

1643
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:05,260
the somatic mutations of the nuclear genome are actually the result of the mitochondrial

1644
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,980
dysfunction.

1645
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:12,660
I think the majority would argue, no, it's the other way around that the nuclear genomic

1646
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:18,660
mutations somatic are actually what leads to ultimately whatever's happening in the

1647
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:23,500
mitochondria that may be dysfunctional, may be maladaptive, may be adaptive.

1648
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,860
You would be in the latter camp, correct?

1649
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:26,860
Completely.

1650
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,860
100%.

1651
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:30,540
And again, this is why this clinical trials are really important.

1652
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:33,280
This is why the metformin trial is important, right?

1653
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,900
So I've told you two things.

1654
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,300
I've told you three points and it's that are quite contrarian.

1655
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:43,180
We started with antioxidants, that there's no evidence that antioxidants in large scale,

1656
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:49,620
the dietary antioxidants, just to be clear, vitamin E, vitamin C, have had any benefit

1657
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:52,260
to mankind and womankind, right?

1658
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,140
For human health and disease.

1659
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,480
It just hasn't worked out.

1660
01:32:55,480 --> 01:33:02,020
So either we haven't built the right antioxidants or the theory that Ross and oxidants are bad,

1661
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:03,020
that theory is off.

1662
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:09,900
And I would argue that theory is off because if anything, normally we use oxidants as signaling

1663
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,900
molecules.

1664
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:14,980
The second thing I told you about is the fact that during aging, yeah, it might have conjured

1665
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:20,340
decline, but that correlates and it could be adaptive, very contrarian point of view.

1666
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:28,020
If anything, if you gave an agent that decreases mitochondrial function, like metformin, that

1667
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:32,220
that could be a good anti-aging therapy, right?

1668
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,580
It's not turning on mitochondria, but turning off mitochondria.

1669
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:37,180
And by the way, Andy Dillon, a good friend of mine I was there with yesterday, who's

1670
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:40,580
done beautiful work on worms.

1671
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:45,140
Clearly in the worm, when you decrease complex one or three, you live longer as a worm.

1672
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:49,900
Yeah, I don't know Andy, but David has spoken so highly of him, David Sabatini, you have

1673
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,900
as well.

1674
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:54,340
I need to meet Andy and hopefully interview him at some point and talk about all this

1675
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,340
stuff.

1676
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:59,500
Of course, it could be going back to your point that the inhibition of complex one,

1677
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:06,980
which inhibits mitochondrial function inside of a non-toxic range might not actually be

1678
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:09,620
part of why metformin makes you live longer.

1679
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:14,180
That might just be a, it survives despite that, not because of that, the organism.

1680
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:18,740
Yeah, I would argue that metformin being anti-inflammatory and-

1681
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,980
I want to come back to you, Andy, inflammatory in a second.

1682
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:21,980
Yeah, we'll come back to that.

1683
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:28,860
So the third point is that like colitis is necessary, but so is mitochondria, that cancer

1684
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:34,220
cells use a robust mitochondrial function.

1685
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:39,900
And if that function doesn't work, the TCA cycle or the respiratory chain doesn't work

1686
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,820
in most cancers, you don't get tumors.

1687
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:48,460
Now there are these rare cancers where it has a TCA cycle mutation.

1688
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,700
And so this is another sort of logic point, right?

1689
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:54,540
So they look at that rare phenomenon, the exception to the rule.

1690
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:59,060
And some people say, oh, there are these rare cancers that have a TCA cycle mutation.

1691
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,940
Aha, therefore, cancers have TCA cycle mutations.

1692
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:04,940
Oh, come on, this is illogical.

1693
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:10,620
It's the exception to the rule of most cancers, at least that we've studied, whether it's

1694
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:15,660
in cell culture, in mouse models, and my good friend, Ralph Debradinis, who's doing glucose,

1695
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:19,020
he's doing trace certain experiments like Joshua Benowitz has done as well.

1696
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:23,500
They can clearly show the TCA cycle is quite robust.

1697
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:29,420
And so why those cancers can arise is an interesting question, but they're the exception to the

1698
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:30,420
rule.

1699
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,420
So I'm in that camp.

1700
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,420
Well, and the other, I guess, point to it.

1701
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:36,180
And if I'm right, by the way, then these drugs, if they make it in the clinic and really make

1702
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,820
a difference, voila.

1703
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:43,940
The other thing that I think would favor the genomic argument is a lot of the viral research,

1704
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:50,380
because when we see viral vectors driving cancer, it's presumably nuclear DNA.

1705
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:54,620
I'm not aware, are there viruses that are causing cancer through infecting mitochondrial

1706
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,620
DNA?

1707
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,620
I don't believe that.

1708
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,500
I think it's all nuclear, personally.

1709
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,500
So that would be another...

1710
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,620
Yeah, if anything, so renal cell carcinomas are really...

1711
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:07,060
So you know these oncocytomas, you know what they are, benign tumors, essentially.

1712
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:10,060
If you look at renal cancer...

1713
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:14,820
Just for the listener to understand, meaning they still grow in a somewhat unregulated

1714
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:16,880
way, but they don't have metastatic potential.

1715
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,340
So you're not going to die from these things, but they're benign growing tumors.

1716
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:26,780
Even those, the major mutation that they have is in the respiratory chain.

1717
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:33,060
So in other words, again, they're very rare, but sometimes you do get complex one loss,

1718
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,420
but you don't get an aggressive tumor.

1719
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:36,340
You get this benign tumor at best.

1720
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:39,580
So again, it's almost a barrier to progression.

1721
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,140
And that's from human genetic data.

1722
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:47,300
So I'm in the camp, but ultimately we can do all these cute little mouse experiments

1723
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:51,120
and the data is very clear in our hands and Ralph's hand and Josh's hands and lots of

1724
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:57,000
people's and the mitochondria necessary for tumor genesis, TCA cycle activity.

1725
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,620
The ultimate proof is, well, let's inhibit the TCA cycle for prostate cancer, for colon

1726
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:06,500
cancer, for pancreatic, and does it make a difference with immunotherapy or chemotherapy?

1727
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,660
So we'll see.

1728
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:15,620
And by the way, the same one goes to metformin, which is that if metformin really does work

1729
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:20,020
as a potentially as an anti-aging strategy and we can show that those effects are due

1730
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:24,980
to complex one inhibition, then it's hard to think why that, you know, that might, this

1731
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:31,980
idea that mitochondria rate limiting or declining to a point during aging that's injurious,

1732
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:35,880
that idea can't hold up because you're giving essentially a weak complex one inhibitor to

1733
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:40,920
turn on stress responses, which means you must have enough mitochondrial activity as

1734
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:41,920
you age.

1735
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,760
It's down, but not gone, right?

1736
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,760
Right.

1737
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,760
Right.

1738
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,760
Enough to not be rate limiting.

1739
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,720
And of course the antioxidant one, we've already won that battle, right?

1740
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,400
Because the trials have all failed.

1741
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,920
And for the person listening to this who's scratching their head and confused and says,

1742
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:01,320
does this mean I shouldn't be taking my vitamin C or my vitamin E or my Whole Foods proprietary

1743
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:05,840
antioxidant blend of blueberry skin?

1744
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:06,840
I think you're right.

1745
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:11,480
The answer is pretty clear that the harm of taking those things might not be great, but

1746
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,440
the benefits seems to be negligible to nowhere.

1747
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:15,440
That's a fair statement.

1748
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:22,080
Are there benefits you think to the natural quantities of antioxidants we consume in our

1749
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,080
food?

1750
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:27,040
So, for example, berries do contain lots of antioxidants.

1751
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,760
I would love to talk about those benefits without saying go up and take ground berry

1752
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,600
capsules or something like that.

1753
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,880
Do you still think there is a benefit in having ... In other words, if a berry doesn't give

1754
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,600
you benefit in the antioxidant, there's not a hell of a lot of benefit in it because it's

1755
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:47,120
basically just a vehicle to deliver fructose, which I could argue you don't need any fructose

1756
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,120
in your life.

1757
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:51,920
And it's a vehicle to deliver glucose, but you can get glucose in better forms or more

1758
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,000
of it elsewhere.

1759
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,760
So is there some other benefit?

1760
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,640
So I don't know much about berries, so the best one is vitamin C, right?

1761
01:38:58,640 --> 01:38:59,840
Like how much should you take?

1762
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,880
Okay, so let's talk about an orange.

1763
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,840
Is there some benefit in eating an orange?

1764
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,840
Yes.

1765
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,920
Okay, so what's the benefit in eating an orange from an antioxidant standpoint?

1766
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:14,240
Yes, so there are enzymes that control DNA methylation and other reactions.

1767
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:23,040
So simply to maintain proper function of gene expression so that your genes turn on and

1768
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:30,040
off properly, there are enzymes that are dependent on vitamin C. And you basically

1769
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,680
need about an orange a day or a glass of orange juice.

1770
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,680
Please please please.

1771
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,680
Not orange juice.

1772
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,520
Not orange juice, fine fine fine.

1773
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:43,360
But what I mean is you don't need to take 10 oranges, right?

1774
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,800
An orange a day is enough, right?

1775
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,440
To give you enough vitamin C to make those reactions work properly.

1776
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:54,160
And one or two oranges, but you don't need to then go and take 400.

1777
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:57,760
But that has nothing to do with the antioxidant properties of vitamin C.

1778
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1779
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,320
It has nothing to do with the, nothing to do with the Ross and all of this stuff we

1780
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,320
talked about.

1781
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:08,120
It has to do with running some enzymes that are important for controlling gene expression.

1782
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:14,080
I know those genes that have to get turned on and off are dependent on those.

1783
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:18,920
And of course there are some people who might not be taking, getting into vitamin C due to

1784
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:19,920
their diet.

1785
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:20,920
They go, they go, they go.

1786
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:21,920
Yeah, they go.

1787
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,920
Pretty hard to do that.

1788
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,920
Pretty hard to do it.

1789
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,440
I mean, citric acid, I mean, you know, we have it a lot of places.

1790
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:32,960
Would you be comfortable speculating that a cancer patient in particular should avoid

1791
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:33,960
antioxidants?

1792
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:39,080
No, no, I don't think, I don't think the dietary, well, let me rephrase my question.

1793
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,080
I don't mean through dietary means, but through supplemental means.

1794
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:46,800
Like if any patient could actually be harmed by an antioxidant, could it be a cancer patient?

1795
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,400
Well, the, one of the trials, the lung cancer trial argued that I think was a vitamin E

1796
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,320
trial and they did worse.

1797
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,280
And in mice you can recapitulate that.

1798
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,280
So why is that?

1799
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,580
It's not clear.

1800
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:04,600
So I personally don't take any of these supplements because I think I've got a reasonable diet.

1801
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,600
So just like you.

1802
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,160
So why don't you take metformin?

1803
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:12,560
I will not take anything unless it's done, any drug, unless it's gone through a rigorous

1804
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,560
clinical trial.

1805
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:14,560
That's just my own bias.

1806
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,200
Now some people would say, okay, you're aging now.

1807
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:22,360
So you're going to, by the time they do a trial, you may not be around.

1808
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,320
So why not take a chance, right?

1809
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:28,200
Lots of people argue this about NAD boosting pills, right?

1810
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:32,600
That you should just take any D boosting pill by the time people do a clinical trial and

1811
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,600
all of that.

1812
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,080
It'll take years and years and years.

1813
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:40,760
And for those people who are already later in life, you know, go ahead and take metformin.

1814
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:46,200
So putting your bias aside, because inherent in your bias is an assumption, which is the

1815
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:51,040
risk of taking it is greater than the benefit of not taking it.

1816
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,880
So either you don't think the benefit is that much or you think the risk is maybe greater

1817
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,160
than some do.

1818
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:02,400
And you're certainly somebody who's in a position to evaluate both.

1819
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,280
So tell me where it fails.

1820
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:08,080
Is it a not enough benefit or a too much risk problem?

1821
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,520
Actually I'm not convinced about how much benefit.

1822
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,680
For someone like me who exercises especially, right?

1823
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:20,200
I mean, the best effect of metformin and it's still it's anti-diabetic effect.

1824
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:26,280
And you and I both know you lift weights, you run, you're active, you sort of mimic

1825
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,480
the effects of metformin in many ways.

1826
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,600
Activist is AMPK, you get the muscle benefits.

1827
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,240
So why should I take that?

1828
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:38,960
Now you could say, well, maybe for as an anti-cancer prevention agent, maybe the data

1829
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:44,160
as an anti-cancer, we'll see where that pans out as a large scale trial that's going to

1830
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,160
come out.

1831
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,440
Wait, you're not talking about tame, are you?

1832
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,880
No, no, not tame is the anti-aging trial.

1833
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,360
That won't be done for another five years.

1834
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,360
There's a breast cancer.

1835
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,360
Will that ever be done?

1836
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,360
Yeah, I think so.

1837
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,360
I think so.

1838
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:58,760
But if you're healthy and you're active, it's hard to see why you would take it.

1839
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:04,160
Now of course you could argue that as you've aged, you've gotten some indication that things

1840
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:11,000
aren't working as well and therefore you should help take it as a compliment, whatever loss

1841
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,200
you had.

1842
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:19,400
Maybe you're a little diabetic, maybe the one place I'm rethinking about metformin a

1843
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:24,920
lot is whether it's a mild anti-inflammatory agent.

1844
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:29,680
So in other words, it sort of keeps inflammation down all the time and whether the effect of

1845
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:35,440
that over 20, 30 years, if you and I are sort of in our 40s and that would have a benefit

1846
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,760
20, 30 years later.

1847
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,680
What's the mechanism by which, I'm glad you brought that up because I forgot to revisit

1848
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:41,680
it.

1849
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:48,040
And one of my favorite trials is the Cantos trial where they basically targeted IL-1 beta,

1850
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,440
a pro-inflammatory agent directly.

1851
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,640
And it didn't change the lipid profile.

1852
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,520
But it reduced cardiac mortality.

1853
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:58,120
Exactly, which tells you that inflammation is...

1854
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,120
Oh yeah.

1855
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:03,160
And there's going to be another trial announced very soon that I think will show similar results

1856
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,920
using low-dothymacetrexate.

1857
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:08,720
Of course, I could be proved wrong and maybe that's not, I don't know what the trial is

1858
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,960
going to show, but that's the hypothesis.

1859
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,200
Let's take as a fact, just for the sake of time, that lowering inflammation has wonderful

1860
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,200
benefits.

1861
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:19,040
What's the mechanism by which metformin will reduce inflammation?

1862
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:25,540
So we think that reactive oxygen species, the free radicals, can serve as signaling

1863
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:28,480
molecules to activate cytokines.

1864
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:33,760
And metformin by inhibiting the respiratory chain, which is a major site of those reactive

1865
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:40,600
oxygen species, decreases reactive oxygen species and decreases cytokine in production.

1866
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,040
And again, a little bit, right?

1867
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,880
It's a weak inhibitor of the respiratory chain.

1868
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,240
So if you knock out the respiratory chain completely, you can never turn on the cytokines.

1869
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,240
You've got a bigger problem.

1870
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,240
You've got a bigger problem.

1871
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,140
You get a bacterial infection, et cetera.

1872
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:57,560
So this is just, again, dampening it enough that if you get an infection, you can still

1873
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,720
respond.

1874
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:04,360
But just keeping the set point where you're at a little bit lower and whether that has

1875
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:09,160
good effects over 30 years, 20 years of keeping inflammation down.

1876
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:13,040
And then there may be some benefit to that.

1877
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:18,200
So then one other place you might want to do it is if you live in Beijing or in Delhi,

1878
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:21,920
because pollution increases inflammation.

1879
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,920
That's well known.

1880
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,080
It increases IL-6, right?

1881
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:29,520
So in those sort of places, taking something that might decrease inflammation might be

1882
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,520
helpful potentially.

1883
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:35,920
And how robust are the data on the immune modulating or inflammatory modulating benefits

1884
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,920
of metformin?

1885
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,960
Is that relatively, I mean, it's not as strong as the other stuff we've talked about, is

1886
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:40,960
it?

1887
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,960
No.

1888
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:48,840
I mean, I think there's not that many papers on it to be determined, but it's something

1889
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:56,160
that we're thinking a lot about as a mechanism of why it might have anti-aging properties.

1890
01:45:56,160 --> 01:46:00,560
Well, look, speaking of anti-aging, let's go back to NAD because we sort of skirted

1891
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,640
around a little bit.

1892
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:05,760
Obviously, one of the most popular types of supplements being offered on the market today,

1893
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:13,120
and there are several of them, are supplements that are aimed at delivering precursors to

1894
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,440
NAD production.

1895
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:20,760
So again, the logic here is it's generally well regarded that cells can't take up free

1896
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,080
NAD.

1897
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,720
They have to make their own NAD.

1898
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:28,200
Josh and Rabinowitz and colleagues actually published a paper in June of this year that

1899
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:32,400
demonstrated that the NAD must be made in the cytoplasm, not in the mitochondria, and

1900
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,560
it's actually transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.

1901
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:38,400
And these supplements mainly went to the liver first.

1902
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,480
Well, even before that, but just to explain the logic, the logic is you can make NAD from

1903
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:48,400
NR or NMN, and NR and NMN exist in equilibrium, if I'm not mistaken.

1904
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,680
And the de novo pathway, which is from tryptophan.

1905
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,680
That's right.

1906
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,680
As well.

1907
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:58,600
So by giving these precursors, the cells can take those up and presumably make NAD there

1908
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:05,640
and get more of that NAD into the mitochondria, where presumably it, I think the main argument,

1909
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:10,440
if I'm not mistaken, is actually not around the ETC, the ethylene transport chain, but

1910
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:16,720
more around having them as cofactors for the sirtuins, because the sirtuins of course play

1911
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:22,240
these two roles of acetylating, deacetylating as gene regulators.

1912
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,840
They're basically turning on and off genes.

1913
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,360
So I think the thinking is, and again, I don't want to speak out of turn.

1914
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:33,360
This is not my area of expertise, but more NAD should be an important cofactor for sirtuins,

1915
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:38,560
which are a NAD dependent histone deacetylases, HDEX.

1916
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,560
Is that, did I get the story mostly right?

1917
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1918
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,560
Okay.

1919
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,560
I mean, that's the simplest hypothesis.

1920
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,200
NAD levels decline in aging.

1921
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,880
You lose sirtuin activity declines, which is not good.

1922
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,920
Right, because you now lose the ability to control gene expression either on or off.

1923
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:58,040
You boost the NAD as it's declining and you get a little bit increase in sirtuin activity.

1924
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,280
Right, right, which so totally makes sense conceptually.

1925
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,360
So I think what Josh did is a great experiment.

1926
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,080
He basically asked when you take these supplements, where do they go?

1927
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,800
And a lot of it goes to the liver.

1928
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,840
Eventually it makes its way into other tissues, because there was this simple idea like it's

1929
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,280
going to get into the brain easily.

1930
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,400
It's going to go to your heart.

1931
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,040
It's going to go everywhere and it's going to do exactly what you said and therefore

1932
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:20,440
have all these magical properties.

1933
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:28,040
I think the place where NAD supplements and metformin start to cross talk is two places.

1934
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,880
The first is it goes to the liver.

1935
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:36,240
So it might be having some metabolically healthy effects on the liver like metformin, similar

1936
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:38,440
to like what metformin does, potentially.

1937
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,280
It's a hypothesis, by the way.

1938
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:43,160
The second one is I think it gets into immune cells.

1939
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:47,880
You think that NR, let's just make it simple and talk about NR because that's the preparation

1940
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,920
that's more commercially available.

1941
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:51,480
You think that NR is being taken up by immune cells.

1942
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,480
Potentially.

1943
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,960
But wouldn't Josh's paper contradict that?

1944
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,960
I don't remember if they looked at all the immune cells.

1945
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,680
Well, I don't think they did, but it isn't the takeaway from Josh's paper that the first

1946
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:05,400
pass effect is so significant that all of the NR was getting taken up by the liver.

1947
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:08,320
But it still circulates in the blood, right?

1948
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,600
And your immune cells are in the blood.

1949
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,120
So I don't know.

1950
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:15,320
And by the way, in Josh's paper, he also said that the liver, once it makes a downstream

1951
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:18,600
products of NR, it distributes it back into circulation to the rest of the tissue.

1952
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:19,880
What did it deliver, remind me?

1953
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,880
Was it delivering NAD?

1954
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:21,880
No, no.

1955
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,880
It was delivering what downstream product?

1956
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:24,880
I think it was NAMM.

1957
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,880
Okay.

1958
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:26,880
Yeah, I don't remember.

1959
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,080
And can NAMM be taken up by the other cells?

1960
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,080
Yeah.

1961
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,480
And can NAMM work its way back?

1962
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,120
I don't remember the paper, yeah.

1963
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:36,000
Well, I'll put you on the spot with something that's not your world.

1964
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,400
Well, no, it's not, again, pathways.

1965
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,400
I'll talk with Josh.

1966
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,040
But I think the more simpler point is, is what I think Josh's paper is getting at and

1967
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:50,200
what you're getting at is, really, this stuff gets everywhere and has magical properties?

1968
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:55,360
And then he starts to argue, well, it goes onto the liver or only to certain tissues.

1969
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:00,360
And I'm just arguing that a tissue, if you can call it, is not really, but a compartment

1970
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:06,280
that we don't think about enough of whether it's with metformin or NAD supplements, air,

1971
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:07,640
the inflammatory cells.

1972
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,800
So what would an inflammatory cell?

1973
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,400
How would it benefit from having more NAD?

1974
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,200
Well, I mean, again, for the same reasons, right?

1975
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,200
The sirtuin reason?

1976
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,200
Yeah.

1977
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,200
Yeah.

1978
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:22,280
Or some other NAD-dependent process that in an immune cell that might be important.

1979
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:25,240
And by the way, there is an enzyme that gets rid of NAD.

1980
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:28,160
It's an NADase, basically, CD38.

1981
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,880
It's most abundant on immune cells.

1982
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,880
Yeah.

1983
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:31,880
So there's an immune connection.

1984
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:34,920
I didn't realize there was much CD38 off immune cells.

1985
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:35,920
I mean, depends.

1986
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,920
Yeah, yeah.

1987
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,920
No, I mean, I'm not disagreeing with you.

1988
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:38,920
I just didn't know that.

1989
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:42,640
I was a little bit out of my wheelhouse, but I'm just speculating that there might

1990
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:50,000
be a connection between these supplements as basically working as mild anti-inflammatory

1991
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
agents.

1992
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,880
Now, of course, the other way that these things are typically delivered is through intravenous

1993
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,560
NAD, which says, hey, you don't need to make it.

1994
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,560
We'll give it to you.

1995
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,400
We know you can't take NAD orally, so you have to do it intravenously.

1996
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,040
There, I think it went everywhere in that paper, right?

1997
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,160
But does it get into the cells?

1998
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:08,960
Is there a cell that can take up NAD?

1999
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:14,040
I don't think so, but again, I don't remember Josh.

2000
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:17,640
I asked for the next podcast.

2001
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:21,080
We have stated away from NAD biology.

2002
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:23,760
It's been quite a contentious field.

2003
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,600
As you know, Josh and others are doing really nice experiments.

2004
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,800
We've avoided NAD.

2005
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,240
What we haven't avoided is NAD to NADH ratio, right?

2006
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,040
Because that's linked to complex one function.

2007
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,920
That's what my performance tweak is.

2008
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:44,200
And NAD to NADH ratio, to the best of my knowledge, isn't controlling sirtuins or we don't have

2009
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:45,400
great evidence for that.

2010
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,120
NAD itself might be.

2011
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:55,760
But what NAD and NADH ratio is doing biologically, or how does a cell process that ratio, is

2012
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,680
right now probably the thing that keeps me up at night the most.

2013
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:05,520
My favorite new theory of life, as we know, which is tied to that ratio.

2014
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:11,440
Now, speaking of supplements, you alluded to one earlier, I alluded to it, called MITO-Q.

2015
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,800
I'm getting a lot of questions from patients about this.

2016
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,800
Should I be taking this?

2017
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:16,800
Should I be taking this?

2018
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,800
Should I be taking this?

2019
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,800
Can you tell us what it is?

2020
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,800
It's basically CoQ.

2021
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,800
It's CoQ-10.

2022
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,960
So people take lots of CoQ.

2023
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:26,360
What does MITO-Q differ from the regular CoQ-10?

2024
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:32,120
It has a cation attached to it.

2025
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,600
Those mitochondria are pumping those hydrogen ions.

2026
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,120
They're quite negative in charge, like a battery, positive.

2027
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:44,120
And so it will take a molecule that is very positively charged.

2028
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:47,880
So by putting a cation on it, which is positively charged, you increase its affinity for the

2029
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:48,880
cell?

2030
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,880
Into the mitochondria.

2031
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,880
Into the mitochondria.

2032
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,880
Right.

2033
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:56,560
The problem is that therapeutic windows are very tight on that because when we give MITO-Q,

2034
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,960
we can shut off a lot of Ross production and all those beneficial stuff gone.

2035
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,560
So you put it on stem cell.

2036
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,720
Stem cells don't renew.

2037
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:08,560
You put it on immune cells because they don't get activated.

2038
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:15,520
And so I think, again, antioxidants get tough because they have normal biological roles.

2039
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,000
And is CoQ considered an antioxidant?

2040
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Coenzyme Q?

2041
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,360
The reduced form of it is, which is ubiquinol.

2042
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,360
Yes.

2043
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,360
And do you think so therefore reduced?

2044
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,080
But they're hard, by the way.

2045
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,080
You know this.

2046
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,520
Super, super hydrophobic, right?

2047
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,600
Yeah.

2048
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:34,240
Most commercially available preparations don't even seem to have any bioavailability.

2049
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:36,720
You can take a ton of them and you can't measure it in the blood.

2050
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:40,880
But there are potent ones that make their way into the blood and you can measure those

2051
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,880
levels.

2052
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,840
I think the question is, is there benefit in that?

2053
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,560
Again, your view is no.

2054
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,760
My view would be no.

2055
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:50,160
And your view is it could be harmful?

2056
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:55,080
I think a lot of these antioxidants have poor availability.

2057
01:53:55,080 --> 01:54:03,320
So in the Peter Attia 2x2 is on the x-axis you think about harm and on the y-axis you

2058
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:04,320
think about benefit.

2059
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,380
But to simplify it, even though these are continuous variables, you go with two categories.

2060
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:14,920
So on the x-axis, which is harm, you think about picking something up in front of a tricycle

2061
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:17,520
versus picking something up in front of a train.

2062
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,840
Obviously, one has much more dire consequences.

2063
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,720
And then in the benefit, it's picking up a Bitcoin versus a quarter.

2064
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:30,800
And so do you view most of these antioxidants CoQ10, MITOQ as picking up quarters in front

2065
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:36,520
of tricycles where the upside, if they work, is probably not that big but the downside

2066
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,240
is also probably not that big?

2067
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,240
Yeah.

2068
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:41,840
And do you put a metformin in that category or do you think metformin has more potential?

2069
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,840
It has more potential.

2070
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:44,160
But you still don't take it.

2071
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,320
I still don't take it.

2072
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:48,960
So you think metformin is potentially picking up a Bitcoin in front of a train?

2073
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,040
Maybe.

2074
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,280
Time will tell.

2075
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,280
Time will tell.

2076
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,720
People are now doing clinical trials with metformin for anti-cancer.

2077
01:54:55,720 --> 01:55:00,440
I mean, clearly, it's still one of the first line antidiabetic drugs.

2078
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:03,560
And people are now running them through inflammation models.

2079
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:08,160
We've done some interesting work around pollution and metformin, which I cannot comment on.

2080
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:13,360
So there's a lot of interest beyond the antidiabetic effects of metformin.

2081
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:16,200
And we'll see how it plays out.

2082
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:20,000
From our point of view, we want to really nail down is it by inhibiting mitochondrial

2083
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
complex one?

2084
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,880
Yeah, that's super elegant stuff.

2085
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,560
So you've got to go back and do the experiment we talked about with the eucenic.

2086
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,720
We're making, you know, we made mice in all of this.

2087
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,720
So we're doing that.

2088
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:36,040
Just to finish, you know, time is probably, we've probably gone over as always.

2089
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:40,560
But so in my world, those roasts from mitochondria are beneficial.

2090
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,960
And you don't, you know, there's not, I'm not sure if there's a window where antioxidants

2091
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,920
get in to really scavenge them.

2092
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,880
So I don't consider them harmful, Peter, right, for that reason.

2093
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,920
So generally, roasts are good.

2094
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,440
Again, very contrarian, but this is where the data is taking us.

2095
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,480
So when is metabolism bad?

2096
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:04,440
So my favorite new theory, which this is what I'm really excited about.

2097
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:08,400
And I'm hoping somebody will give me lots and lots of money to test this because it's

2098
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,880
way out there.

2099
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:15,760
So if you think back about what causes pathologies like neurodegeneration, even diabetes, the

2100
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:22,840
big idea for 20 years has been that proteins get misfolded or they aggregate the idea of

2101
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:25,800
what's called proteotoxicity.

2102
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,680
Let's clean up bad proteins.

2103
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:31,440
So now they've done some trials in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

2104
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,840
It hasn't quite worked out.

2105
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,360
But you know, again, maybe they caught them too late.

2106
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,360
Yeah, that's my argument.

2107
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,360
Yeah, yeah.

2108
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,360
Yeah.

2109
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,360
So I don't have a problem with the theory.

2110
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,360
I think it's a nice theory.

2111
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:43,280
I still think, you know, proteotoxicity is a real phenomenon.

2112
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:46,000
It causes diseases, all that good stuff.

2113
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,880
But what if, which is not a mutually exclusive idea, what if there's metabolite toxicity?

2114
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,880
What does that mean?

2115
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:57,880
That means that certain metabolites that are normally found and at low levels and they

2116
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:03,560
do normal functions, if they rise, they can incur pathology.

2117
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:04,920
So what's the evidence for that?

2118
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:07,640
Well, this is where inborn errors of metabolism come in.

2119
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:12,960
So they're, they're unfortunately, people have genetic mutations in metabolic genes.

2120
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:20,200
And those pathways get altered and some metabolite increases or decreases is and that's causes

2121
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:21,520
major pathology.

2122
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:29,680
So we know that metabolites are at a certain threshold are sufficient to cause pathology

2123
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:32,560
based on inborn errors of metabolism.

2124
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:38,120
And so why couldn't it be that in Alzheimer's we have a particular metabolite or metabolites

2125
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:43,120
that increase due to the tau and all the amyloid plaques that people talk about.

2126
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:45,640
And those then are causing the early generation.

2127
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,440
Again, not mutually exclusive.

2128
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,440
Not mutually exclusive.

2129
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,440
It's just a different way of thinking about it.

2130
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:54,840
So one way you test it is, you know, someone's got to give me money to do this, but you start

2131
01:57:54,840 --> 01:58:01,200
screening metabolites in mice and rats and people and see if you see signatures.

2132
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:06,600
And if you see certain signatures and you say, so I have one right now that I'm very interested

2133
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,200
in is called L2 hydroxylglutarate, L2AG.

2134
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:16,000
And I know that if a human has a mutation in a pathway that can't get rid of L2AG and

2135
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,800
it starts to accumulate, they get a, they get neuropathology.

2136
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,000
So could L2AG be elevated in Parkinson's and in Alzheimer's?

2137
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,680
What's so cool about L2AG, and this is going to wrap everything up from the start, is if

2138
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:36,520
mitochondria are not working, are not functional, the respiratory chain is not working, then

2139
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:43,600
NAD goes down and NADH goes up and it will trigger L2AG.

2140
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,480
That's the key trigger.

2141
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:51,040
When NADH goes up and NAD goes down, L2AG gets made.

2142
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,840
So is this why you don't take metformin?

2143
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,400
No, because metformin is a weak, uh, use ratio has to change a lot.

2144
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:58,480
This ratio has to change a lot.

2145
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:02,600
So for example, are there physiologic conditions under which that ratio changes that much?

2146
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:03,600
Hypoxia.

2147
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,600
Ah, ah.

2148
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:09,320
Hypoxia has been shown that L2AG levels actually increase and they can then function as a signaling

2149
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,320
molecule.

2150
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:14,960
So here is more where the organelle mitochondria is completely dysfunctional.

2151
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:21,560
So complex one loss has been correlated with Parkinson's, dopaminergic neurons are not

2152
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:22,560
functioning.

2153
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,640
And so is L2AG elevated there?

2154
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:31,080
So have you looked at, um, you know, the other patient population you should study this in

2155
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:35,960
would be patients who undergo circulatory arrest in cardiac bypass.

2156
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:38,760
So you're going to see, or even frankly, just bypass.

2157
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,760
Because they're so hypoxic.

2158
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,760
Yeah.

2159
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:41,760
Yeah.

2160
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,320
It'd be interesting to see, you know, quote unquote, this idea of pump head.

2161
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,080
Can it be explained through any of this stuff?

2162
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:50,560
Well, so one other thing that I like about this is, is that's an acute event, I think.

2163
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,560
We don't see it acutely.

2164
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:58,680
So you have a complex one and the NADH goes up, NAD goes down and a real severe inhibition.

2165
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:02,480
It takes a long time for that to accumulate.

2166
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:03,680
How long?

2167
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:08,520
In cell culture with complex one, not 24 hours, a couple of days.

2168
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:13,720
And you know, so you could imagine, let's just play fantasy here.

2169
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:20,720
You get loss of complex one slowly in a dopaminergic neuron, which causes results in Parkinson's.

2170
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:27,560
And then slowly over years, you get this accumulation of this particular metabolite.

2171
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:30,040
And that could then cause the pathology.

2172
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:35,640
Again, I'm very interested in just testing the broad idea that metabolites can cause

2173
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,640
pathologies.

2174
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:42,720
You know, like metabolite toxicity, like kind of like proteotoxicity.

2175
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,680
Probably wrong, but at least it's original.

2176
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:51,560
Well, I mean, it's just, I guess what the thing that would concern me is the ubiquity

2177
02:00:51,560 --> 02:01:00,040
of the potential signaling molecules and trying to identify like what the patterns

2178
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,040
are.

2179
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:05,800
Can that's a, I mean, look, there are no problems worth solving that are easy.

2180
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,440
So, but boy, you have so many variables in so many directions.

2181
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:12,200
You don't just have the number of metabolomics.

2182
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:16,680
You have the time series in which they occur relative to an insult and then the amount

2183
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:20,280
of exposure of each that's necessary to drive the disease.

2184
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:24,720
It could be so easy to miss something with all of those variables, right?

2185
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:25,720
Absolutely.

2186
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:29,880
And that's why we're being very biased and going after this one.

2187
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,280
Keep it simple.

2188
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:32,280
Test that one.

2189
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:35,680
But of course we could totally miss it because there could be five other metabolites that

2190
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,760
might go up that might be causing the pathology and synchrony, right?

2191
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:43,480
But at least this one is tied to mitochondrial function.

2192
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:46,880
And so in mitochondria, really dysfunctional.

2193
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:52,080
So we started with the powerhouse as people would say, well, mitochondrial dysfunction,

2194
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,640
ATP goes down.

2195
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,640
Okay.

2196
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:55,760
I would say mitochondrial dysfunction.

2197
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,760
Guess what?

2198
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:58,120
L2AG goes up.

2199
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,120
This two hydroxyglutarate.

2200
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:00,120
So interesting.

2201
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:05,800
So it's a new way to think about mitochondrial dysfunction that I'm very interested in pursuing.

2202
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:08,960
So last thing I just wrote down when we were talking earlier and I want to come back to

2203
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,120
it is talk to me a little bit about cortisol and your views on it.

2204
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,960
How does cortisol interact with the mitochondria?

2205
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:14,960
Yeah.

2206
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,960
Well, I don't know.

2207
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,760
Another one that I would love to work on.

2208
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:19,560
So it's just a weird observation.

2209
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:21,160
I don't know if you have this.

2210
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:27,800
I mean, I think maybe in our circles we have a lot of kind of type A personalities who

2211
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,360
exercise vigorously.

2212
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:30,760
They wash their diet.

2213
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,280
They do all this sort of stuff.

2214
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:34,120
I don't know anybody that does that.

2215
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:35,120
No, you don't know anybody.

2216
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,120
No one.

2217
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:37,120
Nobody.

2218
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:42,680
But I always wonder if they're stressing themselves out by being so careful about everything,

2219
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:43,680
you know?

2220
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:45,560
And you know me, I am the opposite.

2221
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,720
You've seen me eat and drink.

2222
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:49,040
Yeah, but you're pretty fastidious with your exercise.

2223
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,040
You play soccer every day.

2224
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,040
No, I do.

2225
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,320
And I don't overeat and I do time feedings, right?

2226
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:56,040
I still fast 12 to 15 hours.

2227
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,040
Most days closer to 15 hours.

2228
02:02:58,040 --> 02:02:59,040
I do watch what I mean.

2229
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:03,840
But what I'm saying is I know people who get very, very regimented about these things.

2230
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:08,840
And it's like the marathon runners who, you know, the old line that they die and don't

2231
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:09,840
run marathons.

2232
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:14,200
Well, I was with a friend last night and he was joking about this exact concept.

2233
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:17,040
And he was talking about his, he's an orthopedic surgeon.

2234
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,600
He was talking about his partner or somebody knows.

2235
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:26,000
And he was like, the guy is so into yoga, but it's become, he's like, the way he described

2236
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
it was really funny.

2237
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,360
He's like, he's stuck in traffic and he's like, I got to get to my fucking yoga class.

2238
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,360
Yes, exactly.

2239
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,600
And it's like, yeah, no, of course there's the irony to that, right?

2240
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:38,040
So, you know, your insulin levels might be fine and everything's fine, but you know,

2241
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,320
what's your cortisol level?

2242
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:40,920
So I'm fascinated by cortisol.

2243
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:47,060
In fact, I'm fascinated by, I would love for you to basically develop a very simple

2244
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:52,160
test that you can sell at Walgreens where you take a prick of blood and you can do it

2245
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:53,160
as often as you want.

2246
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:56,280
And you tell me my thyroid and hormones.

2247
02:03:56,280 --> 02:04:03,160
You tell me my insulin, my glucagon, my estrogen, my testosterone, my dopamine, serotonin, and

2248
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:04,600
obviously cortisol, right?

2249
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:10,160
These five or six, seven things that I just said, because it's about a lot of biology

2250
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:11,720
or physiology can be explained.

2251
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,360
Yeah, we're not going to be able to get it that way because cortisol is mostly bound

2252
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:17,280
to albumin and cortisol binding protein.

2253
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:22,280
So it's the free cortisol that exerts its metabolic effects and its physiologic effects.

2254
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:23,880
And most of it's not free.

2255
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:27,240
So you can only measure the free cortisol and saliva and urine.

2256
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:28,800
And then the other, you know, of those other ones.

2257
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,800
But you know what I'm saying?

2258
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:34,560
Like, like I would love to have those, those hormones at my disposal.

2259
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,680
I mean, is my testosterone too low?

2260
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,880
My estrogen too high?

2261
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,880
This too high?

2262
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,880
Insulin.

2263
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:40,880
You know what I mean?

2264
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:45,320
Just having that data points all the time and then you could sort of modify your diet

2265
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,840
and your exercise.

2266
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:53,800
But I think the cortisol one is I pay more attention today to stress as than anything

2267
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:54,800
else.

2268
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,800
I'll be honest with you.

2269
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:58,220
I mean, I still exercise and I watch what I eat.

2270
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:02,120
Those things seem intuitive because I've done it for so long.

2271
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:06,440
But I've been wondering if myself and many of my colleagues, especially because we fly,

2272
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:12,440
get talks, you have grand pressures, a teenager daughter, she's lovely, lots of different

2273
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:13,440
pressures we all have.

2274
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:14,440
Right.

2275
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:19,360
And if that somehow is being manifested metabolically through cortisol to the mitochondria, just

2276
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,360
like we think about insulin.

2277
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,360
Right.

2278
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:22,360
So that's all.

2279
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,680
That's the only reason I want to talk about cortisol.

2280
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:26,000
No, I think I agree with that wholeheartedly.

2281
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,560
I think certainly in the last three years as I've dug my heels into it, I think hypercorticillemia

2282
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:33,520
is a problem.

2283
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:39,040
And I think I wish people would think of these hormones through more broad endocrinologic

2284
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,040
terms.

2285
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:43,680
You know, it's very easy for people to think of hypo and hyperthyroidism.

2286
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:46,160
We accept those as states.

2287
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:49,960
You can be euthyroid or you can have too much or you can have too little.

2288
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,200
And yet people have such a hard time thinking of insulin in those terms.

2289
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,880
You can have too much, you can have too little.

2290
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,300
There's a range in which this hormone makes sense.

2291
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:04,060
And cortisol is probably equally important, if not more important in terms of the damage

2292
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:09,180
that can be done, especially from too much with respect to everything from blood pressure,

2293
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:11,460
which would then impact the endothelium.

2294
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:16,340
What it does in terms of inhibiting melatonin secretion in the brain and melatonin obviously

2295
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:21,180
plays an immediate role in terms of sleep, but also plays an indirect role in terms of

2296
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:23,060
neuro regeneration.

2297
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:26,380
So and that says nothing about what we just talked about, which was the role that cortisol

2298
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:29,940
may even play in the mitochondria, which I'm just learning about, you know, literally

2299
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:31,380
in the past couple of months.

2300
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,380
So I don't disagree.

2301
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:38,220
I think the challenge in many ways for anyone listening to this, if we're going to be brutally

2302
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:44,380
honest, I think for many people it's easier to control what they eat, how they exercise

2303
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:48,060
and exert discipline around taking medications, taking supplements.

2304
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:51,500
But in many ways, one of the hardest things to control is our response to stress.

2305
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,660
And I think that's an important distinction to make.

2306
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:57,820
I don't think there's anything that's particularly troubling with being in stressful situations.

2307
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:03,020
I think the difference is less about the situation you're in and more about the response you

2308
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:04,500
have to it.

2309
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:07,900
And that's probably where the greatest differences lie between people is there are some people

2310
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:15,220
who can be in relatively low stress situations and yet they're sort of, they're not reacting

2311
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,220
well to it.

2312
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,380
They're not coping with it well.

2313
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:18,860
And there are others who can be in-

2314
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:21,220
They have different set points where they begin from.

2315
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:22,420
Maybe.

2316
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:24,380
I guess I just don't understand enough of this stuff.

2317
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:26,660
I mean, I think-

2318
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:29,380
But I don't hear too many people talk about it.

2319
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:30,380
I don't know.

2320
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:31,380
I think it's-

2321
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:36,060
No, people talk about stress, but sort of like we talk about insulin all the time and

2322
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:39,340
glucose levels and for men, testosterone, women-

2323
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:40,860
You mean sort of in longevity circles?

2324
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:42,860
Yeah, in longevity circles.

2325
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:45,660
Like is that a variable we're missing?

2326
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:46,660
No, I agree.

2327
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:47,660
That's all I'm saying.

2328
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:48,660
You're right.

2329
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:49,660
I'm just pitching cortisol.

2330
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:52,300
Well, part of it is we don't have a target for it, right?

2331
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:57,780
No one's thinking about pharmacologic ways to manipulate this and we don't have great

2332
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,380
obvious ways to curb our behaviors.

2333
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:04,540
Like meditation probably is the single most valuable thing I've ever found to help regulate

2334
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:08,140
this, but you also don't have the ability to measure cortisol levels that easily.

2335
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:11,660
Every time you want to do one of these tests, it's, you know, you're collecting urine over

2336
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:13,820
the course of a day and doing a bunch of other things.

2337
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:14,820
So it's just, it's involved.

2338
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:15,820
You don't have the-

2339
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:16,820
Glass of wine?

2340
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:17,820
Yeah.

2341
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:18,820
You know, it's really funny.

2342
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:23,180
There was a paper that came out probably about three months ago that looked at, basically

2343
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:26,700
the punchline of the paper was look at any of those alcohol is toxic.

2344
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:30,180
But you know, if you look at those events, it's like 950, 900,000.

2345
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:31,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no.

2346
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:32,180
It's like 954.

2347
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:36,460
The point of it is there's no dose of ethanol where the ethanol becomes valuable, but the

2348
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:38,260
toxicity takes a while to kick in.

2349
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:42,620
So, you know, for some people, a glass a day seems perfectly reasonable.

2350
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:45,220
There's no toxicity.

2351
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:48,540
But the flip side of it is, and this is where I kind of try to have this discussion with

2352
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:51,900
every patient is, look, I'm not going to tell somebody not to drink.

2353
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:53,420
I mean, I'm not going to tell myself not to drink.

2354
02:08:53,420 --> 02:08:55,700
I probably have four drinks a week.

2355
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:57,580
And you know, I pick and choose my shots.

2356
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:00,500
You know, I have this rule called don't drink on airplanes because the alcohol on airplanes

2357
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,500
sucks.

2358
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,660
So I'm not drinking alcohol just for the sake of drinking alcohol.

2359
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:07,300
But if you're sitting there and the alcohol is really great and it's something you really,

2360
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:13,420
the downside of the ethanol, the hepatic toxicity of the ethanol can be offset by the emotional

2361
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:17,220
benefit that could come from the enjoyment of having that glass of wine with your buddy.

2362
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:21,340
That brings me to another one of those things we should always measure, ALT, you know, the

2363
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:22,340
liver enzymes.

2364
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:23,340
Yeah.

2365
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,340
I agree.

2366
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:25,340
How will your liver function?

2367
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:26,940
How's your ALT this morning, by the way?

2368
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:27,940
It's pretty good.

2369
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:28,940
Yeah.

2370
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:32,140
I went and checked it.

2371
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:34,060
And so I think we're almost at the end.

2372
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:35,060
Yeah.

2373
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,060
Yeah.

2374
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:37,060
So I have one question for you.

2375
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,060
Oh.

2376
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:39,060
To sort of wrap it up.

2377
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:40,540
Wait, I didn't think that was part of the rule.

2378
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:42,820
Well, it is because I'll tell you why.

2379
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:48,820
So when I interact outside of the scientific circles, if I'm at a dinner party, if I'm

2380
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:56,340
at a bar, if I'm on an airplane and whoever I'm engaging with, they ask me like, what

2381
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:57,340
do you do?

2382
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:03,260
Now, if I say I'm technically my title's professor of medicine and cell biology, if you say that,

2383
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:05,780
they'd think, oh, you teach something.

2384
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:09,100
And I do indirectly, but what we do is research.

2385
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:13,180
So if I just say I do research or if I say I'm a scientist, they go, oh, well, that's

2386
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:14,180
nice.

2387
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:22,980
But the minute I say I'm a metabolism scientist and it's like, they light up and they want

2388
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:26,660
the next question, which is, what should I eat?

2389
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:27,660
You got it.

2390
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:29,740
But wait, can I ask you a question?

2391
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:33,340
Given that you know that that's going to happen, when you go to parties, do you go out of your

2392
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:36,900
way to make sure that you don't prime people for that question?

2393
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,660
Or do you enjoy being asked that question?

2394
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:47,380
I think I enjoyed being asked that question initially as a way to tell people, look, science

2395
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:49,220
is cool, metabolism is cool.

2396
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:50,220
You know what I mean?

2397
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:52,940
Sort of not think.

2398
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:56,300
There's this image that people have about scientists.

2399
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,740
As you can see, I'm pretty flamboyant.

2400
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:03,260
So I figure, you know, something that they can relate to as a common language.

2401
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:08,660
But now I regret it because all I hear about is, what should I eat?

2402
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:09,660
What should I eat?

2403
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:10,660
Oh yeah.

2404
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:12,300
So let me give you a piece of advice on this now.

2405
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:15,900
So first of all, I have the same problem whenever I'm in a situation.

2406
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:20,300
Could be a wedding, could be a funeral, could be a party, doesn't matter.

2407
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:25,260
So I've learned that there are two, I have two go to things that I tell people I do for

2408
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:26,260
a living.

2409
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:33,020
And I know enough about each of them that I can almost never get called out.

2410
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:38,060
And the good news is both of these generate almost no follow up questions.

2411
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:40,700
Now the difference is you're an extrovert and I'm an introvert.

2412
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:43,260
So you at a party would like to talk to people.

2413
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:45,300
I on the other hand don't.

2414
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:46,860
I don't like to go to parties.

2415
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:50,860
But if I'm dragged to a party, I don't want to be at parties.

2416
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:52,380
I don't want to be at happy hours.

2417
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:56,380
I don't want to be around anybody except two of my friends at a time sort of thing.

2418
02:11:56,380 --> 02:12:00,820
So I just tell people, I shouldn't admit this now because now if somebody hears this, they'll

2419
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:01,820
know my trick.

2420
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:04,180
All right, I'm not going to say it.

2421
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,380
I'm not going to say it.

2422
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:06,380
You're going to leave them hanging.

2423
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:07,380
I'm going to leave them hanging.

2424
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:13,180
But I have two awesome alter egos that whenever I'm at, and I, in fact, I busted one out last

2425
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:14,180
night.

2426
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:15,780
I was at a dinner thing last night.

2427
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:16,980
I didn't know people.

2428
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:21,940
And there were a lot of doctors there and there was a lot of butt sniffing, which always

2429
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:25,100
happens at doctor parties where everybody wants to sniff everybody else's butt.

2430
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:28,560
It's like kind of the dogs, you know, walking around sniffing each other's butts.

2431
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,860
And there was a lot of what do you do?

2432
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:32,300
Oh, I'm the chairman of this and I'm the chairman of that.

2433
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:34,340
And I am the head of this and blah, blah.

2434
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:35,580
And they looked at me.

2435
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:36,580
What do you do?

2436
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:38,420
And I just said, I'm a, and I said it.

2437
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:39,860
And it was amazing.

2438
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:42,700
The crickets are chirping.

2439
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:45,260
Everybody is like, they don't know what to say.

2440
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:48,580
And they said collectively nothing.

2441
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:51,940
And then the discussion just went elsewhere and it was awesome.

2442
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:53,580
I didn't have to talk about it.

2443
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:54,580
All right.

2444
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:59,620
So I do give an answer and I want you to tell me if this is the right answer or the

2445
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:01,220
wrong answer.

2446
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:04,380
I still like, and I know it got debunked a little bit.

2447
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:06,380
I still like the Mediterranean diet.

2448
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:07,380
Yeah.

2449
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:10,340
I mean, not, I mean with curry, okay.

2450
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:14,380
But generally that kind of died with nuts and avocados, a little red wine.

2451
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:16,740
Well, when you say debunked, I mean, I'm not even sure I would agree on it.

2452
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:17,740
No, I don't think it has.

2453
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:18,740
But you know what I mean by that.

2454
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:22,700
What you're referring to is the PradaMed study, which I'm guessing many people listening to

2455
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:25,860
this will know what that is, but in case somebody's not, we'll certainly link to it.

2456
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:29,780
This was a study that randomized something in the neighborhood of 7,500 patients, although

2457
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:31,180
we'll come back to the word randomization.

2458
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:36,500
I'll put a little asterisk beside that, into three groups, about 2,500 patients per group.

2459
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:40,740
And they were randomized in a one to one to one fashion between a Mediterranean diet

2460
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:46,340
that was high in extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet that was high in nuts and

2461
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:48,020
a low fat diet.

2462
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:52,060
And this was a primary prevention study, which makes it a very difficult study to do, especially

2463
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:53,820
with nutritional therapeutics.

2464
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:54,820
And the study was stopped early.

2465
02:13:54,940 --> 02:13:59,820
It was stopped at about 4.7 years if my memory shows correctly because the both Mediterranean

2466
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:01,940
arms were outperforming the low fat arm.

2467
02:14:01,940 --> 02:14:06,180
Now, I used to view that as one of the more interesting studies ever done in nutrition

2468
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:08,260
because nutrition studies generally suck.

2469
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:12,460
It did have one major criticism that didn't get any attention at the time of the initial

2470
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:15,980
publication, which I think was 2014 maybe.

2471
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:18,660
And that was the performance bias.

2472
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:25,100
So the groups that were getting olive oil and nuts had those products sent to them.

2473
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:29,020
The low fat group, to my knowledge, did not receive anything, didn't get food given to

2474
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:30,020
them.

2475
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:33,500
Well, that creates the potential for a difference in behavior.

2476
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:34,500
And that's problematic.

2477
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:38,920
That's very problematic in clinical trials where you can't blind anyone.

2478
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:44,860
But the more recent issue, the one that I think you're referring to is some irregularities

2479
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:46,720
popped up in their randomization.

2480
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:52,280
So some people doing post hoc analyses found, hey, these numbers don't make sense.

2481
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:56,920
It's very improbable that these people were all randomly assigned.

2482
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:01,900
And I believe, because it's been a while since I read the correction, that what they identified

2483
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:04,920
was that a number of those patients were not randomized correctly, for example.

2484
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:07,640
And it wasn't nefarious, but it was done through convenience.

2485
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:13,400
So if you had a husband-wife team in the study, they were immediately put on the same diet,

2486
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:15,080
which by the way is logical.

2487
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:17,280
That's actually a better study design.

2488
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:21,720
But you have to then change the statistics to accommodate for that because you have no

2489
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:24,280
longer randomized each of those individuals.

2490
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:27,200
They would be considered one randomization, not two.

2491
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:33,160
To the best of my knowledge, even when you take into account those changes or those inconsistencies

2492
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:39,500
or those methodologic failures, I don't believe it changed the results or the outcome of PREDIMED.

2493
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:45,500
So we're still back to the initial limitation of were those representative diets and were

2494
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:50,900
those subjects, victim for lack of a better word, but the victims of a performance bias.

2495
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:56,380
So all that said, look, I think the Mediterranean diet, which is unfortunately not a very descriptive

2496
02:15:56,380 --> 02:15:59,240
term because what the hell is a Mediterranean diet?

2497
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:03,900
Is that what people eat in Italy, Egypt, Greece, Spain?

2498
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:10,660
So I guess the only opposition I would take to the concept is I like to be more specific

2499
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:12,460
in my description of the diet.

2500
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:18,900
What I dislike is high protein or a high carb or a high fat diet, like people love.

2501
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:21,900
So the high protein people like is they want to look like a South Beach model essentially

2502
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:25,620
as far as I can tell because you can lose weight.

2503
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:28,780
The high carb, we know you talk about it all the time, why that's bad.

2504
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:34,140
And sort of the ketogenic diet, I mean, it has some benefits maybe for the brain and

2505
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:37,260
other systems, but it does make you insulin resistant.

2506
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:39,100
I mean, there's data in mice.

2507
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:41,700
Well, I would take issue with those data though, right?

2508
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:45,300
So are there data that ketogenic diet make mice insulin resistant?

2509
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:49,220
I don't think there's hundreds of studies in mice that people have done.

2510
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:53,820
And so my favorite one, I think you should, I sent it to you where they looked at a whole

2511
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:59,580
bunch of diets and essentially the best one was sort of a one third, one third, like 20

2512
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:03,420
percent protein because we can both agree if there's too much protein, your mTOR might

2513
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:07,140
be quite active if you need enough for your muscles.

2514
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:09,220
But this is again, not in the elderly.

2515
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,020
So again, not with the disease.

2516
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:15,620
This is just primary prevention that we're talking about in healthy sort of 40 something.

2517
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:16,820
So let's start with.

2518
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:23,620
So it was relatively not high in protein and it was had about 40, 50 percent carbs

2519
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:24,860
almost I think.

2520
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:28,700
This is a mice study and then the rest was sort of the good fat, you know, avocados,

2521
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:30,540
nuts and stuff like that.

2522
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:34,900
And so I sort of liked that diet because it was a pretty good study in cell metabolism

2523
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:37,260
published on these mice.

2524
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:40,580
And to me, intuitively, some of this makes sense.

2525
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:44,580
And so, you know, keeping protein not too high because you want to keep them closed

2526
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:45,580
down.

2527
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:46,420
And

2528
02:17:46,420 --> 02:17:47,420
Steven Simpson was the last author on.

2529
02:17:47,420 --> 02:17:48,420
Yeah.

2530
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,420
Steven Simpson, I think.

2531
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:50,420
Maybe there was like he's Australian.

2532
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:51,420
Yes.

2533
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:52,420
Yes, there was 25.

2534
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:56,660
Again, I don't think there's a clear answer to this.

2535
02:17:56,660 --> 02:18:00,500
But you know, rather than answer the question, let me tell you my two cents on this topic.

2536
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:04,780
One, I don't have a lot of interest in mouse studies for human nutrition.

2537
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:08,500
I struggle with them because I think there are so many other issues going on and it's

2538
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:09,500
very hard to make that.

2539
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:11,060
That's a fair point.

2540
02:18:11,060 --> 02:18:15,020
The second thing is I always want to be sure that I'm distinguishing between short term

2541
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:17,060
insulin resistance and long term insulin resistance.

2542
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:18,060
So I think you're right.

2543
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:24,380
In the short run, ketogenic diets in a non-trivial subset of people generate profound insulin

2544
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:25,740
resistance in the muscle.

2545
02:18:25,740 --> 02:18:29,140
Again, I don't even know what insulin resistance means if we're going to be truthful.

2546
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:32,300
Like if we're going to put me in the confession booth, I don't have a goddamn clue what that

2547
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:33,420
term even means.

2548
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:34,860
It's so ubiquitous.

2549
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:40,060
Does it mean the failure of one type of cell but not another type of cell to respond to

2550
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:41,060
insulin signaling?

2551
02:18:41,060 --> 02:18:42,060
I mean, all of these things.

2552
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:43,180
But I think I know what you mean.

2553
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:48,740
You can see huge elevations in glucose and insulin and basically a complete refusal of

2554
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:53,300
the muscle to accept glucose in someone on a ketogenic diet when they first encounter

2555
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:55,060
a carbohydrate.

2556
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:59,060
But I think it's generally also regarded that after about three days of carbohydrate refeeding,

2557
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:05,020
that effect goes away and that that effect is sort of a physiologic response to an individual

2558
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:09,740
who's been so carbohydrate deprived that their muscles are basically saying, any glucose

2559
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:14,780
in the system we're going to preferentially save for the brain since we now have all the

2560
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:19,460
fatty acids and beta hydroxybutyrate in the world we need as metabolic substrate.

2561
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:25,060
So the short answer is, I don't know, these days I find myself far more interested in

2562
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:30,820
fixating less on the exact amount of this micronutrient or this micronutrient or that

2563
02:19:30,820 --> 02:19:34,780
micronutrient and more on the complete deprivation of calories for more prolonged periods of

2564
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:35,780
time.

2565
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:38,860
So people who are used to following me these days, I'm spending much more time thinking

2566
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:43,340
about fasting than I am sort of sticking on one diet and sticking to it.

2567
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:50,460
Yeah, so I basically eat a third of my calories probably from fat, carbs and protein.

2568
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:53,180
And then the other thing is just the 15 hour fast every day.

2569
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:56,380
But if you're getting a third from protein, that's probably quite a bit.

2570
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:57,380
Probably I think.

2571
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:58,380
I'll have to lower that.

2572
02:19:58,380 --> 02:20:00,860
I'm going to have to check your, check your torrid.

2573
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:06,940
Well, maybe a third is too much but I eat a fair amount of protein probably.

2574
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:07,940
Probably, you know.

2575
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:11,340
At the parties, tell them you're a math professor.

2576
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:12,780
They won't ask you any more questions.

2577
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:14,940
I don't remember any math and we'll leave it at that.

2578
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:17,140
Yeah, but hopefully they won't ask you the questions.

2579
02:20:17,140 --> 02:20:20,100
No, I'm an extrovert and I like talking about metabolism.

2580
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:21,620
I don't have a good answer on the diet.

2581
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:23,940
I have lots of answers on mitochondria and all that.

2582
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:28,660
Then just tell them you're a mitochondrial expert but don't use the word metabolism.

2583
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:31,860
Then people really look at you like, oh.

2584
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:32,860
Anyways.

2585
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:33,860
Hey, man.

2586
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:36,300
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk about all this stuff.

2587
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:38,900
I had written down a bunch of things I wanted to talk about and I think we actually got

2588
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:40,900
through like half of them.

2589
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:41,900
Oh, totally.

2590
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:42,900
Okay.

2591
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:44,900
Well, but that's the nature of this stuff.

2592
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,900
It's so fun.

2593
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:46,900
There's so many rabbit holes to go down.

2594
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:51,260
In particular, I really love the double click deep dive on metformin which is something

2595
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,020
I think a lot about myself.

2596
02:20:53,020 --> 02:20:57,580
Hopefully once we have some results and there's more clinical trials, we can come back and

2597
02:20:57,580 --> 02:21:00,580
we can really talk about some more answers.

2598
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:01,580
All right, man.

2599
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:02,580
Thanks.

2600
02:21:02,580 --> 02:21:03,580
