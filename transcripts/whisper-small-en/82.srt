00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,560
natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now, the

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,040
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,440
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,640
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,680
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,320
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,960
have proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,920
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,520
you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,840
for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,760
to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members will receive

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,480
full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we plan to build upon. These

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,920
are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of our shows.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,080
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,600
episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,760
these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,680
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,800
I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,520
companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,320
have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,260
is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,080
content exclusive for members. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you

44
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,720
learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,280
by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Mark Messier. Mark is considered one

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,280
of the greatest hockey players of all time. He had a career that spanned 25 years in the NHL,

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,840
and he's played the second most games of any player, second only to Gordie Howe. And there's

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,000
interesting story that we'll get to in the podcast about how close he came to that record. He's also

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,600
the second leading all time scorer of all time, or as he likes to put it, the first leading all

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,960
time score amongst mere mortals with Wayne Gretzky being the only one who scored more than he did.

51
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,300
It would take me too long to kind of go through all of Mark's professional accolades, six time

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,680
Stanley Cup champion, the only person to captain two different teams to win a Stanley Cup, the

53
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Edmonton Oilers, and the New York Rangers, in addition to all the number of all-star games

54
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,040
he's played in and the number of MVPs that he's won, etc. I wanted to talk with Mark about a number

55
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
of things today. I wanted to obviously talk about his career, and this is kind of a boyhood dream of

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,200
mine to speak with one of my heroes who I've had the privilege of getting to know over the past

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,960
couple of years. But also I wanted to just talk about Mark's philosophy in life and leadership

58
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,960
and amazing transition he has made and the ease with which it seems he's been able to transition

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,600
out of the limelight into his family life and his work outside of hockey. We touch on many things

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,200
here, but we do sort of go through it chronologically, and I think if you're a hockey fan, this is a no

61
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,280
brainer for you. But I would encourage you, even if you're not a hockey fan, to listen to this one.

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,320
I think you're gonna get a lot out of it. I think I was really on the edge of my seat, honestly,

63
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,520
during so many parts of this. And even though a lot of the stories I knew, but I don't think I

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,520
really appreciated growing up watching Mark was the subtlety and the maturation process that came

65
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,640
along with his leadership and his growth as an individual. You know, I almost forgot that he

66
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:52,040
entered the NHL at the age of 17 or 18 years old, which seems almost unimaginable today. I'll leave

67
00:05:52,040 --> 00:06:00,160
it at that. And without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Mark Messier. Mark,

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
thanks so much for coming into the city today. Good to be here with you. How often do you come

69
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
into New York City these days? Actually, quite often, especially with the emerging Kingsbridge

70
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,120
project up in the Bronx, which set up an office down on 21st Street and was coming in for at least

71
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,000
a couple years, at least four times a week. And then Ranger Games and other charitable initiatives

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,960
and dinners and meetings. New York is still friendly. I'm a regular on the on the subways

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,320
and trains now. Yeah, I was about to say, I mean, you know, you took the subway in today,

74
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,760
the most days to someone recognizing the train. Every day on the train coming in from Greenwich,

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,040
then on the subways, obviously takes a lot of selfies on the subway, but it doesn't get old.

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,680
It's just amazing. You know, almost 20 years later, the passion that's still in the city and

77
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,960
the people that were involved with the Rangers at Europe, if not actually there during their

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,120
regular season of the playoffs. And of course, the Stanley Cup in 1994. So yeah, this is 25 years,

79
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,800
which 20, 25 year. Yeah, it is hard to believe. Actually, we're we had a reunion last year. We

80
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
couldn't believe it's been actually 25 years. Yeah, we were talking before we started this

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,560
podcast about even just it seems like you didn't retire 14 years ago or whatever it was 15 years

82
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,480
ago. Like it seems I guess that's what happens when we get older. Time goes seems to be going

83
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,920
by quicker. Life does not stand still. That's for sure. Especially when you have kids, you can see

84
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,880
the growth obviously every year. And it's fun though. Every stage of the development of the

85
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,080
kids has been amazing being a part of their lives and being retired so I can be home for that has

86
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,280
been incredible. So yeah, I've enjoyed the retirement, but still when you start actually

87
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,800
reminiscing and talking about my career, it's hard to believe I've been retired now almost 14 years.

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
We'll talk a lot about your career, but I mean, I think one little factoid that's always worth

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,360
mentioning is the length of it, right? It's that I mean, you played in the NHL for 25 years, correct?

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,920
25 years in the NHL, 26 years as a professional started when I was 17. And the that back when

91
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,640
they had the WHA, which was the secondary league, a lot of the NHLers Wayne Gretzky, Craig Hartsburg,

92
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,440
they used to call that it was, it was a big race to sign the underage players back then, especially

93
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,280
for the WHA who was competing with the NHL. So I was able to play as a 17 year old for two teams

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
and I have the distinction of being the youngest player ever to fold a professional franchise in

95
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,360
hockey. Cincinnati or the Indianapolis Racers, I played five games and they folded, went home

96
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,480
back to Edmonton for a couple of weeks and then Cincinnati signed me about two weeks later.

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,800
It's interesting to look back at because that's as you know, because we've talked about this before,

98
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
but I mean, the Oilers were my team growing up even though I grew up in Toronto. I mean, one,

99
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,600
the Leafs were just such a bad team in the 80s that, you know, hard to be a Leafs fan, but also

100
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,200
Edmonton was just the most exciting team in hockey. So I remember those early 80s

101
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,200
years and those were, I think it's, unless you're in a real hockey diehard, I don't think most people

102
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,920
remember what the Oilers were like in the 80s, like what it was like to have

103
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,360
Gretzky, Messier, Curry, Coffey, Lowe, Fuhrer, Anderson, like that all of those guys were on

104
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,600
one team. Yeah. Like a free agency wouldn't permit that today, right? It would be hard to keep the

105
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,200
players for as long as we did, but just to put it in perspective, I used to travel a lot in the

106
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,040
summertime. I had to travel bug and went all over the world and the Oilers literally in Wayne

107
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,400
Gretzky put Edmonton on the map. There wasn't anywhere we didn't travel that someone didn't

108
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,520
know where Edmonton was because of the hockey team, which was always kind of gave you a sense of pride

109
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,400
just because of what we're able to accomplish, but also what we're able to do in the sporting world

110
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,360
that was being recognized with people all over the world. That was eyeopening for me coming from

111
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,800
Edmonton and traveled a bit with our family. But once I started really going abroad and

112
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,960
that really hit at home that we were doing something special and actually we had a really

113
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,320
special team with some amazing players that was being recognized around the world.

114
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
So you grew up how close to Edmonton? I know you're from Alberta, right?

115
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
Yeah. So Edmonton, Alberta grew up right there.

116
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
Were you in a suburb of Edmonton?

117
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Eventually, but when I first came back, my father was playing hockey in Portland, Oregon

118
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,800
for the Portland Buckaroos. I think we moved back in 1968. He came back and taught school.

119
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:39,280
I think I came back and was going to grade one or two or right around there. And then right about

120
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,400
when I was turning or getting into, ready to go to grade four, we moved out of Edmonton to St. Albert,

121
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,520
which was a small community at the time just north of the city, finished my schooling there and

122
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,040
played junior hockey until I actually signed as a 17 year old to go to the WHA.

123
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
So when did you start playing hockey?

124
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,920
Well, I think like everybody else, I started skating fairly early, but I think my first

125
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,120
organized hockey team was pretty much like everybody, like right at six years old.

126
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,000
Actually started in Edmonton or in Portland. My father started the whole minor hockey league

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,080
programs in Portland. They didn't have kids hockey back then. He was responsible for really

128
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,080
getting the whole minor hockey league system up and running in Portland, Oregon.

129
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,200
How did it fit into other sports and other activities you were doing?

130
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,280
Was it one of those things where everybody talks about Wayne's story where he's two years old,

131
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,680
basically you can't stop him from playing, right? It's like you won't come in from the rink. He's

132
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,720
taking shots on his grandmother in the kitchen. Was it like that for you or was it just another

133
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,920
sport that you played in addition to baseball? No, I loved hockey. Back when I played, it was

134
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,520
it was completely different. We played hockey in the wintertime. We had 120 hour program. We had

135
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,320
two practices, two games a week. We didn't travel to tournaments. Everything was right in Edmonton.

136
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:05,440
When this winter or the spring came, we played baseball or soccer. We played multiple sports.

137
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
If you talk to Wayne and you listen to what he talks about is exactly that.

138
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,640
He was a great athlete in the other one.

139
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,080
Great athlete. He played all sports. He played baseball. He's a great baseball player. He's a

140
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,960
great lacrosse player. He played hockey in the wintertime. That's the way it was. Now it's

141
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,240
been more professionalized at an early age, which some would dispute is not the most healthy thing

142
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,440
for kids, but that's the way it is now. What do you think of that? My reading of the literature,

143
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,560
so this is a very academic view of this, not as my kids aren't in Southern California, hockey is

144
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,840
not even on their radar, even though obviously lots of kids in SoCal do play hockey. It would seem

145
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,320
that the approach that you took was a better approach actually, which is a broader sampling

146
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,960
of sports and developing a broader set of athletic abilities before ultimately narrowing your focus.

147
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,920
I mean, that looks to be the better formula, but it's not what's typically happening today, is it?

148
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,320
It's not. And I think because of it, it puts a lot of pressure on the parents, both on the time

149
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,840
issue for parents and the pressure puts on the rest of the family, but also on the

150
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,640
financial by having to travel consistently to different places to play tournament,

151
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,720
hockey and whatnot. But until you get to the age of 14 is really the kind of the age where

152
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
kids start separating themselves into what they really want to do and they're more focused into

153
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,560
what they want to do. But up until then, I've always believed that it's great to try a lot

154
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,240
of different sports and become a better athlete total, a total better athlete in all regards.

155
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,120
And I think the science would probably prove that. And there's all kinds of examples of some hockey

156
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,640
players that actually made it to the NHL that didn't really start playing hockey till they were

157
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,200
14 or 15 years old, which debunks the myth of that you have to be playing hockey 365 days from the

158
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,960
time you're two years old to the time you get drafted. It's just not the case. You got to be

159
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,000
blessed with a God given talent to order in order to make it. And then at the right time,

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,560
you have to hone those skills and you have to have the desire and the passion to put the work in.

161
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,880
But there's a lot of kids that go through that whole process that never do make it. So where is

162
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,480
that fine line and that balance that's really healthy for the family structure, healthy for

163
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
the kid and give him the best opportunity to fulfill his own dreams. So what's the earliest

164
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,160
memory you have of your dad playing? Because I got to believe that that sort of at least planted

165
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,520
a seed in your mind or? No question. I remember I wasn't even in school yet and we were living in

166
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,600
Portland, Oregon and my father would take me with him to his practices. Sometimes I probably was

167
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:45,440
maybe four, three, four years old. And then we'd be able to go skate on the ice in Portland before

168
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,040
his practice started. So, you know, I have very early memories of him playing. I can honestly say,

169
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,720
I don't really actually remember him being on the ice in a game vaguely. We got some old pictures

170
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,480
and some old videos that we watch once in a while, but no question him being a hockey player really

171
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,920
cemented the passion. And it's amazing how much you learn sitting around the kitchen table,

172
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,880
talking about hockey when you have a parent that was so entrenched in the game itself,

173
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,760
not only as a player, but as a coach and as a mentor to a lot of young kids after his retirement.

174
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,960
When did it start to make sense to you that like this thing that you love doing or one of several

175
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,760
sports you like doing, you actually could do this as your job. I mean, how old were you when it became?

176
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,800
Yeah, you know, I always played up. My brother was four years older than me or three years older

177
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,200
than me, I guess. So when we moved back from Portland to Edmonton, Paul was basically a Pee Wee.

178
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,280
I think he was 10 years old or somewhere in there. I was seven. So my dad was coaching and he didn't

179
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,320
want to go to two different practice times and two different ranks. So he just put me on the team. And

180
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,640
so I was always playing against older kids. The joke was I had a career as a Pee Wee. I think I

181
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,960
played four years as a Pee Wee, but I was never really that great growing up. I liked the game. I

182
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,480
always watched hockey night in Canada. I did all the things that most kids do when they love a

183
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,720
sport. I guess, you know, I didn't have very much success as a Bantam. I think one of my Bantam years

184
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,400
or one of my Midget years, we've won one game the whole time of the whole year. So individually,

185
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,080
I wasn't really kind of standing out maybe because I was playing against older kids.

186
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,960
But do you remember if you were Hessel having fun? Oh yeah.

187
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
Do you remember how you felt about it? Oh, loved it.

188
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,720
Oh yeah, loved it. Loved it. Oh yeah. Never question about, my dad was really cool about

189
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,240
practices and all that. He always knew if I was just being lazy or if I really just needed not to

190
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,240
go because of tired school or whatever. So there's never any pressure in that regard to go to the

191
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,960
ranks. But we would, besides our practices, we would go with our friends and play outside. And

192
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,240
that's what we would do on the weekends when we weren't playing. I mean, that's how we spent our

193
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,440
time. The outside ranks with our buddies and sipping hot chocolate and playing a shinny.

194
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,000
I had a real passion for the game, but I had a passion for all sports. I loved being outside,

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,160
playing, throwing soccer, football, lacrosse. I tried them all. I wasn't that great in any of

196
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
them there, but certainly had the passion for hockey. And it was probably looking back and it

197
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,600
was my, probably my main sport. So when you're what, 12, 13, 14, did anything start to change

198
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,200
at that point in terms of your. Not to why I was a late developer. I didn't really start growing

199
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,880
at 15. I think I had a Legrosper. I shot up to like five, nine and 150 pounds. I actually made

200
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,920
that next fall after turning in 15 in January. The next fall I made the junior team, which at

201
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,280
a 15 was pretty good. By that time I was maybe growing a little bit more, but I was a late

202
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,400
developer physically. I played four years of junior. When I finished junior, I was six, one,

203
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,320
couple hundred pounds. And that's when I left to go play probe. So when I was right around 14,

204
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,760
I really started to kind of, I used to practice with my dad's junior team. They're all 20 to

205
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,840
15 to 20 years old when I was younger and trying to do all the drills and catching up. But I was

206
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,120
working hard, but I couldn't really generate any speed. And my dad was, come on, you got to skate,

207
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
skate, skate. And I was in my own mind, I felt the other skating, but all of a sudden I started

208
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,840
getting, growing and getting stronger. All of a sudden my stride getting started getting longer,

209
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,240
started getting more speed and everything just started to fall into place once I turned 15 and

210
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,480
became a junior. Were you weight training at the time? What kind of off-place training were you

211
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,640
didn't start weight training till I was 15. You know, at that time, you know, the conventional

212
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
wisdom, he had to wait a certain time to your growth plates and all that. And I think it's still

213
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,280
true till today. We had an assistant coach, my after my first year of junior, who befriended one

214
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,680
of the world's strongest men in the contest, huge guy. And he had brought home a program that he did

215
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,320
and it was Monday, Wednesday, Friday, three hour sessions. And, you know, we just used to lift,

216
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,360
it's all changed now, but back then it was heavy weights. And, you know, we couldn't even lift

217
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,320
our arms up to wash our hair after in the shower. It was one of those real beefy, big weight, heavy

218
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,040
weight, weight lifting programs, but that really, really cemented it for me. I love to work out. I

219
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,040
could see the changes happening there. So between getting the power on the ice, so I could skate

220
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,560
faster and handle myself. And it really all started to kind of come together for me at that,

221
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,400
right around that 15 years old age. So you're 17, you're in the WHA, which as you pointed out a

222
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,920
moment ago, I mean, the WHA was absorbed, at least four of the teams I think were absorbed by the NHL

223
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,920
when the WHA folded. But there were a lot of great players in the WHA. I mean, many stars in the NHL

224
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,560
came out of that league. What was it like back in the late seventies was the idea that you play in

225
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,480
the WHA and then eventually go to the NHL, or was it a totally parallel path that you pick one

226
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,040
or the other? No, not really. It was just, there was a lot of underages being signed by-

227
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,600
Did the NHL have a cap on what you could sign at the time?

228
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,480
No, there was no cap, nothing like that at the NHL. And the NHL wasn't too happy about losing

229
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,640
these young, great players to the like Gretzky, to the WHA. So it was a little bit of tenuous

230
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,080
relationship, obviously, between the two leagues. The WHA folded before those teams went, I think

231
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,480
was Winnipeg, Quebec, Edmonton and Hartford joined the NHL from, so went from a 16 team to a 21 team.

232
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,400
I think the city, the team in Kansas, or somebody became, I can't remember, I can't remember now.

233
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,400
My trajectory was, I was going to go follow my brother's footsteps to a college scholarship to

234
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,240
Denver University. So I had kind of a verbal commitment from Marshall Johnson at the time,

235
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,800
who was scouting the Western teams in junior and that felt like a great, great idea. And so I stayed

236
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,440
in junior B, which gives you the ability to go play college hockey instead of the major junior,

237
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,800
where you can't, it takes your eligibility away. So that was what I was planning on doing. And all

238
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,680
of a sudden the opportunity came to go play in the WHA and I was kind of getting bigger and stronger.

239
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,440
Obviously looking back, I was never ready to go play pro-hockey as a 17 year old,

240
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,520
but I can honestly say it was a great experience. What did your folks say? What did your mom say

241
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,000
about that specifically? I don't think my mom was too happy about it. My dad was a little more,

242
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,960
he kind of realized that I was at the point of, it was my fourth year of junior hockey. I was kind of

243
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,520
playing pretty well at that particular time for that league. I couldn't go to college yet. I had

244
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,800
to finish the year. And so I was kind of stuck in this kind of place. But was playing going to take

245
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,840
that college eligibility away? I'm assuming a year in the WHA. Oh yeah. I became a pro.

246
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,080
No, I became assigned a contract. I became a pro. That wiped out the college.

247
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,120
Was that a hard decision to make? For you personally?

248
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,440
I would have liked to have gone to college, but for me it just seemed to be the right thing for

249
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,480
me at the time, emotionally and for what I was really trying to accomplish. I wanted to be a pro

250
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,960
hockey player at that time. I'd kind of thrown everything into the ring. So, you know, and

251
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,560
someone's going to sign you and give you some money to go play hockey. It didn't seem like a

252
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,720
bad idea. I'm kind of amazed how small many of those contracts were at the time. I mean, Gretsky

253
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,360
had, I think, a huge contract with the Indianapolis Racers that ultimately got bought by the Oilers

254
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,960
while they were in the WHA. Even his wasn't big. But relative to WHA. Well, Bobby Hulsey signed

255
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,040
for a million dollars back in the early 70s, which was huge money for anybody back then.

256
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,200
So they were given some money out to try to get some recognition. And wasn't Gordie Howe

257
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,280
in the WHA at this point as well? Gordie Howe. I played against Gordie Howe in the WHA. Because

258
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,000
he was playing for the Whalers at the time, wasn't he? He was playing for the Whalers, yeah. And he

259
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,720
had a bunch of old Boston Bruins, Davey Keon, Johnny McKenzie. I mean, I watched these guys play

260
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,040
on Hockey Night in Canada my whole life. And here I am as a 17-year-old in the WHA playing against

261
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,720
Gordie Howe and Johnny McKenzie and Dave Keon and all these amazing players that I'd watched for

262
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,680
years in the NHL that had finished their careers in the WHA. So it was amazing, actually. Do you

263
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,400
remember the first time you met Kratzky? I do. I always tell the story. When I was flying from

264
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,520
Edmonton to go play for Indianapolis, it was shortly after he got traded with Peter Driscoll

265
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,200
and Eddie Meale. And he was on a plane flying from Indianapolis to Edmonton. And so our paths

266
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
crossed in the air. And so I didn't meet Wayne other than playing against him. I didn't meet him

267
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,800
until training camp when the leagues folded. I was drafted by Edmonton. And then we met at training

268
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,880
camp in 1979. And that would be in the NHL now? That was in the NHL. So you guys didn't meet? I

269
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,400
didn't realize that. I thought you guys crossed paths in WHA, but you actually didn't really meet

270
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,800
until you were both now. No, I was playing in Indianapolis. They folded. Then I went to Cincinnati

271
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,880
to finish the year for 52 games. And Wayne got traded to Edmonton. So we played against each

272
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,960
other but didn't know each other. And how many of the other foundational players of the Oilers came

273
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,840
in that merger? Who else was there? Was Fier there? No, Fier didn't get drafted until 80,

274
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:17,760
two years into our NHL. And Currie came later. Currie came maybe the second after the second

275
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,480
draft. What about Lowe? Lowe was the first draft for the Edmonton Oilers. Yeah, Kevin was the first

276
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,760
draft ever of the Edmonton Oilers back in 1979, 80 draft. I think Currie came the next year, Grant,

277
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,760
and Paul Coffey came the second year with Currie. Currie was like a fourth, fifth rounder.

278
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:41,840
Then Grant was drafted early in the third year. And so we basically, that whole team from the

279
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,840
draft came together. So Andy Moog was the goalie coming out of WHA? Andy Moog? No, he didn't come

280
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,760
until later either. He was playing, he came from Penticton, was playing Major Junior. He got there

281
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,480
before Grant. He came the second year when we upset the Montreal Canadiens. Yes, which was 1981.

282
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,360
It was 1981. I think our goalie got hurt or Glencie either put him in on a whim and they

283
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,240
stole the show as a rookie goalie. That was back when, I mean a lot of people don't remember what

284
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,400
the NHL looked like back then, but my recollection, I was only eight years old, but I was still obsessed.

285
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,400
One played 16, two played 15. It was done like a sweet 16, independent of conference, wasn't it?

286
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,480
Absolutely. Yeah, 21 team leagues, 16 made the playoffs, eight from each conference,

287
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,160
and you seated yourself depending on where you stood during the regular season.

288
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,280
Edmonton gets in there 16th, the top seed is the Montreal Canadiens.

289
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,120
The second year, first year we played Philadelphia. We made the playoffs the first year. We had to win

290
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,000
nine of the last 10 games of the regular season, our first year, just to make the playoffs. Of

291
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,440
course, Philadelphia was a team who we played. They beat us in, I think they beat us three straight

292
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,040
back then with the first series. Yeah, the first series was best of five. Best of five,

293
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,920
so they beat us pretty handily. They had a really good team.

294
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,680
And then it's that second season, which is 81-82, if I'm not mistaken.

295
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,720
It was 81.

296
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
81. Yeah.

297
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,920
Well, we played the Montreal Canadiens.

298
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,040
And you upset the Canadians.

299
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,600
We upset the Canadians, which was one of the most, to this day, one of my

300
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,720
best experiences playing hockey, that whole series against Montreal. And I can't remember

301
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
everything that happened, but I just remember coming home and people can Google it. And it's

302
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,120
the impossible dream. We were under the dressing room, obviously, waiting to be

303
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,360
come out onto the ice. And they played a video with the song, Impossible Dream,

304
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,480
with all the highlights, because we won the first two games in Montreal,

305
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,120
and coming home to close it out. To this day, it makes it here in the back of my neck stand up of

306
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
how energized that city was.

307
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,200
Was that the moment you realized that you were going to win a Stanley Cup?

308
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Whether or not that year. But when was the moment when you thought,

309
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
this is a really special group of people?

310
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,320
Well, it wasn't quite that soon, but I think what we all recognized was that Wayne was on

311
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,520
a different trajectory than most any other hockey player that ever played the game.

312
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,440
And the chances of Wayne winning a Stanley Cup were going to be pretty good.

313
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,880
And if we all played our cards right, and we were able to grab an oar and start rowing,

314
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,960
and fill a need on the team, our chances increased significantly if we could

315
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,000
follow Wayne. And that's true. That's the way we felt. Wayne was completely different than any

316
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,280
hockey player. He was chasing records books. He wanted to smash every record that it was ever made.

317
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,600
Well, 81-82 is sort of a crazy year, because those are some of my really first memories of hockey.

318
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,560
So I grew up in Toronto, so you guys always were two hours behind us. So to watch an Oilers game,

319
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,160
it was really a big ask of my mom. I do my mom's permission to stay up late,

320
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,240
because you guys weren't starting your games until 9 PM Toronto time.

321
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,040
On a school night.

322
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,320
On a school night.

323
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,560
But I would beg and plead, and I think my mom just gave up. I mean, it was just like,

324
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,600
oh, for heaven's sake.

325
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,480
Yeah, it was must-watch TV. I think he tied Marcel Deon his first year with 165 points,

326
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,160
and then the second year, I think he smashed it with 190-some points, and went on going away,

327
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,480
and then onto 215 points.

328
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,960
212, and then up to 15.

329
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
And then he'll score 50 goals in 39 games.

330
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,160
Well, it's that night I remember. So do you remember that night in Edmonton against Philadelphia,

331
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,560
when he's got 45 goals going into the 39th game, and at that point, everybody knows 50 and 50 is

332
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,720
going to go down, but nobody knows it's going to be five goals in one night.

333
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,160
Everybody's just trying to anticipate where to be and where to get tickets when it's going to happen,

334
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,920
but nobody going to that rink that night thought he was going to score five goals against the

335
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,720
Philadelphia Flyers. The big, bad, tough Philadelphia Flyers, there were no way they were going to

336
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,560
let that happen. And sure enough, he did. He scored five goals, and Pete Peters, and

337
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,720
what an amazing time to sit there and watch that genius on a day-to-day basis.

338
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,440
How often in anybody's life can they look at one of their own peers, a guy that's your same age,

339
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,920
and look up to him as a role model, but that's what Wayne was for us. He was so far ahead of us,

340
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:18,480
in his own mental preparation and the way he prepared for games, both physically and mentally,

341
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,920
and his ambition of what he wanted to do in the game of hockey, all those things were just so far

342
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,800
superior. And then to be able to sit there and watch how he practiced and his practice habits,

343
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,880
and how he prepared for games, and it was just remarkable to have someone like that to learn from.

344
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,880
I wanted to understand that a little bit more, because I think most people are familiar with you

345
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,480
as one of the greatest leaders in hockey. I mean, you are the only person to captain two Stanley

346
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,720
Cup teams. You've captained Edmonton to a Stanley Cup in the absence of Gretzky, and then you

347
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,000
captained the Rangers to a Stanley Cup, and no one's done that before or since. And yet, what

348
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,880
I'm hearing you say is some of your early sort of lessons in leadership came from watching Gretzky.

349
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
Well, not only Wayne, but a lot of people. Obviously, my father, who was a great mentor

350
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,160
and role model for not only myself and my brother and my sisters, but also a lot of hockey players

351
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,640
that he coached. He was a great coach, a great mentor, and then all the people that helped you

352
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,600
along the way. And then you turn pro, and then you start watching other players, and you start

353
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,720
watching and listening to coaches, and you start filling up your bag with all this experience. And

354
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,720
so you kind of learn through successes and failures of what actually works for you as a player and as

355
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,360
a person. So you're kind of collecting all this data, you know, all the way along. Wayne just

356
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,080
happened to be a teammate that was obvious to everybody that he was going to become the best

357
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,920
hockey player to ever play the game. He proved it as a kid from the time he was four years old to the

358
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,920
time he was in junior hockey. That's the time he turned pro, and here he is, you know, scoring 215

359
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,240
points unheard of numbers in any sport, no matter how you compare it to. It's worth pausing on that

360
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,680
for a moment because I don't think a non-hockey fan can put in perspective what Wayne Gretzky did

361
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:16,480
during about a seven-year run from 81 to 88, right? What you just described. To my knowledge,

362
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,840
no player has ever scored more than 200 points in a season. Gretzky averaged that for seven

363
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,400
consecutive seasons. Yeah, I know you're probably true. I know that he had, you know, 215, 212,

364
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,760
202 a few times, 198. I mean, there was years when he was winning the scoring title on assists alone.

365
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,040
Yeah, the only guy that I can actually say that was, you could even talk about Wayne in the same

366
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,760
breath in that regard as far as that offensive genius would be Mario. Mario had some injuries

367
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,040
earlier on, and so he never had that consistency that Wayne did. But he would be the only guy that

368
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,120
I could even think about comparing to to have that, you know, offensive genius that exists in a guy

369
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,160
that was able to do that. It was amazing having that kind of role model there, right? For a guy

370
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,960
that was my own age. That's right, because you guys are both born in 61. Eight days older, yeah.

371
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,360
I remember reading a funny story once, and again, it can be totally BS because it was just

372
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,840
blown out of proportion, but early in your days in Edmonton, you sort of got in trouble for something.

373
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,640
I don't know, did you fail to show up to a practice? Were you disciplined for something

374
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,640
very early in your time in Edmonton? Yeah, I was living at home my first year pro and

375
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,640
punctuality at that time in my life probably wasn't my best asset.

376
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,280
But this one was actually harmful. You were super punctual today. Whatever lessons learned.

377
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,680
Lessons learned, it's taken a while. But I was living at home and my mom was driving. We were

378
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,360
leaving on an extended road trip, and so I packed my bag and my mom was driving me to the airport.

379
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,360
And she asked, you know, because back then there was two airports in Edmonton. There was a downtown

380
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,800
airport and there was one out in the suburbs, the international airport, and I told her that

381
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,800
we were coming back into the municipal airport. For whatever reason, we just didn't think about it.

382
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,240
We drove to the municipal airport. So when I got out of the car and she dropped me off,

383
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,640
this is back in the day with no cell phones or anything, I looked around and normally you see the

384
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,520
guys in trench coats and their bags and everybody huddled together waiting on their tickets. And I

385
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,120
didn't see any kind of sign that you'd normally see. So my heart started beating a little quicker

386
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,920
and sure enough, I looked at the itinerary and we were leaving to Detroit from Edmonton International.

387
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,600
So my heart sank. I quickly jumped in a, actually I went and phoned on the pay phone and phoned the

388
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,680
oiler office and the secretary said, no problem, Mark, there'll be a ticket waiting for you at the

389
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,480
counter at the Canada counter. So when I got to in a taxi and got out to international, went up to

390
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,520
desk and got my ticket, except it wasn't going to Detroit, it was going to Houston. I was being

391
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,240
sent down to the farm team to teach me a lesson. So that was a tough moment for me at that time,

392
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,240
knowing that I missed a flight and was being sent to our farm team. I spent two weeks down there,

393
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,440
played five games and they called me back up thankfully, but that was not a fun experience.

394
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,800
But that must have left an impression. I mean, that's a pretty harsh lesson.

395
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Well, you think it would have, but there was a couple other ones along the way that

396
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,480
had to cement the lesson. But what you realize is that when you're playing on a team and you're in

397
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,760
a team format, nothing is about you as an individual. It's all about what's best for

398
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,200
the team and your time is not your own. It's a team's time and you have to be respectful of that.

399
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,200
So there was a lot of lessons for me growing up as a young adult in a professional environment

400
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,080
that doesn't always happen. But when you turn professional 18 years old, you grow up quickly.

401
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,520
In those days, I mean, even by today's standards, Gretzky was tiny. How explicit was it that

402
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,240
someone on that team or some group of guys on that team needed to make sure that he didn't get hurt?

403
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Well, back then, that's where the game was played anyways. I mean, it was a completely different

404
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,360
set of rules of what was acceptable behavior in the National Hockey League. It was tough hockey.

405
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,200
Not long before that, there were still bench clearing brawls during the game. I remember

406
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,400
in the WHA my last year as a 17 year old having three bench clearing brawls in one game. Insane

407
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,280
and big, big tough guys I'm looking up to. So yeah, I think every team had a lot of muscle under

408
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,680
teams and everybody had to stick up for each other. You had to be able to count on your teammates

409
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,520
for protection. Everybody had to be a cohesive unit and everybody had the answer to Bell for

410
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,080
the protection of the entirety of the team, not to mention something of Wayne's caliber because

411
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,960
he was obviously targeted in many different ways. And we had to be there to help him get through an

412
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,120
82 game schedule. So let's fast forward to your first Stanley Cup Final, 83 against the

413
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:08,560
Islanders. The Islanders have won three consecutive Stanley Cups right now. Mike Bossi, Brian Terracie,

414
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,880
Billy Smith, who I hated. If you're an others fan, you hated Billy Smith, right? And it's now

415
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,000
basically you guys are going to try to stop their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup.

416
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,840
How well do you remember that series? I remember every series I ever played, but that one in

417
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,560
particular because how much respect we had for the Islanders. And don't forget two years before

418
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,800
that we had taken them to six games and we didn't even know what we were doing back then. And we were

419
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,960
just doing it on sheer talent and adrenaline and youthful exuberance. And at that point, I mean,

420
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,640
the average age of the Edmonton Oilers is probably 22, 23, right? Well, we had some new veterans that

421
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,680
mixed in with some of our young guys. So then there was a good mix of vets and some young guys, but

422
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,360
we didn't have as much talent then as we ended up having the first year we won. But we still had a

423
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,360
good team. And of course any team with Wayne on it was X factor. So you make it to the finals and I

424
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,840
don't remember what the odds makers said going into that final, but I certainly remember as

425
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,680
a kid, it was like the Oilers are definitely going to win this.

426
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,960
Well, we felt good about it, but we had suffered some painful losses on our way to that first

427
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,440
Stanley Cup final, losing to LA, being up five nothing in the deciding game. There was a lot

428
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,280
of painful lessons along the way of what it took to win. And we were on the trajectory and we were

429
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,960
taking those defeats and those failures and really implementing into our game. And so by the time we

430
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:46,640
got to the Stanley Cup final, we felt pretty good about our game. We didn't realize how much of a

431
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,240
cohesive unit the Islanders had become by winning three straight Stanley Cups. There was a huge

432
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,800
disparity about where they were as a team and how they played as a team compared to where we were.

433
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,880
It was not even in the same league and they pretty much dismantled us even with the great Gretzky.

434
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,760
They dismantled us in four games and that was a real eye opener for us that if we're going to

435
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,040
take this to the next level there, we have to figure out first of all how to play much better

436
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,160
defensive hockey and then be able to recognize what teams are trying to do to us and then be

437
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,960
able to counterbalance that very quickly in game and make in-game changes and alterations to the

438
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,040
style of play we're playing. So it became a real chess game after that for us. We realized we were

439
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,280
playing checkers and they were playing chess and we had a lot of catching up to do in that regard.

440
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,000
Do you remember leaving the arena on the night that they won the Cup?

441
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,440
Yeah, that's a much often told story. I mean, you can only imagine nowadays a team winning

442
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,120
four straight Stanley Cups and the toll that would take on a team, not only as a team but on every

443
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,360
individual and we did. We walked by their dressing room and expecting a big celebratory

444
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,920
champagne fest and most of them were just sitting around quietly around their stalls by this time

445
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,240
with ice packs on their bodies and that told us that we weren't paying the price that we needed

446
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,480
to in order to win a Stanley Cup. So a lot of lessons, a lot of lessons leaving that rink that

447
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,840
night in that playoff series there that we came back to next year and started implementing very

448
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,760
early on in training camp. You talk about like any professional sport but like take hockey for

449
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,520
example, there's 21 teams. Well, 20 of them end the season as losers, right? I mean, there's just,

450
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,040
you know, there's only one team that's going to win the Stanley Cup. So there's 20 teams that either

451
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,840
don't make the playoffs, get booted out earlier or like the Oilers did in that case, get booted out

452
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:53,120
at the very last moment. But it would seem to me that losing in the way that you guys did in four

453
00:39:53,120 --> 00:40:00,080
straight, as you said, just getting your asses handed to you makes that a very long summer.

454
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,320
I'm sure there's a part of you that just cannot wait to come back in the fall. Well, we didn't see

455
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,920
it coming because we had actually taken them to six games two years prior and so we felt good about

456
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,160
the matchups and we felt and we knew what we're getting into. We knew the players. It wasn't like

457
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,040
they surprised us from a player standpoint, but what they really surprised us with was how they

458
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,040
were able to take our strengths away and expose our weaknesses and pretty much completely take

459
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,680
us off our game and the game that we like to play. They never allowed us to get into our rhythm and

460
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,880
that high pace, high tempo game that we were so used to and accustomed to playing. And we realized

461
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,280
that if we're going to beat the Islanders there, we had to beat them in the streets, in the alleys,

462
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,000
and eventually we're able to do that the next time around. But what did Glenn say there say

463
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,600
after that fourth game? Do you remember what was said in the locker room when you guys lost?

464
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,560
At that time, not much is said. It's a long year. Everybody's nerves are pretty fragile.

465
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,280
Everybody's emotions are high. It's not really the time to start kind of dissecting what had

466
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,760
happened. I think we all kind of had to live with it ourselves throughout the summer and then come

467
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,920
back and start to address it. And that's what we did. And to everybody's credit, they came back

468
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,400
with even more vigor and determination to get it to the next level. And sure enough, we were able to.

469
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,840
And it's kind of amazing. So the next season, 83-84, you guys face the Islanders again in the final.

470
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,920
And now it's there. They're going for five consecutive Stanley Cups.

471
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,120
And it was easy for them. They had to win an amazing series against Pittsburgh and scored

472
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,400
game seven overtime to get there. So you can imagine it's amazing, actually. To this day,

473
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,200
it's incredible that they made it. We won five cups in seven years, but to win five straight

474
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,040
is incredible. So I think I have a good understanding of what it took on you physically

475
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,520
as a person, but also as a team. And sure enough, there they were again.

476
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:07,360
Now, if I recall, you guys won game one close. They won game two, not close. It was kind of a

477
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,840
blowout game two, wasn't it? It was pretty good. Yeah. And then you won the next three. And it was,

478
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,760
I always thought like I just, what do you remember about the psychology of those last three games?

479
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,120
Because that was the passing of the baton. That was one dynasty to the next.

480
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,480
To this day, it was so amazing to see that team hang on to

481
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,840
that championship banner and how hard they fought to relinquish it. You would think at some point,

482
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,960
you know, we could have just willed it away from them that we couldn't. They would not relent their

483
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,760
grasp on it. And it was all we could do in that third game to win that third game. Once we won

484
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,360
that third game, I think it kind of was the start of kind of the wear and tear of them starting to

485
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,960
kind of show. And then our confidence went this way and they were beaten up and tired. And then

486
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,600
we're able to win the next games, not easily, but pretty handily. But to this day, I give those guys

487
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,880
so much credit because they would not let go of that, that mantle of being Stanley Cup champions.

488
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,640
And it was so much pride and hard work had gone into it there. And it was just even as no, I think

489
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,040
they knew in their hearts at their time had come. It was just devastating. I think they just were so

490
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,120
devastated that they finally lost there. But it was a great lesson in humility and sportsmanship.

491
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,320
And what a real pride a champion has to watch those guys go through that whole fifth year of

492
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,720
trying to win a Stanley Cup for five times in a row. Now going into game five, when you guys are

493
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,480
at home, if you win the game, you win the cup, which you go on to do. Was there even a tiny bit

494
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,560
of a thought in the back of your mind that not only could you guys win this thing tonight, which I

495
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,440
guess there was that thought, but that you could be the MVP of the playoffs. Was that even something

496
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,640
you never even thought of that, you know, every time we allowed ourselves the night before to

497
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,080
think about maybe we might win the Stanley Cup, it just was over wrought with fear of losing that

498
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,920
game and giving them a chance to get back in the series. We were terrified of the Islanders.

499
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,200
We knew how good a team they were. And even though they were banged up, we knew how dangerous they

500
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,440
were. And if you lose game five, you're back to New York to play game six before you know it.

501
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,040
Game six and game seven. Yeah. Yeah. You could be hosed if you lose that game.

502
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,920
It was not a good thought going all the way back there for a number of reasons, but none more than

503
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,320
than that we were terrified of getting this close and not finishing it off.

504
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:41,520
Where does that first Stanley Cup first of your six rank in terms of the emotion you felt when

505
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,480
that final buzzer went? Well, I get asked that question often about, do we know what was the

506
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,880
best Stanley Cup? And I can only say that every Stanley Cup had so many of their own unique

507
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,360
storylines because there's always different players and he's obviously the first Stanley Cup

508
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:04,240
growing up watching it being delivered to a team every year from the time I can remember watching

509
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,160
TV to the time that I actually had a chance to do it ourselves was a huge moment, both from

510
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,440
every individual on the team and then collectively what we had gone through to get there. So that

511
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,200
was that was incredible. But then the next year, it was the same kind of feelings again, because

512
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,280
of how hard we had to work and different set of circumstances, different set of motivating

513
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,200
factors that led into the team. And then the same thing happened all the rest of the time.

514
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,160
And the next year was Pelli Lindberg, right? That was the year you played, you faced Pelli Lindberg

515
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:46,080
was in the 84-85 Stanley Cup, right? It was the 84, it was the 85 Stanley Cup against Philadelphia.

516
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,240
You go from facing Billy Smith to Pelli Lindberg. I mean, I guess that's why these teams make it to

517
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,720
the Stanley Cup. I mean, these are. The Flyers had an amazing team. When you get to that point,

518
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,800
I mean, obviously playing a team deserverly of being there and nothing's going to be easy. And

519
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,120
at this particular point, we were pretty confident and we knew how to win and we knew what it was

520
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,600
going to take in order to win. We just needed to go out and execute. And we felt that if we

521
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:18,720
executed our best, we were a better team, but didn't make it any easier. So now you've won

522
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:29,520
two Stanley Cups by the 85-86 season. Edmonton looks unstoppable. The team is now fully connected.

523
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:36,080
I mean, you basically could have four or five 50 goal scores on the ice at one time.

524
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,000
In grant fear, you have my personal view, the greatest goalie that ever played the game,

525
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,160
maybe not by the statistics, but in terms of like just pure big game acrobatics.

526
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,880
It seems like there's no way you guys can't win a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seven Stanley Cup

527
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,360
consecutively. And then you come up against your nemesis from the town next door, the Calgary

528
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,880
Flames. And I, I, you know, by this point I'm in seventh grade. So now my, by sort of my,

529
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,880
I'm watching every minute of every game and studying every statistic, reading my Toronto

530
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,440
star newspaper after, and it's just like, I'm dissecting every detail of this. And I can't

531
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,720
believe what's happening, but all of a sudden it's game seven against the Calgary Flames.

532
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,640
Somehow you guys have each won three games going into the final game, the Northlands Coliseum.

533
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,880
And I remember that night having dinner, getting ready to watch the game and thinking,

534
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,160
trying to paint a glass half full view, which is, well, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe Edmonton just

535
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,480
needs, this was a good little wake up call and maybe they're getting a little too complacent

536
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,800
going into this game. And I've never gone back and watched that game again. So like,

537
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,160
I remember, you know, I watched it in 1986. I've never seen it since. I don't know. Have you ever

538
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,600
seen that game since that you watched it from start to finish? No. So if my memory serves me

539
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:58,320
correctly, it's two, two in the third period. Is that, I couldn't even tell you exactly what the

540
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,520
score it, I know, I know it was tied late in the game. Yeah. It's tied. It's tied. I think it's

541
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,080
tied one, one or two, two or three, three, but I think it was two, two in the third period.

542
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:15,040
Steve Smith behind the goal has the puck. He's going cross ice pass a million times a game pass

543
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,280
and it just didn't go in the right place and it hit the back of Grant Fuhrer's leg and in the net

544
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,280
it goes. And you guys are down three to two with less than a period to go. What do you remember

545
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,800
about that moment? Oh, I just remember Calgary building a team that could compete with this,

546
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,880
the Smite division back then was whoever seemed to be able to get out of the Smite division had a

547
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,880
good chance of winning this Stanley Cup. Winnipeg was a great team. Calgary was really amassing a

548
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,200
great bunch of talent and putting a team together that believed they could beat us. And they were

549
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,880
tough all year long. So we knew once we got into that series with them, it was going to be a tough

550
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:59,680
series. And it didn't surprise us at all that they were playing us every bit as hard and we're

551
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,560
matching us in every bit of the game, both physically and from a talent perspective. And

552
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,360
it got into that series where we knew it was going to be tough to your point where here we are in

553
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:16,080
game seven and that sports stuff happens. When you're in the middle of it, when something like

554
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,600
that happens, you got to shrug it off pretty quickly. We weren't able to rebound from it and

555
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,680
score a tying goal and end up winning the game. They beat us in that seventh game, but that sports

556
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,720
things happen. There's so much along the way. Yeah. And there's so much about it to me, right?

557
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,000
Like, do you remember in 91 when the Bills went to their first Superbowl and at the very end of

558
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,360
the game, Scott Norwood has to kick this field goal for them to beat the Giants and it misses,

559
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,200
it goes wide. And he's, you know, on some level, this big scapegoat and you sort of imagine, well,

560
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,720
is that how Steve Smith felt? But a really critical analysis of that game of the Giants

561
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,160
versus the Bills says it's really not about Scott Norwood at all. If the Bills had played

562
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,080
half as well in that game as they'd been playing all the way to the Superbowl, they never would

563
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:09,280
have been in a position where a last second field goal was necessary. And I think that was sort of

564
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,000
my feeling of the whole thing with Steve Smith, which was sure, it would be easy to sit here and

565
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,320
beat this guy up, not you guys as his teammates. I never got the sense, you know, reading the

566
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:23,120
newspapers that that was happening, but that the public could sort of beat this guy up for the own

567
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:28,080
goal, as they would call it in soccer. But it was like, look, that was just a symptom of there

568
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:34,000
were seven games in this series, right? Normally, good bounces, bad bounces over seven game series,

569
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,600
they all equal out. So I would never blame any one incident on winning or losing a seven game series.

570
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,080
You know, that whole game and the whole way it unfolded with Steve is we could do a whole

571
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,800
podcast on the psychology of that alone. It was an amazing time for all of us to, you know, just

572
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:02,960
look at ourselves and the vulnerability that we all face in a team game and how much you require

573
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,600
everybody to be in the moment and put the work in and trust and all the things that you talk about

574
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,400
in order for a team to win a championship. And it could have been any one of us. And I think the

575
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:24,560
compassion that everybody felt for Steve even drove our team closer together in some crazy ways.

576
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,200
Again, you know, another tough lesson along the way. But things happen. And that's what we took

577
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,560
out of it is you can take nothing for granted in this game, as good as we were, as much as we

578
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,680
expected to win ourselves as much as everybody else expected us to win. You can never take it

579
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,120
for granted of exactly what's happening here. And so we just collected ourselves again and dusted

580
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,080
ourselves off and came back the next year. Even more determined. And the next year you play the

581
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,120
Flyers again, if I recall, right? Next year exactly. We played with Ron Hextall. Now it's Ron Hextall.

582
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,560
Now it's Ron Hextall. So we play them the next year and we're able to, Wayne was able to accept

583
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:09,520
the Stanley Cup and the first guy he hands it to is Steve Smith. I mean, that's why sports is so

584
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,560
important in everybody's lives because it transcends sports. It goes much deeper than

585
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,240
sports, especially when you're playing on a team and doing the things that we were doing there.

586
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:28,240
It wasn't just about hockey. It wasn't just about shooting goals and scoring pucks and all the

587
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,200
things you would think about. It became much more about life and life lessons in order to sustain

588
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,000
that kind of remarkable level of play for the... Did you know Gretzky was going to do that?

589
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,760
Didn't surprise me when he did do it. Wayne was always looking out for people around him, always

590
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,480
had the ability to get outside himself and make sure everybody felt good about being on the team

591
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,800
and part of the team and all the things you would expect from a leader. So it didn't really shock

592
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,440
anybody that he was the first one that he handed the cup to was Steve. I remember that very clearly

593
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,200
and I'm glad you brought it up because I don't think I would have remembered to have brought it

594
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,440
up but I don't know, it just sort of warms your heart. I mean you compare it to the most extreme

595
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:18,320
grotesque example of the opposite which is 1994, the World Cup. Andreas Escobar scores on his own

596
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:24,160
goal and he ends up getting killed. I mean he literally is murdered in a parking lot of a bar

597
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,720
and here Steve Smith at least a year later gets to hold the Stanley Cup.

598
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,920
That's part of any human development for him as a person and as a player and what it did for him

599
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:42,160
and his own confidence and his own self-esteem and his own career. I think you know those are

600
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,040
the things that define you ultimately and stuff happens to everybody but you know he was able to

601
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:53,600
be strong enough to absorb the criticism that came along his way, strong enough to come back

602
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,200
the next year and go through the process of getting back in that exact same position and

603
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,280
then succeeding ultimately all the way through until we're able to win the Stanley Cup.

604
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:09,120
I mean that's what defines you not him shooting the puck in our own goal. What defined him was

605
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,720
absorbing that and having the strength to absorb it and the infrastructure around him to help him

606
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,200
absorb it and I think that's what good organizations, good teams do. They help people grow not only as

607
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,000
athletes and hockey players but as people because you need people and you need good character people

608
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,920
in order to win. So if you're just talking about developing athletes and hockey players and trying

609
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,080
to win a Stanley Cup it's just not going to happen. And do you see examples of that either in hockey

610
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,200
today or in other sports then or now where you have all the talent in the world but there's

611
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,200
something lacking in the character of the team? All the time, all the time. You see it all the time.

612
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:53,280
When we were kids we saw good teams that had infighting amongst each other and jealousy about

613
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,200
who was playing and it just never dawned on us to ever think that way. Let's reflect on that

614
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:06,160
for a second Mark because the talent on that team was staggering. As we've discussed earlier it

615
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,280
would be very difficult to imagine in a free agency era like we have today where you could

616
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,760
amass that much talent under one jersey. We could amass it but then you couldn't afford it. You

617
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,480
couldn't keep it. Yeah, you couldn't afford it. So again maybe there were stories that you're not

618
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,320
telling but you don't get the sense that this is a team of prima donnas where everybody's sort of

619
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,200
pissed that the other guy is getting more air time and more attention. Well it helps when you have the

620
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,360
the leadership that we had and it helps when you had the character that we had. I mean it's part of

621
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:41,040
it that Gretzky was so good that everybody was happy to acknowledge that this is our leader and

622
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,880
this is the best player on our team and we're watching history right now. I mean as you said

623
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:51,600
it was part of it but it was also the way he included everybody and this is crazy and the

624
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:57,680
stats that he was having he had a way of making Dave Semenko feel like he was the most important

625
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:05,760
guy on the team and the list that goes on and I think that in the end is really we always talked

626
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,320
about the stage is going to be big enough for us all to stand on. There's not one or two of us are

627
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,000
going to be standing on the stage when we win the Stanley Cup. The stage is big enough for everybody

628
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,280
so let's make everybody feel accountable and let's make everybody feel important and let's hold

629
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,240
everybody accountable for the job that they have and let's help them understand that even though on

630
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,240
another team they may be able to play a different role but in this team this is a role we need you

631
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,920
to play and we need you to do the best of your ability and anything less than 100% isn't going

632
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:40,000
to cut it and together we are able to help convince everybody that that was the path to success and

633
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:47,440
we never felt jealous of Wayne. We never felt that he shouldn't be on the ice at the end of the game

634
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,360
when he already had four goals and four assists. We wanted him on the ice. We felt a part of his

635
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,640
success. We felt that we enabled him and put him in position to have the success that he did so in

636
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:05,840
a crazy way we felt part of the reason why he was able to smash all those records so it was really a

637
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:11,280
team philosophy that we had that we're all in it together and you're right I mean one year in the

638
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,480
All-Star game we had 11 players off the Edmonton Oilers dressed in the in the All-Star game and you

639
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,840
would think everybody would have been vying for you know Glenn Anderson never once complained

640
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,360
about not being on the first and he was a 50 goal scorer and he couldn't get on the first power play

641
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:30,960
unit never once did he even think it was a problem. Didn't Paul Coffey almost score 50 goals one year?

642
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,320
He scored 48 goals. I mean a defenseman, unbelievable. He had a hundred and some points I mean it was

643
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,920
yeah so everybody had a role Kevin Lowe was an offensive defenseman he realized right away we

644
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,680
didn't need another Paul Coffey so he worked on becoming the league's best defensive defenseman

645
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,080
and that was where he got his pride of being able to shut the other team down. He knew that that

646
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,120
was our best chance to win as if he and Lee Fogeland could be the go-to guys to to shut it

647
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,920
down late in the games and so he took the pride to do that and everybody on the team did the same

648
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,440
thing. When you look at the way the NHL is today and again we'll talk about the arc of your career

649
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,360
but the league you finished in is very different very different style of play from the league you

650
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:17,520
started in. Could a team that played the way Edmonton played in the 80s could that type of a

651
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,560
team be successful today in the league? Oh yeah we you know Edmonton was the first I mean Glenn

652
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:28,880
Sather took the European flavor that had infiltrated into the WHA with all the European

653
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,800
players and all the Swedish players and Anders Hedberg and Alke Nielsen and Bobby Hall and

654
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,720
all these great European players that came over and then the Russians in 72 and the flavor that

655
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:46,480
we got from that kind of that infiltrated into the WHA and Glenn really realized that that was the

656
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,680
wave the next wave of the way hockey would be played and so when we came into the league in

657
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,600
1979-80 we were all really good skaters and and Glenn allowed us not to play we called it we

658
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,640
should call it tabletop hockey you know those games that you'd play with your hands and the

659
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,880
winger would go up and down but that's all you could go that was traditional NHL hockey and next

660
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,480
thing you know you know the Oilers come in with all the talent and we're all weaving and

661
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:17,360
going all over the ice and creating havoc for most teams so that style of play is basically

662
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:23,360
a refined version of what's happening now so to answer your question our style with Edmonton would

663
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:31,040
have fit perfectly with the way the game is being played now. It's amazing so you've now won it's

664
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:41,120
sort of July of 1988 you've just won your fourth Stanley Cup in five years when do you first hear

665
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,640
any sort of inkling or rumor about the trade? There was some kind of rumblings towards the end

666
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,160
of the season through the playoffs and you know we didn't think much of it you know how could they

667
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,800
ever trade Wayne Gretzky nobody would even think about it so we didn't really pay too much attention

668
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:01,520
to it we got wind of it you know normally with the smoke there's fire as they say there was

669
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,920
becoming more talk about it and I was actually in the summertime playing golf and got the word that

670
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,960
the trade had happened and I was this was like August early August was my recollection somewhere

671
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,120
in there who called you I remember being playing golf and stopping at the at the halfway house

672
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:23,200
and hearing about it on the radio that the trade had gone through nobody could still believe it so

673
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,760
until I got the phone call from Wayne or somebody that then I realized that it actually had come

674
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,440
through. What did you think at that moment I mean you're obviously thinking by this point you've

675
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,480
had now eight years to hone your own leadership skill I mean just listening to the way you talk

676
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,320
about those eight years you can see like I can just hear you describing lesson after lesson after

677
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:54,560
lesson up and down up and down hard you know hard lessons so on the one hand you still have a job to

678
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,920
do you became the captain of the Oilers that day right basically de facto even if they didn't put

679
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,640
the sea on your jersey until a few months later but it's got to be kind of heartbreaking too I mean

680
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,960
Gretzky was probably your closest friend on that team as well. Well it was devastating for everybody

681
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,040
it was certainly devastating for the players we felt that we were only just beginning of what we

682
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:20,080
could accomplish we're all in the prime of our careers. That's the part that's so hard to believe

683
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:26,400
is you guys literally were right at your prime you were not near the crest yet. No we were right

684
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,440
there in the sweet spot so for the players it was devastating for the fans and the people in Edmonton

685
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,720
it was devastating it was just a really tough day for everybody. Did you talk to Peter Pocklington?

686
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,480
No no I never talked to Peter about that there was no need to I mean what was there to say

687
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:49,280
obviously the feelings everybody had were obvious but to your point when all the dust settled and

688
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,080
the training camp came around you know what were we going to do about it you know we realized that

689
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:59,360
we had first the responsibility to each other in the room and we had a responsibility to the team

690
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,360
as much as we're disappointed with a decision to do something like that and

691
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:11,120
and then we added a responsibility to the fans and to the city and so we just like again collected

692
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,240
ourselves again and came to training camp and tried to do the best we could throughout a tough

693
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:24,480
year. Now in 88-89 I'm blanking who won the cup that year was that Montreal? No Calgary. Oh that's

694
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,960
right that's right that's right Calgary won so another Montreal won in 86. That's right and of

695
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,960
course Montreal would go on to win in 93 after that amazing series with LA but then in 90 you

696
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,600
guys make it back to the finals. Again you're playing the Bruins in the finals in 90. Yeah

697
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,080
we're the Bruins. What does it feel like to go back to the Stanley Cup without Gretzky

698
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:51,120
and now you're the captain I mean you've always carried the expectations in many way but now this

699
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,920
is the captain didn't change much for me I mean I was already entrenched and most of players on

700
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,400
the team knew me so I didn't really have to change anything. Did you create a narrative like I can

701
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,800
imagine it could very easily spiral out of control psychologically where you think well if we don't

702
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,920
win now it somehow means that all those years we won it was only because of Wayne. I mean did you

703
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:19,600
did you did anyone even allow that? It was true. It was true one of the reasons why we won all those

704
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,600
cups was because of Wayne but it was because of a lot of other guys too. Well to me that's the

705
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:29,520
point of 1990 right it's that you want to know how great the Oilers were yeah they're the best team

706
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:35,200
that probably ever laced up skates and with Wayne Gretzky if you never interrupted that team they

707
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,760
probably would have won nine Stanley Cups. But we didn't look at it as validation of how good we

708
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,120
were weren't as hockey players because we won in 1990 without Wayne. Never even crossed our minds

709
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:50,320
in fact the opposite in fact we were disappointed Wayne wasn't there to share it with us because of

710
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,960
all the great times we had had with him. So I don't think anybody on the team was looking for

711
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,400
validation that we could or couldn't win without Wayne. I just think when the training camp came

712
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,640
along like every other year you set your sights on winning a Stanley Cup and you go through the

713
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,360
whole journey all year long to win a Stanley Cup and you go through the process of winning a Stanley

714
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,960
Cup because now there's new players on the team and players that hadn't been before in that culture

715
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,480
and so you're trying to establish this culture with new players and you go through the whole

716
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:26,560
process. When ultimately we we did win in in 90 I don't think anybody felt like all right I will

717
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,360
show everybody that it was it was more that we were proud of the process that we had to go through

718
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,800
with younger players and different players with a lot of the players that have been through

719
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:44,000
the grind years prior and we were able to elevate ourselves and everybody else in order to make it

720
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,440
happen. So there was never any validation from us that we were able to do without Wayne. It was

721
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:58,240
we were way past that in my opinion as far as our own careers and our own thoughts of where we were

722
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,840
and where we stood in the game and and how we can look at ourselves as winners and all that kind of

723
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,200
things. It was a great victory don't get me wrong it was an amazing victory to bounce back and win

724
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:16,000
you can't put it ahead of any other other ones but it was it was just as satisfying to win that

725
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,320
that one as well. When did it start to look like because you your contract with Edmonton was through

726
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:32,080
what 92 or later maybe even longer right? Yeah I can't remember signing a contract at some point

727
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:37,360
I can't even remember if I had contract left or I had a couple years left or no I don't even know

728
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,440
I just knew it was over. When did you know it was over when did you know you were leaving Edmonton?

729
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:48,960
I knew it was over the last year I was there which was 91, 92, 90, 91. Yeah a lot of changes

730
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,920
the team would was breaking up a lot of injuries it just felt different whatever reason we ended

731
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,840
up losing to Minnesota I think you could just tell that. It was back when they were North Stars right?

732
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:07,920
With yeah yeah yeah you could just tell that that chapter and all our lives was over and it was time

733
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,960
to go do something different in a different place different town and you just know you can just feel

734
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,360
you can't explain it never even tried to figure out why or you know why I felt that way it was

735
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,920
just so evident to me that it was just time to go. Were you keeping this to yourself were you talking

736
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,680
about this with your parents other teammates I mean how were you processing this? No I didn't

737
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,760
it wasn't really that I was talking about it during the regular season because you're so

738
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,320
focusing on trying to win and I had to hurt my leg that year and I missed some time and

739
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,560
I think I'd missed like six weeks with a knee injury and came back early and my knee was never

740
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:46,000
really that great the rest of the year into the playoffs. When it was over at the end of the year

741
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,960
and we had finally lost we got to the semifinals again which was amazing and it was over when the

742
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,320
final game ended against Minnesota it was it was like the book that someone just took the two

743
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:03,120
chapters and closed a book and it was over as quickly as that. Did you know where you'd end up?

744
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,080
No idea hadn't even had the conversation with Glenn or anybody hadn't even talked about it with

745
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,120
anybody but had to have that conversation I don't even know when it was with Glenn at some point and

746
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:20,000
and he was great about it. What's it like to come to New York? Well as I mentioned earlier I was

747
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,640
into a lot of travel and you know I was 30 years old I was looking for a new challenge both

748
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:31,440
professionally and personally and when you start looking at the choices from where I was

749
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:38,000
in my own self-development what an amazing. What mattered to you the most in that next chapter?

750
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,880
Lifestyle, opportunity, excitement. Was it I have to win another cup or I want to be part of building a team?

751
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:50,000
I was 30 years old I was still at the peak of my career I was playing good hockey still yeah no

752
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,400
the hockey wasn't over but I just wanted to do it in a different venue a different environment

753
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:04,560
something completely different and then you just match it all up and the pin. New York's a

754
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:10,000
pressure cooker right I mean it's a this is in a sense that you know the Rangers haven't won a cup

755
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,720
since what 50 1950? Well I thought I didn't care about that. Oh 1940 they hadn't won a cup since

756
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:21,200
1940. Yeah I thought that wasn't a problem because of the pressure that wasn't Edmonton because it's

757
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,240
such a small community and players can't really go anywhere I mean it's really a small community

758
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:33,760
I loved it I'm from there we embraced it we didn't hide from it we immerse ourselves in with the people

759
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:40,080
and at restaurants and at bars and at parties and at fundraisers and at charity events and we're

760
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:46,240
we're part of everybody else we were just we've meshed in just like everybody else those years

761
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,760
in Edmonton so the pressure was always there with us so when I come into New York I didn't think it

762
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:56,000
would be a big problem I quickly underestimated that impact because of the size and the pressure

763
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,240
here in New York City but it it didn't bother me I mean it was something that I just really wanted

764
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:06,880
to focus in on. Yeah why do you think because there are some people Mark that just get crushed

765
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,960
in that environment I can only imagine what it would be like to be a professional athlete in New

766
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,800
York where you've got the world watching you right and this is a city that can put more pressure on

767
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,760
you than maybe even the country could like Canada. Well one lesson I learned very early on was from

768
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:27,200
Wayne when he mentioned something that the everything he has is because of hockey and he

769
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:33,520
never jeopardized his performance with something that had to do with off the ice so everything off

770
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:39,280
the ice took a back seat for Wayne. Hockey was his primary focus and so when I came to New York I

771
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:44,480
realized that I had to take that same philosophy in order to be successful here and because of

772
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:51,760
the distractions that are obviously abundant in a city like this and so my focus was purely

773
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:58,080
on hockey and everything else that came along with it would take a secondary role if I was able to do

774
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,760
it and that sustained me well and don't get me wrong we had as much fun as anybody that's ever

775
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:10,320
played in this city but and for myself personally my main focus was from seven to ten at night

776
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,800
playing that game to be and making sure I was at the best my ability to do it and I think that's

777
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,320
one of the reasons why I was able to perform here with arguably one of the toughest cities to play in

778
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,920
because of the distractions that just made it more fun for me more challenging and all the things

779
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,280
of being able to juggle that and that's kind of the juice that I was looking for as a 30 year old

780
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,800
coming off five Stanley Cups in seven years and feeling pretty good about my own game and and

781
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,760
excited about to live in the city and and try to be a part of a team that conquered

782
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,480
at that time a 50-year drought or a 51-year drought. What was it like when you showed up

783
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,920
for training camp in 92-93? Was it 91-92 I guess your first year? Well I missed training camp

784
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,840
because I didn't get signed till after the training camp had finished I actually met the team

785
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,520
in Montreal when the season was just getting going. And how were you received? Was it just

786
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,640
incredible excitement on the part of the players or was there a bit of trepidation?

787
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:14,240
I'm probably not the one to ask that but I was excited so I think the players were excited. I

788
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:19,680
hope they were. I think they were. I remember the Rangers hadn't won in Montreal in a lot of years

789
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:26,400
and we won to end up winning that game and it just seemed to start unfolding and I think that year

790
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,160
we won the President's Trophy. We missed the playoffs next year and won the Stanley Cup

791
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,680
the third year so I wrote this huge roller coaster of emotions through three years and saw

792
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:40,640
the great side of New York all the way down to the depths of missing the playoffs and the coach is

793
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,560
getting fired and taking the blame for the whole debacle and then all of a sudden rising up the

794
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,000
third year to winning a Stanley Cup. It was an amazing roller coaster and maybe one of the

795
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,440
reasons why it made the experience so much more powerful is that I was able to see both the good

796
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,800
and the bad of an athlete in New York and it wasn't easy when we didn't play well. Let's start

797
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,560
with the bad. 92-93, you guys don't make the playoffs. What is that like compared to other

798
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,560
pain you can experience as an athlete? For example, the year you guys get swept by the Islanders or

799
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,960
the year you guys lose to the Flames. How does it compare to say you don't make the playoffs?

800
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,800
Well, I think the year that we won the President's Trophy, it gave me enough time to realize the

801
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,360
importance of the Rangers in this community and the generations of fans that have supported this

802
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:35,440
franchise for so long and so by the second year I was fully aware of the impact that the Rangers

803
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:44,480
have in this town, in this area and then to go from the disappointing playoffs obviously and

804
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,600
failing again which always seemed to happen to the Rangers but having a great regular season so

805
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,320
that was kind of like a little bit of a trade-off to the next year just not having a good year.

806
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,720
And what do you think was wrong that year? We had injuries, there was a lot of things that

807
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,920
happened that didn't allow us to play as well as we should have and but anyways I got to see the

808
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:13,440
other side of the city and the pressures that can go against an athlete that's expected to

809
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:20,320
bring a championship. Luckily I guess I had enough experience to absorb it and articulate it in my

810
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:26,960
own mind and take the responsibility and then have enough support around me to help get through it

811
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:32,160
and then make the right decisions obviously the next year in order to allow us to get to the Stanley

812
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:37,200
Cup. Before you get to the Stanley Cup you got to get through your arch nemesis the New Jersey Devils.

813
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,240
Well we beat the Islanders and the Devils that year so it was a good hockey in this area in the

814
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:48,320
metro area there so we started off with the Islanders then played Washington in the obviously

815
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,800
the great series against the Devils. Let's talk about that end of that series so you're down three

816
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:59,280
games to two correct you now have to win the next two games and you make this bold promise right

817
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:06,640
so you sort of follow in the lineage of Babe Ruth and Joe Namath. Yeah wasn't thinking about that

818
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,680
long at the time. I mean did it occur to you what you were saying and how boldly you were declaring it?

819
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,560
It occurred to me what I was saying because I was trying to as a captain you're always monitoring

820
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,760
your team's confidence level every day not only during the playoffs but every day you walk into

821
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:27,200
the room your spider senses are up and you're just gauging everybody's emotional state good

822
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:32,320
better and different in that particular time I was just trying to instill a confidence in the

823
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:40,240
players and our routine on that day was to kind of get on a bus and go gather on a bus and go to

824
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:44,480
New Jersey have a pre-game skate in the morning have lunch have a rest and then go back to this

825
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,600
so I knew everybody would be on the bus reading the morning papers because we had done it all

826
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,800
year long so I said well what a great idea to let the guys know that I believe we can win this. I

827
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,080
wasn't even thinking about that it would be splashed across the papers it was only supposed

828
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:07,440
to be for our 20 guys on the bus. It wasn't supposed to be for 12 million New Yorkers and

829
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,840
certainly the New Jersey Devils but that particular point it didn't really matter to

830
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:18,640
me I mean you do anything you can to swing the momentum back into your favor and that's what I

831
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,960
was trying to do is instill the confidence that we had displayed all year is that we could go in

832
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,760
there and win game six we had done it numerous times it wasn't like we couldn't do it we had to

833
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:33,280
figure out a way to play better we had to figure out a way to stop the momentum of the Devils and

834
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,680
that's where the inspiration came from. So going into game seven how do you feel? Well we feel good

835
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:44,400
we feel good about winning game six we feel good about going home for game seven it's been a

836
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,440
friendly place for us all year long we love playing in front of our home fans there's nothing

837
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:54,000
not to like about our position going into game seven other than the Devils are a great hockey

838
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,960
team and could play a spoiler very easily which was terrifying we knew in order to win game seven

839
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,280
we were going to have to earn it they weren't going to roll over they felt that they could

840
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,720
win the game just as much as we did and ultimately is one of the best series I've probably ever played

841
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:15,440
in. Was it game seven that you got the hat trick? Game six. It was game six you got the hat trick to

842
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:22,480
win the game to come back what was the score of game seven? Two three two two one one go

843
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:28,800
Matov the greatest the great Matil goal in overtime. Yeah so now you're back in the Stanley Cup finals

844
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,480
before we get to that I want to go back to something you said a moment ago because it

845
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:38,560
honestly like the way you articulated it I've heard great CEOs say the same thing right which is

846
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:45,920
the job of a great CEO is to monitor the confidence of the team is to boost morale

847
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,920
is to provide leadership in a meaningful way not just a sort of hollow way I want to kind of

848
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:59,440
understand how how these things developed in you like when did it become apparent to you

849
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:07,040
that like what you did mattered more than just how you played on the ice what you said mattered

850
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:13,040
how you spoke in the locker room mattered like what was the evolution of that from a 17 year old punk

851
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:20,960
who can't even get to the right airport to the guy who on the eve of game six is calling a shot

852
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:27,360
heard around the world guaranteeing victory yeah good question I think it really stems back when I

853
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:34,480
was all the lessons that I had from a father who was a hockey player who was a team player who was

854
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:42,320
a tough defenseman who protected his teammates and knew the value of a team in every sense for

855
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:49,600
protection for success for individual accomplishments he really understood what it meant to be a team

856
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:57,200
player then I'm a stick boy for my brother's junior team when I'm 14 years old actually 12 to 14

857
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,000
and got to see my dad coach and how he treated his players and how he talked to his players and how he

858
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,880
motivated the team and how he brought the team together and how he made everybody feel

859
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:14,880
comfortable and accountable and important and valued you just see the power of what a team can

860
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:21,360
do when they are completely synced and linked together without ego and without all the things

861
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:29,280
that can undermine any team in any sport and then get to a professional level as a young guy just

862
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,360
trying to get my own footing as a professional but still seeing and understanding all the things

863
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:39,040
that I've learned all along the way and then seeing it play out in different formats and sometimes

864
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:45,360
positively and sometimes very negatively and so you start to realize that geez some of the things

865
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:52,800
that you know are actually really good and smart and healthy and productive and this thing and the

866
01:18:52,800 --> 01:19:00,560
way that this is happening is very toxic and detrimental and not good for anybody and so you

867
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,160
just start kind of like I said earlier just start building the confidence of what you're doing not

868
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:11,120
only as an individual but what you're trying to do as a team and and how you're carrying yourself

869
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,360
on the team and the decisions that you're making for the team as an individual and

870
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,160
and it just starts to come together and then you start to see other players and other great

871
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:27,040
leaders and hear about other great events and and it just starts to accumulate over time until

872
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:32,960
you're finally put in the position to have to pull the lever on some of the things that you've

873
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,680
learned at critical times and having the confidence that it's the right thing to do

874
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:45,040
and and I think you know with any great leader will tell you there that they no great leader is

875
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:50,800
is mistake free every leader makes mistakes but it's the equity that you've built up into the

876
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:56,960
people that you are around that will forgive you for making an honest mistake that just didn't

877
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,960
work out well it was a calculated decision it didn't work out but the players or the people

878
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:09,680
aren't going to abandon you because of that mistake they trust you it was a bad decision didn't work

879
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:14,960
out but they still trust your vision and and how you can get there and so that's we're kind of all

880
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:22,800
evolved into some seminal moments in my own career as a captain in the 1990 Stanley Cup run all the

881
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,120
way into through New York until we're able to win the Stanley Cup with a bunch of great character

882
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,440
talented kids here in New York City. You've obviously talked about the role that your dad

883
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:39,680
had that Wayne had and probably some of the other guys you played with in Edmonton how much of this

884
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,680
was modeled for you by people not on your team were you able to look at opposing players and see

885
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:50,320
some of these characteristics that would ultimately come to define your leadership? No question both

886
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,200
positively and negatively we would watch other teams and good teams be fighting with each other

887
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:02,000
on the bench and yelling at each other on the ice as a leader on the opposing team I'm using that as

888
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,960
a galvanizing force for our players to say look at these guys they don't even like each other they

889
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:12,560
don't even win I'm using every any tool I can to convince our guys that we can win no matter what

890
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,680
it is and so if I see a weak link like that that's gonna we're gonna expose that anything because

891
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:23,440
it gets down to such small detail when two teams are so evenly matched the smallest things matter

892
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:29,040
and you're always looking for that little bit of evidence that little bit of self-doubt on the

893
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:35,120
other team or any kind of pressure cracks that are starting to happen and to use that for your

894
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:41,520
own team to expose that there's so many things that go along and so you really start as you get older

895
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,560
and you're in a different position of leadership you're looking for to play the game within the

896
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:52,080
game and that's oftentimes where you know series and Stanley cups are won and lost if you can win

897
01:21:52,080 --> 01:22:00,000
the the war of not only attrition but also the the mental war that goes on against another team

898
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:05,200
of all the players you played against but never with so I know you played against Gretzky but

899
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,840
let's discount Gretzky and Curry who you played against eventually but because you played with

900
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:15,200
them but of guys that you only played against who did you respect the most first as a player

901
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,120
but also as a leader and you can think of those separately you know I was looking at looking at

902
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:28,000
the other day with my son my younger son about there was a wall somewhere of all the names and

903
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,080
I looked at it and I was gonna I played against every one of these players and go and it went

904
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,360
back to some of these guys that were playing in the 60s that were still playing we're still

905
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,600
playing at the end of at the end of their career at the beginning of yours yeah and then to evolve

906
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,800
over four decades so you can imagine the amount of players that I played against and with over

907
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:52,480
over 26 26 years pro you know just off the top of my head I just had so much respect before I

908
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:58,240
was just as a kid with Bobby Orr he was my favorite player I loved the way Bobby played I loved

909
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,200
everything about him I loved the way he dressed I loved the way he's he looked in his equipment

910
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,680
so I had a lot of respect for him I had a lot of respect for when did you first meet Bobby Orr by

911
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:13,280
the way not too much later when I was already a pro I didn't get a chance to meet Bobby as a young

912
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,880
guy at all I got a funny story for you so when I was a kid I had a Bobby Orr signed hockey stick

913
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:24,160
on my wall and it was like you know one of my prized possessions I had your autograph I had

914
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:31,120
Gretzky's autograph Curry Fuhrer like I had half the Oilers posters and stuff autographed

915
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:37,360
and I had this Bobby Orr hockey stick autographed as you know being a good Canadian kid all you're

916
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:42,160
doing is playing ice hockey and street hockey every day and so sure enough I'm out there one day

917
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:47,520
and we're playing street hockey after school and I break my stick and I don't have another stick to

918
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,000
play and you know what I did it's like the worst thing I've ever done in my life I go into my

919
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,240
bedroom I take that Bobby Orr stick which is way too big for me I go and get a saw I cut the top

920
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:03,040
of it off which is the part he'd signed and I go back out and I just start playing with it and all

921
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,760
I've got left is the signed top end of a Bobby Orr stick and my dad comes home and somehow he

922
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,240
had got me this stick you know somehow I mean he wasn't pissed at me but you could just tell he was

923
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:19,360
sort of like I don't think you're supposed to do that son I mean I was like you know I was probably

924
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,560
like all for the love of the game 10 years old and I just can't to this day I still think I cannot

925
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,840
believe I saw that stick you just said Gila Fleur as well now you did play against Gila Fleur of

926
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:37,680
course Gila Fleur but I always remember the great series against Boston that rivalry and

927
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:42,560
when they had to go back to Boston and Mike Milbury said he wouldn't get out of there alive

928
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:49,680
and the story goes out Gila Fleur was at the Boston Gardens at two in the afternoon in full

929
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:55,840
equipment smoking cigarettes and went out and scored a hat trick when I heard that story I

930
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:01,280
said wow because I know what it was like going into the Boston Garden so I can really appreciate

931
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:06,800
performing under that kind of pressure back then but loved the way he played but there's so many

932
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:12,080
players that I played against that were ended up being not only great leaders but great players

933
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:17,840
great people off the ice great in their communities and that's one of the I think the assets of our

934
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,240
game is is really the people not only as players but what they've been able to do off the ice as

935
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:29,760
well I always felt like Eric Lindros was a player that never fully reached his potential he was just

936
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,800
always getting you know something about his style of play that lent itself to just him getting hurt

937
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,480
too many times yeah it's health and it's not only injuries but just health in so many different ways

938
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:46,400
and that allow a player to do what you're talking about and have an extended career I think but

939
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:51,200
Eric played 12 years or when he first came in the league looked like he could play until he was 100

940
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:56,560
well do you remember before so the year he was playing for the Oshawa Generals and he was going

941
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,720
to get drafted and it was really clear Quebec was going to draft him I mean this was non-negotiable

942
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:06,000
and he kept signaling guys I'm not playing for Quebec so don't bother drafting me trade me trade

943
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,720
me trade me but they don't but I think Sports Illustrated came out with an article that said

944
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:19,280
this kid is Lemieux, Gretzky and Messier melded into one and I remember thinking

945
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,120
guys are you freaking kidding me like how much pressure could you put on a kid like

946
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,520
taking the three greatest players in the NHL and telling me that this kid in junior A is going to

947
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,440
be the next him and I grew up in Toronto so a lot of the kids I went to school with actually played

948
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:37,040
with Eric during like the junior junior like MTHO you know triple A like through probably fourth

949
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:42,640
grade before Eric really started to leapfrog ahead so you knew he was great there was no question but

950
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:47,760
I thought that was like that was a bit much pressure to put on a kid I thought yeah I think

951
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:54,240
so too you know he was, Kour got cut short the fact about the NHL there's a lot of great players

952
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:02,560
there's a lot of great players and to elevate your self to the likes of Lemieux and Gretzky

953
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,560
those are pretty lofty standards well and as you said there's the longevity thing I mean I still

954
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:11,040
can't believe you played 25 years like in fact I gotta be honest with you I never had done the math

955
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:15,920
until I was preparing for us to sit down and talk today like it was really on the last couple of

956
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:21,920
weeks that I did that actual math because I just didn't realize it was that long in fact I forgot

957
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:28,480
that Gretzky had played a full 20 years like that just doesn't make sense in a sport like hockey

958
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:33,360
like that's the exception not the rule you you really and especially the way you played because

959
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:40,160
you played such a physical game I mean what's the worst injury you've sustained that I got so lucky

960
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:48,480
um I had both knees ligament stretch MCLs probably four times in each knee I had arthroscopic

961
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,480
surgery on my shoulder towards my second last year how many concussions did you have hard to

962
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,400
count yeah they just don't really keep track of them the same way they keep track multiple

963
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:06,160
concussions but didn't really keep track and back then you made sure you woke your roommate

964
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,360
up a couple times if you did get a bump in the head make sure he woke up you know we just didn't

965
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:18,560
know we just didn't have the the knowledge of of what concussions were and the impact that they

966
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:24,880
had so it was completely different back then what was the hardest part about retiring for me I

967
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,040
didn't really have a hard time retiring if you can believe it just so like I recognize it was kind of

968
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:38,000
finished in Edmonton I kind of recognize that well it's funny I asked my trainer I said okay

969
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:46,880
if I train every day am I going to be able at 44 am I going to be able to compete with the younger

970
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:53,120
guys on that kind of level and he goes no because you're going to need more work to rest yep your

971
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,880
recovery is my recovery is just not there so every time I work out I need three days of rest or

972
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,440
whatever it is and so it's diminishing returns over 82 games but do you ever think like imagine

973
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,200
there's a model I've often thought about this and it's you know you have to change the economics of

974
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:14,400
the sport but it's like you take a guy like you who's now in his early 40s and you say look we're

975
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,160
going to reduce the amount you're getting paid but you're only going to pay it play every third game

976
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,960
you know could a roster support that because in many ways what you're bringing from a leadership

977
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:31,440
and an experience and an intelligence standpoint is not going down it's only going up but you just

978
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,720
as you said you don't have the reps in you you can't practice and play with 22 year olds

979
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:42,160
yeah I personally probably wouldn't have liked that I mean I love playing every day I love being

980
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:47,040
in the pit I love being in the trenches that wouldn't have worked for me I couldn't have sat

981
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,680
on the bench for two out of every three games I just don't think you have the equity with the

982
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:59,520
players I think you you you can do that and be a great resource and you can actually play and it

983
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:05,040
would be for some people but I think to be in a big leadership role I think one of the parts of

984
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,640
being in a leadership role is being is actually got a hurt with everybody example and being in

985
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:16,640
those tough skates and being those tough it's not the worst philosophy and so I just knew that if

986
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:22,560
I couldn't do that then what else do I have left to play for I didn't want to play for money I didn't

987
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:28,480
want to play for anything I didn't care if I was eight games behind Gordie Howe I didn't mean

988
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:37,440
anything yeah that's that was another stat that I had totally forgotten which was so you retire

989
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:44,320
as the second leading scorer of all time so you know somehow these two little kids that showed up

990
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:53,920
from the WHA no I was a I retired as a leading scorer of mere mortals that's why you were the

991
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,920
leading scorer of all time he doesn't count he's way easier so I was the when I retired now I'm

992
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,200
I'm third of the mere mortals that played the game but what's amazing is what you just alluded to

993
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:10,240
a second ago you were only what eight games behind Gordie Howe for like an air base and play another

994
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:15,040
year playing I you only eight games behind Gordie Howe I said I never played the game

995
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:19,920
ever you never played for a record never played for a stat never played for any kind of goal

996
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,240
record any kind of a cis record any kind of a game record I never played for any of that

997
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,960
wasn't even on my radar when I first came in the league I was just trying to make the NHL I never

998
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:36,560
thought I would even be in a position to hold any record and so I it wasn't even in my DNA as a

999
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,680
player to to even consider something like that and all the things that came along were just by

1000
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:48,000
coincidence of playing a certain amount of time but feeling a part of the of the whole journey

1001
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,360
with the team and so just to come back and play on a promotional tour to be Gordie Howe I mean what

1002
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:57,360
was that gonna define me with it didn't mean anything to me that's telling though Mark I mean

1003
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:02,160
I think there are a lot of players who would have come back for another year or half a year or as

1004
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:07,760
you said kind of just the record tour I think a lot of people would and but but I think in some

1005
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,280
ways I think the fact that you didn't the fact that you you finish eight games behind one of the

1006
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:19,600
most storied records in sports says more than if you had the record maybe you know I guess that's

1007
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:26,800
for other people to decide for me I you know I was so focusing on being a team player and trying to

1008
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,840
win a Stanley Cup every year so that was the only thing that kind of motivated me and finding that

1009
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:38,800
whole chemistry within a different team every year and and it all came in different ways and

1010
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,360
different teams were motivated for different reasons but finding that motivating galvanizing

1011
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:49,920
factor every year that we could all rally around was the juice that kept me playing for 25 years

1012
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:55,760
if a young player comes up to you today and says I'm starting my career I mean was there a moment

1013
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:01,280
when you were just so nervous that you you know going into a game or going into a series or going

1014
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:07,600
into a tryout or something and and you actually had to will yourself off the ledge because

1015
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,040
obviously stress and anxiety and nerves are a very positive thing I mean you can totally harness

1016
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,680
those things but when they go too far they can be crippling do you recall a time when you actually

1017
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:24,720
were on that edge and you had to pull yourself back from the sort of destructive to the

1018
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:29,920
constructive utilization of that force that's that's such a great point and the fear factor

1019
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:37,200
of failure is always evident you know we were terrified of losing in Edmonton all the time as

1020
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:42,960
good as we looked from the outside I can only imagine inside we were terrified of not losing

1021
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:49,200
and probably more terrified of underachieving which is worse than anything is being an underachiever

1022
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:58,080
so how do you get yourself that you're able to be ready enough and relaxed enough to be able to

1023
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:03,520
execute in the most important situations and I think it really gets back to what we talked about

1024
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:09,760
earlier as you know your preparation trusting in the preparation trusting in the evolution of the

1025
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,920
team over the course of the season and and repetitive scenarios there that you know you can

1026
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,040
do and you can trust yourself and you got trust in your teammates that they're going to be in the

1027
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:25,120
right position because it's this whole choreographed ballet that's happening on the ice at 40 miles an

1028
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:31,760
hour with 24 switch blades traveling 60 miles an hour and dangerous and but everybody's got to be

1029
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:38,080
in the right position at the right time in order to make that cohesive systems work so I've felt

1030
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,320
it myself but when you do fail there because you're not always going to play your best when

1031
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:46,560
the chips are on the line you are going to fail you are going to make mistakes you are going to

1032
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:53,920
be the guy that gives a puck away to to lose the game and just being able to be strong enough to

1033
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,920
have an unwavering self-belief in who you are and what you're trying to achieve and a lot of that

1034
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,920
comes from the preparation and the commitment that you put into the game so there's been a lot of

1035
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:11,280
questionable moments along the 26 years where you doubt yourself and I remember standing on

1036
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:18,240
my first Stanley Cup final along the blue line in Edmonton and being so amped up that

1037
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:25,600
when the anthem finished my whole right side of my eye got blurry and I played about 20 seconds of

1038
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,360
the first shift and then went off to the dressing room I had to lay on the training room table for

1039
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:36,000
five minutes in order to just get vision back whatever happened just way too amped up way too

1040
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:42,800
ready to go way too excited and that was a great lesson as well because when I looked over at the

1041
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,640
Islanders they were just kind of in a nice groove and a nice relaxed state and so how do you marry

1042
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:56,640
that with too much not enough and that perfect sublime state and then of course a lot of philosophy

1043
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:04,320
and some other things that I worked on in my career from a self-awareness standpoint and things like

1044
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:09,280
that. Say a bit more about that you live a different life than most people can relate to right I mean

1045
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:14,720
most people finish high school get a job or go to college or do whatever but you were sort of

1046
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:20,560
thrust into a limelight from from a very young age you had to make a bunch of mistakes in front of

1047
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,560
a bunch of people and and before you know it you're you're sort of 44 years old or whatever you were

1048
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:32,160
at 43 when you retired I want to talk a little bit more about retirement and the next phase of your

1049
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:38,800
life but I want to know a little bit about how you like what kind of introspection and self-reflection

1050
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,760
were you able to do as an athlete or was that mostly something that came after? No I think it

1051
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:50,960
was an evolution all the way through I became curious why to start with why Wayne was the best

1052
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,280
hockey player in the world and so I started watching him I started watching him in practice

1053
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:59,840
and his practice habits and what he did in practice to become a better player and how he

1054
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,840
was able to saucer the puck on his forehand and backhand and where he would go in certain

1055
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,520
situations and all that and then I so if you're curious enough there's a lot of answers out there

1056
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:14,400
how to become a better player both physically and emotionally and tactically and all the things

1057
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,840
that you would think because you don't rep your the way you represent yourself you're just an

1058
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:23,280
average guy right like you're not a guy that had this god-given gift now of course you obviously

1059
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:30,480
have great natural athletic talent but you're this guy who as you tell the story no one could have

1060
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:36,720
predicted on your first day in the NHL you are going to be the second leading score of all time

1061
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:44,960
or the first amongst mortals whereas in the case of Gretzky if someone said that on day one it was

1062
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,760
believable it was more evidence and that's why it's so amazing that you are patient with and

1063
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,880
there's certain things that you look for in athletes about any sport not necessarily when

1064
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,400
they're younger but in how they can change and evolve so there would have been no evidence up

1065
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:06,160
until I even turned pro that that would have happened so I think that yes you are given

1066
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:13,520
god-given talent it has to be nurtured and and honed and then you have to be willing to

1067
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:19,520
absorb a lot of information in order to become a good pro and a good teammate and then you know

1068
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:26,640
how do you elevate your own game from a fourth line fighter to a second line left winger to a

1069
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:32,240
second line centerman to a first line centerman through the course of a career right like but yeah

1070
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:37,760
so I think curiosity won and I felt that there was a way that I didn't believe in the zone

1071
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:43,520
say more about that I didn't believe in that it was just by chance that a guy would have a good

1072
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:49,680
game you would hear these people talking about wow it's really in the zone tonight I don't know why

1073
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:55,200
I don't know what happened couldn't feel my legs I could skate all day never got tired the goal

1074
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:01,200
looked like a soccer net you know didn't feel like anybody else's on you know you never once

1075
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:06,000
felt that I felt it but I didn't think it was just because it just was you didn't think it was just

1076
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:12,240
a chance you think that's something happened along the way in order for that to manifest itself at

1077
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:18,400
that particular time so I started asking questions about you know okay well what is that I mean what

1078
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:23,920
there's a there's a bigger so what is your take what is your take well I think it's a level of

1079
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:28,480
concentration that doesn't get discovered you know it's a whole nother that's another whole

1080
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:35,120
nother podcast but I just think it's a it's a deep level of concentration that you're not even aware

1081
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:44,400
of that's mixed with preparation that's mixed with belief that's mixed with repetition of the skill

1082
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:52,480
all that comes together at a certain time and I think that in to just very quickly I just think

1083
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:59,200
that in a in a professional world there's a lot of external things that go on outside the game

1084
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:06,640
that can be conflicting and be distracting and take away energies from you not only physically

1085
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:12,800
but also emotionally and if you in a perfect world you have everything in your personal life

1086
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:20,560
in complete order you have one thing to think about on a big game like a game seven or whatever it is

1087
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:27,200
so when you guys were like literally these 23 year old kids in this town called Edmonton

1088
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,880
do you think you were able to take it more seriously as a combination of things one

1089
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,640
it's not New York City right so you're not or Montreal or Toronto where the pressure is

1090
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:44,320
unbelievable it was unbelievable in Edmonton too but almost a result of how well you how much

1091
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:48,800
potential you guys brought to it and then secondly you have this thing around Gretzky

1092
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:55,680
which is you all figure out very quickly you are in the presence of greatness and this is a once

1093
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:01,040
in a lifetime opportunity you're a piece of history in many ways do you think that somehow that all

1094
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:06,640
galvanized to produce this environment you're describing which is you could focus so much on

1095
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:12,720
your on honing your craft at a time when it could have been easy to have put 80 percent of that

1096
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:18,000
effort in but 20 percent of that could have been put elsewhere I think again it doesn't just happen

1097
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,080
overnight I think this is something that if you're interested in it takes a long time to get there

1098
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:28,960
and I think that there are a lot of questions that need to be answered along the way of anyone's

1099
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:35,520
career you know why am I here what am I here for you know what are my intentions what is the end

1100
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:41,840
game how am I being perceived by my teammates how is the sporting hockey world perceive me

1101
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:48,240
what am I doing off the ice to be a good citizen what am I doing to contribute to the community

1102
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,440
that doesn't happen when you're 18 years old that doesn't happen when you're 20 years old

1103
01:41:54,160 --> 01:42:00,320
that happens over a duration of period as you evolve as a person so for me when I came to New

1104
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:06,400
York I was 30 years old and I had a lot of time for introspection to think about you know what I was

1105
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:13,440
needed to do in order to be successful as a player and all that maybe if I came here at 22 it wouldn't

1106
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:19,120
have been the same result because I wasn't ready for it or mature enough to handle the external

1107
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:26,560
things around the city who knows I just look at it it's it's an evolution of anyone's I think that

1108
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:34,560
the sport has to mirror the maturity of anyone's and if those two things kind of keep going on a

1109
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:42,320
parallel track then you get into players like Tom Brady and players that are redefining their sport

1110
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:48,720
and doing things that are considered unattainable whether you're playing into your 40s and

1111
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:54,480
still you know you're you know as quarterback you know I'm just using him as yeah sure but I think

1112
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:01,360
if you asked him his own trajectory of when he first came out and got thrown in well I think

1113
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:06,080
there's something else about I don't know Tom Brady but I would infer from the outside that

1114
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:10,800
there's something about Tom that's very similar to what you said earlier which is I don't get the

1115
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:15,280
impression he's playing for another Super Bowl ring of course he wants to win another Super Bowl

1116
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:20,560
ring but that's not the reason he's playing I get the sense he's playing because he believes he can

1117
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:26,800
continue to perfect his craft and I and I suspect that that's what the greatest winning is the end

1118
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,880
and that result it's the way you can measure that it's the way you can measure it and of course

1119
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:36,080
you know every time you come to training camp you want to win but I don't think you can just say you

1120
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,680
want to win I think there's certain things especially at his age that he needs to do in

1121
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:45,600
order to be put himself in position to be efficient enough at that position in order to

1122
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,000
take his team to another and so I think that's where that whole thing I'm talking about where

1123
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:57,360
where sport and life finally come together at a certain age and they parallel the tracks where

1124
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:02,240
you become more evolved as a person which only helps you in your sport because you have a better

1125
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,960
understanding of who you are as a person and all the things that are it takes to be successful

1126
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:12,480
from a physical standpoint and the training and then the involvement of the knowledge of the game

1127
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:17,360
and the experiences that you had so it's it's quite remarkable and it's one of the things that

1128
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,760
I'm sure he would tell you because I can say for myself is one of the things that keeps you in the

1129
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:28,240
game at that later stage of the year is is honing that walking on that razor's edge

1130
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,280
that very few people have done and to try to do something that has never been done before

1131
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:39,680
you look like you're still in great shape what do you do today for exercise how do you stay in shape

1132
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:46,000
a little bit of everything obviously weightlifting is important cardio and I can get cardio from many

1133
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:52,880
different I was never a runner but I ran the New York City Marathon back I guess 2011 10 year

1134
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:59,360
anniversary of 9-11 are you deliberate about it or sometimes professional athletes when they're done

1135
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:05,280
they're done with structure they've spent their whole lives being very structured in doing this

1136
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,680
doing this being here at this time being in this training camp being you know eating this way doing

1137
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:14,640
this doing that and then when they're done it's like look I'm gonna work out but I don't want to

1138
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:19,440
program I just want to do what I feel like doing I mean where are you sort of on that spectrum

1139
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:24,480
yeah I'd say that shortly after I retired I was doing some other stuff and I I kept waiting for

1140
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:29,520
that because I used to give myself three hours to work out when I was training you know it'd take

1141
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:34,160
me a minute to get in the gym and it'd take me you know 10-15 minutes to get myself with a deep

1142
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:39,680
enough concentration to be able to actually put the work into that I wouldn't that would need I

1143
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:43,440
didn't need three hours to actually physically work out but I to get myself mentally ready to

1144
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,760
work out and then when I retired I kept waiting for that three-hour window to come along and

1145
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:53,120
never came along never came along because of the kids and all that kind of stuff so I'm kind of

1146
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:58,560
pretty loose about what I did find though is that I feel better when I work out I physically feel

1147
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:05,440
more awake I feel more alive I feel more energized more energy fresher and I guess it's a probably

1148
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:09,600
net result of doing it for so many years that your body just becomes accustomed to it and you feel

1149
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:15,440
sharper so you know when I did retire I wouldn't work out all the time and it became apparent to

1150
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,440
me that I actually feel better when I when I get some kind of work in it doesn't have to be anything

1151
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:24,000
like I did when I was in the three hours in the gym and all that but if it's a 20-minute cardio

1152
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:30,400
or if it's a anything a yoga session or so I'm kind of resigned to the fact that if anybody's

1153
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:35,680
doing anything I'll kind of jump in on it and try it and obviously got a little bit of a routine to

1154
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:40,480
three four days a week but I'll try anything do anything and just to kind of keep the body

1155
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:46,720
moving how often do you get back on skates playing some charity events every once in a while I'm on

1156
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:52,000
the ice quite a bit because I coach my son's team so I'm on the ice I use actually a friend's

1157
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,880
rink up in wire mill Paul Orland the great guy he's got a little private rink there so I go there

1158
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:02,240
and just do some cardio you'll just get out there and skate I'll just get up there and just do

1159
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:05,840
skating exercises because it's just so good for your core and for your

1160
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:10,640
and you don't have the impact and you don't have the impact of running and all that and so it's

1161
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:15,200
just and it's just so much development of your core and your legs and all that so keep that strong

1162
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:22,720
how fast can you skate relative to your 28 year old self what percent well what you realize is that

1163
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:28,320
you have such massive leg power when you're playing and when you stop that atrophy is pretty

1164
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:34,480
quickly so if I had to say put a percentage on it yeah like I'm curious as to how far you would

1165
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:40,800
fall in 20 years I would say I have 10 percent of what I had wait wait 10 percent less no overall

1166
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:47,440
you're that far from where you were 20 years ago I would I would say so but my guess is if you

1167
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:51,760
can't so I'm still in good shape I can still skate but if you get back on the ice with a bunch of

1168
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,280
40 year old dudes I bet you skate circles around them right depends on what you're skating I mean

1169
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:03,120
if I if I took six months and skated and started to develop some of the muscles that you really

1170
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:10,640
need to skate and for your edging and all that yeah maybe but you know I'm 58 so you know it's

1171
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:16,240
just atrophy unless you skate every day those muscles atrophy you know your growings and your

1172
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:22,240
hip flexors and your quads and ham I mean that whole muscle group of of your legs and so that's

1173
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:26,400
just straight away speed skating around circles what about the ability to change direction is

1174
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:31,520
that even more lost is that even a loss because you instantly become fatigued because you don't

1175
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:36,960
have the muscle part of their source it's just it's amazing actually in fact it wasn't it was

1176
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:43,520
about two years after I retired and I put my equipment on to do something and it felt like I

1177
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:48,400
didn't have my I felt like I felt like you were wearing someone else's equipment because my legs

1178
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,680
were about twice the size and my pants fit different and all of a sudden my legs were in

1179
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:58,000
the pants that I had retired with and it felt like they were just swimming on me just because

1180
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,600
of the atrophy what do you weigh now weigh about 215 which is not that far from what you play

1181
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:08,720
I played right there at 215 or so just distributed you think it's just distributed differently yeah

1182
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,560
you just don't have the muscle mass you lose muscle mass just because of age but you also

1183
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:17,840
you lose muscle if you're not using it well I mean you can't just admit it's amazing how much power

1184
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:24,800
it takes to play hockey from a leg standpoint and a cardiovascular standpoint it's incredible and

1185
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,280
you know when you do it from the time you're a young boy to the time you're 40 something and

1186
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,440
you retire you don't even think about it because it's all you've known get on the ice and not even

1187
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:38,240
think about it what does your son think about hockey the one that you coach he's how old well

1188
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:43,440
lines 30 the older boy is 32 and he's coaches he loves hockey he's made a career of coaching kids

1189
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:50,800
and up in Washington the little caps uh douglas loves hockey he's 16 playing midget hockey and

1190
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:56,160
that's the one you coach yeah yeah does he want to play pro I think you would love to play pro

1191
01:49:56,160 --> 01:50:02,560
is it hard how do you feel about letting him be his own guy oh I think he needs completely needs

1192
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:09,360
to go on that journey of self-exploration to see what he can extract from himself does he ask you

1193
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:18,320
about it oh we talk often about hockey I think he knows what's required even before whether or not

1194
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:24,480
you have the talent it's an interesting journey for him to see where he can take it ultimately

1195
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:29,520
that'll be defined by him and not by me it's got to be interesting it's got to be a mixed bag of

1196
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:36,160
emotions for you to watch your watch your kids play this game and know that I you know I know

1197
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,520
enough about you to know that all you really care about is you just want your kids to be happy you

1198
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,320
want your kids to sort of find their own way and you want to stay out of their way enough but also

1199
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:49,920
be there enough to answer a question and support I mean it's just I think it's just harder when your

1200
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:54,880
dad is mark messier to no balance I mean your dad was such an important part of your development

1201
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,680
is it sort of like you want to be able to provide exactly what your dad did no more no less is that

1202
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:04,720
sort of how you think about question being the son of any professional player and any sport is going

1203
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:10,560
to come with some baggage for the kids whether they feel it as they're expected to be a great

1204
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:15,600
player because their dad was and and all the things that go along with it ultimately the

1205
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:20,960
reason why sports in my opinion is such a great thing for all kids is that it does take you on

1206
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:26,320
that self journey of self-awareness and what you want to do and are you able to do and are you able

1207
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:32,560
to put the discipline in and the time in and that's required to be the best you can be it doesn't

1208
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:38,960
matter how good everybody else is what do you have and are you willing to extract every ounce of

1209
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:47,360
talent and work out of your own body that ultimately no matter how far you take it

1210
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:52,720
will serve you well in wherever you land whether it's in a sport or in business or whatever that

1211
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:59,120
kind of journey can only be beneficial for for all kids and certainly for for my kids as well

1212
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:03,200
and i think there's something else about team sports which is all the stuff you've alluded to

1213
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:08,560
around this type of leadership and the difference between you know i always love that movie miracle

1214
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:13,520
because i thought it did such a great job of showing how at an individual level that team

1215
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:20,000
was not nearly as talented as the soviets right but on that one moment in that tournament

1216
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,960
everything that they had done under her brooks sort of came together and they outplayed the

1217
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:31,440
best team on you know in the world as a team not as a collection of individuals and so much of what

1218
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:37,120
you talk about is really you've repeatedly emphasized this importance of both leadership

1219
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:42,480
and team play and the dynamics of the team and again i think you've you've paid a lot of that

1220
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:48,800
tribute both to your dad and to Gretzky as being two great role models of that and many more but

1221
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:55,120
yeah there's there's a lot of information out there for for any young aspiring sportsman

1222
01:52:55,120 --> 01:53:03,200
sportswoman girl boy no matter what their dance music acting hockey baseball football whatever

1223
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,920
it is if you're interested there's a lot to learn if you're interested tell me about the

1224
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:12,800
mark messier foundation what do you guys do well when i first came to new york it was really

1225
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,160
important for me to entrench myself into the community the first charity i ever got involved

1226
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:24,160
with was the alberta lung association when i first became a pro in in emilton and glenn saether our

1227
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:28,800
coach there really kind of emphasized that we'd get out into the community and pick a charity and

1228
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:34,240
attach your name to it and help the alberta lung association was an incredible learning experience

1229
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:39,440
for me because it was all about the babies that were born premature and had unhealthy lungs and

1230
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:46,720
whatnot fast forward to coming to new york the inundation of requests to get involved with some

1231
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:53,280
kind of charity in the city was overwhelming so i had to figure out a charity to involve myself

1232
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,840
with and then help out as much as i could everywhere else and that became the tomorrow's

1233
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:05,120
children's fund at the hackensack medical university and years after retirement it became

1234
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:12,080
the parent that i could start my own foundation and really kind of focus in on the things that

1235
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:17,280
inspired me the most and that was giving back to in providing access and opportunity to kids that

1236
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:24,320
didn't have the means to do it like hockey in the city so the mark mister foundation is basically

1237
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:31,520
that it's about creating access and opportunity in different areas of kids lives or that they

1238
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:36,800
would never have had the opportunity otherwise and for different circumstances whether it was

1239
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:43,040
financial or infrastructure not available or school plastics or whatever and so that's what

1240
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:47,840
it focused on and it spun out of the kingsbridge national ice project that we're trying to build

1241
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,560
here in the city that that would provide a lot more access and opportunities of kids to play

1242
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:59,440
hockey in the metropolitan area here with three nhl teams you you would think we could do a better

1243
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:05,520
job of creating more access for kids to play a sport that's so much entrenched into this metropolitan

1244
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,800
area it's hard to imagine you not living here isn't it you have so many tentacles in this in

1245
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:17,200
this new york area business-wise philanthropy wise family-wise which is again i think it's

1246
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:20,640
for me i always think of you as being from edmonton which of course you are from

1247
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:26,320
but you've probably lived almost as much of your life here as you have there right yeah well that's

1248
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:32,080
close i came here when i was just 30 and i'm 58 now so it's been a you know i remember my first

1249
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:37,840
press conference saying i hope my second career is this is good as my first we weren't able to

1250
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,400
quite win as many championships here in new york but we were able to win the one but my experience

1251
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:47,440
here in new york has been incredible i think the thing that really drew me to come to new york was

1252
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:52,960
not only the challenge of breaking the 54 year old drought of the stanley cup but also immersing

1253
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,480
myself into a city of this magnitude and and the culture and all the things that go along with it

1254
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:04,240
that was very appealing to me and it didn't disappoint me in any way i've can't tell you how

1255
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:12,800
much i've enjoyed my time as a player in retirement in this area and the people and the amount of

1256
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,360
experiences i've had with so many different types of people in the city it's interesting i mean the

1257
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:22,240
last thing i really want to talk about mark is this idea where there just seem to be two types

1258
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:29,600
of athletes there are those who retire who can never sort of get over the fact that they're not

1259
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:36,000
still 28 years old and that their glory is no longer going to be wed to that and then there

1260
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:44,960
are another group of athletes who retire and move on and continue to like live life to the fullest

1261
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:50,320
with respect to whatever the next chapters of their lives fit and you're obviously in the

1262
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:54,720
latter category i mean you know we could have in a whole other podcast talking about what you're

1263
01:56:54,720 --> 01:57:01,200
doing in business today and all the things you're doing outside of hockey do you have a sense of why

1264
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,720
you're able to make that transition and when it was time to say goodbye you said goodbye

1265
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:13,040
and you know your identity doesn't have to be wrapped up in that and why others have such a

1266
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:17,760
difficult time doing that what do you think defines that difference i think you just nailed it i think

1267
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:23,440
to put it very quickly i think the thing is i didn't identify myself only as a hockey player

1268
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:30,240
i think that in order and for me to be able to do that i needed a good family around me and good

1269
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:36,240
people around you to remind you that there's a lot more to life than hockey although it's a huge part

1270
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:41,440
of my life from the time i was you know very young to the time i turned pro and is one of the things

1271
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:47,200
that i had to really focus in on when i was 18 because it requires all your attention to perform

1272
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:54,800
at your highest level but it wasn't who i was as a person big difference and i think with good

1273
01:57:54,800 --> 01:58:01,840
people around you to remind you of what's possible outside the game you eventually realize that you

1274
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:07,440
do something that you love and it's the most amazing time of your life but it's not going

1275
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:14,720
to define you in the end and i think those two things became very apparent to me you know sometime

1276
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:19,760
in the middle of my career where there's just more to this than playing hockey

1277
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:27,120
and that's where it became so apparent that you are an important part of any community that you

1278
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,800
play in and there are the things that are going on and the way you conduct yourself and how you

1279
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:36,800
give back and all the things that are so important to a to a professional athlete in order for him to

1280
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,920
do and i think those are things that really kind of separate you from the player and so when it's

1281
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,440
time to retire yeah i sure i miss the game i love playing hockey there's nothing better than playing

1282
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:52,960
hockey and being a part of a team but i was able to walk away because i had a new family and there

1283
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:58,240
was more to do in life in a different way that alleviates that need to go to the rink every day

1284
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:05,600
and have your ego boosted because of your playing on a professional hockey team so i think that kind

1285
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:11,040
of really made it easy for me to retire and to kind of go on to the next phase of my life when

1286
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:16,880
at 40 some years old now look at if i was 25 years old and forced to retire because of

1287
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:22,560
injury or something that would have been tough to retire i no question no question so i'm only

1288
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:27,360
speaking for myself that i was i fulfilled everything you know for you know 26 years pro

1289
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:33,920
44 a young family in my own mind was there anything left to prove do you know from a hockey

1290
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:39,040
standpoint no was there is there a lot more to prove from a philanthropic standpoint there's

1291
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:43,520
a lot more it's amazing mark do you still keep in touch with any of the guys from edmonton i uh

1292
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:48,960
everybody everybody yeah we just had another reunion in edmonton not long ago we had one here

1293
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:53,280
in new york and what's amazing about uh the city is that everybody seems to come through here at

1294
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:59,920
one point during the year so being able to stay connected to a large portion of the guys on a

1295
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:06,320
fairly regular basis is is quite easy i would love to be a fly on the wall for one of those

1296
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:11,840
reunions literally just sitting up there in a raft or watching like the greatest hockey team

1297
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:19,280
that ever laced up reminiscing about gosh what it's been now 30 to 35 years ago the 85 team was

1298
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:27,120
voted the top team in the last hundred years and so we had a reunion for that team in edmonton not

1299
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:33,920
long ago and it was remarkable actually to get that team together and see everybody that some

1300
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:38,000
of the guys i hadn't seen a lot of the guys i had but just to be able to get to to your point

1301
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,520
to get to get to the room and and everybody uh sat in exact same seats on the bus on the way to the

1302
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:48,880
rink and it was it was just did you guys get on the ice and skate we never did that would have been

1303
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,280
we should have done that actually we should have had some kind of yeah just some came

1304
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:57,280
a game a quick pickup or something like that we should have been with both andy and grant there

1305
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:02,080
you had two goalies oh yeah oh the whole team was there unbelievable it was amazing actually we

1306
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:07,280
should have done that i'll remember that for the next one you know i i got to meet ronnie lot

1307
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:11,920
recently who was one of my favorite football players ever growing up and we were you know

1308
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,280
after we're shooting the breeze for a bit i said you know do you guys ever get together and play

1309
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:19,200
a game of pickup football you and montana rice and everybody goes yeah yeah we did it actually

1310
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:25,200
kind of recently and i said what was it like and he goes it was awful i mean i hurt for like three

1311
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:31,040
days after he's like you know jerry was the only one who was really really in still in amazing

1312
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:35,440
shape which of course if you look at ronnie lot by the way he looks just like you he is exact same

1313
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:39,840
weight that he played at so it's not like this guy got out of shape but he's like look jerry was still

1314
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:45,040
sort of you know really in shape but but it's the same idea like to get that 49ers team of the 80s

1315
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:48,880
together and the oilers of the 80s i mean i don't know there's something there's something very

1316
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:54,800
special about those uh well i think it is i think the connection is so strong because you have such

1317
02:01:54,800 --> 02:02:01,120
a deep respect for what you did together and the commitment that each individual put

1318
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:07,840
forwards towards the common goal i think that's where the uh gratitude comes in do you think that

1319
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:14,320
it's just impossible to ever reproduce that again in the sense that like has money changed that i

1320
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:19,200
mean back in the 80s you guys just didn't get paid a fraction of what players get today do you think

1321
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:23,440
that has changed the game in order to win you in order to win you got to get there somehow or

1322
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:27,920
another the team has a shorter window to do it to bring it all together but they have to get there

1323
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:32,960
on an emotional level in order to win st louis did this year you know you look at them

1324
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:37,360
just before christmas they weren't even into playoffs yeah kind of an amazing turnaround

1325
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:43,520
amazing turnaround but somehow or another they were able to emotionally connect on a much deeper

1326
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:51,120
level than they had ever in the past and it's without that so yeah i think the principles of

1327
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:56,240
winning are the same you got a much shorter window to do it it comes and goes for some

1328
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:00,560
organizations where they don't quite get there but any team that actually wins will tell you there

1329
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:06,480
that the team connected in a way that they didn't probably feel possible at some point prior

1330
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:11,360
notwithstanding that your kids are still at a point where you don't want to be away from home

1331
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,120
but fast forward a few years your kids are all in college or doing their own thing

1332
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:22,320
would you want to coach in the nhl it's hard to say i obviously feel like i have a lot to offer

1333
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:30,560
any organization any team because of my experiences that would lend itself well to any part of the

1334
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:35,920
organization coaching is something that i enjoy and i don't think there's a big difference

1335
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:43,520
philosophy speaking coaching a 16 year old team than coaching an nhl team because you do have to

1336
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:49,120
communicate the bench awareness the things that come have to come naturally to some of the coaches

1337
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:55,120
and it doesn't come naturally to everybody it just doesn't i recognize that i do have a

1338
02:03:55,840 --> 02:04:01,680
unique ability to coach and i think i get it from my father and to communicate so it'll be

1339
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:07,840
interesting and see if that ever happens one day and last question sort of out of your purview but

1340
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:13,440
will toronto ever win the stand like that i'm asking seriously i do i do think so

1341
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:18,400
you know the toughest part about our game is it's such a tough league

1342
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:26,240
but the good news is that you can see a team like st louis bring it together in a short period of

1343
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:30,800
time i mean they obviously had the pieces they couldn't have won if they didn't have the pieces

1344
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:36,560
in order to do it but somehow or another they are able to galvanize which in a way that they hadn't

1345
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:44,400
previously and so when you look at the turnarounds of teams that have gone on to to win the stand

1346
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:49,600
like up in the last 10 years you know you look at la you know when it's finishing eighth and

1347
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:55,440
winning the stand like up the league is structured now that every team has weaknesses there's no

1348
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,920
perfect team out there right now every team has to decide where they're going to put their strengths

1349
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:06,000
and and absorb the weaknesses because of the salary cap era and what it does is it lends itself to a

1350
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,680
very competitive environment where it's a tough league and but it also gives a lot of teams a lot

1351
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:16,160
of hope that it can win and i think it's good for the fans it's good for the league it's good for

1352
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:20,400
the players it's good for the organizations it's going to be hard for someone to dominate

1353
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:26,240
perhaps like we did in the 80s or something like that but to answer your question i believe uh

1354
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:31,360
does the toronto may believe they're gonna with the nucleus they have there right now they should

1355
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:37,360
be able to get it done and it's now probably longer than the rangers drought because wasn't

1356
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:45,120
the leafs last cup in 67 67 so uh what are we working on now yeah so you're that's long that's

1357
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:51,200
that's actually that is now longer than the rangers four years is a long time well long long

1358
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:57,520
long time but i love the leafs no i guess it's not quite there yet another couple years but

1359
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:01,040
i think it's funny growing up in toronto i never liked the leaves because i just think this sort

1360
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:05,760
of that harold ballard era was so bad and i mean we would go to the gardens but you were going to

1361
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,600
watch the other teams that were coming i mean every time the oilers played including exhibition

1362
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:15,920
games i was sitting up in those crappy gray seats to watch a game but now i'm always amazed when i'm

1363
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:21,360
back in toronto just what an ordeal it is to get to the air canada center to see a game i mean it's

1364
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,960
got to be one of the toughest towns to get tickets well i just know coming to new york an original

1365
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:30,080
six team and the passion behind the generations of fans that were here it didn't take me long to

1366
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:34,320
understand the gravity of it and if you and then when i when i say i love the leaves i love the

1367
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:39,440
leaves because of that same yeah yeah original six teams are just in a different league the history

1368
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:47,920
the passion the heartbreak all the things that go into an organization that make it so compelling

1369
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:53,120
to go to the game and to cheer the Leafs on if you're a leaf fan and even if you're not a leaf

1370
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:58,480
fan you still got to respect where they've been and where they've come from and and the way the

1371
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:05,360
organization has moved into the modern era and this juggernaut organization that is just

1372
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:12,320
so compelling well if they win this year i've done the math now it'll be 53 years if they win this

1373
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:17,760
year so they've got one they've got two years left well i'd say 54 is a long a long time but

1374
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,040
they're working on it so hopefully they can get it done sooner or later it'd be nice to see a

1375
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:28,960
canadian team get in there but oh yeah for sure it's the it won't be i can guarantee it won't be

1376
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:35,680
given to him mark this has been awesome thank you so much for all these insights you know the first

1377
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,200
time we met i remember you never know when you're a kid you know you meet you meet your

1378
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:44,880
boyhood heroes you sort of you just never know like can they live up to the poster on your wall

1379
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:50,000
can they live up to that time you got that autograph then you got to stand in front of

1380
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,400
them for 3.7 seconds while they scribbled something on your hockey stick or whatever

1381
02:07:54,960 --> 02:08:00,640
it's been a pleasure getting to know you and i think that this podcast i think is just hopefully

1382
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:05,600
a great way for folks to get to really understand your style of leadership which is certainly not

1383
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:12,480
about boasting but about just sort of a quiet passionate yet highly intuitive and introspective

1384
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:16,720
form of leadership that i i don't know i guess i'm biased but i don't think we see a lot of that in

1385
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:21,360
sports anymore if nothing else i'm i'm highly appreciative of it and i know that others will

1386
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:27,040
be also well thank you great being on great talking hockey as always and uh we'll be watching those
