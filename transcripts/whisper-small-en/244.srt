00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,280
Hey, Sid. So great to see you again. It's been a long time since we've seen each other

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
in person. The last time we sat down for one of these, of course, it was in person and

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,840
we didn't have video now. We've got video, but we're in a different time zone. Congratulations

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,720
on the success of your most recent book. For folks listening or viewing, give us a sense

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,720
of kind of where this book fits into the prior work. We talked at great length about one of

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,000
your books, The Emperor of All Maladies, but there was a book that followed that. And then,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,880
of course, there's this. So maybe put this in the context of those books.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,640
Well, so it's an interesting. So, you know, this is part of a trilogy and possibly a

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,760
quartet that I'm working on broadly called the Life Series. And the attempts of these

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,400
books is to try to explain and understand how we understand life and how we're

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,000
manipulating life, living things, obviously, particularly humans.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,480
And so in an odd way, the place to begin, to some extent, the trilogy right now.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,560
So the first book, The Emperor of All Maladies, the second, The Gene and now The Song of

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,720
the Cell, would be to probably start with the gene, the gene being the least unit or

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,920
the smallest unit of information.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,240
And then realize as you end the gene that genes which are encoded in DNA, the

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,840
molecule DNA, are lifeless. They don't have any autonomous life. A gene is just a

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,800
molecule. It's a chemical. And it's the it's the cell that brings it to life.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,800
And without the cell, there would be nothing. All of that code would be useless.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,400
I liken this to the human genome or any genome to a score of music.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,480
But a score is lifeless. There's no music in a score. It's just it's the code.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,800
You need a musician to bring it to life. And the cell is that musician.

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
And hence the word, hence the title of the book, The Song of the Cell.

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,320
The cell brings it to life.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,600
So the second book, to some extent, is The Cell.

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,000
And then the third book, bizarrely enough, is the first book.

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,840
It's sort of like Star Wars, the prequel to the sequel to the prequel, where you learn about what

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,040
happens when cells become average.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
So that would be one way to read the book, read the series of books, start with the gene,

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,000
move on to the second unit, which is the cell, and finally end up with the sort of dysfunctional

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,400
aberrant cell and what happens to it when its genes in genes go haywire.

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,960
A completely different way would be to read them as they appeared.

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,880
And the reason behind that is that they progressively go downwards.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,560
I mean, the first book was of course, a history of cancer and cancer therapy.

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,600
They progressively go downwards and delve deeper and deeper into mysteries of that history,

37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,960
missing pieces. What did we not understand about cancer?

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,440
Obviously genes and genetics.

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,840
What did we not understand about cancer in terms of its cell biology when the cancer genome

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,040
atlas was, for instance, completed?

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,240
And what do we understand now?

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,560
So they can also be read chronologically from the first to the third, but you would get a

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
different kind of story.

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
And that's what's interesting about it.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
You can read it by the way.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:51,040
It's possible that my question slash statement here is a bit of tainted by a bit of recency

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,440
bias because I read them in order.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,120
And of course, I've just finished reading the cell because we decided on a very last minute

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,800
basis, we were going to try to do this podcast last minute for the way my podcast works, which

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,920
is months of preparation.

51
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,560
So, you know, I was sort of, you know, reading the book in the period of the last week and a

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,320
half, which I enjoyed immensely.

53
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
But here's the thing.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:21,040
I felt more surprised and in awe of the characters in this book than the previous books.

55
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,520
And that might sound crazy because you'd think, God, you know, decoding the human genome, what

56
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,720
a Herculean feat.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,440
But in many ways, the characters of this story blew my mind even more because of the time and

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,080
the era in which they had to do their science.

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
There were fewer tools at their disposal.

60
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,080
Is that does that statement surprise you or how does that resonate with you?

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,880
Well, so it's not surprising.

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:56,480
It's because the characters in this book are enunciating things that are, I think, very

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,360
fundamental.

64
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,200
Now, if you take, for instance, a comparison, if you were to do a historical comparison with

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,160
the history of genetics.

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,280
So, you know, you would start potentially in the scientific world, you would start with

67
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Mendel and, you know, Greta Mendel, of course, being the pioneer here.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,880
And then there is an enormous period of silence that follows Mendel, almost 40 years in which

69
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
basically nothing happens.

70
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,000
And then, you know, his work is picked up by other people, ultimately picked up by folks like

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Thomas Morgan and others.

72
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,160
But for a long period of time, nothing happens and nothing's relevant.

73
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:45,480
Here, what you see in this book is very different because you see a sort of continuation of

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
development.

75
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,320
And so once the microscope is invented in the 17th century, you see from the 17th century a kind

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:04,120
of gradual blossoming of the science, ultimately ending up with someone like Rudolf Werkau, who

77
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,520
can make really, really audacious statements that are missing in the history of genetics until

78
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,240
much later.

79
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:21,840
The audacious statement that Werkau makes is every function that we carry out, regardless of its

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,960
origin and regardless of what that function is, is a consequence of cellular physiology.

81
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,200
We are cells and everything that we do is cellular, is a consequence of something happening in some

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,760
cell. This conversation is a consequence of something happening in some cell.

83
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
So that's one piece, that statement one.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,960
And then you get the other converse statement, which is equally audacious in which he says that

85
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:53,360
every illness is the consequence of some cell behaving incorrectly.

86
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,800
And these statements are made in the late 19th century, mid to late 19th century, they in fact,

87
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,640
almost contemporaneous with Mendel.

88
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:12,960
So you have enormous sets of leaps in cell biology, which is why this book might feel sort of, you

89
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,960
know, that these characters are doing things while sort of, you know, genetics is still clogging its

90
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:27,480
way, trying to understand sort of Mendel's first very important paper. And there's a remarkable 40

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,680
years of silence, whereas in cell biology, there isn't that 40 years of silence.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:40,480
And I think also just maybe we take it for granted sometimes today, but the ingenuity that was

93
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,760
necessary to even build the tool to permit the visualization.

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,480
I mean, we just lost over the fact that in the 17th century, we're putting together microscopes.

95
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,920
But you actually describe in some detail what the process is like to grind the glass, to create the

96
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:01,000
lens, to even have the window into this otherwise microscopic and invisible to our eye piece of

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,720
physiology.

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Well, it's an it's, it's an incredible I tried to make one myself. I tried to make the one of

99
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,600
Lewinhoek's microscopes. And I can tell you, Peter, it was not an easy task. It was a it was a

100
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:23,800
disaster. And he made 500 of them. These are single lens microscopes. And they're about, you know,

101
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:32,200
this big, it's about the size of I would say, half a sheet of paper. And the lens is literally

102
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,800
this smaller than the size of your eyeball. And so you have this sense in which you have an

103
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,840
enormous amount of labor of love put into making this thing that's mounted with tiny screws and

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,880
tiny little apertures. So that when you look through your eye, through the lens to in a droplet

105
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,000
of water, you can actually see these, you know, microscopic forms. So so there's a there's an

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,440
enormous sense of wonder about how people even began to, to see these and how, how they found them and

107
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,240
what what the consequences of that, of that finding were and are.

108
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,640
People who listen to my podcast are probably used to an idea that I talk about. And you have come

109
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
across this now because you were kind enough to be one of the people who read my book. But I talk

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
about this transition from medicine 1.0 to medicine 2.0. And then, of course, where I hope

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,280
we're going is the transition from 2.0 to 3.0. And I typically talk about medicine 1.0 to 2.0 is

112
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,480
two big events happened. And they weren't, you know, momentary events, they were transitions

113
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
of process. One was, of course, the way we changed about the way we changed the way we thought,

114
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,680
right. So it was the scientific revolution. So once we introduced the scientific method,

115
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,560
late 15th century, we had a new way of thinking about observation and hypothesis. And all of a

116
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,240
sudden, the idea of bad humors and all that stuff sort of went away. But really, the big moment

117
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,720
became germ theory. Once we understood microbial agents and that we had a way to treat them,

118
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,640
we really leapfrogged into the era of modern medicine. And if you look at the mortality rates

119
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,520
as a result of that, it's outstanding. I mean, there has been no bigger reduction in human

120
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,680
mortality than the reduction of death that comes from infectious diseases. What I had never really

121
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,440
thought of until I read your book was that couldn't have happened without this deep

122
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,920
understanding of the cell. I mean, it's obvious when I say it that way. But in effect, this book

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,600
describes how medicine went from effectively witchcraft into where we are today. And of course,

124
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
you're going to we're going to talk about this in more detail, by the way. But I mean,

125
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,120
does that make sense to you? Oh, absolutely. It makes sense to me in the sense that it makes sense

126
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:07,520
because the introduction of being able to ultimately see germs and connect germ theory

127
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,800
with human disease, as you say, took medicine from witchcraft to the modern era.

128
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:25,440
Think of any procedure, childbirth, any surgical procedure, anything that we do, and think of the

129
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,880
effect of antibiotics on that procedure and think of how important it is that these antibiotics are

130
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:40,480
now available and the lives saved. I mean, just childbirth alone, the capacity of saving lives

131
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,320
through antibiotics has been enormous and has just really been transformative in terms of, you know,

132
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,560
again, as you say, moving medicine from from witchcraft. And that's because what's astonishing

133
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,840
in the piece that I write about microbial biology and the discovery of microbes, Peter,

134
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:10,160
is that microbes were imagined in the abstract long before they were seen. So what's interesting

135
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,000
is, you know, people like Lister, the great surgeon who began to sterilize his instruments,

136
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,880
folks like, you know, I have a small biography of him in the book, folks like Semmelweis,

137
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,600
almost ignored by medical history now, but Semmelweis discovered that, you know, that people,

138
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,680
that doctors were transmitting microbes. Tell the story. You know, I have it in my book,

139
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,080
you have it in your book. I am really glad that more and more people are writing about him because

140
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,160
it always breaks my heart when someone dies without their due. And Semmelweis is the example

141
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,320
of that. And it's a heartbreaking story, but it's a remarkable example of this transformation.

142
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,280
So Semmelweis was a junior obstetrician in Vienna. It's important that he was so junior,

143
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:12,400
and he made a very important and incredibly important discovery. So Semmelweis was delivering

144
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,320
children, and there were two maternity wards, World One and World Two. And this is why it's

145
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,240
important in medicine, I think, to listen to your patients. You know, the famous adage in medicine

146
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,720
is the most important question that you ever ask in medicine when you're trying to diagnose a

147
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,240
patient is to ask the patient, what do you think the problem is? And it's the one we forget the

148
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,360
most, right? Doctors never ask that question. But usually the patient will tell you the problem is,

149
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,040
they'll say, you know, I think I have an infection in my lungs, or, you know, I think I'm, you know,

150
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:57,680
depressed because of X or Y reason, because I lost my father. So Semmelweis learned to ask people

151
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:08,560
of a bizarre aberration that was going on, which is that in World One, the maternal mortality rates

152
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:18,560
from childbirth were astronomically high. Whereas in World Two, same similarly, same people, same

153
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,560
women coming in, were much, much lower. And he asked the very simple, and he knew this because

154
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,120
he, you know, at least the story goes, whether it's apocryphal or not, the story goes that,

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,360
that in World One, people, you know, mothers would beg to be admitted into into the safer world,

156
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,000
while they would beg not to be admitted to the where, you know, they would have a 30% mortality

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,360
rate, or 20% mortality rate, one out of five women, which is an incredible number to think about.

158
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,600
So Semmelweis began to ask the question why, and he looked at all sorts of variables. He was sort

159
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,040
of a classical epidemiologist. So he looked at all sorts of variables. And the variable that he

160
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,960
found was that in, in the first world, where there was a high mortality rate in childbirth,

161
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:20,160
the, it was run by doctors. And these doctors, he figured out, were running between autopsy rooms.

162
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,360
So doing autopsies on probably the very patients that they had killed, and then running, and then

163
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,680
without cleaning their hands, delivering babies, essentially examining patients, delivering babies,

164
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,640
etc. were two, on the other hand, was run by nurses, nurses were not doing autopsies, not touching

165
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,720
any decaying or dead material. And there was no mortality. So Semmelweis made the hypothesis,

166
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,240
again, remember, this is a junior obstetrician in Vienna, made this hypothesis that what doctors

167
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,920
were doing is they were transferring some, and this is, these are his words, some material

168
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:08,160
substance from the decaying, decomposing dead bodies that they had autopsied into the bodies

169
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,480
of the women that they were examining internally. And thereby transmitting that material substance

170
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,360
and that material substance was, was the source of the putrefaction or the infection that these

171
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,520
women were getting. And he insisted that the doctors wash their hands with a diluted sort of

172
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,280
a diluted version of bleach. And he saw that suddenly now the mortality rate plummeted.

173
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,560
And so he made this argument. Now, remember, he didn't have a microscope. He didn't have,

174
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:46,320
it is all in the abstract. But he made this argument that this material substance was

175
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,880
responsible for this, what was then called child-bred fever or maternal infections.

176
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,800
And the transfer of the material substance could be removed by washing hands, by hand washing.

177
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,480
And so he, in the abstract sense, he had basically founded junk theory.

178
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Yeah. I mean, completely prescient.

179
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah. And incredibly prescient. And the idea of a material substance, that's what's important about

180
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,080
it. Right. It wasn't just bad air in a vague sense.

181
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:23,440
It was not bad air. It was not, you know, bad humors. It was not, it was a material substance.

182
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,080
And of course, if you had, if he had the capacity to look down the microscope, he would have found

183
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,640
out that that material substance was in fact nothing else but germs.

184
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,440
And the sad thing, you know, the sort of the epilogue to the story is the guy dies in an insane

185
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,600
asylum, basically having been ridiculed. He's ridiculed. The doctors don't want to,

186
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
the last thing that the doctors want to do is to admit that they've been, you know,

187
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,640
infecting other women. So he's, symbol wise, he's ridiculed and he's sent off to an insane asylum.

188
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,000
And ultimately he dies in impoverished and never vindicated.

189
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Yeah. It's again, medicine is full of these stories. But, but, but yes, this is,

190
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,720
this is what it was about the book that really captivated me was this thing that I've taken for

191
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,640
granted. So, so much, you know, of my existence in medicine is what really allowed this, this leapfrog

192
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
and frankly, far more so than the genetic revolution. I mean, we could sit and talk about

193
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,080
has the genetic revolution delivered on its promise? I mean, in some ways, yes. In some ways,

194
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,720
no, we thought, of course, in whatever it was 22 years ago, when the human genome was coded,

195
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,320
that was basically going to be an equal leapfrog forward. It turned out not to be. We'll come back

196
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,320
to talk about some genetic stuff, but I want to go back to a question that you pose in the book

197
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,600
that I had never contemplated and I have not been able to stop thinking about it and I love it,

198
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:08,320
which is what's the evolutionary drive for multicellular life? So like, let's talk through,

199
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,160
you know, kind of, yeah, we go from these single cell organisms that have all of their own evolution

200
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,920
built into them and then look at the complexity that we are today. You go through this very elegantly.

201
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,680
Well, I mean, it's the less cause for a second to contemplate single cell organisms. So they are

202
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:36,240
bacteria, you know, protozoa, yeast, etc. They're extraordinarily successful. You can't imagine how

203
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,720
successful they are. They live in virtually every environment that you can think of, you know, they

204
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,200
live in boiling water, they live in thermal vents, they live in inside volcanoes, they live, I mean,

205
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,400
how successful is a single cell organism? So the bizarre question that you should ask is not

206
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:04,000
why, you should ask why we exist at all. Why is, what is the reason that, you know, we have about,

207
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,080
you know, several trillion cells or trillions of cells. How did we, why do we exist? Why not, why

208
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,320
aren't we all bacteria? And people have been trying to answer the question and the initial idea in the

209
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,520
80s was that there was a massive leap, evolutionary leap from single cell organisms to

210
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,280
multi-cellular organisms. But what's surprising is that if you look at evolutionary history and if

211
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,120
you look at all the evidence from evolutionary history, it turns out that multicellularity

212
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,160
evolved from single cell organisms, not once, but independently multiple times. And it's, you know,

213
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,360
it used to be called a major transition. It's actually turns out to be a minor transition.

214
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,560
In other words, there was a great evolutionary drive towards becoming multicellular. And you can

215
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,240
ask the question then, well, if single cell organisms are so damn successful, why ever be

216
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,840
a multicellular organism? The quick answer is we don't know, but all the evidence suggests

217
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,840
that it has to do with several possibilities. The leading possibility is predation. So it's much

218
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,480
more hard, it's much harder for a predator to eat a multicellular organism for several reasons. One

219
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,280
of them is that it's bigger. Number two is that it has defense systems. Number three is that it can

220
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:34,560
move away from predators through specialized apparatus, apparatus. So that's one idea. The

221
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:41,120
other idea is food and resources, multicellular organisms can have, you know, can access food and

222
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,400
resources. And there are other ideas about how multicellular organisms came to exist and

223
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,720
essentially conquered the world, as we know. But that said, single cell organisms are still the

224
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:02,000
champions. We are just a minor fixture in the world. If you took by weight all the single cell

225
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,240
organisms in the world and their diversity, you would be shocked at how successful you still are.

226
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:17,600
Remind us what Ratcliffe's experiments with yeast demonstrated. I had never heard of that experiment

227
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,360
before, so I'm reading this like I'm reading a thriller novel. Well, William Ratcliffe is a

228
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,080
professor who studies this transition, this evolutionary transition from single cell to

229
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,120
multicellular organisms. And he did this actually an extraordinary simple experiment. And he sort of

230
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,600
just thought about thought about it over Christmas with Travis Zahn on his advisor. He said, well,

231
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:50,240
why don't we just take some yeast and culture them? And we basically allow them to grow.

232
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,720
And so remember yeast are single cell organisms. And we just collect the sediment. So anything

233
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,360
that's multicellular is obviously going to sink to the bottom of a flask. We collect the sediment,

234
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,720
and then we allow that sediment to grow again in another cycle of evolution. So this is sort of

235
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,400
Darwin in a bottle. So we allow that to evolve another cycle, collect the sediment, allow that

236
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,440
to evolve another cycle. And by about 30 or 40 such cycles, he found that the yeast had evolved.

237
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,120
And this is astonishing. I have pictures of this in the book into these sort of snowflake-like

238
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:33,360
multi-fingered, multicellular forms, really a new organism, a multicellular yeast. And what's

239
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,880
interesting about them is that when he let them be by themselves, so no more recollection, no more

240
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,440
sedimentation, they continue to propagate as multicellular yeast. So in other words, he had

241
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,640
basically created a new life form, which is multicellular. And what is even more interesting

242
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,080
is that when he looked at these multicellular yeast, they started to acquire specialized

243
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,960
functions. So you would imagine that one way that these multicellular yeast could reproduce is that

244
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,000
one cell could butt off and create a new multi-fingered multicellular yeast. That would be one way

245
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,680
that these organisms could reproduce. But that's not how they reproduce. The way they reproduce

246
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,680
is that a specialized series of cells that sit in the middle of this snowflake

247
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,760
commit a purposeful cellular death. And I repeat the word, they commit a purposeful cellular suicide

248
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,000
such that this snowflake can break into two parts, two snowflakes, and grow out new fingers.

249
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,240
So this organism has now, evolutionarily speaking, learned, the word learned implies that it has some

250
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,520
consciousness, but that's not true. This is just an evolutionary process. It has created a specialized

251
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:01,600
furrow in its middle, where these cells basically can divide into two forms. And what's more is that

252
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,280
he's now, that has done many versions of this experiment. He's done it with different organisms.

253
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,560
He's done it with algae. He's done it with various other organisms. And what he finds is that there's

254
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,880
even more specialization. So these new creatures, that's the only thing I can call them,

255
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,800
form little channels to deliver nutrients. They form pores. They form secondary structures.

256
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:34,000
So he's really sort of created a new kind of life. And just by doing nothing, I mean, just by allowing

257
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
it to evolve naturally. And remember, this is 30, 40 cycles, which may be, you know, 60, 80, 90

258
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,400
days. So you can imagine over the course of, you know, several billion years of history, the

259
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,960
extraordinary amount of diversity and specialization that could happen in evolution that leads to

260
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,800
people like you and me having trillions of cells, very committed to doing one thing or another thing

261
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,720
or many other things. You know, because my kids who were, my boys are five and eight at this point,

262
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,480
they're, as you can probably imagine, obsessed with dinosaurs. So we're nonstop watching every

263
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,440
imaginable thing. I, you know, I paleontologists are the most important people in the world at this

264
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,360
point. I can't help but wonder when I watch these recreations of what we assume dinosaurs to have

265
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,160
looked like. I mean, at least we know about their size. How did evolution allow something so large

266
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,720
to be, you know, in existence so many millions of years ago? And are we basically seeing a

267
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,040
correction now? In other words, was that just the pendulum swinging too far towards multicellular,

268
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,960
where, you know, boy, here you have things that can really defend themselves, that can really get

269
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,240
away, that can really go after prey. But of course, they're too sensitive to a reduction in food or

270
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,800
something like that. Or is that just totally unrelated? And had it not been for, you know,

271
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,960
volcanic eruptions and things like that, maybe we just wouldn't be here today and dinosaurs would

272
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:12,800
be the sentient, higher, you know, higher order creature. A little bit outside my, my pay grade

273
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,960
in some ways, but, but, you know, there's lots of theories. I'm certainly not a paleontologist. So

274
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,160
there's lots of theories about the extinction of dinosaurs. What we do know is that, that, that,

275
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,320
you know, that these life forms were also very successful in their environments. The problem

276
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:41,520
was, as many people have hypothesized, that, that they, they sort of reached a maximal capacity of

277
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:54,720
size. And smaller mammals, or mammal like creatures, were much became much more adapted or adaptable

278
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,440
to the environment. But there are a thousand theories about dinosaur extinction, including

279
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,480
changes in the atmosphere, changes, you know, meteors and various other volcanoes and events,

280
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,120
which, you know, you can read in, in, in most paleontology. Yeah. I just, I just wonder if

281
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,080
there's something about their size that became their downfall beyond, you know, the obvious

282
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,160
external factors. And it just made me think of that when I was reading that segment about,

283
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:34,240
yeah, there's a beautiful essay, if I remember correctly by Steven Gould, where he talks about

284
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:42,720
a natural biophysical limitation on size. And that's because the volume to surface area of

285
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:52,640
any creature reaches a place in where the volume to surface area becomes no longer sustainable,

286
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:00,720
because the, the, the, the surface area of a creature does, is no longer able to deliver

287
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,560
the oxygen and the nutrients required for aerobic living. Yeah. I'd encourage people to read it. I

288
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,880
don't remember the name of the essay, but it will find it. It has to do with the rhinoceros and,

289
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,080
you know, what the size limits of creatures can or cannot be. Interesting. So let's go back to

290
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,280
something in the book where you talk about the four types of cell therapy. When you spell it out,

291
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,400
it sort of makes sense, but I'd never considered this before. I think it's, I think it's, I think

292
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,440
it's an illustrative framework for people to think about the era of medicine that we live in. So what

293
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:47,200
are these four areas of cellular therapy? You know, I tried to create a typology of the four types of,

294
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,280
of ways in which we could use cells as medicines. The first is the simplest one of all, which is to

295
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,920
use a drug or a substance to change the behavior of a cell. So the simplest example would be an

296
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:08,960
antibiotic. You're using a drug to kill a microbial cell while you're sparing normal human cells.

297
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:18,960
So that's one. The second one is the use of the transfer of cells from one body to another body

298
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,800
without any modification. The simplest example of that would be blood transfusion. So you're

299
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,320
transferring red blood cells, piglets, and other cells from one body to another body for therapeutic

300
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,880
effect, but you're not essentially changing the cell itself. The third is the use of a cell,

301
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,240
either transferred or by itself in a dish, in a bioreactor, in a chamber to synthesize something.

302
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,080
So I remember I said that DNA is inert. It's a lifeless molecule. If you put it inside a cell

303
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,720
in the right context, the right cell in the right context, the cell will start making proteins out

304
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:02,560
of DNA. And those proteins could be very useful. So insulin, for instance, you can only make insulin

305
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:10,320
in cells. That's how insulin is generally made. So antibodies are made by cells. The

306
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,080
antibody, herceptin, that you use in breast cancer is made by cells. So that's a third

307
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,120
use. And the fourth and the final is the one that is coming up and now becoming more and more

308
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,240
prominent as we move into this new era. And that is the use of a cell where you make a genetic

309
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,000
modification in a cell and then either transplant it or use it for a therapeutic reason.

310
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,520
So for instance, CAR T cells, which I'm sure we'll talk about, are examples of a genetically

311
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:52,320
modifying T cells and putting them into a human body. I've been doing, as you very well know,

312
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,200
series of experiments on bone marrow transplants in which we genetically modify the bone marrow

313
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,000
using CRISPR and other techniques and then transferring them into human bodies

314
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:13,200
and essentially creating a genetically engineered cells. Now people, just to finish up a little bit

315
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,120
on that last point, people often talk about gene therapy. And I always remind them that gene

316
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,120
therapy is really cell therapy. If you put the gene in the wrong cell in the wrong place at the

317
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:35,680
wrong time, you get nothing. You get the disaster. So gene therapy is really a mechanism to put a

318
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,320
gene inside a cell and that would be the fourth typology as it were. And then the book goes through

319
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,920
elements of these four typologies, examples and elements of these four typologies as medicines.

320
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,600
Well, let's touch on a few of them. Because you and I don't have the ability to sit here for

321
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,560
the next three days, which is what it would take to do each of these, their appropriate service.

322
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,920
There are a handful that I really want to talk about. So let's talk about the story of Jesse

323
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,600
Gelsinger, because that is one of the earliest examples of gene therapy in a human. We could

324
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,560
talk about what went wrong, but let's use Jesse's story just as much to explain the state of the

325
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,400
technology at the time, the vectors, the vehicles, the methods by which genes were transferred. So

326
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:33,440
let's just start with what disease did Jesse have? Why was gene therapy viewed as the solution as

327
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,000
opposed to whatever the other three methods would have offered Jesse? So Jesse had a genetic disease.

328
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,320
He was a young kid, I think 14, 15 years old, 16, maybe. He was a young kid. And, you know,

329
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,200
I've interviewed his father, I've interviewed, I've had a very, very moving interview with his

330
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:02,960
father. But nonetheless, Jesse was a young kid, he had a defect in an enzyme, which is related

331
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:16,720
to the processing of ammonia and ammonia related substances in the body. And so the idea back then,

332
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,360
and we're now talking, I think, about 22 years ago, yeah, it was about 2000. Yeah, yeah.

333
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,040
At the University of Pennsylvania, the idea was that if they could create a virus,

334
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:39,920
which would then go to Jesse's liver and start making this the correct version of the gene,

335
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:49,440
then Jesse's disease would be ameliorated. So they created a virus that they thought was going

336
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:58,000
to be harmless. It was a variant of an adenovirus. And then they genetically modified that adenovirus

337
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,960
to now include the corrected version of the gene that Jesse had a problem with.

338
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,400
And then they infused that virus into Jesse's body, hoping that the virus would go and infect,

339
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,680
because viruses infect cells and deliver its cargo, the cargo would be the corrected gene,

340
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,480
and thereby correct Jesse's disease. So that was the idea behind that therapy.

341
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,960
Let's explain two things before we go on with the story. We didn't say this earlier,

342
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,080
so I think it's worth clarifying. We don't really consider viruses in the same category

343
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:42,640
as bacteria, yeast, fungi. Why is that? What is it about viruses that, do we consider them

344
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,800
living things? Are they not living things on their own? I mean, they basically just contain

345
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,480
DNA and RNA, but there's sort of parasites in it. They need us to replicate. So that's right.

346
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:00,480
So viruses are not, they don't meet the criteria of living things. They are essentially

347
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,040
a strand of RNA or two strands of RNA or multiple strands of RNA or DNA that have been packaged

348
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,560
usually with an envelope and with some decorated with some proteins on top. But they themselves,

349
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,400
by themselves, they can't reproduce. They can't make copies of themselves, which is one of the

350
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,400
reasons that they're not considered living. The only way they can reproduce is they go and attach

351
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:38,160
themselves to cells, let's say to human cells or any other cells, and then they use the reproduction

352
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,720
apparatus, the duplication apparatus and the reproduction apparatus and the synthetic apparatus

353
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,920
that's present in the cell to make copies of themselves. And once they've made copies of

354
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,680
themselves, they butt out of the cell and then they go and infect more cells and make more copies of

355
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,280
themselves and so forth. So that's what a virus is. And in Jesse Gelsinger's case, the idea was that

356
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:09,600
this virus would essentially infect his cells and create now, but it would insert, because the virus

357
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:16,400
would genetically modify, it would insert its genetic payload, which consisted of the normal

358
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,960
gene, into Jesse's liver cells. The liver cells would now start making the protein that was

359
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:31,920
defective in Jesse's case. This is gene therapy. And then by doing so, it would reverse his

360
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,920
relatively mild, but his disease. So what happened then? They used this adenovirus,

361
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,040
they injected him and it went pretty bad, pretty quick. Yeah, so a rather terrible thing happened.

362
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,120
And again, I have a very, very moving testimony from his father, which is in the gene, not a

363
00:37:53,120 --> 00:38:00,160
little bit in this book, but really in the gene. A terrible thing happened. So in retrospect,

364
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:09,520
we think what happened is that Jesse mounted a very, very vigorous immune response. A virus is a

365
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,200
object, a foreign body, and you mount an immune response to it, especially if you, for whatever

366
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,440
reason, have been exposed to that virus before. And people now suspect, we don't know for sure,

367
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:31,360
that first adenoviruses cause common colds, they cause, in circulation, there's a suspicion

368
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:40,880
that Jesse had been exposed to that virus, the wired form of that virus before, perhaps through

369
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,360
a common cold or something like that. And his immune system went berserk, because it was now

370
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:55,440
recognizing not one virus particle, but millions of particles suddenly into his body, his immune

371
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,080
system went berserk. And when the immune system goes berserk like that, you basically have

372
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,440
terrible consequences because your body is recognizing your cells as foreign, the virus

373
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,080
as foreign, the, you know, it goes on what I call a kind of immune rampage. And that immune

374
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:21,040
rampage can kill you. And unfortunately, Jesse died from the consequences of this very hyperactive

375
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,880
risk immune response raised against that virus and died. And in fact, the whole field of gene

376
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:35,360
therapy was frozen for almost a decade, as we learned to slowly understand the cause of that

377
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,760
death and how we could prevent it in other people. And so I think in response, the field said, look,

378
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,680
we need to look at slightly more immune protected or privileged sites to dip our toes back in the

379
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,720
water. And so tell folks a little bit about what's a safer place to maybe consider gene therapy as

380
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,320
the field moves closer to that. Well, there are many things that have happened. It's not just

381
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,160
safe places. So I'll give you some examples. Again, I'll try to create a typology for you.

382
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,880
So one thing you can do is you can, there are safe harbors in the body. By safe harbors,

383
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,400
I mean places that the immune system doesn't usually reach easily. So it just by chance,

384
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,520
the retina turns out to be one of them. There's not a lot of immune cell infiltration into the

385
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,200
retina. So you have a chance to use gene therapy. And in fact, there are now several gene therapies

386
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:38,640
that have been approved that allow you to insert or inject viruses so that you can get some

387
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,960
corrected gene that's missing or abnormal in the retina. So that's one place. There's some other

388
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,600
places in the body turns out by coincidence, the testes is another place, although we've not used

389
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,840
that for gene therapy. So that's one thing you can do. The other thing you can do is you can

390
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,640
actually, there are new drugs that can dampen down or tack down the immune response. So you can

391
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,640
think of the immune response as a dial. What you can do is you can dial the immune response down

392
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:17,840
so that the immune response doesn't respond so briskly to the gene therapy. You can hide

393
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,480
the virus. So you can make a virus such that your body has not seen such a virus before.

394
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,320
So you can actually use a novel kind of virus that has not been, that won't raise a brisk immune

395
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:38,080
response. The fourth thing you can do is you can actually give the gene therapy in small doses.

396
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:45,760
It's called hyper fractionation. So that fractionation, big, small fractions, so that the immune

397
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,040
system doesn't again go berserk, seeing this massive bolus of a dose of virus. So those are

398
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,920
some of the strategies and they've been very successful. So that now, the number of deaths

399
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,560
from this hyperactive immune response still remain, but they are much, much, much more controlled

400
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,680
than in Jesse Jusz and his times. So you alluded to an example earlier of CAR T cells.

401
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,600
I think it's one of the great successes of cancer when it comes to treating CD19 or B-cell cancers.

402
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,840
Let's use that as an example to explain how gene therapy can work in that regard.

403
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,400
Well, so CAR T cells are a very special example of gene therapy. So in a CAR T cell,

404
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:43,200
what happens is that you extract T cells from a human being who has cancer. You extract their

405
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:51,200
normal T cells and you use gene therapy to recognize them so that they can attack cells,

406
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,200
including cancer cells. So you're essentially turning the T cell. A T cell is part of the

407
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,000
immune system. Its job is to hunt out and kill foreign cells, including cells that have been

408
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,440
infected by viruses or foreign cells that have somehow entered the body. That's their job. That's

409
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:17,520
the job of a T cell. It's a foreign cell detector built into your body. So now you take that T cell

410
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:25,280
and weaponize it to recognize the cancer cells as foreign. And then you re-inject them. You grow

411
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,120
them in a petri dish in the laboratory and you re-inject them into the body. And our laboratory

412
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:40,160
has done a lot of this work. We are now doing this in India. The costs of doing this are

413
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:48,400
astronomical in the United States, almost $500,000 to a million dollars per person. We're trying to

414
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,800
reduce that cost dramatically, 24, perhaps even 50 fold in India using new technologies, et cetera.

415
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,560
We've treated about 11, 12 patients already. And we've just released the data. It looks very, very,

416
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:08,000
very good. And so they're usually used in blood cancers like lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma.

417
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,200
They've not been so successful in solid tumors for reasons that we don't fully understand and

418
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,960
we're still trying to understand. But that's what a CAR T cell is. It's a weaponized T cell that goes

419
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,960
and kills cells in your cancer cells in your body. Sid, what is the difference? Why is there a 20 to

420
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,880
50 fold reduction in cost doing this in India as opposed to the United States? Because this is,

421
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:40,320
of course, one of the jugular issues with oncology is marginal treatments. Not that I'm saying CAR T

422
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:47,200
cell is marginal. It's actually one of the few beacons of success. But cancer is full of marginal

423
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,520
treatments. Extend median survival by two months at a cost of $100,000. How much of that is just

424
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:01,200
a structural American problem versus sort of, you know, people that are able to go outside of the

425
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,280
existing channels of IP? Some of it is a structural American problem and some of it is not. So

426
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:17,120
obviously, the structural American problem is that for reasons that we are trying to still investigate,

427
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:24,880
90% of drugs, including drugs in the cancer space, fail. And pharmaceutical companies make the

428
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:32,800
argument that they are trying to recoup the R&D costs, the research and development costs of those

429
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,160
failed drugs with the ones that are successful. Now, that's a complicated and, I would say,

430
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,800
somewhat specious argument because you could ask, you could say to them, well, why do these drugs

431
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,320
fail in the first place? Is it because drugs always fail? Is it because you didn't understand

432
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,960
something about the human body that you therefore took this drug all the way to spend millions,

433
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:02,080
perhaps even billions of dollars on the drug? So that's one reason. The second reason is,

434
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,680
so that would be the standard argument. The second reason is that CAR T's are intrinsically

435
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,440
expensive to make. Their success rates are incredible. So these are not just one month,

436
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,880
two months survival. My book begins with the story of Emily Whitehead. She was seven when she

437
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,360
was treated with CAR T therapy. She's now 17 or 16, applying to college, completely cured.

438
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,920
So you have a situation in which these are miraculous drugs. We've seen people who've

439
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,080
had terrible leukemia, essentially eradicate the leukemia forever and become cured. The problem is

440
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,440
that they're intrinsically hard to make. To weaponize the T cells, you need to make a virus.

441
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,400
That virus is expensive to make. It's labor intensive. The quality control that's required

442
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,600
is much, much greater than making aspirin or making any other tablet. And then, of course,

443
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,600
growing the T cells, you have to grow them in an incredibly sterile environment,

444
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:11,680
where you have to basically put on a hazmat suit to go in. It's called a GMP facility, but it's a

445
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,080
highly, highly sterile environment. It has to be monitored. It has to be checked for a single

446
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,720
bacteria or a fungal infection in that flask of a T cell will now basically take that entire batch

447
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,120
away. You can't give those back. So there are some intrinsic expenses.

448
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,120
Now you asked the question, how can you reduce the cost? Well, we reduce the cost by several ways.

449
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:47,520
One is that we basically, we've learned to make the virus in a much cheaper way. We've reduced

450
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:59,200
the cost of the patent burden by essentially, I think, by really making successful products

451
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,960
and not spending millions of dollars on unsuccessful products. So we don't have to recoup all that R&D

452
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:12,640
cost. We've changed the machinery. We've changed the way the cells are harvested. And finally,

453
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,240
of course, hospital treatment and therapy in India is much cheaper to start off with.

454
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,320
So that, you know, adding them all together comes to, you know, almost a 10 fold to 20 fold reduction.

455
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,560
So let's now use another example of gene therapy, which is maybe the harder of the problems, which

456
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:41,200
is you have a person more like Jesse, where they have a germline mutation that results in a pathology.

457
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,040
And the goal is as an adult, you know, let's pick sickle cell anemia as an example.

458
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:56,400
In some ways, sickle cell is so amazing that one single amino acid difference can have such

459
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,680
catastrophic consequences on the life of a person. But you want to now just change that. I mean,

460
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,400
it's a single amino acid. It's very, you know, we know exactly what genes drive that.

461
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,520
How does one go about doing that? And where are we in the in the realm of approaching success there?

462
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:23,760
So fantastic new results in sickle cell anemia, published in very major journals, and will

463
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,760
continue to get published. So ancient disease, as you know, single the minor acid mutation,

464
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,160
if you inherit two copies, then you get sickle cell anemia, terrible disease.

465
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,680
Your blood cells in low oxygen environments form sickles, you get, you know, they basically clog up,

466
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,000
it's like plumbing clogging up. And you get essentially what you might consider sort of

467
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,240
micro strokes all over your small, the small blood vessels in your body, terrible pain

468
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,120
associated with this. So the answer would be in gene therapy, you know, what if you could change

469
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,600
the mutated gene. So there are two or three approaches that have been so far tried.

470
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:17,920
One is using new technologies, gene editing technologies, to basically change both copies of

471
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,800
the gene to now make them into normal. So take out your bone marrow, which is where blood is made,

472
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,000
change the gene from the abnormal gene to the normal sickle, normal hemoglobin gene.

473
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:38,720
And then re infuse that back into the into the patient. So that's a gene correction strategy.

474
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:46,000
There's another strategy, which is very attractive and fascinating. And I'll just briefly mention it.

475
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,360
So it turns out that the fetus, the human fetus, has a special kind of hemoglobin, which is different

476
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,840
from adult hemoglobin. And the reason it's different is that the fetus has to extract

477
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,960
oxygen from mom's blood. And mom's blood, when it by the time it reaches the fetus,

478
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,880
has already been depleted of oxygen because it's gone through her body.

479
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:16,960
So this is called fetal hemoglobin. And so basically, the fetus has a special form of

480
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:24,000
hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in blood, that can even extract oxygen out of mom's blood.

481
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,120
And so another approach to sickle cell anemia is to forget about the sickle gene problem.

482
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:41,120
And basically, in an adult, somehow reactivate or express or make fetal hemoglobin.

483
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,440
In that case, you don't need to correct the gene, the gene, you leave the gene as it is,

484
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:55,520
you just make fetal hemoglobin, which is very, very avid as an oxygen delivery machine.

485
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,520
And the cells don't sickle anymore because they don't have this oxygen problem. And that too has

486
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,880
been successful. There have been several trials now showing that if you activate fetal hemoglobin,

487
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:15,280
you can do that. So just to summarize, then you can either do gene therapy to express the corrected

488
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,720
version of the sickling gene, that would be the gene is called beta globin. That has been performed.

489
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:30,480
The second approach is to use gene editing technology to change the gene back to its normal

490
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:39,200
form. And the third approach is to reactivate fetal hemoglobin in adults to essentially correct

491
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,480
the hemoglobin defect. And all three of them are in trials. And all three have shown various

492
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,800
measures of success. My impression is that during our lifetime, we'll see a cure, a permanent cure

493
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,960
for sickle cell anemia. So this kind of dovetails nicely into, I think, a term that most people have

494
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,480
heard of. But I think that the details of this are pretty important. And this is the idea of

495
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,640
CRISPR. Now, I haven't had Jennifer Doudna on the podcast yet. I would love to at some point.

496
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,880
So we don't need to necessarily go into the great depths of CRISPR. But I think some history is

497
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,040
probably relevant, especially as it pertains to the topic of our discussion, which is cells,

498
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,840
bacteria and viruses, or bacteria as the cells and how they interact with viruses and where to

499
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,520
protect themselves. But I now want to kind of use the story of CRISPR to talk about another tool by

500
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:36,240
which one can impart this type of cell therapy. So, you know, the world of genetics was turned

501
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:44,240
upside down in a very important way by the discoveries of Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuel

502
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:52,880
Saucon-Tier, and several others. I should mention Fen Zhang and George Church, among others. And

503
00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:05,360
there's a history of this, which is in the book. For a long time, there was the question of whether

504
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,240
the human genome is a library. Imagine the human genome as a massive library.

505
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:22,400
If it was printed in normal text, it would contain 80,000 books, a massive encyclopedia,

506
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:31,920
stretching across a massive library. And imagine that you wanted to make a change in one word

507
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:42,720
in that library. You want to take book 61 on shelf 47 and make a change from verbal to herbal

508
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:51,520
in that library. This was a dream of scientists for a long time and no one could do it.

509
00:54:52,800 --> 00:55:00,240
And then Jennifer Doudna, Jean-Puentier, and then assisted by Fen Zhang and other people,

510
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:08,880
figured out that there was a bacterial system evolved millions of years ago that could make

511
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:18,400
that precise change in one word in that entire library, either deleting that word, in other words,

512
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,240
erasing it, simplest change, or potentially changing the word to another new word.

513
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:37,280
That's, it's an incredible genetic revolution. So as we move forward into this new universe,

514
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:45,760
we have the capacity to change the human genome in a deliberative and,

515
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:56,480
erm, I would say a, a processed manner. So just take the example of sickle cell anemia that we

516
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:05,440
gave before. We can change that sickle cell anemia gene to a normal gene by using this technology.

517
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:14,560
We can change the mutant or abnormal cystic fibrosis gene to a normal gene, the normal

518
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:25,360
version, erm, or the wild type version using this technology. So it's obviously extraordinarily

519
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:37,840
important, erm, and there are many, many applications of this technology, erm, and it's exciting because

520
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:47,680
we can do things that we couldn't do before involving changing genes to new genes, changing

521
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:57,360
genes to their wild type, er, variants or their more common variants, and so forth. So, erm, we

522
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,400
now have, have the capacity to do this. We can do this with embryonic cells. We can do this with

523
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,240
embryonic stem cells. We can do this with bone marrow cells. We can do this with T cells,

524
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:22,080
CAR T cells. The, the, it's a revolution and all I can emphasize is the depth and breadth of this

525
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:31,760
revolution because it's enormous. So two, two follow-up questions. The first is explain using

526
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,720
the library analogy how this system differs from the approach that was used 20 years ago in the

527
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,880
case of Jesse Gelsinger that we described where an adenovirus was used. I mean, what's the difference

528
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,760
in scale and elegance between what you just described, which is in the 80,000 books, you can

529
00:57:51,760 --> 00:58:00,000
go to one page, one word and make the change versus that other approach. Yes. So, erm, so again,

530
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:09,920
imagine the human genome as a massive library, 80,000 books, er, printed on a page, erm,

531
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:20,720
and so the old technology, Jesse Gelsinger, the technology that was used with Jesse Gelsinger

532
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:30,480
is the technology in which we, er, by analogy, I'm using metaphors and, and, and analogies here,

533
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:41,360
we would insert a new page into that 80,000 page library. Erm, so you would go into the library,

534
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:49,440
80,000 books around you, and you would take a page and insert a new page into that library.

535
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:58,160
A foreign page. The librar, the librarian could come, in this case, the immune response, the T-cell

536
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:06,160
or the B-cell immune response, and come and say, wait a second, that's on, it doesn't belong. That's

537
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:12,720
on a page that belongs. And that's what happened with Jesse Gelsinger and other people. The librarian

538
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,720
would come and say, librarian being the human body, would come and say, wait a second, you're

539
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:26,400
inserting new pages into a library. That's no good. Erm, and would prevent that.

540
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,880
And it seems to me that you didn't even, it was much harder to know where to put that page. I

541
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,400
mean, if you knew a priority, I really want that p2b between page 87 and 88, you might accidentally

542
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,840
insert it somewhere else, right? Exactly. And the librarian would say, well, why are you putting it

543
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:56,000
into, you know, Jennifer Egan's book on the Boone Squad? Because it doesn't belong there. You just

544
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,480
inserted that page, new page, the new gene into a place where it doesn't belong. And he or she would

545
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:14,480
say, I don't buy this. I'm not going to let you do that. That's absurd. You're reading along with,

546
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:21,920
you know, Chekhov or Egan or whoever. And all of a sudden you find a new page that's been taped in

547
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:29,600
the virus that's carried in the new gene, the new virus. And you say, well, wait a second,

548
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:35,760
that doesn't belong there. And that was where the technology sat for years and years and years.

549
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:45,120
Then Jennifer Doudna, Charpentier and others discovered a method in which you would do just

550
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:52,880
quite the opposite. You would go into a page and say, listen, I have the right page in the right

551
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,720
volume of the right book. And I'm going to change one word. The first kind of words that they could

552
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:12,720
change was just deleting a word. And this was using a viral system called CRISPR. And you could

553
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:20,720
just erase a word. And then more and more research showed that you could change the word.

554
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,160
And as I said, you could change the word verbal to herbal by changing a single letter. And for the

555
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:35,360
most part, leave the library intact. And if you were a very vigilant librarian, you would say,

556
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,280
that's okay. You haven't put in an extra page in, you know, Charles Dickens book.

557
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,800
You've actually gone to the right book and changed the right word in the right space,

558
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:58,160
in the right time from one to another. And that's the subtlety of what CRISPR allows us to do.

559
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:06,480
It allows us to make extraordinarily precise changes in extraordinarily precise ways

560
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,920
in a massive library, which would not be possible otherwise.

561
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,560
So you alluded to this at the outset of your description, which was

562
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:24,480
you could make changes to an embryo, right? You could take an embryo and you could make a

563
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:32,560
genetic change, which now has pretty significant consequences because it is now a germline change.

564
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,480
This is different than, you know, if you made a change in a non germline cell way down the line.

565
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:46,480
And I guess as things would have it, the first documented example of this created quite a

566
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:58,640
controversy. So maybe briefly tell the story of JK and the CCR5 gene and why that, and I guess

567
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:06,640
more importantly is what are the implications of that pretty unethical episode?

568
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,640
So again, I would encourage people to read the book, The Song of the Cell,

569
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:21,120
to get all the details about it. But a Chinese scientist, JK Wu,

570
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:33,600
made a somewhat bizarre decision. And I'll talk about why that is it or was bizarre.

571
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:47,040
There is a gene in the human genome that makes cells resistant to HIV infection.

572
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:59,920
There are many genes, but this is one of them. The Chinese scientists in this case

573
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:10,000
decided, Hei-Jung Khen, decided that he was going to make a change in human embryos

574
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:18,880
with gene editing technology, the technology that I just described, which would make the child of a

575
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:28,480
parent couple in which the man was HIV positive, the woman was HIV negative,

576
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:38,560
and make that change in the embryo and implant those altered embryos into the mom

577
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,360
so that they would be HIV resistant because of this change.

578
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:56,320
So it sounds great on paper. The problem is that the risk of these children to acquire HIV

579
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:06,960
because they were produced by IVF is basically zero. It cannot get HIV. The sperm doesn't carry

580
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:18,880
HIV. So if you produce a child by this method, you basically have a zero risk of HIV infection.

581
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:36,800
It wasn't medically necessary. Let me take a step back. Peter, the book makes a very big distinction

582
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:46,720
between disease and desire. Disease is fundamentally linked to suffering.

583
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,920
When we talk about disease, we talk about human suffering.

584
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:05,040
When we talk about desire, we talk about the idea or the aspiration to ameliorate suffering,

585
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:11,840
even where there's no suffering involved, as far as we can tell. Now, in this case,

586
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:18,320
there was no disease. The children had no risk of disease. They couldn't have any risk of disease.

587
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:29,840
The desire was an entirely scientific desire to create a generically modified embryo.

588
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:39,920
In this case, in particular, the desire was that they would create a modified embryo and that

589
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:47,200
his inquiry would be the first in human history to create a human embryo with genetically altered

590
01:06:47,440 --> 01:07:00,960
stem cells. So he went ahead with this project and he created two girls. We don't know their

591
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:13,360
real names. Their names have been called Lulu and Nana. What he obtained was not exactly what

592
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:22,400
he hoped to obtain, which is not that precise erasure of verbal to herbal in a single book

593
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:33,200
in the entire library of 80,000 books. What he obtained was a much cruder version of that.

594
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:45,120
Scientists across the world were concerned about did he have informed consent? Was there appropriate

595
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:52,880
use of the parents even understand the language that we're using? Now, remember,

596
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:00,880
because this was an IVF procedure, the risk of these children getting HIV was zero.

597
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,880
So again, we come to the question of disease versus desire. They had no disease. The only

598
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:14,240
desire was to create someone who was potentially resistant to HIV infection. So we have this

599
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:22,240
situation, which is very unusual, where desire, the desire to change human embryos, the desire

600
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:29,760
to push the frontier of science overwhelms the disease where there is no disease.

601
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:38,720
And so the scientific world became extraordinarily incensed about the idea that, you know,

602
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:49,040
this scientist had really crossed the boundary between disease and desire. Now,

603
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:57,040
if this had been some disease that the children had inherited, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease,

604
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,840
Huntington's disease, some terrible thing that they would encounter in their lifetime,

605
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,440
the scientific community would have been much more sanguine about it.

606
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:13,600
But these children, these two twins that were born, had a zero risk, zero risk,

607
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:22,000
of acquiring HIV from their fathers because the sperm had been washed, sperm don't get infected

608
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:34,320
with HIV. So they were basically, they had no risk of the disease. So what was left was desire,

609
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:42,080
the desire to be first, the desire to be create new human embryos. And that's what was very

610
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,680
incensed, you know, that's what incensed the scientists and the community of scientists.

611
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:55,920
You know, there's probably no greater example of the relationship between science and philosophy.

612
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,760
You know, people might want a little bit of a reminder about what a doctorate degree is

613
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,000
formally called, right, a doctor of philosophy. And so when you think about this question,

614
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:16,160
it becomes kind of difficult, right? And I think in Walter Isaacson's biography,

615
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,720
of Jennifer Doudna, I think this topic is explored in your book, this topic is explored.

616
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,960
Where does one draw the line, right? So, you know, Huntington's disease is a great example

617
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:36,720
in the sense that you have a genetic, you have an acquired genetic mutation that is 100%

618
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:42,080
penetrable in a devastating disease that shortens life and leads to immense suffering.

619
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:52,320
Would we find many philosophers of science who would say that it is wrong to alter the embryos

620
01:10:52,320 --> 01:11:00,400
of adults who have Huntington's disease or carry that trait, that gene, to prevent it from going

621
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,560
to their offspring, which by the way, if you play the thought experiment out, would eliminate

622
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,840
Huntington's disease altogether? Because these are germline mutations. Like, how does the

623
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,240
scientific and philosophical community merge over questions of that nature? And then of course,

624
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:22,240
just to tell you, eventually, do we move that further to APOE4, LPA, other genes that are not

625
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:31,360
as penetrant? Right. So APOE4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease or early Alzheimer's disease,

626
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,840
just to give you an example of how devastating it can be for particular people who have

627
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:46,800
combinations of APOE4 and other genetic mutations that increase their risk early Alzheimer's disease.

628
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:55,440
But I think the scientific community would say, for Huntington's disease, the scientific community

629
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:06,960
would say, listen, this is a devastating disease with a huge penetrance. By penetrance, we mean,

630
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:11,840
if you inherit the gene, the chances that you have the disease is very high.

631
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:19,680
Sometimes that's not the case, right? So you might inherit a mutation in some gene,

632
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:26,000
whatever it might be, but you might not get the disease. Braco1 is a good example, right? You might

633
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:33,280
inherit Braco1 gene, but you never may have, you may escape having breast cancer in your lifetime.

634
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:40,880
Huntington's disease has a very high penetrance. So in other words, if you inherit the mutation,

635
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,880
the likelihood that you have the disease is very high. I think the biomedical community would say

636
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:55,760
that for diseases like Huntington's disease, it's probably worthwhile doing an intervention,

637
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:03,040
an intervention of whatever that intervention might be. But the biomedical community would say

638
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:18,320
that for, in this case, in HIV, it's not warranted. And I think that the biomedical community would

639
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:30,080
say it's not necessary. It's not part of the continuum of disease versus desire. It moves

640
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:36,560
towards desire without moving towards disease. I think the other examples of things on the clearly

641
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:41,920
desire spectrum are pretty obvious, right? Like enhancing intelligence or physical traits like

642
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:49,360
strength, size, et cetera. Of all of these areas, the one I find most interesting is around mental

643
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:57,040
health, right? Which is we understand, for example, autism and schizophrenia have an enormous genetic

644
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:04,160
component. On the surface, it might seem like, hey, wouldn't it be great if fewer people were

645
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:10,560
born with autism and or schizophrenia, but it's really nowhere near that simple, is it? And there's

646
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:19,200
a Pandora's box upon which we have no idea what we could lose as a society if we were to sort of

647
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:26,640
sterilize, quote unquote, some of these conditions. You've obviously touched on this, and I want to

648
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:32,480
come back to sort of mental health, because in some ways, where we're going to go next in this

649
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:40,480
discussion, I think, is to the last cellular territory, right? The cells of the brain. To me,

650
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:48,320
that's kind of like the most complicated cells of the body, in a sense. And of course, this is one

651
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:54,560
area where it's very difficult to appreciate a phenotype under a microscope or in a scanner.

652
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,720
And so I think part of it has to do with the complexity of these genes. But how do you think

653
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:08,880
about what might be inevitably questions that society faces around the use of this type of

654
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,400
precision gene editing when it comes to genetic conditions of the brain?

655
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,400
Well, the brain is the most complex of all organs, and it's important to understand that complexity.

656
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:35,040
What we know about diseases like autism and schizophrenia is that there are, broadly speaking,

657
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:47,280
two kinds of genes in the entire spectrum of genetics that have to do with mental diseases.

658
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:56,720
One kind of gene is what I call a shove gene. Shove meaning it pushes you really hard.

659
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:06,480
So think about height. Forget about autism for a second. Think about height. Height is a genetic,

660
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:14,480
has a strong genetic component. Tall parents tend to produce tall children. Short parents tend to

661
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:19,520
short parents tend to produce shorter children. So we know there's a genetic component to it.

662
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:32,080
Now, there are genes in the spectrum of controlling height that are very powerful

663
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:42,240
shove genes. They shove you in one direction or the other. So one example is Marfan syndrome.

664
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:49,760
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder, a single gene. One gene, if you inherit copies of that gene,

665
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:58,080
you will likely be extremely tall and you might have other medical and other complications,

666
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:05,520
but you will be tall for sure. There's a story that Abraham Lincoln may have inherited

667
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:16,960
Marfan's, the Marfan gene. Okay. So that's a shove gene. Those are relatively rare in the human

668
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:30,000
population of very tall people. The more common variant is what I call a nudge genes. Nudge versus

669
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:39,280
shove. Nudge genes move you little by little by little by little by little towards increasing

670
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:48,000
height. And there may be hundreds, there may be tens of hundreds of genes that may increase your

671
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
height little by little by little by little by little until you get five feet, 10 inches, five feet,

672
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:05,280
nine inches, five feet, 11 inches, six feet, etc, etc. It's not one gene, but hundreds,

673
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:17,520
if not tens of hundreds. Now, transfer that same idea to mental health. Okay. There are certainly

674
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:25,760
genes in the human genome that change your neuron physiology, the physiology of your nerves

675
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,720
that are shove genes. In other words, if you inherit them, just like Marfan syndrome, you are

676
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:40,960
likely to get much more likely to have mental illness in whatever form it is.

677
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:51,600
They're relatively rare. And they are inherited in families. There's a great book on this

678
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:59,440
written recently about a family that has multiple kids with schizophrenia, etc.

679
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:10,960
I think it's called Fallen River Road, if I remember correctly. Okay. But most mental illness,

680
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:19,040
just by analogy with height, is not the consequence of this shove phenomenon,

681
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:29,120
but our consequences of what I would call death by 1000 cuts, small nudges that would push you

682
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:37,600
towards depression, schizophrenia, autism, etc. And in fact, we haven't even found those

683
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,400
genes yet, even though we know they exist. In some cases, we haven't found those genes yet.

684
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:56,000
So the capacity to change those genes is very limited because, you know, the examples that I

685
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:04,400
gave you of gene editing, gene alteration technology are limited to one gene, two genes,

686
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:13,680
three genes. But it's very, very hard to find a way to change those genes, hundreds, potentially

687
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:21,200
tens of hundreds of genes in the mental health spectrum. So it's not as if we can all of a

688
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:26,320
sudden wake up one morning and say, I'm going to change your mental health, or change the mental

689
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:32,880
health of your embryo, based on the understanding of our subgenes, because it just won't happen.

690
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,640
So let's now dig into this complexity issue around the brain. You know, it's,

691
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,280
I've tried to explain this to people, and I've never been able to do a great job of it. You do

692
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:54,880
a great job of it in the book, describing the mystery, right? And you came up with a way to

693
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,960
describe it that I thought was fantastic, which was, and I want to make sure I'm getting this

694
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,520
right. So correct me if I'm wrong. You said there were two types of problems in science.

695
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:13,280
There are the eye in the sandstorm problems versus the sand in the eye problems. And as

696
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:19,040
the cellular biologists and neurobiologists were getting deeper and deeper into the brain,

697
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:26,400
and it really seemed like they had figured out this thing, these axons, the movement of electricity,

698
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,600
these action potentials, they were figuring this out, but they had a little piece of sand in their

699
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:39,280
eye. What was that piece of sand? And again, feel free to expand on this if I haven't provided an

700
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:48,640
eloquent enough setup, but it was a beautiful description. It's a fanciful description,

701
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:54,400
and it's an important distinction. And it's a philosophical distinction.

702
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:05,520
The eye in the sandstorm problem is a problem in which you encounter something in medical sciences

703
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:16,080
where the information just doesn't fit. It's being in the sandstorm. And I give the example

704
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:22,960
when we made the transition in physics between Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics and

705
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:30,000
Einsteinian understanding. So in other words, you reach a place and all of a sudden,

706
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,320
everything didn't fit. The bending of light, the presence of

707
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:46,480
relativity, etc. Nothing can fit. So you needed a completely new theory, a new paradigm, a Tobi

708
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:53,840
shift in paradigm, paradigmatic thinking. That's the eye in the sandstorm problem. So in other words,

709
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,280
there's sandstorms everywhere, and you can't make sense of the real world.

710
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:10,320
That's one kind of problem. And I'm interested in those problems. The sand in the eye problem,

711
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:16,960
as I call it, is a different kind of problem. The sandstorm in the eye problem is when everything

712
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:25,120
fits except one fact. And it's very important to understand that both of those are really,

713
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:32,080
really interesting, because the sand in the eye problem says that our theory is almost right,

714
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:40,240
but it's not right because there's something, a fact that won't fit. And the particular example

715
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:47,840
I use is neuronal transmission. So when people discovered neurons in the brain,

716
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:57,120
they figured out basically by looking at an anatomy, that neurons in the brain weren't,

717
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:06,640
that there was a space between them, that nerves weren't just wires. If you were an electrician,

718
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:17,680
fitting out an electrical situation in an apartment, right? What you wouldn't do is put

719
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:25,760
spaces between the wires so that all of a sudden that space would become a communication between

720
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:33,600
wires. You just hook the whole apartment up. But when people like Ramani Kahal and other

721
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:43,600
scientists figured out how to solve this problem, they understood that all of a sudden that nerves

722
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:51,360
have spaces in between them. In fact, they had a name for these spaces. It's called a synapse.

723
01:24:52,880 --> 01:25:00,720
And that is an eye in the sand problem because you say to yourself, wait a second, if the nervous

724
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:09,520
system is just electrical wires strung together, why would you place a space between two electrical

725
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:17,360
wires? And the solution to that problem turns out to be extraordinarily important for neuroscience

726
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:26,640
because what happens between nerves is that an electrical conduction moves between, from one end

727
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:35,520
of a nerve to the other. And then, and here's the kicker, it changes from an electrical conduction

728
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,960
to a chemical signal between one nerve to another. And that chemical signal

729
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:51,840
re-sparks, or sparks, an electrical conduction. So you're both going chemical, electrical, chemical,

730
01:25:52,560 --> 01:26:01,200
electrical. And you could say what mad person would ever devise, or what evolutionary process

731
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:08,640
would ever devise a system like this? And the answer is, the reason is very important.

732
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:16,720
Because what your nervous system is doing is in that transmission between electrical, chemical,

733
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:23,440
electrical, chemical, electrical, chemical, what your nervous system is doing is it's putting

734
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:34,240
weights so that in the chemical transmission and in an electrical impulse could come down a nerve.

735
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:43,920
But let's say there are 10 nerves or 10 neurons, nerve cells, that are impinging on one nerve cell.

736
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:53,280
You could assign a weight as to how much this one was transmitting versus another one.

737
01:26:54,480 --> 01:27:01,680
And by assigning those weights, by assigning those calibrations, you could say one is louder

738
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:12,160
than the other, one is softer than the other, one inhibits the other. And it's those combinations of

739
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:23,360
inhibition, loudness, etc., etc., that allow profound things like sentience, and conversation,

740
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:31,280
and consciousness, and so forth. The analogy that's very important is this is exactly or similarly

741
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:38,720
to how, and I say it's an analogy, this is exactly or similarly to how neural networks work.

742
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:47,600
There are, there are weights put on how one layer of communication

743
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:54,000
communicates with the second layer of communication. In other words, some are louder than others,

744
01:27:54,640 --> 01:28:04,480
some are softer than others. Imagine discriminating a dog from a cat. You could say that a very loud

745
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:12,080
signal in that discrimination if the animal happens to bark. You know that for sure that's

746
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:19,760
not a cat. That's a very loud signal. A very soft signal could be the weight of the animal.

747
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:29,440
Some dogs are lighter than cats. A very loud signal could be the way that, you know, the snout

748
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:38,640
of an animal is fixed with the head of the animal. Dogs have a particular snout, head combination,

749
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:47,280
cats have a particular snout head combination. So by adjusting the weights of these combinations,

750
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:53,200
we think by analogy that this is how the brain can discriminate between dogs and cats.

751
01:28:54,160 --> 01:29:00,000
We don't know this for sure because this is an area of science that's still in process.

752
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:09,760
But this is a classic example in the 1950s of the idea that why on earth would you take an

753
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:15,280
electrical signal, convert it to a chemical signal and then convert it back to a micro signal?

754
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:21,040
The answer is because it was just an electrical signal, you know, we'd be a box of wires.

755
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:28,960
And a box of wires without the weight between individual signals between the wires is a useless

756
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:38,480
box because we don't understand or we cannot understand how to construct a learning network

757
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:47,280
between these a box of wires. Whereas we can understand how we can construct a learning

758
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:54,320
network between electrical and chemical stimulation because we can modulate the strength

759
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,400
of that chemical stimulation such that we can really actually learn a process.

760
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,680
Does that make sense?

761
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:07,920
It really does. I mean, another way that I like to explain it is using music, right, which is

762
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:14,800
the electrical signals that travel down the axon are digital. And maybe because I'm an engineer,

763
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:22,560
I do tend to think in terms of digital versus analog processes. But if you explain that,

764
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,720
look, digital means it's either completely on or completely off. There is no modulation.

765
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:34,960
And imagine an orchestra that every instrument could only play at one maximum decibel level or

766
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:41,440
not at all. You couldn't have any modulation of sound. It would be a very awful sounding music.

767
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:48,480
But if now each of those instruments can go up and down and crescendo and decrescendo and modulate,

768
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:54,800
you now basically have kind of the analog adjustment of music. That's how we make songs.

769
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:00,480
And I think that's probably a cruder analogy. But I think it kind of also gets at this point,

770
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:08,320
which is I mean, again, it comes back to how did evolution figure this out? How much trial and

771
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:15,200
error went into producing something so remarkable, so brilliant, right? I mean,

772
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,960
like, again, you wouldn't think to engineer this system necessarily.

773
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:26,000
Well, I mean, I think the reason evolution figured it out is, is again, learning

774
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:36,240
a purely electrical system, which is sort of like saying, you're playing some music,

775
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:42,240
but you don't have any modulation. You know, you're listening to a score,

776
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,000
and the score has no modulation, right? So you play everything at the same volume,

777
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,960
at the same tempo, at the same time. That's on music. That's not the song of the cell.

778
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:04,960
What evolution figured out, and by figured out, I don't want to put an anthropomorphic idea on it,

779
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:13,840
but what our evolution converged on is the idea that music has tempo, it has pace,

780
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:22,000
some pieces are softer, some pieces are louder. And by altering this loudness, softness,

781
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:30,320
as we move along in our neurons, that we can produce not just a mechanical

782
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:38,960
output of the score, but a real music. And your musical analysis is very interesting,

783
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:45,040
because that's what we're producing. We're producing not a mechanical output of the score,

784
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:55,600
we're producing a learned output, a mature output of the score. And that mature output has to do

785
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:04,640
very much with, you know, modulation. Some parts are louder, some parts are softer, some parts

786
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:12,960
speed up in rhythm, some parts slow down in rhythm. And that is ultimately the music of the cell,

787
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,840
but also the music of the brain. So there's many systems we haven't spoken about, but there's one

788
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,320
we would be remiss not to speak about, because it's near and dear to both of our hearts. So you

789
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:32,000
when you went to Oxford to do your PhD as a Rhodes Scholar, you ended up in a lab where you

790
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,840
learned immunology, which of course would come to serve you very well, as an oncologist and a

791
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:43,520
hematologist today. I want to talk about a couple of things there. First is, you spoke of course,

792
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:54,320
of your mentor Enzo in the lab. Help us understand what it is that was sort of bestowed on you

793
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:01,280
from an education perspective, from a learning perspective, as a doctoral student that we don't

794
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:07,120
really get in medical school. I mean, you know, you would go on to Harvard Medical School, you'd

795
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:13,600
get a great medical education. But I think anybody who spent time in a lab will understand that

796
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,960
there are just certain things that can't be taught in a classroom. You have to learn things

797
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,160
by being in a lab if that's the language you want to be able to speak.

798
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:27,280
What are your recollections of that period of time, especially in the beginning when presumably

799
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,560
the learning curve was very steep and you're drinking from a fire hose and you don't know

800
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,040
much of what's going on, but you've committed to this path of becoming a scientist first,

801
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:46,560
a physician second. It's a very different kind of thinking process. Peter, I like to make

802
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:54,000
medicines. And when I make medicines, I like to make medicines that are important for

803
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,960
human life, hopefully for saving lives. I've talked about some of them.

804
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:08,000
We've spoken prior podcasts about some of the new medicines that I've been involved in inventing.

805
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:17,440
The textbook knowledge in medicine is important and biology is important because it lays the

806
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:24,880
groundwork and the foundations of what we know and understand. But textbook knowledge only gets

807
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:33,680
you so far because when you come into the actual laboratory, you understand that there are things

808
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:39,120
that are predictable, there are things that are not predictable. And then you get into these

809
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:45,280
eyes, eye in the sandstorm and sand in the eye problems, which are very important.

810
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:55,520
You learn to recognize failure. You learn to recognize how to troubleshoot your way out of

811
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:05,840
failure. None of this is in a textbook. Open a textbook of biology, any textbook of biochemistry

812
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:14,400
biology, and try to find me a section on troubleshooting. You won't find one.

813
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:24,480
Troubleshooting your way out of failure is the most standard way that we think about medicine

814
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:33,040
in biology. Run a clinical trial. How do we select a patient? So let's say you're running a phase one,

815
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:42,640
phase one to be clinical trial. I have six open trials right now. How do you run a clinical trial?

816
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:51,360
Read a textbook. Nothing will tell you about how you select a patient for a clinical trial,

817
01:36:51,920 --> 01:37:00,160
how you manage a patient with complications from a clinical trial. There is no information anywhere

818
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:09,520
in that textbook about running that trial. So similarly, run an experiment which will

819
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,720
set you up for a clinical trial. There is no information in that textbook about how to

820
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:24,880
troubleshoot how and where and how to do that science that allows you to make it into a human

821
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:34,240
medicine. What if, for instance, you suddenly find that the medicine that you're working with,

822
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:44,160
that you're trying to create, isn't pure, that there's a contamination. How do you remove that

823
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:53,120
contamination? There is no method that you can't find a textbook. And so what you do is you ask your

824
01:37:53,120 --> 01:38:00,800
peers who've done this before you and you say, what did you do? And that's not in a textbook.

825
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:08,320
That's not in any book. That's not in a book that's ever been written. And so I wanted to write

826
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:16,640
about that. I wanted to write about that process of learning by doing, learning by being, learning

827
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:24,560
by experiencing. And that's why that whole chapter exists in the book. There is a kind of learning

828
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:38,000
that we do by doing, that we be by being, that we acquire by acquiring, that cannot be found in

829
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,680
any book or textbook in the medical sciences. And there's no way around it.

830
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:49,680
You know, there are a couple of really personal things I want to ask you about,

831
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:56,320
some of them for selfish reasons. I want to start with writing. For all the times we've had meals

832
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:05,440
together, I don't know how this hasn't occurred to me to ask you, but how and when did this, and

833
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,440
when I call it a gift, I don't want to undermine it, Sid, because I don't want to suggest it doesn't

834
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,120
require an obscene amount of hard work. But the reality of it is if I spent the rest of my life

835
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:22,000
writing, I would still write like a child compared to an adult in the way that you write. So at what

836
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:29,840
point in your high school, undergraduate, etc., did you realize that you had a brilliant way to

837
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:36,480
write? And I will say this, I think you are hands down the best medical writer, I mean, best writer

838
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,080
who happens to write about anything that has to do with science and medicine. I mean, it's really,

839
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:47,920
it's outstanding, Sid. Well, thanks for the compliments. You know, writing is not an easy

840
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:58,640
process for me, but it's also a somewhat weird process for me. And by weird, I mean, I throw in

841
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:06,400
everything. In the next book that I write, maybe this conversation that we're having, or some aspect

842
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:11,600
of this conversation, some question that you ask in this conversation will find its way into the

843
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:22,800
book. So I have this policy in which I don't make any, there's nothing that's outside my box.

844
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:35,760
It's all part of the box, all part of the whole story. So again, I find that that writing is a way

845
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:47,760
for me to think, a way for me to work through my thoughts. And the analogies and the metaphors and

846
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:57,760
the metaphorical parts of my writing are really not in service of writing. They're in service of

847
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:09,040
making me think. They're in service of making me understand why a certain phenomenon is related to

848
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:16,720
another phenomenon. I draw from history, I draw from mythology, from philosophy, from our

849
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:28,800
conversations, from interviews, and everything goes into a book. And in some ways, I feel as if

850
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:41,040
I had to invent the genre, because, you know, it was so siloed. Medical writing was about medicine.

851
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:53,520
It wasn't personal. It wasn't. There was sharp distinction between memoir and case histories.

852
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:03,200
There were sharp distinctions between, you know, deep history and an interview or journalistic

853
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:10,640
writing. And I said to myself, you know, these distinctions are arbitrary. They only exist to

854
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:18,720
serve a kind of secondary purpose. Why not erase all of them and make a new kind of writing in

855
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:30,400
medicine or in life? Because the most important thing that I think people told me about medical

856
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:39,040
writing was that when people read writing about medicine, they want to enter your cosmos. They

857
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:47,200
want to enter your world. They want to know what it's like to be like you. And so I said, okay,

858
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:56,080
I'll show them. What is it like to be like me? Well, it's like to be to experience intense,

859
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:09,840
absolutely intense exhilaration when a clinical trial is successful, absolute depths of depression

860
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:20,880
and crisis when a clinical trial fails. Absolute anticipation, absolute apprehension,

861
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:30,240
absolute admiration for people who on whose shoulders I stand. That's what it's like to be

862
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:40,240
like me. And when people said to me, show me your world, I said, okay, I'll show you my world,

863
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:48,960
but I'll show you my world in a way that's like to be like me. What is it like to be like me?

864
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:58,320
I am like you. I have terrible days. I have very good days. I have exhilarating days.

865
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:09,440
I make inventions. Those inventions work. Some of them don't work. And all of it is

866
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:18,400
wonderful and terrifying at the same time. I want to bring you into that. And that means I will

867
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:28,400
combine memoir, journalistic writing, traveling writing, philosophy, mythology, and everything.

868
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:33,520
I'll throw everything in there so that you understand what it's like to be like me.

869
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:38,960
There are two things you talked about in the book, Sid, that were completely unconnected,

870
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,840
but immediately in my mind were connected. And it probably has to do with my own world.

871
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:50,960
As you know, Sid, I think a lot about the end of life. I think a lot about how we can

872
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:57,680
delay and push off the end of life. And one of the things that I think a lot about is how

873
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:04,000
quickly life can vanish in a person when they fall. In an older person, I don't mean a 10-year-old.

874
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:11,680
And these two things that you write about, and again, totally different parts of the book.

875
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:17,680
Run, you talk very openly about your own depression that really kicked in a year after

876
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,960
your father's death, which resulted from a fall. And near the very end of the book,

877
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:28,400
you talk about the end of Virchow's life, which I was not aware of how Virchow died.

878
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:33,040
I was completely unaware of that, that he ultimately died as a result of a fall and

879
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:40,480
a broken femur. And within less than six months, he was dead, which is unfortunately far more

880
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:47,120
common than people realize. I mean, it is the leading cause of accidental death. And the

881
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:54,320
mortality, as you know, Sid, from a person over the age of 65, if a person at that age or above

882
01:45:54,320 --> 01:46:00,720
falls and breaks their femur, depending on the study, it's anywhere from 10 to 30% mortality

883
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:08,080
at 12 months. And you do a very good job of explaining the why. Because a lot of people,

884
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:13,920
when confronted with that fact, simply can't understand it. And I was again confronted by it

885
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:20,160
just two days ago, when the swim coach of Stanford while I was there, and of course,

886
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,400
I didn't swim at Stanford, but many of my friends did. And I sort of knew him and I got to know him

887
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:32,240
later after he had retired. And he fell two weeks ago, broke his hip, and two weeks later, he's dead.

888
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,160
Never really recovered from the surgery. That's a very extreme example.

889
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,280
It's interesting to me, but

890
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:46,960
what I couldn't believe was how you tied it back to the cell, right? Which was,

891
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:54,880
here we have one of these giants of cellular biology who falls and dies, but it's actually

892
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:02,080
the result of a cellular process. One cell, it starts with the osteoclast and the osteoblast

893
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:10,880
and the matrix of the hip. And ultimately it leads to organ failure. That's not a leap that I think

894
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:17,040
is easy to make. It's not obvious. Well, it's obvious when you think about

895
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:27,040
Burkhart's own idea that the body is a citizenship. Yeah. Well said. And the citizenship falls when

896
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:34,640
one part of the citizenship falls. Imagine a citizenship in any capacity, right?

897
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:44,720
All of a sudden your bureau of transportation decides to take a leave for 20 days. The trains

898
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:52,480
in New York City stop running. The trains stop running and therefore people can't go to work.

899
01:47:53,440 --> 01:48:00,640
People can't go to work and the economy collapses. The economy collapses and all of a sudden

900
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:09,600
people who are dependent on small changes in their lifetimes, wage workers collapse.

901
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:17,760
And then the entire system, the network of systems collapses, all because

902
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:25,120
the Department of Transportation closed down for two days. That's what happens in the human body.

903
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:32,880
That's the liability in some ways of multicellular existence. There are many advantages. We talked

904
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,640
about multicellular existence as advantages, but there are also liabilities because you depend on

905
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:44,000
your pancreas for insulin. You don't depend on your brain. Your brain doesn't make insulin.

906
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:49,120
Your brain doesn't make insulin. You depend on your brain for sensuous and consciousness.

907
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:54,000
You depend on your muscles for movement. Your brain can't produce movement without muscles.

908
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:01,200
And so there's a citizenship that bodies develop and have developed with each other

909
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:07,360
so that we together perform as organisms. Say it again, another personal question. How

910
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:18,880
much did you weigh the pros and cons of writing about such personal matters as your own depression?

911
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:24,640
I mean, we do still live in a world where it's not entirely clear to me why we view

912
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:30,560
depression different from hypertension. For example, if a person says,

913
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:36,800
I have hyperlipidemia and I take 10 milligrams of Lipitor a day. I don't think anybody bats an eye.

914
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,880
But if somebody says, I'm really struggling with depression and I take an antidepressant,

915
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:49,440
it just has a different valence to it for some reason. I don't, again, I don't know why that is.

916
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:58,480
I really don't. But in the presence of that knowledge, you still chose to talk about this

917
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:07,200
Why? Well, Peter, it was a very conscious choice. It was not unconscious. I talked to my family about

918
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:17,040
it. And I made the choice after that conversation. I agree with you. I think that depression is,

919
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:26,160
it can be what's called an organic disorder, a disorder in mood regulating neurons in your brain,

920
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:34,640
just like type 1 diabetes is an organic disorder, a disorder in the inability of pancreatic beta

921
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:44,080
cells to secure insulin. The reason it's different, I think, is that we associate a kind of victimhood

922
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:57,920
to mental disorders. And that kind of victimhood is punitive. It blames victims for being victims

923
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,480
in a way that you don't say that, oh, you're hypertensive because you

924
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:13,280
have genetics or behaviors, etc., etc., that are related to your hypertension.

925
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:22,880
But depression and mental disorders, grief, depression, and perhaps even more complex

926
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:32,160
disorders, schizophrenia, have a sense of blaming the victim and the victim being the person who's

927
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:42,800
the experiencing the disorder. That victimhood, I think, has to do with the idea of the brain

928
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,560
is separate from the rest of the body. It's a special organ. And yes, of course, it's a special

929
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:54,080
organ. There's no doubt about that. But on the other hand, it's also an organ that has physiology,

930
01:51:54,080 --> 01:52:01,280
just like your pancreas physiology, just like your heart has physiology. And so what I wanted

931
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:11,600
to get away from is this idea of special victimhood and talk about the brain as a cellular cluster

932
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:20,880
which is just a cellular, in some ways, just a cellular cluster, like the pancreas or the heart

933
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:32,560
or the liver is a cellular cluster, and thereby remove this or defend or even challenge this

934
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:42,320
idea of victimhood and responsibility. Because most people who experience severe clinical

935
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:51,360
depression experience it as a consequence of, of course, of environmental and emotional stimulation,

936
01:52:51,360 --> 01:53:07,200
the grief of dying, the grief of their situation, etc. But there are neuronal or nervous nerve cells

937
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:17,920
and nerve cell circuits that push them in biochemical and chemical ways towards the

938
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:25,840
state in which they cannot function. And I want to highlight that that absence of function,

939
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:33,440
if Virkha was alive today, Virkha would say that absence of function or that dysfunction

940
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:45,520
is not dissimilar to a person who has a failing heart or a failing liver. Because that function

941
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:55,200
is a dysfunction of mood regulating circuits and neurons in the brain, just as type 1 diabetes is

942
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:06,720
a dysfunction of insulin regulating cells in the pancreas. And that idea, again, is very important

943
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:14,240
and I think radical in this book and in all my books. I agree with you completely. I think it is

944
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:22,240
entirely radical and it's, I think, very difficult. I spoke about this with Carl Deseroth.

945
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,760
If you haven't read his book, by the way, it's a fantastic book as well.

946
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,200
I have read his book. It's incredible.

947
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:35,520
And Carl was a classmate of mine in medical school and he was equally brilliant then as he is now.

948
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:41,600
But he talks about this idea, right, which is it's this entire field of medicine,

949
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:47,440
I'm referring to psychiatry, for which we have not one biomarker, for which we have not one

950
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:53,360
radiographic finding that lends itself to a diagnosis. And so in the example of that

951
01:54:53,360 --> 01:55:00,320
failing heart and that failing liver, I mean, we have a menu of things to aid in the diagnosis.

952
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:05,840
In fact, it's much easier to make that diagnosis today than when William Osler had to make the

953
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:13,120
diagnosis 125 years ago. I mean, today, a medical student can diagnose a failing heart and a failing

954
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:21,920
liver given enough data. And yet there's still this black box inside of our brains in some ways.

955
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:30,880
And I think I just, you know, I find it very interesting and I can't help but wonder

956
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:37,600
where we will be in 20 years. Like when I think about oncology today and I think about what the

957
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:45,120
wish for oncology is in 20 years, and I think about psychiatry today and psychiatry in 20 years,

958
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:49,680
I feel like there's even more potential in psychiatry. And of course, I think the potential

959
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,200
in oncology is enormous.

960
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:58,720
Well, I think you hit the nail on the head, which is to say that, you know,

961
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:08,800
biomarkers will help and are always helpful. But ultimately, it's a clinical decision.

962
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:18,640
When you see, I always tell people, you know, who haven't been in clinical medicine,

963
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:25,680
when you see depression, you know depression, you know that this person has a dysfunction of

964
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:33,280
the neural circuits that regulate mood, just like a patient with type 1 diabetes has a dysfunction

965
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:42,560
in the cells that secrete insulin. And even if there are no biomarkers, you know it.

966
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:52,720
This is what humans can see about other humans. There's a disproportionality or a

967
01:56:56,640 --> 01:57:06,080
disconnection between the level of grief that a person experiences and the level of grief that

968
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:18,800
persists, the level of onui, the level of psychomotor inability to move that a person

969
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:24,720
experiences when they're when they're thinly depressed. So I think that there are,

970
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:31,200
even in the absence of biomarkers, I think that there is a new age that is coming.

971
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:40,240
And a respect, I think, for the autonomy of patients who experience neurological and

972
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:45,280
psychiatric diseases. And I think, as you said before, Deseroth writes about them

973
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,600
very carefully and very thoughtfully. There are many people, Andrew Solomon has written about

974
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:57,920
all of this. And I think it's very important because, you know, we could find therapies

975
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:03,360
for these. Some of them may be related to things that you and I are very interested in, like

976
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:14,000
alterations in diets, alterations in diets plus medicines, alterations in human physiology that

977
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:20,560
could reset brain circuits, electrical stimulation, as Helen Mayberg and others have been doing.

978
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:29,840
And to treat the problem as if it was, you know, just a problem that is sort of an epic phenomenon

979
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,880
is to minimize what the problem is.

980
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:42,000
Sid, there's so much more I wanted to talk with you about, but as not surprisingly, we've gone

981
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:49,280
pretty deep in a few things and there are topics like the entire immune system, the epigenetic

982
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:54,080
phenomenon and how we get into cellular reprogramming and Yamanaka factors. I mean,

983
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,320
we got through about half of what I wanted to talk about. So I think the only reasonable thing to do

984
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:03,760
here is to say, once the book tour is behind you, once we've both got a little bit more breathing

985
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:09,360
room, we should sit down again and do part three where we talk about some of these other factors.

986
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:15,920
You have a wonderful way of explaining complicated ideas. And frankly, I think perhaps the single

987
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:20,000
most important thing I wanted to talk about today, which was to bring all of this around

988
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:28,320
the future of science and the culture of anti-science that is propagating. I hesitate to

989
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:32,480
not touch on that now, but I don't think we could do it justice with a glib and short discussion.

990
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:38,080
With your blessing, I'd like to postpone that as yet another topic we can explore,

991
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,080
hopefully in 2023.

992
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:48,000
Would love to. And good luck. I love your podcasts and I love being on it.

993
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:54,320
Well, thank you, Sid. And congratulations again on another masterpiece. And I'm looking forward

994
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:01,200
to helping to spread the word so that many more people enjoy the, or experience the joy of reading

995
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:13,360
your work. Thank you, Sid.
