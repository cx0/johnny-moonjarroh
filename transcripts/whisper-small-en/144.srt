00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,840
today's episode. I guess this week is Phil Maffetone. Phil is an author, coach, health

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
practitioner. He wears many hats. Many of you will probably recognize him as he's written a

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,280
number of books, the 80s, 90s, and today, basically covering a number of aspects of exercise, sports

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,360
medicine, biofeedback, nutrition. I first probably came across Phil's work when I was in college,

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,960
and I was interested in aerobic training, trying to improve my cycling performance at the time,

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,240
and became pretty interested in the way he was advocating for a very low intensity relative to

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,240
what I was doing approach, which of course today in hindsight seems to be quite the logical thing

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,200
to do. Phil's background is in biology, has a doctorate in chiropractic, and he also has

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,320
trained in Chinese medicine and kinesiology. He was in private practice for about two decades,

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,160
and he's now a consultant, along with continuing to write, doing independent research and lecturing.

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,600
In this episode, we talk about his journey, how he became interested in this, both as an athlete

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,600
himself and then ultimately as a coach. We get into what is maximal aerobic function,

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,760
and this overlaps very closely. In fact, you could argue this is a very similar way to describe

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,920
the zone to something we speak about in a previous podcast, but coming at it through a sort of

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,320
different lens and using heart rate as opposed to lactate to measure it. We get into the importance

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,000
of fuel partitioning in addition to different levels of intensity. We talk a little bit about

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,440
marathon times and how they've changed over time and what that probably tells us about training.

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,880
So I hope you'll enjoy this episode. And without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:38,240
Phil Maffeten. All right, Phil, thanks so much for making time so late in your day. You're in,

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,800
where are you? Are you in Portugal right now? I'm in Lisbon, Portugal, and they don't have

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,240
dinner here till 9 or 10 at night, which I usually skip. So it's just past lunch for me.

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,800
It's great to be with you. So thanks, Peter, for having me. Well, I've been wanting to speak with

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,920
you for quite some time. And we've got a lot of listeners who have been excited about getting you

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
on. A lot of questions have come about. We've talked a lot about aerobic efficiency on this

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,560
podcast because obviously it's such an important part of delaying the aging process. So even if

34
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,840
you take it out of the context of performance, I think today we'll talk about both of these things,

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,240
performance and health. But it's obviously something that you've been working on for such

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,960
a long time. It's been central to the work you've done. But I want to go back and give folks a bit

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,760
of a sense of how you cut your teeth on this stuff. So you're obviously an avid runner yourself,

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,680
correct? I've been running since high school, I guess. And from track and field in high school

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,560
and college. And then when I got out and into practice, I thought, you know, this road running

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,440
stuff looks interesting. I'm starting to see patients. Let me let me see what's going on.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,160
And I, you know, I jumped into a 5k and it was a complete disaster because I was a track runner.

42
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,200
And what do we know about distance? And gradually I progressed to the marathon. I trained for a 6

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,960
day running race on a track because I had been working with some ultra runners,

44
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,640
Stu Middleman in particular. And it looked like such an exciting event. I thought this, you know,

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm going to do this. Then I can, you know, my bio could read, I've run everything from 200 meters

46
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,080
to six days. I thought that was cool. Of course, I was by that time, I was so busy with with treating

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,120
other athletes that I was just not able to get the time on the training. All the training was on a

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,960
track because the race was on a track. Yeah. Tell people what a six day race is. Yeah. A six day race

49
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,720
is a running race where you run on the track and the person who accumulates the most miles or

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,440
kilometers is the winner. You can run as you please. You can start and stop anytime. You can

51
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,800
sleep if you want. If you can stay awake, good luck. And I trained some people and it was for

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,920
me a fascinating thing clinically. It was really akin to having a mouse in a lab where you, you

53
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,360
know, you do something to this mouse and then you put them back in the cage and have them run on the

54
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,960
wheel for a while. And then you take them out and you do something else, measure something. And,

55
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,920
you know, it was such a great learning experience for me. And it was a great opportunity to really

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:39,920
hone my skills of observation in terms of gait and talking to an athlete, finding out when they

57
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,080
really were tired, unlike what they said. It was just so many really fascinating things. And then

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,080
the idea of doing the race seemed quite interesting. And I just ran out of training time. And so what

59
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,080
is the ideal strategy in my mind right now, I'm going through multiple ideas for how one could

60
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,200
approach a six day race. And, you know, one idea that comes to mind is you simply walk 18 hours a

61
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,520
day and sleep six hours a day, or, you know, you walk 20, sleep four and never put yourself under

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,000
incredible duress, but also never go too fast. The sort of slow and steady wins the race approach.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,960
And then alternatively, you can see something crazy where you, you know, actually take out a

64
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,040
reasonable clip and run for, you know, an hour and take an hour off. But of course, in that scenario,

65
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,000
you don't really get a full recovery. So what did you discover was the optimal scenario for covering

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,720
the most amount of ground in six days? What I discovered was you start the race by walking.

67
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,080
And now you're the only runner who's walking. The gun goes off, everybody starts running,

68
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,880
you're left walking. And that was always a kind of a comical scene for me. And the runners I worked

69
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,680
with, Stu Middleman in particular, who has the maybe still has the American record for that

70
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,000
distance. They were a little embarrassed in the beginning, but the strategy was to start slow,

71
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,320
gradually run faster, start jogging, gradually hit a certain plateau using the heart rate,

72
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,880
that maximum aerobic heart rate that we can talk about at some point. So very easy, relatively easy,

73
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,280
relatively low heart rate. And then now you're two hours into the first run, maybe three hours,

74
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,480
and then you start cooling down. And you take a half an hour to cool down, basically just the

75
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,600
opposite of what you did in the beginning. And now you can get off the track and take a very

76
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,840
short break, and then get back on the track and do the same thing. And that segment would sometimes

77
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,440
be elongated in the beginning in particular, because people are kind of jittery and they want

78
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,800
to do something, and taking a break is not something they want to do. And so there's no

79
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,120
hard running, certainly there's no high heart rate, high intensity training, you do see that in

80
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,640
other athletes. And that's how the days go by. That's it. So you spend a fair amount of time

81
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:19,120
walking. And with Stu in particular, as an example, Stu really liked the idea of going for 36 hours

82
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,320
without sleep. And I said, okay, let's try it. And it worked out well. So we did that. And then we

83
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,200
took a longer break before getting back into a 24 hour cycle. I'll tell you the interesting thing

84
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:42,640
for me is that it was exhausting for me, because I really had to be awake longer than he did,

85
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,800
because I couldn't sleep when he slept, because we had a specific time frame for him to sleep,

86
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,080
sometimes as short as seven minutes. And I needed to be awake when he was waking up, because

87
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,680
sometimes he didn't know where he was. And so for me, it was quite a stress. You're interfering

88
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,360
with your circadian rhythm so much that you could literally hallucinate after day four by day five,

89
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,080
potentially. And I've done that. So it's a very different kind of event than most runners have

90
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,320
ever experienced. Yeah, it sounds a lot like Ram, the race across America in cycling, which I

91
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
interviewed a guy named Mike Trevino a while ago, who has done Ram a number of times. And his stories

92
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,320
are very similar to that. And again, very different strategies that many cyclists will take. But there's

93
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,240
nobody at the end of that that's not in a significant world of pain. And the hallucinations can lead to

94
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,520
crashes and all sorts of crazy things. And it's pretty high stakes racing. It's an obvious

95
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,080
indication of significant brain stress. But I think the key is to, like with everything else,

96
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,960
individualize it with your athlete. And like I said, Stu had this idea that he wanted to go for 36

97
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,760
hours, which we had talked about a lot beforehand. And that became part of the strategy, because

98
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,440
that's something that he wanted to do. And the way we did it seemed like we weren't going to

99
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,160
sacrifice his health much. And so it was okay for me. And I think in in, whether you're on a bike or

100
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,840
running or whatever you you you need to as a coach as a clinician, and in that kind of race, I served

101
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,240
as a clinician because I did things like biofeedback, neuromuscular biofeedback, obviously, there's

102
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,840
significant stress in that area of the body. You still want to allow the athlete to voice,

103
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,760
you know, how they would like to do this race. And then you want to voice how you think it should

104
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,320
be done. You come to some meeting of the minds. But for me, it was always, I'm not willing to

105
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,720
sacrifice the health of this athlete, because that's, that's against what I do as a clinician.

106
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,080
As a coach, I want him to perform his best. And he was running about 100 miles a day for six days.

107
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,840
That's that's not a bad performance. Wow. At what point did your thinking start to transition from

108
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:18,480
the training of peak athletes to sort of a broader set of metrics or parameters that could be

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,320
applicable to health? Or did that not occur in sort of the fashion I've sort of described it?

110
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,720
It occurred the opposite way. I always loved sports. I love sports myself, I competed at a

111
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,160
very high level. I played other sports. And in undergraduate school, my goal was, hey, I want to

112
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,920
study and get out into the world. And my goal is to help people. It was my goal was to help people

113
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,960
with their health. And I knew there was this fitness thing. And I wasn't sure how it goes

114
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,520
together. But I, I didn't focus it. The athlete component was not really there. And in those early,

115
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,400
early days, when I got into practice and started seeing athletes who were injured, they were local

116
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,560
athletes who were, you know, they were they were five 10k runners, half marathon runners, some of

117
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,400
them were marathoners, you know, this was the boom in the 70s. And there were a lot of patients

118
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,040
because there were a lot of injuries. And so my focus was, why are they getting injured? And I

119
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,600
would gradually see better and better athletes locally. That led to two things. One, some of

120
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,920
those athletes got really good and attained a national class level. And, and then they referred

121
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,560
people that they knew who were professionals. And I started seeing pro athletes who were in

122
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
running, of course, because that was the big thing back then. But there was this thing on the west

123
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,760
coast called the triathlon, which just fascinated me to death because I was a swimmer and I was a

124
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:04,800
cyclist and a runner. And to have three events to work with was just, it was exciting. And I started

125
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,240
seeing some local people who were, you know, I was in the New York City area. So I was on the east

126
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,800
coast where it took a while for the word of triathlon to get there. And when it did, there were some

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,840
athletes and that was a lot of fun as well. So this is now sort of late 70s, right? When the

128
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,600
triathlon movement starting in Hawaii, kind of migrating over to California and the west coast.

129
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,440
Yep. And it was still new. It was crazy. And all we, all we really knew about it were these,

130
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,120
these three guys in a bar who were arguing about who's the better athlete, the swimmer,

131
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,920
the cyclist or the runner. And, you know, and that, I don't know how accurate that story is,

132
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,840
but supposedly that's, that's how the event started. And interestingly enough, early on,

133
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,560
there was a double iron man. I worked with somebody who, who did that, but yeah, that was late 70s and

134
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,920
then into the eighties. And by then I was seeing some professionals in most sports by then,

135
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
certainly by the, by the mid eighties, I had seen professionals in all sports.

136
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,360
And by the mid eighties, what fraction of your practice is professional athletes or athletes

137
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,920
competing at a very high level versus normal people who are coming to you saying I'm overweight

138
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,240
or I have diabetes or something like that. Gosh, I have to, you know, by then my clinic

139
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,840
was so busy. I was taking on associates or had other doctors in the clinic. You know,

140
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:41,280
my goal was for them to treat the local patients I had because I was now starting to travel with

141
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,480
athletes, which I hadn't, hadn't done. Mark Allen was a patient of mine by that point. And

142
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:55,040
I think it was 83. I'd been doing some sports clinics on the road in various cities. San Diego

143
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,200
was one and that's where I first met Mark and Paul and Newbie Frazier and some of those other

144
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,880
folks who were just getting going. And so by the mid eighties, I was on the road a lot.

145
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,480
And certainly by the mid eighties, I was in Boulder every summer because that's where a

146
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:21,280
lot of athletes went. And so I went there. So by that point, most of the patients I had were

147
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,040
competitive athletes who I was working one on one with. And I was doing a lot of lecturing,

148
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,160
starting to do a lot of writing as well. So at what point did you sort of, I would say,

149
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,760
congeal the idea that said, hey, we need to train at a lower level of intensity for longer

150
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,360
periods of time. You know, we're going to get into obviously the methodology, but I want to talk even

151
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,800
broader than that, which is, did you look at athletes and say, wait a minute, something's a

152
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,120
muck here. These people are training too much or either either volume is too high or intensity is

153
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,920
too high, but something is off and we need to do something that's sort of counterintuitive,

154
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,040
which is dial this back in one or both of those metrics. Was there, did you sort of see that in

155
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,640
the eighties? Oh, I saw it before the eighties. I saw it quite early because I was seeing these

156
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,880
people who were were able to run a marathon in whatever time. And that was like, wow, this guy

157
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,840
could run a marathon. What an example of optimal health. Well, it wasn't because they were broken

158
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,160
down. They were getting sick. You may remember, I mean, back then, you know, it was a badge of

159
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,880
courage to have a high white blood count because you are a runner. And I, I started putting all

160
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,640
these things together and it was pretty clear that something wasn't right. Cooper's aerobic

161
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,480
revolution was not, something wasn't working. You don't just go out and train and everything falls

162
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,680
into place. These people were falling apart. So that, that was in the seventies when I started

163
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,200
seeing that. And I was having a hard time understanding that relationship between being

164
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,680
healthy and being fit. And when I ran the New York city marathon in 1980 and I crossed the finish line,

165
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:16,080
it just hit me. These athletes are fit, but unhealthy. And that whole concept of fit, but unhealthy and

166
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,400
fitness and health are two separate definitions and they need to be balanced. Whether you're

167
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,520
a grandmother who goes out for a walk four or five times a week, or you're training for the

168
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,520
race of your life as a professional, it's all the same. And many of the things that I developed,

169
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,560
like the, the MIF tests, for example, were never meant for athletes. They were meant for the

170
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,840
average person because I thought whatever we're doing to this person to help them get healthier,

171
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,680
we need an indication, not just a blood test. We don't want to know if their blood picture looks

172
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,680
better. You want a functional test. We want a functional test that at the time didn't really

173
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,480
exist. And so the functional test for me was that they were going to be able to walk faster at the

174
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,080
same low heart rate than they could a month or two earlier. And that was, that was the big thing. And

175
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,520
then soon after that, I said, Hey, wait a minute. These guys are running faster now at the same

176
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,040
heart rate. And I thought, wow, this is, this is interesting.

177
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Can you give folks an explanation? Let's assume that people aren't entirely clear on the nomenclature

178
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,320
between aerobic and anaerobic fitness. This will allow us to, I think more accurately talk about

179
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,000
what submaximal means and maximal and all of these things. People have heard the term VO two max,

180
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,800
but I think it's important to give a bit of a context for where that'll fit on the spectrum.

181
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,600
So can you explain to folks what we mean by aerobic and anaerobic systems?

182
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,160
Yeah. And, and, and I don't want to go into the, the microbe definition, which is where

183
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,320
a lot of us have learned those terms, you know, there are aerobic microbes and anaerobic microbes.

184
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,880
So the anaerobic microbes are without oxygen. And when patients would say, well, I, I want to do

185
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,600
some anaerobic training. I'd say, well, what is, what is that? They said, well, what's without

186
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,560
oxygen. I said, you mean you can hold your breath while you're doing the intervals. And so

187
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,320
we need a better definition. And my definition became fat burning was, was associated with

188
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:30,160
aerobic and all of the factors that are associated with fat burning. So the aerobic muscle fibers in

189
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:38,000
the mitochondria and the ability to convert fatty acids into energy, into ATP, and anaerobic was the

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,440
glucose side. And that was simple enough. It wasn't scientific enough, but it was simple enough

191
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,360
for what people needed to understand. And especially when we can come up with a heart rate

192
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,640
that says, well, if you go over this heart rate, you're drifting into that anaerobic state. And if

193
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,880
you stay under it, you're in an aerobic state. And therefore you're training your body to burn more

194
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,680
fat as an energy source. And therefore you're going to store less fat and, and you're going to

195
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,640
get rid of any excess fat and so on and so forth. Can you explain to folks what the VO2 max is?

196
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,360
Because I want to spend some time explaining why it's not a great predictor of much,

197
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,760
despite the fact that it certainly produces boasting rights. It produces for sure,

198
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,480
boasting rights. It's a number that people talk about. Everybody talks about it and hardly anybody

199
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,240
gets tested. And almost nobody gets tested with some regularity so they could do something with

200
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,960
the numbers. We can define it academically, which doesn't tell you much, but it's a test that is,

201
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,280
was developed a long time ago. And so there's a lot of tests around. And the real question is,

202
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,240
what does it really mean? And I'm not sure it means a whole, I didn't do many of those tests.

203
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,280
So I, you know, I had an academic education and, and I knew about VO2 max and I knew about

204
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,760
all this traditional stuff, the 220 formula, which I used in the very beginning because I thought that

205
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:18,160
was the science of, of exercise physiology and quickly learned it wasn't. And VO2 max was right

206
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,680
there and, and VO2 max became the tradition. I think it was the tradition back then. I don't

207
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,680
remember when it was first developed. It was by Hill, wasn't it? Back in.

208
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,880
I actually don't know who developed it in 1920s. But for listeners, I think it's,

209
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,800
it's a relatively straightforward test to administer provided you have the machinery and

210
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,280
the machinery is complicated because you have to be able to isolate gases very well,

211
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,000
specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide. So the test is normally done on either a treadmill

212
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,160
or a stationary bike where you can control the resistance or the, the load that the athlete is

213
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,240
under. The challenge is creating an airtight seal around their nose and their mouth,

214
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,680
because what you're really doing with the test is you want to measure how much oxygen is coming

215
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,000
out of their respiratory system and how much CO2 is coming out because you know how much is going

216
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,160
in. And therefore the difference is the amount of oxygen consumed. Now, if you're sitting here at

217
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:35,920
rest, you have a VO2, an amount of oxygen that's consumed. And the purpose of the test is to ramp

218
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:43,280
up the level of exertion until you reach the maximum level of oxygen consumption. So VO2 max

219
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:50,240
is simply the maximum amount of O2 consumed. And the difference between a very fit person and a

220
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,800
non-fit person is the fitter you are, the more oxygen you're able to consume. And that's basically

221
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,400
a function of your muscles. It's what can the muscles do? So I think a lot of people erroneously

222
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,000
think this is a test of the heart and lungs, but it's not really a test of the heart and lungs,

223
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,640
right? The lungs is where the gas exchange is happening. The heart is the circulatory pump.

224
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,880
It's really a test of what your muscles can do in terms of utilizing that oxygen. And to your point,

225
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,040
it's how much fat oxidation can happen because that's where you're utilizing the oxygen is in

226
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:33,680
the mitochondria to oxidize fat. But all of that said, the research actually says that you can't

227
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,240
predict marathon finish time by VO2 max. You're right. And people don't like hearing that because

228
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,040
they have this idea that this set, now this VO2 max is directly associated with performance. So

229
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,760
they need to rev up their VO2 max by doing hard training, which will get them performing better.

230
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,520
And that, you know, that's where the whole system breaks down. That's the problem we have. This VO2

231
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,480
max is a, it's something we have been worshiping and we're worshiping the wrong thing.

232
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,840
So tell folks what MAF stands for. MAF stands for maximum aerobic function.

233
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,880
And in essence, the goal of being healthy, the goal of being fit is to develop the aerobic system.

234
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,240
This is what our ancestors did. This is how we got here. We developed a really

235
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:37,360
incredibly powerful aerobic system by doing the things in our lifestyle that drive that aerobic

236
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:45,280
system to develop, which includes eating more fat, not eating much carbohydrate, eating moderate

237
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,560
amounts of protein, maybe even relatively small amounts of protein for the earlier humans,

238
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,440
because we were, we were not the hunters in those early stages, but we, we certainly ate a large

239
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:06,640
amount of fat and we didn't sprint after animals. We jog after animals. And so all of that is how we,

240
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,440
we developed, we developed bigger brains, bigger bodies. We developed bodies that

241
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,840
had great longevity and a higher level of health to match that longevity. And it doesn't take long

242
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,520
when you start reading about this. And it was really an anthropology course, I think, that I

243
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,280
first started reading this kind of stuff. And it was really quite fascinating because I said, well,

244
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,520
if that's what they were doing, why are we doing all this other stuff now? And that sort of got me

245
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,400
thinking about this as an undergraduate student, because it seemed pretty clear what our ancestors

246
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,280
were doing and the fact that they were doing it for so long, you know, just what happened between

247
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,440
some time ago and now, how did we get into the mess we're in? And so the concept of maximum aerobic

248
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,080
function has been really with me for, for quite some time. When I was working with runners, which

249
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,040
is almost all the athletes I worked with, certainly in the seventies, I started talking about the pace

250
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,960
that these athletes could run at with this given heart rate that I had come up with,

251
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,040
this aerobic heart rate. And I called it the maximum aerobic heart rate. And so the pace

252
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,920
they were running was the maximum aerobic pace. And how did you come up with that heart rate?

253
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,120
That heart rate was derived in combination of a physical exam in my office. I want to know how

254
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:46,720
healthy they were. I want to know about their history. What did their labs look like, their

255
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,480
posture, their strength and so forth. And then I would go out to the track and I would monitor

256
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,840
their heart rate. I'd monitor their gait while we use different heart rates. And so I'd see them at

257
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,920
a 120 heart rate. I'd look at their gait, I'd say this is, it's a pretty good gait. And then we'd go

258
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:12,320
to 130. That's a pretty good gait, maybe even a little better. And then they'd go to 140. And I'd

259
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,440
start seeing irregularities. And then I'd bring them back to 130 and I'd see a nice smooth gait

260
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,400
again. And I'd put all that together and I'd assign them a certain MAF heart rate and they would go

261
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,720
train. And then I would test them again to see if it correlated. And it was a long process. And it

262
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,920
would not be for two or three years when I developed a formula, which I never used personally

263
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,280
because I always wanted to do it manually, but they correlated so well. And you may have heard

264
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,320
me say, I was lecturing one day about this and how I came up with this heart rate and what it meant and

265
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,240
how people were benefiting from it. And somebody said, well, how do we come up with that heart

266
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,480
rate? And I didn't have an answer. And I started realizing that, well, there's probably some simple

267
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:10,640
mathematical process that I can go through to use the athletes I had. I already know their heart

268
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,840
rate. Let's plug in the numbers. And the 180 formula was born. I tweaked that for a couple

269
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,960
of years. And the formula you see today is basically the same formula that existed in the early 80s.

270
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,160
Let's go through it in a bit more detail, just to make sure folks understand what we're saying.

271
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:38,480
You're saying that a person is going to be at their maximum aerobic output, so meaning they're

272
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,520
going to be maximally fat oxidizing at an approximate heart rate of 180 minus their age,

273
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,000
plus or minus a few modifications. So I believe there are a handful of these. If you're recovering

274
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
from an illness or you're kind of in an overtrained situation, you might actually need to discount that

275
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,240
by another 10, right? It might be 170 minus your age. Correct. The key is that you want to

276
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,480
individualize it. So you begin with 180 minus the age, which has no meaning, like the 220 formula.

277
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,520
You subtract your age from 220 and they say it's your maximum heart rate or whatever. Your max

278
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,280
heart rate. And of course, it's not most of the time. So 180 minus the age has no meaning. It's

279
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:30,000
just a means to the end. But you now want to individualize it to your health and fitness

280
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,400
needs. So if you're recovering from an illness, if you're severely overtrained, if you're in rehab,

281
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,800
you want to subtract another 10 from that. But if you're not in that category and you only have

282
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,480
the typical two or three colds a year, you might have asthma or seasonal allergies, you might be

283
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:57,840
overfat, you might be training for a while and then you kind of, you lose time, you can't train,

284
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,920
and then you get back into it. And in that category, you subtract another five, all the way

285
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,400
to the competitive athlete who has no health problems, who has been progressing quite well,

286
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,440
they can add five to that number. So in the, you know, that formula, what's important for people

287
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,840
is to follow the formula and be honest. That's the hardest part is to be honest. So if you're

288
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,200
on medication, for example, you've got to subtract your age from 180 and you've got to subtract

289
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,880
another 10. And what kind of meditation does it matter? Doesn't matter. That's the thing.

290
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,800
People will say, well, I'm only on this and that's not really affecting my heart rate or,

291
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,680
or I don't have to be on it. Or I, I don't know what, you know, if you're on medication,

292
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,000
you subtract 10. And if you get healthy along the way by training this way, and now you can

293
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,640
get off your medication, well, now you could redo the formula because now you're no longer

294
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,960
on medication, you're healthier. Let's have a look at the 180 formula again and modify it as

295
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,040
needed. You know, it's like doing a history on a patient. The most important thing is that they

296
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,600
be honest, because if you don't get the right information, you're, you're in trouble.

297
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,800
So it's kind of amazing to me, by the way, that you were able to do so much with heart rate back

298
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,200
in the seventies and eighties. What, what did you even use for heart rate monitors or were people

299
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,560
just manually checking their heart rate doing these tests? Well, yeah, I began manually checking

300
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,080
heart rates. There were some finger units that were not very accurate. There's some clips you

301
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,640
put on the ear. They were not accurate. Unlike the ear buds that are used today, picking up the

302
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:51,120
heart rate in the ear canal is a good measure. And I finally got a heart monitor that was used

303
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,480
in cardiac rehab in hospitals. And it was a big obnoxious, you know, double strap. One went over

304
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,240
the shoulder, one went around the chest and it had this box that was in the middle. And it, you know,

305
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,760
all you got was the heart rate. You could see it in this tiny window and you can hear the thing

306
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,880
beeping. And it would be several years before the wireless monitors came out, which I think was

307
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,440
late in 83 maybe. And when I first started using this heart monitor, I had one in my office. It

308
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,800
was like having, you know, I had a stethoscope. Okay. And I used it when I needed to use it. And

309
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,400
so I had this heart monitor and I would use it, go to the track, put it on an athlete, we'd use it,

310
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,400
take it off, put it on another athlete. And I, silly me, I thought, well, okay, once they

311
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:51,040
feel what 130 heart rate or 150 heart rate is like, they'll be able to train that way.

312
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,880
Well, that didn't work. So then I started lending out the heart monitor and then I had to buy another

313
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,800
one. And then I had like three of them. You know, it was like, you have three heart monitors? Yeah,

314
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,480
I have three in my office. It was like the old, you know, 1950s people had one television and if

315
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,760
somebody had two television, it was like, you mean you have two TVs? Wow. That's, you know,

316
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,000
you know, then people started buying them. They said, I'm going to train with this.

317
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,880
Because when I trained with it, I feel better. I'm not tired. I'm, you know, my back doesn't hurt

318
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,640
anymore. And blah, blah, blah. It progressed that way. And then when the wireless heart monitors

319
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:38,160
came out, everybody wanted to buy one, which was interesting. So the formula, the math formula of

320
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:47,120
180 minus age, and then adjusted based on all the factors, is a way to basically gauge the intensity.

321
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,720
How did you then prescribe volume? And how did you not only prescribe the volume there,

322
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,600
but determine how much volume to add in that was at a higher intensity?

323
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,320
That's an interesting question. It really began early on when I had no intention of coaching.

324
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:14,240
I didn't want to be a coach. You know, I want to be a clinician and fix people's knees and help them,

325
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,040
you know, get off blood pressure medications or whatever. And with athletes, I thought if I could

326
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,760
just keep them from getting injured, they'll just perform better because, you know, that seemed to

327
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,440
be the thing that slowed them down getting some physical injury. And I realized that

328
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:40,800
I was treating symptoms. I was, I was really, you know, it was against my nature to, to do that. I

329
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,680
was, I was fixing some runner's knee and they go out and train. And then I'd see them again in my

330
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,600
clinic a month later with the same knee problem. I said, well, what, what did you do? He said, well,

331
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,840
I just did my normal training. And, you know, eventually I said, well, let me look at your

332
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,000
training and people would write down their schedules and I would start looking at it.

333
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And I realized that I didn't, I needed to have some input on this schedule because

334
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,920
what they're doing was excessive. They were literally over training. And so I became a coach

335
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,480
and I didn't want to be like a regular coach where I'd give out a schedule. I wanted them,

336
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,880
like I said earlier with, with, with Stu Middleman, I wanted the athlete to be part of the process,

337
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,640
you know, I wanted to say, well, what would you like to do with your training? And they bring in

338
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,560
their schedule and I'd look at it and I would just say, let me get this straight. You work 60

339
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,960
hours a week. You have three kids and a house and you do all these social things and you're trying

340
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,200
to run a hundred miles a week. That doesn't make sense. You either have to get rid of your kids,

341
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,240
get rid of your family, get rid of your job, or reduce the number of miles you're running.

342
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,200
And so, you know, I got a lot of laughs and we, we went on and I found that people

343
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:17,360
could do a lot less training, add a lot less intensity and perform in a race a whole lot better.

344
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:26,080
And it didn't take long to see that. You know, it's like a taper. When you taper, you get stronger.

345
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,920
Well, when you cut somebody's schedule down, they can get more out of their training. And so,

346
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,440
it worked that way. And so the big issue was really this aerobic system stuff. How do you build

347
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,560
the best aerobic system? Of course, I had been familiar with Arthur Lydiard,

348
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,960
who was a patient in my clinic actually at one point. And so I knew about this concept of the

349
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,600
aerobic base and, and it just seemed to make a lot of sense. And what I found through working

350
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,880
with a number of patients that if they, if they do their traditional two days a week of

351
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,000
interval training on the track, they never got faster at the same heart rate like these other

352
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
people did, who seemed to excel quite quickly from, from one month to the next, they could be running

353
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,800
starting at a nine minute a mile pace at their MAF heart rate. They might be running 830 a month

354
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,680
later, same heart rate, month later, now they're running at an eight minute pace.

355
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,400
Okay, so I want to pause there for a sec. So when the athlete makes progress, when they're doing

356
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,920
their MAF test, which again, I just want to remind everybody, because we're, we're talking about both

357
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,960
an MAF heart rate, but then the MAF test, and these are very important concepts. So let's go

358
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,280
back. So I figure out either through a very bespoke manner or using the formula that my

359
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:02,160
MAF heart rate is 130. I go out and I'm going to do my training at 130, and I'm running a nine minute

360
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:10,800
mile. The question becomes, while keeping my heart rate at 130, can I get faster? Can I go from a nine

361
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,240
minute mile to an 830 mile to an eight minute mile? And if I can do that while staying at 130,

362
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,720
by definition, I have become aerobically fitter and more efficient, correct?

363
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,840
Correct.

364
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:33,360
Now, is there a point at which you begin to adjust up the heart rate and say, Peter, I want you to now train at 132?

365
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Or do you keep me at 130 and see how far we can drive that down until I plateau? How do you make that decision?

366
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:48,640
I keep you at 130 because I've determined that 130 is a good number for you because you're

367
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:56,240
progressing now. Can we cheat a little bit up to 132 and 133, only to find out two months later

368
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,880
that you're back to where you were? I don't want to spend that time because at some point I've had

369
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,120
enough experience to know that's not a good use of our time. So we're going to stay at 130,

370
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,640
and we're going to allow your body to develop that aerobic system. The question people often have is,

371
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,440
well, how do I run faster at the same heart rate? It doesn't make sense. And the answer is that

372
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,560
you're able to generate a lot of energy from fat. You're building the aerobic system, so you're

373
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:34,640
increasing fat burning. Now you have more energy. You have the steam engine, the more wood or coal

374
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:42,640
you throw in there, the more that engine can go and the faster it can go. And you will progress,

375
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,800
and you'll month after month get faster and faster. At some point you will hit a plateau. And

376
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,600
early on I realized it took three, four, five, six months before people hit a plateau.

377
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,680
So there are two issues. One is, do we keep allowing the body to get faster and faster?

378
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,560
Which for an endurance athlete is the greatest benefit they can obtain. Because if they can go

379
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,800
faster at a submax pace, they can go faster at a max pace. Let's unpack that for a minute.

380
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,320
Let's unpack that. That's a very, very important statement. Can you talk about some of the

381
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,120
experiences you've had to establish that? And again, actually before we do that, Phil,

382
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:35,040
let's talk about why that's relevant. You're running a 10k. Let's say at the very competitive

383
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,080
level, a 10k is, depending on how competitive obviously, it can be sub 30 minutes. But if

384
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,360
you're kind of a recreational athlete who's running competitively, you're going to be in the 32,

385
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:54,560
33, 34 minute range. By definition, you're running well above your math target. Is it necessarily

386
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:04,240
true that if you take the top 10 finishers of that race and then a week later, have them

387
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,560
run at their math heart rate, they'll cover greater distances as a function of what they

388
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,840
ran in the 10k race. In other words, do we have evidence that that's true? Because if it is,

389
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,960
it's a remarkable statement, right? We do have evidence that that is true. Hypothetically,

390
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:30,640
you have the outlier who's this guy who can't run nine minutes without hitting a 180 heart rate.

391
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,720
These are the people who are over-trained enough to be in that sympathetic state.

392
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:44,000
They get into a 10k and they run a PR at amazing feet. How could, you know, I've run a minute and

393
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,920
a half faster in my, you know, these are the people that are ready to fall apart at any minute.

394
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,120
And I've seen them. These are also the people who are ready to drop dead of a heart attack.

395
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,440
And so if we take those outliers away, then yes, we have this hierarchy of athletes who have a

396
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:12,000
increasingly better submax condition that corresponds to their race pace.

397
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,320
If that's true, then, Phil, it would really lend credence to the idea that even if you're training

398
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:27,520
for a 5k or a 10k, you still want to push your math protocol. It still matters how much you can,

399
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,240
how much distance you can cover at that lower heart rate and lower intensity where you are

400
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,920
running at your maximum fat oxidation and maximum aerobic capacity.

401
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:47,520
Yeah. And I think it's pretty clear now that submax performance predicts maximum performance.

402
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:55,520
How far down can you go even for a miler? I think it comes down to how much fat burning

403
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,640
do we need? And even for a mile, there's a lot of fat burning taking place in a one mile race.

404
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,240
I want to ask you about fat. When I was in medical school, the conventional wisdom

405
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:16,720
was that fat oxidation could not exceed one gram per minute. Now, I didn't think much of it,

406
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:25,360
but many years later when I underwent an enormous dietary switch and I went from being a kind of

407
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:33,840
ultra distance athlete, basically mainlining carbohydrates, so probably consuming,

408
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,680
I would say, five bottles of Powerade a day. So let's say if I was training four hours a day,

409
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,480
I would go through five liters of Powerade plus CytoMax plus Hammer Perpetuum, like basically all

410
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:57,200
of these very high carbohydrate formulas, rotting my gut. And when I would do my VO2 max testing,

411
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,120
which I did pretty frequently, you get a lot of data on the way up to VO2 max. You're getting all

412
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:10,560
of your fuel partitioning data because you're getting VO2 and VCO2. So I know how many calories

413
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,480
I'm expending at every level of intensity, and I know what the mixture is of carbohydrate versus

414
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:24,720
fat. So clearly in that state, I was nowhere near oxidizing one gram of fat per minute. In fact,

415
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:32,080
I was pretty much only oxidizing glucose the entire level. In other words, even at my low

416
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:38,560
intensity, I was still a glucose oxidizer. Fast forward years, several years, I've tried

417
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,720
something totally radical. I've gone on a ketogenic diet. I've done it for not just a while,

418
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,120
but actually for three years. And I've become very adapted to it such that I can function at high

419
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:55,200
and low intensity. And I'm now doing the same thing. I'm repeating VO2 max testing, but on this

420
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:06,240
ketogenic diet, and I hit a fat oxidation, which is still submaximal. So it's just below my VO2 max,

421
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:15,200
but my max fat ox was 1.73 grams per minute. And I remember thinking, how is that even possible?

422
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,040
Now, of course, I would go on to learn that world-class athletes training on a very low

423
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:29,600
carbohydrate diet were able to hit 2, 2.1, even 2.2 grams per minute, which I found interesting.

424
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:37,360
It basically said that this conventional wisdom we have about sports nutrition and sports science

425
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,800
is largely predicated on assumptions of what people are eating that aren't necessarily the

426
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,760
optimal way to go about doing it. It's a very good point. And I mean, you and I came to that

427
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,200
same conclusion in different ways. And we also had the same studies to look at, the same lab

428
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,160
tests to do. And unfortunately, we had a lot of the same subjects, or we read about

429
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,920
studies that use the same subjects, which were big carbohydrate eaters that distorted the research

430
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:15,200
completely. But all along the way, I knew there was something about fat. And the question is,

431
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,360
well, how could we really measure it? And I knew we could do it in the lab. My clinic was in the

432
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,840
middle of, I mean, I was in the New York City suburbs at the time. So I occasionally had access

433
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,400
to a lab, occasionally could get somebody in there to test. And occasionally, they would say,

434
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,840
wow, this is amazing. How could this person burn so much fat? We don't understand this.

435
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,600
It must be a problem. And then, you know, as the months and years went by, you know,

436
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:52,320
it was not a problem anymore. This was great. And so all along the way, for me, it was always,

437
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,480
I know what's going on. I know this athlete's getting healthy. I know they're burning more

438
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,040
fat because they're running faster at the same MAF heart rate. And now we're starting to see it be

439
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:10,960
measured. And it was a point where I said, I can't be the scientist. I'm not really a scientist.

440
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,720
I do wear that hat, but I'm too busy being a clinician and coming up with all these

441
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:25,600
crazy tests. And still my primary concern was helping people get healthy and fit. And if it was

442
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,720
an athlete, it meant they were going to perform better, but not by sacrificing their health. And

443
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,520
if they were not an athlete, we still had a lot of work to do. And it was only after a while that I

444
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,240
started thinking more scientifically. I always thought scientifically, depending on who you ask,

445
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,440
you know, if you ask a scientist, they would say, well, I'm not, I'm not being very scientific when

446
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,720
I explain this MAF heart rate. And if I ask a clinician, they say, you know, you're, you're too

447
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:02,800
scientific about this. So I gradually became more and more scientific only because A, it was fun,

448
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:11,120
especially reading the new research. And B, it was much better for me as a clinician to explain

449
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:21,840
things in scientific terms. I still had that scientific mentality of this is how we communicate

450
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,840
to the rest of the world from a scientific standpoint. So the fat burning component became

451
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,600
that factor that we can measure more and more. And like the story you told of the changes you made

452
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:43,200
and how it affected fat burning, you know, I started gathering that kind of data and started

453
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,520
writing more as a clinician, you can't publish papers. You just can't, you know, your brain is

454
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,760
unable to, to spend time doing that because you're spending so much time doing other things. And it

455
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,400
wasn't until after I left my clinic, because healthcare was getting so bad, I just couldn't

456
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,840
do that anymore. And I, I ended up only working with, with athletes. And so healthcare was really

457
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:17,760
out of the picture in many ways. And then I was able to spend more time thinking and writing

458
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,480
scientifically and start publishing more. I wrote a textbook, I started publishing more

459
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:32,080
scientific papers and talking about all this with a scientific hat on rather than merely a

460
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:37,280
clinical hat. Although a lot of the scientific things I've written are clinical oriented,

461
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,200
because that's still my goal is to help people. And one of the ways of helping people is to help

462
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:50,000
other clinicians who can then in turn help their patients. There's something about this nutritional

463
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,320
component that I think creates a lot of confusion for people, which is that it tends to be in flux.

464
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:03,280
So it's not constant. When I was young, so call it the first athletic phase of my life, which I

465
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:10,080
would say is about age 13 to 18. So between the ages of 13 to 18, I was indestructible, just like

466
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,880
most 13, you know, to 18 year olds are you can do anything, there is no such thing as overtraining,

467
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:22,960
nor is there such a thing as overeating. I could consume such comical amounts of food. And they

468
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,040
were really not of high quality at all, right? So, you know, breakfast would be a box of cereal into

469
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,840
large Tupperware bowl the entire box. I mean, six or seven sandwiches for lunch every day. So a whole

470
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:43,120
loaf of bread turned into sandwiches plus French fries plus a one gallon thing of orange juice.

471
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:51,520
I mean, just disgusting quantities of food, but absolutely no impairment of performance or health,

472
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,480
at least by any measurable amount. But by the time I'm in the sort of second and third phase of

473
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:06,000
my life into my late 20s and my 30s, my tolerance for that amount of carbohydrate went down.

474
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,960
And so even though I was still exercising a lot, certainly by any normal standard, you know,

475
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:21,600
I metabolically became quite sick. And I became the example of that guy who can't outrun his bad

476
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,400
diet. Although in my case, I was out swimming it, I was trying to out swim it or out ride it.

477
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:36,240
And so how did you then either as a coach or as a clinician trying to help just a normal person

478
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:43,040
calibrate not just the intensity of exercise, not just the duration of exercise, but now this

479
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:50,000
third layer, which is specifically what is the carbohydrate tolerance of the individual,

480
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,720
given that one, two people can be similar and vary in a number of ways and yet be different in that

481
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,480
regard. And secondly, any given individual is likely going to see a deterioration of that over

482
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,080
a deterioration of that over time. Sure. And we we all become more insulin resistant

483
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:14,240
as the years go by. I like to call it carbohydrate intolerance, because as soon as you say insulin

484
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,720
resistance to the average person, they either shut down or they panic or they totally ignore you,

485
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,040
because that's a hard, it's a hard term to relate to because they can't relate to it.

486
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,520
Carbohydrate intolerance, at least when you say you're not tolerating the level of the amount of

487
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,640
carbohydrates you're eating. So you need to cut down. They can relate to that. They may not be

488
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:45,520
happy, but they can relate to that. But the more important factor was one that I already

489
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,640
knew about, although I didn't know how to apply it to patients. But I already knew

490
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:59,200
going again, going back to undergraduate school where this idea of holism, you know,

491
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:07,120
it came from philosophy, really, for me, this holistic idea showed up one day. And I think

492
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,560
out of that came this idea that we're all individuals and we all have uniquenesses.

493
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:21,040
And I carried that with me into my clinical world. And there wasn't much to do, you know,

494
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,320
to measure insulin resistance back then meant going into the hospital and having a glucose

495
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:32,880
clamp test. That was just unheard of. They laughed at me when I sent patients to the cardiologist

496
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,560
because I wanted to see, I want to measure heart rate variability in this patient because

497
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,440
I think there's an autonomic problem. Well, half of them didn't have any problem, but the other

498
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,480
half did. And they said, well, gee, how do you know that? You know these things as a clinician

499
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:54,560
because you do a good evaluation. You assess the patient and you spend a lot of time talking to

500
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,400
the patient, something that's not done anymore. It wasn't done much back then either. But by

501
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:09,200
doing that, you learn about the patient. You learn about so many things, including insulin resistance.

502
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,400
How sensitive are they to insulin? How do they respond? An obvious example is a New York City

503
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,800
executive works in an office all day, training for a marathon, goes out for lunch, comes back,

504
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,320
and is so tired that he has to put his head on the desk and literally fall asleep.

505
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,080
Obviously, Bob, what did you have for lunch? Well, you start putting two and two together and it's

506
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,800
not that hard. And then just like the MAF test where you want to see what is this person capable

507
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,840
of doing at this given heart rate, I came up with another challenge, which was a food challenge

508
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,800
called the two-week test. Okay, Bob, I want you to not eat those things at lunch anymore. I don't

509
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:05,040
even want to have you eat those things for breakfast. In fact, let's take away all the junk

510
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,680
food from your diet and take and cut way down on the natural carbohydrates like lentils and beans

511
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,560
and rice and fruits and fruit juice, etc. And we'll do it just for two weeks. It's a challenge. We want

512
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:26,080
to see how you respond. So we gather all the signs and symptoms that are not normal. I fall asleep

513
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:33,520
after meals. I fall asleep easily at night because I'm so exhausted, but I wake up at 2am, etc., etc.

514
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,640
Okay, let's put these things on the table. Let's do this two-week test after the two weeks of eating

515
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,760
that way. Let's look at all these signs and symptoms. Are any of them better or any of them worse?

516
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:51,440
Well, yeah, three-quarters of them are better. Of all the miracles I've seen in clinical practice,

517
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,960
the two-week test is one of them because you see these people become new people after a very short

518
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,200
period of time. It's really amazing. I mean, it's because insulin is involved. Insulin has immediate

519
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,400
effects. Carbohydrates have immediate effects. The two meal effect with, you know, it's just,

520
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:16,160
it's an almost an instant change. So now you've gathered more information. You're still assessing

521
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:23,600
the patient, but now we can start individualizing things more and more. And that process was just

522
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:30,000
ongoing. And again, I always wanted to enlist the patient. So I wanted to say, okay, you've done

523
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,040
this two-week test. You're feeling so much better after two weeks. Now we want you to add some lentils

524
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:45,040
to your midday meal or add a small piece of fruit at breakfast or whatever. And let's see how you

525
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:51,360
feel. Let's see if some of those signs and symptoms come back with just one piece of fruit or let's

526
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,840
see if you've lost 10 pounds. You're starting to gain after a couple of weeks of only having a

527
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:03,840
little bit of carbohydrate, whatever. But I want to enlist them in the process. I want them to use

528
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,560
their instincts and intuition, which we all have, to understand what it feels like to eat too much

529
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:19,440
carbohydrate before you've gotten there. One more bite of this apple and I'm in trouble. I want you

530
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,920
to know that. I think it's a very important thing. It's a very human thing. And so that holistic

531
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:34,000
component, that individualizing aspect of my work has always been there. And in many ways, it makes

532
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,200
it easier. People might say, well, if you just give somebody a diet, it doesn't get any easier

533
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:46,480
than that. Well, it doesn't get any rewarding when you do that either. So it was a very important

534
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,200
part. And it still is a very important part, even though I'm not sitting with patients one-on-one

535
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:59,840
anymore, usually. I may do some consulting, but I am writing. I am still lecturing. And I could take

536
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:07,360
that component of individualization, of holism, and get those points across to people so they can

537
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:14,800
take that and run with it, so to speak. Now, I, again, mentioned that I spent all this time on

538
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:22,320
a very low carbohydrate diet and saw enormous improvements in my aerobic fitness. When it was

539
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:28,160
all said and done, my anaerobic fitness, my higher level intensity fitness, did not deteriorate,

540
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,800
but it took a very long time for that to come around. And the conclusion I drew from that was

541
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:43,760
athletes who were heavily involved in glycolytic activity really ought not restrict

542
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:50,480
carbohydrates as much as, say, athletes who are doing things that can be done at a much more

543
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,640
aerobic level. Now, a couple of years ago, you were part of a study that sort of flew in the face of my

544
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,200
assumptions because it was a very short study. It was a four-week study, and it put athletes on a

545
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:09,680
very low carbohydrate diet. They averaged less than 10% and maybe 15% protein. So they were, you know,

546
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,560
if they weren't on a ketogenic diet, they were very close to it, and they were doing high

547
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:21,840
intensity interval training. And you guys didn't find any difference between the groups, suggesting

548
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,360
that this amount of carbohydrate restriction did not impair performance. What can you say about

549
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:33,280
that study? It was a good study. Part of it, actually, we published a separate paper on it,

550
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:40,800
showing that the high fat diet did not have any adverse effect on inflammation. But that study

551
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:48,400
really came from this idea that athletes can still burn high amounts of fat when they do interval

552
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:55,600
training. Paul Larson did, you know, that's how I met Paul. They did a study some time ago. They

553
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:01,680
showed that high intensity training can still produce large amounts of, relatively speaking,

554
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,120
fat burning, as opposed to, you know, burning 100% carbohydrate, like you were mentioning

555
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:13,440
earlier. I sent him an email and I said, yeah, well, I sent him an athlete I had worked on who

556
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,800
we had done some lab studies on. And I don't remember the numbers, but at about a 180 heart rate

557
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:28,480
in this 36 year old athlete, he was burning a lot of fat, relatively speaking. And I said, yeah,

558
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,320
here's an example of what I found clinically. And, you know, and so we've known this for a long

559
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:40,480
time, it's good to see that you're doing this. And he wrote me back and we've been colleagues

560
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,600
ever since. And he was in that study. So it was a study that showed what we already knew clinically

561
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:53,760
in a sense. And we wanted to demonstrate it from a lab standpoint. Do you remember how many

562
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,080
participants were in that study? I want to say 20, but that seems so long ago.

563
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:08,080
Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, it would be interesting to see if with a larger sample size, that is still

564
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:14,560
the case. And obviously, at different levels of the athletes in coming, right? In other words,

565
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:19,440
is that true of recreational athletes only? Is it also true of high level athletes?

566
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:25,360
Yeah, these were students, I think Jeff has done, Jeff Volek has done some studies with the higher

567
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:31,920
level athletes, with some ultra athletes. Again, they're not running as fast, but they're running

568
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:39,920
at a max level. These were students. And these were subjects who the ones who were on the very

569
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:48,160
low carbohydrate diet were only there for a month. And my feeling is we really should have gone

570
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,520
longer. I think we could have seen different results, but they're only there for a month. A

571
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,280
month is long enough for some people, but not long enough for others. And there's a good argument to

572
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,720
make that, you know, it should be two months or even three months to really stabilize that metabolic

573
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:12,480
change, but whatever. It was a good study. And, you know, like other studies, somebody will see it

574
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,360
and say, Hey, this should be done with more people. Just like you said, let's get more numbers. Let's

575
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:23,680
get a wider age group. Let's get beginners athletes, you know, middle of the pack runners,

576
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,880
professional athletes. Professional athletes are really hard to get because they don't want to do

577
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,680
this. They don't want to go into a lab and do that. But from a clinical standpoint, I love all these

578
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:44,080
studies. I love being involved with them. But for me, the bottom line is, can you the athlete run

579
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:51,680
faster at the same submax heart rate? In fact, I don't care what you do with your training or your

580
01:02:51,680 --> 01:03:00,000
diet. If you could run faster at the same heart rate as the months go by, whatever you're doing

581
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,960
is working. Keep doing it. So that MAF test is so powerful that that's really the only thing you have

582
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:16,000
to sell people on. And then when they start seeing that they're not getting faster, or when they see

583
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,840
they've gotten faster, and now they're going to start doing some weight training, fatiguing type

584
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:27,520
weight training, or they're doing some intervals, and then they get slower. You know, now you've got

585
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,880
their attention. Now you say, yeah, see, do you understand what's happening? And, you know, they

586
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,600
start feeling it because they say, well, you know, I felt it wasn't quite right. Or I didn't feel

587
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:46,960
comfortable doing that. So when I first started using a heart monitor, I thought this is interesting.

588
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,200
This is biofeedback, by definition, we're going to listen to or we're going to look at our heart rate,

589
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:59,840
and we're going to respond to what that heart rate does. And the goal is to be able to do that

590
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:06,640
without this heart monitor. So I thought really these heart monitors were just a one use, maybe

591
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:14,800
spend a whole week doing it. Now you know how to run at 130 heart rate. It never happened. Once in

592
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:20,960
a while I see an athlete who knows exactly where they are. They know exactly when they could run

593
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,640
at that max fat burning level. And I've always been amazed by that. And there's some good ones

594
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,960
and some mediocre runners who were able to do that. But most people, we are in a no pain,

595
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:41,040
no gain world. And we're seeing injuries because someone watches the New York City marathon on TV.

596
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:48,240
And the next day they go out and they want to run like that lead pack runner. They want to stride

597
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,760
out like, you know, come on, man, you can't even break four hours in the marathon. No wonder you

598
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,640
got injured. Speaking of the marathon, I want to talk about this book you wrote in 2014, which was

599
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:07,360
just such a brilliant idea. The title of the book is 159, The Sub 2-Hour Marathon is Within Reach.

600
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:13,840
Here's how it will go down and what it can teach all runners about training and racing. And of

601
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:22,960
course, five years later in October of 2019, Kip Chogge goes and runs 159.40. Now we can explain

602
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,680
to people who care about the nuance that it was not technically a sub two in a world record pace.

603
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:33,440
It was sort of a contrived example of what could be done under the most optimal conditions. It was

604
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:41,600
not a race, but there's simply no denying that what Kip Chogge did was unbelievable. He had tried

605
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:50,160
a year earlier and I believe came very close, was probably two double oh, I don't know, 40 seconds

606
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:57,040
or something. Yeah, yeah. He was pretty close. He was under two oh one. So let's put aside the

607
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,720
technicality of how this wasn't a world record in the typical sense of how world records are

608
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:10,960
running marathons, but instead just focus on what you thought needed to happen in 2014,

609
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,120
why you thought this was achievable and maybe what we learned from Kip Chogge. Well, I had

610
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:26,480
originally written an article called the 159 marathon back in the 90s. It was half, I wouldn't

611
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:34,320
say that it was a kind of a joke, but it was half goof, but half serious because the lead pack runners

612
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:40,320
were running faster and faster. World records were being broken all the time. There was no

613
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,240
evidence that said this is going to stop. We're going to hit a plateau and we're not going to

614
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,840
get any faster. There were people who thought that. I don't know where they got those ideas from,

615
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:58,000
but we started seeing the fact that age group runners were not getting faster and I thought

616
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,880
that was interesting. And when you start putting numbers together, such as what if you wore a

617
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:14,960
lighter shoe or what if you were three pounds lighter or what if you were shorter or what if

618
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:21,600
your body type was this and of course what if you were a better fat burner, how much more energy

619
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:29,520
would you have? And then again, the next obvious step is, well, what does your MAF test need to be

620
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:38,560
to run under two hours? And I was getting some runners who were starting to hit

621
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:49,760
five minute pace for their MAF test. They're running five minutes a mile at their MAF heart rate.

622
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:56,080
And so I thought there's no indication that they're reaching a limit, that they're hitting a plateau

623
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:04,080
in performance. So why couldn't it keep going? And that's really where the idea went and it turned

624
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:11,440
into a book. And I'm not sure it was a book that sold very well. I think in the 90s when I wrote

625
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:18,960
that article, a lot of people just asked me why I even wrote it. This is silly. We're not going to

626
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:29,680
see a 159 marathon in our lifetime. And I said, well, how long do you plan on living? So I think

627
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:36,000
what this runner did was amazing. I don't like what he did. I don't like the whole idea behind it.

628
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:42,400
I still know that a runner is going to do it in Berlin or London on the right day.

629
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,360
And it's relatively soon it's going to happen. And I'll be much happier to see that.

630
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:53,200
And you're just saying you're not happy with the way it was done because of the sort of contrived

631
01:08:53,680 --> 01:09:00,000
nature of it. Yeah, it was an advertisement. I'm not opposed to advertising, but it was

632
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:07,600
more like a circus. And I think it took away from professional running as a sport.

633
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,440
That's what I didn't like about it. Yeah, it was a Nike commercial for sure.

634
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:23,920
Do we know much about Kipchoge's nutrition or other factors that we could extrapolate from?

635
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:31,360
For example, in a two hour race, even at the level he's exerting himself, he technically

636
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,960
doesn't really need calories. Fluids should be enough. Do we know if he actually consumed

637
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,880
glucose during that race? I'm not aware of what he consumed, if anything.

638
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,080
If properly trained, obviously he was burning a lot of fat. If properly trained, he wouldn't

639
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:55,200
have needed any added nutrition, maybe not even water. Water is this interesting thing

640
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:03,440
because it has a lot of weight. And if you dehydrate a small amount, the time factor is

641
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:09,680
significant enough where you're running faster. There's this window, and I don't know if it's

642
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:18,560
2% dehydration from a weight standpoint or what it might be. You have this game of dehydrating,

643
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,480
but not impairing performance. And as a result, you're getting lighter, and so you're going to

644
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,320
be able to run faster. It's all about performance. If you can prevent impairment of performance,

645
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,280
that's where you want to be. But I don't have information. My impression with the

646
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,880
the Kenyans, with the East Africans, is that if you look back in history, we've got all these

647
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:51,360
areas of the world that have taken their place on the world stage of great runners.

648
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,360
And now it's the Kenyans. The question is, number one, who's going to be next?

649
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,080
Because somebody else will be next. But the real question is, why have all these countries come and

650
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:12,880
gone? And my feeling is that in Kenya, you know, it's a very poor country. These young men and

651
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,440
women have an opportunity to become kings in their own country with the money they make on racing.

652
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:29,040
And they go from race to race, and they race all the time, and they burn out. And it's really sad.

653
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,360
But I think that's what's happened. And the ones I've met along the way at, you know, at the races

654
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:42,320
and at different events, a lot of them are burned out. But they're going to make as much as they can

655
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,800
make as a job. And that's it. Imagine being able to take one of those athletes and train them,

656
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:54,720
I'd want to say properly, but train them more effectively. I think you'd have a two hour

657
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:01,200
marathon broken already in a real race. When you look at somebody like Kip Choggy or guys at this

658
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:07,520
top level, though, there is a longevity to them, which is they're, you know, spoken with really

659
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,400
world class marathoners. And many of them will sort of acknowledge they might only have a dozen

660
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:18,160
marathons in them, you know, in their entire career, where they're going to really be able to run at a

661
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:24,240
certain level. And that's, you know, that says, look, I might only have 12 marathons over 15 years

662
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:30,560
in me that are truly world class performances. And that's that's sort of a different philosophy

663
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,680
than the churn and burn philosophy. Like look at Meb when he won the Boston Marathon. I mean, he was

664
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:42,480
what, 39? How old was Kip Choggy when he went under two? I mean, he was in his mid 30s, wasn't he?

665
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:47,120
Yeah, and that's what that's what I you know, in the book, I wrote this, this is the makeup of a

666
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:53,040
159 marathon or someone who's in their 30s, not someone who's in their 20s, not somebody who could

667
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,360
run a great 10k. They had almost had to have run a great 10k when they were younger. But now that

668
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:05,680
they're 35, and they they've built this great endurance base. Now they've got the best of

669
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:12,640
everything. And so yeah, I my feeling is that you're you're in your mid to late 30s and maybe

670
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:18,960
even 40s. Man, I've just I've worked with some incredible 40 year olds who have won some races

671
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:25,680
and you know, history has shown these people and people are, you know, often say, well, these are

672
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,920
amazing people. They're outliers. I don't think they're outliers. I think it's I think it's the

673
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:37,200
norm. So I want to talk a little bit about a term that you were you've used it a couple times today.

674
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:41,680
And I've heard you, you know, or seen you write about it before, which is you don't like the term

675
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:50,240
overweight. You like the term over fat. You're very clear to talk about it's adipose tissue,

676
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:56,000
we should be concerned with not mass. How do you think about that in the overall context of health,

677
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,040
you know, we we tend to focus on weight. You know, if we get one more layer sophisticated,

678
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,960
we look at body mass index, which of course is a highly flawed metric. But where do you see the

679
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:13,600
trends in fatness? And how does that factor into maybe what you said earlier, which is

680
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:20,240
at the level of recreational athletes, we're not really seeing much improvement in performance.

681
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:28,080
Are those related? I think they're related in terms of the diminishing performance of age group

682
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:35,520
athletes. The problem clearly the over fat condition can typically add weight to the body.

683
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,920
So that's going to affect running performance. But more significantly, those people with excess body

684
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:49,440
fat have some downstream problems that can be very serious. We're talking about chronic disease.

685
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:57,280
So along the way to chronic disease, you have blood fat abnormalities, blood sugar abnormalities,

686
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,760
blood pressure abnormalities. And these things then lead to chronic diseases. So of course,

687
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:10,080
in that situation, people are not going to be performing their best. Over fat, excess body fat

688
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:17,760
also impairs the immune system. So people tend to get sick more often. And Paul Larson and I wrote

689
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:26,320
a paper on this regarding COVID early on in the spring, actually. And people with excess body fat

690
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:33,840
also have physical impairment problems more frequently. And so we're talking about the

691
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:40,160
basic simple injury that plantar fasciitis and also pain patterns, although back pain

692
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:47,520
on the less serious all the way to the arthrititis that are affecting runners. But again,

693
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,440
in an injured athlete, you're not going to perform your best. So these things are going to,

694
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:01,200
over the years, show diminishing performance in age groupers. And it's, number one, that's really

695
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:08,320
sad to see. Number two, it's even more sad to not be acknowledged. I just don't see people talking

696
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,880
about this. I don't understand why. I think people are starting to acknowledge that it always takes

697
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,960
longer. I guess someone like you who's sort of been clinically at the forefront of a lot of these

698
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:27,840
things, it seems like what's taking so long because you're seeing these things many years before.

699
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:35,280
But for example, sugar consumption is actually declining. But it sometimes takes a while for

700
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,560
this decline to necessarily translate into some of the health benefits. And furthermore,

701
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,160
these things are so multifaceted, right? I think that I don't actually know the data on this,

702
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,080
so I'm kind of making this up. But I would guess that you can sometimes see an improvement in one

703
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,800
parameter and a deterioration in others. For example, activity levels might be declining even

704
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,960
while certain elements of nutrition improve. And so the net effect of that could be a reduction or

705
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,760
something we didn't talk about, sleep, quality of sleep could be declining. And that can sort of

706
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:13,760
offset any benefit that we see. But this idea that health and performance are not necessarily

707
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:20,000
the same thing is something I see a lot of people struggle with it, right? I see a lot of people who

708
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:28,640
are not very healthy believe that the key to getting healthier is to train for a marathon

709
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:36,320
or train for an Ironman or train for this bike race or train for this event. And it usually puts

710
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,240
me in a bit of an awkward position because on the one hand, I'm so grateful that they have found

711
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:45,440
something to do to be active and to train for. And I don't want to discourage that. But I also

712
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:52,000
want them to understand that there's nothing especially healthy about doing an Ironman and

713
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,440
that one doesn't need to do that to be healthy. So do you have a message for folks around that?

714
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,320
Well, I have a lot of messages for them around that. But the main one is that they don't have

715
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:07,680
to do it just like you said. And in fact, all they have to do is start walking around the block.

716
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:16,480
And the benefits, the fat burning benefits that they'll get from that are huge, but also

717
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,440
that the food is more important. And so they need to look at the big picture. And of course,

718
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:29,920
they need to look at stress also. But the food is such a such a key factor in all of this. And

719
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:36,800
going back to the question you asked me, what is MAF, maximum aerobic function? How can we maximize

720
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:45,120
our aerobic system? Well, two of the components of lifestyle are food and exercise. And sure,

721
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,480
stress, stress is a very important factor. And yeah, you can't smoke cigarettes and drink too

722
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:57,680
much alcohol. But food and exercise are keys. And it's really, really simple. Just don't eat junk

723
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:03,440
food and take it easy out there. Well, Phil, on that note, I think we've given folks a lot

724
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,920
to think about today. And I want to thank you for your time. You're going to be ready for dinner

725
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:15,760
soon, which it sounds like you skip anyway, right? Yeah, I'm here when they will be starting to eat

726
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,800
dinner soon. I'll be watching, which is okay, because I'm not hungry. But thank you, Peter.

727
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,080
I enjoy your work. I have for quite some time. And thanks for having me on. It's been great.

728
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:33,600

to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

740
