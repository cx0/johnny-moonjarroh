00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
Hey, David, thank you so much for making time in your evening, my afternoon here today.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
Very much looking forward to speaking with you about a topic that I think is on a lot

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
of people's minds lately.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,920
Well, thanks for the invite.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm looking forward to it too.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,840
Let's start a little bit with your background.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,520
It sounds like based on what I've read, going back to your early teen years, you've always

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,080
had an interest in the brain, whether it be through the lens of neuroscience or psychiatry.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
What do you think sparked that interest?

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, thinking about things.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,320
Yeah, I guess it was understanding that, I don't know, I think when I was probably four

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,360
or five, I suddenly kind of realized that actually thinking was what actually made things

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
make sense.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,840
And then I realized that thinking came out of the brain and I've always been fascinated

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
by the brain.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,000
And actually I went to university, to Cambridge to do brain science.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,080
I wanted to be a physiologist, like Hodgkin and Huxley to do physiology.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,080
And then I kind of realized actually that that was, single cells are interesting, but

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,240
you've got to put the 200 billion together and make sense of those.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
And actually that's where, then I did neurology and that got a little bit boring because it's

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,480
mostly people kind of dying slowly from diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,440
So then I moved to psychiatry and then it became really wonderful because you see every

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,200
aspect of the brain in psychiatry.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,920
Well, it's so funny you say that because I'm not making this up, but this morning, my six

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,280
year old son was in my office and we were sort of fumbling around and I have a whole

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,240
bunch of racing helmets in my office.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,720
And so he's putting them on and that got him talking about why we're wearing helmets to

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
protect the brain and blah, blah, blah.

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,960
And then I said, well, you want to see what, well, he said, what does a brain look like?

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,000
So I pulled up, you know, on Google, I pulled up some images of brains, but actual anatomic

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
images.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And again, he's only six, but he's looking at this and he's thinking like that's very

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
unimpressive.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,440
And he sort of says, it just looks like a slimy thing.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,760
And I said, yep, that's true.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
That's what it looks like.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,920
And he says, but is this where my thoughts come from?

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,600
And I said, yes, that's where your thoughts are rich.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,880
And he said, well, how?

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,880
And I got to tell you, it was very difficult for me to explain how electrical impulses

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
work.

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,080
And of course, I'm not going to get into action potentials and neurotransmitters.

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,360
But what's funny is it then took me down a rabbit hole of spending 30 minutes on YouTube

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,680
trying to find good videos of this for kids.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,720
And if anybody can find one, please send it.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,000
But I couldn't find great videos because the videos that I found were more anatomic, like

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,480
this is the part of your brain that controls movement.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,600
This is where memories are stored.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,200
But he was asking a deeper question, which was how does this blob make me think?

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Which it sounds like you were asking that same question as a four or five year old.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Exactly.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,520
But what's amusing, even more amusing is my new book, which is coming out later this year,

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,000
is called Brain and Mind made simple.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,160
It won't be simple enough for a six year old, unless he's very precocious.

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,280
But I have written a book for the general public to try to explain that peculiar phenomenon,

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,000
how lots and lots of single nerves can actually turn into all the complexity of the different

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,160
forms of consciousness and the different experiences that humans have.

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,120
And at some point, and I think the point you raised is a really good one, it'd be really

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:44,040
nice to then migrate that down for children, maybe as a series of sort of comics or graphics.

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,760
I mean, it is the most wonderful thing in the universe, the human brain, there's no argument

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
about it.

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,880
So let's get communicating as soon as we can.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Yeah.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,760
And I do think that, like for me personally, it's not a question I ever contemplated early.

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,080
So it made me very happy that he was asking this question at the age of six in a deep

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,480
enough way.

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,240
And look, even if the book is not written for a six year old, I'm sure it will help

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,040
me do a better job explaining it to a six year old.

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,640
So coming back to your career, so now you've migrated into psychiatry, which of course,

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,520
on some levels is really about understanding pathology of the mind, which is effectively

71
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,440
what all parts of medicine are, whether it be neurology or otherwise.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,000
What were some of the first things that stuck out to you about the pathology of the mind

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,480
through the lens of a psychiatrist?

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Well the first patient I saw who I was dropped into, there was a doctor who didn't turn up,

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm a medical student.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,480
So I said, oh, please go and interview, go and Clark this new patient.

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,720
So I'm sitting there and talking to this person who's not making any sense whatsoever and

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,320
kept talking about there being a smell of fish in the room and rambling on about the

79
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
smell.

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,400
And after about an hour of trying to get some sense, I say, well, thank you.

81
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I'll just have to go.

82
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I'll be back in a minute.

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,640
And I go out and I talk to the consultant and he says, oh, wow, he's clearly psychotic.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,880
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
That's why he doesn't make sense.

86
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,200
And that's why I didn't understand what was going on.

87
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,280
So what was very interesting about that is that the relationship between temporal lobe

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,040
disorders, those parts of the brain, which are intimately involved in aspects of consciousness

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
and also smell.

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,800
And there was this peculiar overlap between temporal lobe disorders where you can be

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,600
psychotic, but you also have these olfactory hallucinations.

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And that's what he had.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,200
So he was hallucinating rather than in his ears, which most people with schizophrenia

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
do.

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,040
He was hallucinating in terms of smell.

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,400
So yeah, I've never forgotten that because it was just such a kind of completely bizarre

97
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,840
experience and it made me realize I got a lot to learn.

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,520
Now for most people, when they go into psychiatry, and I'm sure this was the case with you, you

99
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,800
spend a lot of time learning the neuropharmacology of the agents that are going to be used to

100
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,200
help treat patients with psychiatric illness.

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,160
And for many people, that's sort of where it stops.

102
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
But you've also generated or developed this other interest, which is in the neuropharmacology

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,000
of these regulated substances, you know, call them illegal or recreational drugs and otherwise.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
Where did that interest stem from?

105
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Wow.

106
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,800
Well, so yes, I am a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London.

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Neuropsychopharmacology is really the use of drugs to study the brain and to study the

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,280
effects of treatments for brain disorders, particularly in the case of psychiatry, psychotropic

109
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,480
drugs.

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,480
My PhD was on the GABA system, on drugs manipulating the GABA system.

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,720
As an undergraduate, I think, you know, the big influence on me, I was extraordinarily

112
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
fortunate.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,920
I'm at university in Cambridge in the early 1970s when people are discovering that the

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,040
brain is a chemical organ.

115
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Up to that point, it was thought the brain was an electrical organ.

116
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,000
It was like a very complicated computer or, you know, like some kind of complex telephone

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
exchange.

118
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,920
But then the concept of chemical transmission came along.

119
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,600
And now we know that there are at least 80 different chemicals, neurotransmitters, hormones,

120
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
neurohormones.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,680
And seeing that transformation from electricity to chemistry made me realise, you know, the

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,880
way you study the brain now is through drugs which affect the chemistry of the brain.

123
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,960
And then there are these therapeutic agents which are obviously very important, antidepressants,

124
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,000
antipsychotics, anticonvulsants.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,800
But then it raises the next question, you know, but people use other drugs to change

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,080
the brain.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,320
And they use them recreationally for, you know, like drugs like cocaine or crystal meth,

128
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,160
or they use them to deaden pain or to get insights like psychedelics.

129
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,680
And after a while, because I've done so much research on drugs, I was asked by the British

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,520
government to help them think through drug policy.

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, actually, that was not true.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,320
They asked me to help them justify drug policy.

133
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,480
But when I started working for them, I realised that the drug policy wasn't in any way evidence

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
based.

135
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,520
And when I tried to bring evidence to bear on drug policy, they sacked me because it's

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,560
much more convenient to have a political decision making about drugs than it is to have an evidence

137
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,640
based one.

138
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,040
What year was that that you got involved in that?

139
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,600
Well, I started working on the principles of assessing drug harms really back in the

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
1990s.

141
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,840
And it actually came with the rise of ecstasy and people supposedly were seemingly getting

142
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
harm from ecstasy.

143
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:57,120
And I was one of the experts who was asked by the government to come up with a policy

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,360
which would reduce the harms from ecstasy.

145
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,480
And it became very clear when we were researching those that the harms of ecstasy aren't from

146
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,360
the drug at all.

147
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,920
They're actually from the what you do when you're on the drug.

148
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,880
They're either from the fact you dehydrate because you dance all night or you get hypothermic

149
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,280
because you're in an environment where you can't cool down.

150
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,640
And so we said and actually we brought in what in legislation in Britain which said

151
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,720
any club which is serving drinks, which is where most people were going to have their

152
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,040
ecstasy, they're going to clubs, they must serve free water.

153
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Because what the clubs were doing were actually forcing people to drink alcohol or pay for

154
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,320
water in order to get hydrated after using ecstasy.

155
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,200
And in fact, they were doing worse.

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,360
They were turning off the taps in the they were even turning off the toilet so people

157
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
couldn't drink water.

158
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,960
So we've made it law that people had to get access to water.

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,360
And we also recommended a good policy would be to have chill out rooms.

160
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
And of course, a lot of clubs do have chill out rooms.

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,960
And those just those two simple environmental approaches effectively, you know, the very,

162
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,840
very few deaths from ecstasy since then until we got to the modern day when a variety of

163
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,320
international policies have now made ecstasy considerably more harmful than it used to

164
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
be.

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,960
How much did this coincide with or following lockstep with drug policy in that it states

166
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,160
which really seemed to get a get a real boost in the arm in the early 80s?

167
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,000
Was the UK leading or following?

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,720
Oh, every country in the world follows you.

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,640
The United Nations United Nations is probably still is paid for by the US.

170
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,280
And it does what the US tells them.

171
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,800
Every single British drug law until 2016 was made at the behest of the Americans.

172
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,760
So you know, America basically, you know, you know, they say America sneezes, the world

173
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,960
catches cold.

174
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,160
America defined drug policy.

175
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,120
It started in 1934 with the the attack on you know, the liberalization of drinking and

176
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,760
the attack on cannabis.

177
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
And it continued.

178
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,220
And I mean, of course, the big inflection was when Nixon decided that the war on drugs

179
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,780
was actually a better vote getter than the war in Vietnam.

180
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,260
So he switched people's attention to drugs.

181
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,060
And the world has been fighting a war on drugs, largely funded, but certainly politically

182
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,740
driven by America since then.

183
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,380
So let's talk a little bit about the framework through which one can think about drugs.

184
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,820
I'm a framework junkie.

185
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,780
Everything I think about whether it's, you know, how to order dinner comes down to sort

186
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,620
of a framework.

187
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,700
So you know, some parameters that people might think of, right, you know, how harmful

188
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
is this?

189
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,820
And again, you know, I think the goal of frameworks is to have them be as unemotional as possible

190
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,180
and to have them whenever possible to be objective.

191
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,720
So how harmful is something would be part of it.

192
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,820
How addictive is something?

193
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,620
What's the physiologic dependence?

194
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,140
And then even within harm, you could sort of talk about the harm to the individual and

195
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,620
then the harm to society as that individual acts.

196
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Are there any other things you would include or do those three things largely encompass

197
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,260
what you think of as a good way to think about molecules?

198
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,740
Well, that's yeah, that's that is quite a succinct way.

199
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,660
So I started off with something somewhat similar to that.

200
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,620
But more recently, we've developed what's called multi criteria decision analysis.

201
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,340
And it turns out that there are 16 different ways in which drugs can do harm.

202
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,820
There are nine harms to the user.

203
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,060
And there are seven harms to society.

204
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,820
And the societal harms range from international damage, you know, like the US spraying Agent

205
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,780
Orange in, you know, in Colombia to kill to kill cocoa plants through to economic damage,

206
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,140
through to health costs, through to damage the families, etc.

207
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,780
So there are seven harms to society, and nine harms to the user.

208
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:04,620
And each of those can you can scale drugs on each of those, those 16 scales of parameters

209
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,740
of harm.

210
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,460
And if you do all that and put it all together, and then do a waiting, because obviously,

211
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,500
not every single one of those scales is equally important.

212
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:21,820
If you do all that, then you can actually very, very transparently and very reliably

213
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,420
rate the harms of different drugs.

214
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,700
And we've used this procedure in Britain, we've used it in Europe, and most recently

215
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,300
in Australia, and pretty much all the drugs always ranked the same in all those, you know,

216
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,260
there's three sort of groups of Western jurisdictions.

217
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,300
So based on that type of a framework, what are the drugs that consistently come to the

218
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,940
top of the list in terms of harm, aggregate harm?

219
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,220
So the most harmful drug overall in all in Europe, in Britain, in Australia is alcohol.

220
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,900
And alcohol is the most harmful drug, because it has way more social impact, more harms

221
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,660
to others than any other drug.

222
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,620
And that, of course, is because it's much more widely used.

223
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,180
You know, 80% of American adults, British adults drink alcohol, pretty much every family

224
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,340
in your country, in my country, know someone that's been harmed by alcohol, either through

225
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,840
themselves, getting a difficulties having accidents getting addicted, or they've been

226
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,960
harmed by other ones, someone who's drunk, a drunk driver, or someone who's drunk and

227
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
violent.

228
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,600
But if you look at the harm to the user, alcohol is not number one, alcohol is about number

229
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:37,520
four, the drugs that are really harmful to the user are opiates, crack cocaine, and also

230
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,600
crystal meth.

231
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
So that's super interesting, right?

232
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,200
Because those drugs have very different scheduling, right?

233
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,000
So heroin would be a Schedule I drug, correct?

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Cocaine would be a Schedule II drug.

235
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,120
I guess crystal meth would be Schedule I, or would it be Schedule II in the US?

236
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,680
I'm not sure in the, in Britain it's one, but I think I'm not sure in the US to be

237
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
honest.

238
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,460
And then of course, alcohol is not even scheduled in that sense, it's regulated only by the

239
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,560
age at which you can legally consume it.

240
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,600
And also by taxation.

241
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,480
Right.

242
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,360
So what we didn't talk about was tobacco.

243
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,080
Does tobacco fit into this framework?

244
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Yeah, tobacco, yeah.

245
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,840
We always do tobacco because tobacco is, this is an interesting paradox.

246
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,720
When we first did this, tobacco came out at about number six or seventh, and the tobacco,

247
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,400
anti-tobacco brigade got really agitated.

248
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,960
They say it is the most harmful drug because it kills more people.

249
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,400
And we said, yeah, but that's right.

250
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,320
It kills more people, but they often die in their fifties and sixties.

251
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,280
Alcohol is killing people in their twenties.

252
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
And that's more important, we think.

253
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,760
Our valuation was that the harms of alcohol is considerably greater than the harms of

254
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,360
tobacco.

255
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,600
And I think most people would agree that, you know, tobacco does in the end kill half

256
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,440
of the people who smoke, but it does it later in life.

257
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,760
And it doesn't, tobacco also causes relatively little damage to other people, unlike alcohol.

258
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,360
This is such an interesting question, and I don't even know how one would think about

259
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,920
it because you could also take the flip side, which is there's probably nobody who's benefited

260
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
from tobacco.

261
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,320
I shouldn't say that.

262
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,320
There is a benefit to tobacco, which is that probably it helps some people calm down.

263
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,800
It probably helps cope with nerves.

264
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
But there's no moderate use of tobacco.

265
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Like smoking only 10 cigarettes a day is protective, or the harm doesn't really kick in until you're

266
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
at a pack a day.

267
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,040
No, that's not really true.

268
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,520
Any amount of tobacco is going to take some toll on your pulmonary system and your cardiovascular

269
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,200
system.

270
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,080
Alcohol conversely, you could say, well, look, a person who drinks responsibly, who has,

271
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:52,160
you know, three drinks a week, bears no cost of the consumption of alcohol from a relative

272
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
standpoint.

273
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I mean, we could debate that.

274
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,960
I would argue that there's no dose of alcohol that's healthy, but there are probably doses

275
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,720
that don't rise to the level of toxicity.

276
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,840
Yet to your point, it's much easier to cross the line into acute toxicity, which also gets

277
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,560
to another challenge here.

278
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,320
Tobacco has no acute toxicity.

279
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,600
It's 100% chronic toxicity.

280
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,480
Alcohol has both acute toxicity and chronic toxicity, and it's that acute toxicity that

281
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,440
results in incredible loss of life, both to the individual and to society.

282
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,600
Does the framework allow you to measure these things?

283
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
Yes, it does.

284
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,880
We can give you absolute ratings and rankings on both of those variables, acute toxicity

285
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,360
versus chronic toxicity.

286
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,080
And of course, you know, the drugs which really do badly on both of the opiates, which could

287
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,200
kill you instantly when you take them, but also gradually, quite quickly over time as

288
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,360
well.

289
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,480
But there is another angle, and that's, I think, an important angle which our analysis

290
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,840
doesn't bring in because it's difficult and challenging.

291
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
And I'd love to.

292
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,480
And, you know, maybe at some point we can do this.

293
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
And that's the benefits.

294
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,440
You pointed out quite clearly that generally tobacco doesn't bring many benefits.

295
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,720
Nicotine is a funny drug, though.

296
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,240
It's the only drug we know of that both calms people but also improves attention.

297
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,480
And so there are people who smoke, you know, generally, although they're addicted, they

298
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,280
do get a benefit, at least when the nicotine's in the brain.

299
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,080
But alcohol has a much broader kind of social.

300
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,960
Alcohol is one of the most social drugs.

301
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,720
I mean, after ecstasy, it probably is the most social drug.

302
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,280
And that's why people use it.

303
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,640
So there are unquestionably psychological or social benefits from alcohol.

304
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,880
And that goes back for sin.

305
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
Well, that goes back to pre-Christian times.

306
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
millennia.

307
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Yeah, that's right.

308
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,240
You know, you've got, you know, Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Canine.

309
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Why?

310
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,280
Because wine was what the Jews used to celebrate weddings.

311
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,080
And it's been used ever since.

312
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
We all use it.

313
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
We still use it today to celebrate.

314
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,800
So alcohol has a very powerful pro-social effect, which I think is why it's so widely

315
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,000
used and why it's been, apart from that little aberration of American prohibition, why it's

316
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,600
actually been stable in our society for many millennia.

317
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:17,040
And do you think that that's the fundamental reason why despite the sort of, I mean, hypocrisy

318
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,640
of it, if we're going to be blunt, we would make something like cannabis illegal while

319
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,960
having something like alcohol be legal.

320
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,080
Is it, does it basically come down to our social dependence on alcohol?

321
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Now, that's a great question.

322
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,920
And I think, and it's a very interesting, I haven't thought about those two in that

323
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,320
context before, but I think that's a very interesting point you make because cannabis

324
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,760
is not a particularly social drug.

325
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,520
So people, when they get stoned, they tend to be quieter.

326
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,280
They're not, it's not the party drug cannabis, is it?

327
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
And it might, you might be right.

328
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,200
It might be that people are less positive towards cannabis because it isn't so socially

329
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,120
enabling as, as alcohol.

330
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,880
That's a very interesting point.

331
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,200
I take a different view up till now, until you said that I've taken a different viewpoint,

332
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,520
which is that people have been very anti-cannabis because the alcohol industry and the Drug

333
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,040
Enforcement Agency have seen cannabis as the enemy and the disinformation that's been

334
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,320
produced, you know, the hatred of cannabis, which started with Harry Anslinger trying

335
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,280
to keep the DEA functioning after alcohol prohibition was disbanded.

336
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,680
You know, that a hundred years almost, why 90 years of disinformation has actually poisoned

337
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,960
a lot of people's minds to cannabis.

338
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,040
So cannabis has been vilified and alcohol has been celebrated.

339
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,840
I mean, it's been celebrated throughout history in terms of art and culture and music and

340
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
television.

341
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,640
You know, one of the staggering things, because of lockdown, I've been watching a lot of Netflix

342
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,520
and I've been seeing these disclaimers at the top saying, this program contains product

343
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,840
placement by which they mean usually this program shows people drinking an awful lot

344
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
of wine.

345
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,560
Yeah, we've come a long way.

346
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,680
It's an interesting point you raise.

347
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:24,160
I guess I hadn't thought of it, that part of the DEA needs a reason to exist and therefore

348
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,200
you need boogeymen, right?

349
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,400
If your business is smashing boogeymen, you need boogeymen.

350
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,440
Don't we have enough boogeymen with other drugs like heroin or methamphetamine or cocaine?

351
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,120
I guess I'm confused as to, and I don't want to, this is not going to be a discussion about

352
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,440
the legalization of cannabis because it seems to me that that train has left the station.

353
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm just amazed that there was such a lack of study because I'll tell you where it's

354
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,360
frustrating for me as an outsider.

355
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,200
I have a lot of questions.

356
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,040
My patients ask me questions such as if my 16 year old son is smoking pot, is that going

357
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,600
to have a negative consequence on his or her brain development?

358
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,960
I wish I could answer that question, but I can't really point to rigorous studies one

359
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,680
way or the other.

360
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,600
To me, that's a failure of not having studied this drug the way we should have been studying

361
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,320
it for the past hundred years because you want to talk about a drug that probably has

362
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,960
lots of benefits but also potentially harms.

363
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,160
Cannabis would be a case study in that.

364
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,720
I find it very frustrating as someone who prides himself in caring about data and trying

365
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,360
to not have an emotional discussion about something that I don't have answers to those

366
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,720
questions and it seems like a real missed opportunity.

367
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,240
Well it's worse than that.

368
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,720
The reason that the studies have not been done is because almost all the funding for

369
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,320
that kind of research in America comes through the government, through NIDA.

370
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,240
NIDA has not been funded to study the benefits of cannabis.

371
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,160
Even when, and this is the real missed opportunity, even when California voted to make medical

372
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,960
cannabis legal, what an opportunity.

373
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,920
We know 20 million people using it.

374
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,080
You could have within a couple of years worked out its utility and its harms, but the federal

375
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,240
law because cannabis was illegal under federal law and it still is, they could not fund research.

376
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:34,000
It's one of the many examples of the perverse negative consequences of this prohibition

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,280
approach to drugs.

378
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,200
Let's talk about a few other drugs that we haven't mentioned.

379
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,080
We've talked about basically things that are not particularly harmful.

380
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,920
We've certainly talked about things that rise to the level of harm.

381
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:52,760
Where do the classic psychedelics, LSD, psilocybin fit in along with some of their more distant

382
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,880
cousins, Ayahuasca, DMT, 5MeO, DMT.

383
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,920
Of course, we've talked around it, but we haven't explicitly asked where does MDMA fit

384
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,240
on this list of harm in the aggregate sense according to this sophisticated model.

385
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,640
That's why I started off talking about MDMA because that was my first introduction to

386
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,160
policy decisions.

387
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,280
When I started working for the government back in 1994, I'd assumed that what they told

388
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,480
me about the harms of drugs was right.

389
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,040
Then I discovered that when I did and my team did the more detailed and sophisticated analysis,

390
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,160
they were completely wrong.

391
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,680
I'd been lied to.

392
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,720
The real paradox of doing this really in-depth multi-criteria decision analysis is it turns

393
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,800
out that the drugs that have been most vilified and which we've been taught are the most dangerous

394
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
turn out to be the least dangerous.

395
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,040
The one end of the most harmful drug is alcohol.

396
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,800
The least harmful drugs are magic mushrooms and LSD and MDMA.

397
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,480
It's almost as if the whole law is completely on its head.

398
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,560
Let's now simplify and talk about only harm to the individual.

399
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,320
Purely physiologic risk to self.

400
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,560
If I heard you correctly earlier, heroin and fentanyl and its cousins occupy the top spot,

401
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
correct?

402
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,720
I aggregate greatest risk of acute and chronic mortality, yes?

403
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Correct.

404
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,360
Then second, you're putting the cocaine derivatives.

405
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,680
Then third would be the amphetamine derivatives.

406
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,880
If we just look harm to the user, yes.

407
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,680
Crystal meth's probably more harmful than crack because it lasts longer in the body

408
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
and the brain.

409
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,720
I would generally, crystal's probably a bit more harmful to the user.

410
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,880
It would be opioids, crystal, crack.

411
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Let's talk a little bit about mechanism of action.

412
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,880
I'm very familiar with how opiates kill, but let's just briefly summarize it.

413
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,760
Is it mostly the respiratory depression?

414
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,040
Is that the fundamental issue in the short term?

415
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Yes.

416
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,200
They kill you in overdose.

417
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
You take just too much.

418
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
You don't know what you're taking.

419
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,800
Someone spiked your heroin, fentanyl, and you stop breathing and you die.

420
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,680
You want to talk about, you mentioned earlier, almost nobody in America doesn't know somebody

421
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,200
whose life has been destroyed by alcohol.

422
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,120
We're getting pretty close to that with opioids.

423
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,760
I mean, I personally know three people.

424
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,120
Is it four?

425
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,480
Maybe four who have lost a child or relative to an opioid overdose.

426
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Think about that.

427
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,400
I don't know that many people, David.

428
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,160
It is terrifying.

429
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,760
I'm sorry to say, guys, but you kind of got it wrong and then you got it wrong again and

430
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,320
you're still getting it wrong.

431
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,200
Shall I just briefly go through that?

432
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Sure.

433
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,120
So the fentanyl crisis is very much an American problem.

434
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,200
It's not just because there's obviously a lot of you.

435
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,880
The more people there are, the more likely it is that people will die.

436
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,240
But it's a disproportionate number of deaths.

437
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,080
So now I think last year more people died of opioid overdose and died in the whole of

438
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
the Vietnam War.

439
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Yeah.

440
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:22,000
And last year we set here in the United States a record for the most overdose deaths ever.

441
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,160
So it wasn't just the year of the most deaths due to COVID, but the real record, the story

442
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,920
behind the story is the most overdoses.

443
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,520
And the answers are complicated and it's like a perfect storm of things going wrong.

444
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:46,240
The first perfect storm is the excessive rollout of strong morphine derivative painkillers,

445
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,280
which were heavily promoted by some pharmaceutical companies and you all know they've been sued,

446
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
et cetera.

447
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,080
So I think the doctors also, some doctors were to blame.

448
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,640
I mean, some were clearly overprescribing, but there's also the problem that chronic

449
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,960
pain is very common.

450
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,880
Perhaps a quarter of the country have chronic pain.

451
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,360
And doctors are faced with no treatment, no physiotherapy, no occupation.

452
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
All they had was prescription pad.

453
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,800
Then they tended to veer towards prescribing opiates, which are not good for chronic pain.

454
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,880
And it's interesting also, you see the states which had the highest prescription levels

455
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,760
of opiates for chronic pain or the ones actually that don't have medical cannabis.

456
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,040
Medical cannabis is the best treatment for chronic pain, better than any other drug.

457
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,840
But if you haven't got that, then you can't have it.

458
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
So that was a horrific thing.

459
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Big increase in prescription, you know, partly driven, you know, driven inappropriately,

460
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,400
partly out of just a concern to help chronic pain.

461
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:51,680
The second thing was then the rise, the dispersion of that into society, you know, parents, kids

462
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,400
were taking it and taking their parents oxycodone and dying.

463
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,600
So you have the crisis, you have the concern, and then you have the reaction.

464
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,280
The reaction then was to stop prescribing.

465
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,800
But when you stop prescribing to someone who is dependent on an opiate, they don't,

466
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,760
unless you provide them with something else like medical cannabis, they are in withdrawal.

467
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,560
And so they go and get an opiate.

468
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,400
And if you're not prescribing it, they go and get it from the black market.

469
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,960
And then you see this complete paradox.

470
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,840
You see this rise of heroin deaths, rise of fentanyl deaths, because that's what the black

471
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,560
market provides.

472
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,200
And then you get into this really, the most damaging cycle, or part of this cycle, is

473
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
the rise of fentanyl.

474
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,600
Because until there was a huge increase in black market demand from the people on oxycodone,

475
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,760
fentanyl wasn't a big issue.

476
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,560
But for various international reasons, the United Nations limiting the access of heroin,

477
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:54,440
the amount of poppies it could be grown in a so-called attempt to prevent heroin misuse.

478
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,880
Fifteen years ago, particularly the Mexican cartels realized if they couldn't make heroin

479
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,840
because they couldn't get enough morphine, then they would make something else.

480
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,160
And they discovered fentanyls.

481
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,800
And fentanyls are so much more potent.

482
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,720
And there's so much more value for money, economic, you know, even the simplest fentanyl,

483
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,220
fentanyl, you know, it's, it's, you know, it's 50 times more potent than heroin and twice

484
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
as cheap to make.

485
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,200
So you don't have to be an economist to realize it's better to do that.

486
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,480
And then you get to the super fentanyl, it's like car fentanyl, which is a thousand times

487
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
more potent.

488
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,680
They're so potent, no one knows how to measure them.

489
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,160
And so you don't know how much you're giving.

490
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,760
So we've, you know, you see, it's a cycle, a series of mistakes, which has actually just

491
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
led to this, this terrible tsunami of deaths.

492
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,520
And, and the only way to deal with it really is to have lots of testing to allow people

493
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,080
to take anything they've got and get it tested so they know what it is, eliminate fentanyls

494
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,600
and start to bring in much safer treatments for people in chronic pain like like medical

495
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
cannabis.

496
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,360
I want to talk a little bit about the opiates before we leave it and come talk about a drug

497
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,320
called Ibogaine, a derivative of Iboga.

498
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,040
You know, I have read quite a bit about it and a lot of it's anecdotal, but it seems

499
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:11,120
that there's something very interesting going on there where you have this alkaloid that

500
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,280
while it comes with its own dangers and it's not clear how over or understated they are

501
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:21,520
relative to cardiac toxicity, it seems to have quite an efficacious punch when it comes

502
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,200
to relieving people from the throes of opioid addiction.

503
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,080
Do you have experience with it, at least scientifically, if not through experimental collaboration?

504
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,400
Well, we're in the process of trying to do a study.

505
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,240
I would dearly love to understand the nearest science of Ibogaine and we're, but it's been

506
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,480
difficult to do that study because of the cardiac risks.

507
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,560
But we're in the process of working with a company that's developing a derivative of

508
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,360
Ibogaine called Nor Ibogaine, which may be less cardiotoxic.

509
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,220
And we're working with them to do some brain imaging to see whether we can, is it a normal

510
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,220
psychedelic or not?

511
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,840
Because no one's ever studied it yet.

512
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,240
The evidence, as you see, it's used widely in some third world countries as a therapy

513
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
for opioid withdrawal.

514
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,000
It's also a licensed medicine, interestingly, in New Zealand, but they've stopped using

515
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,760
New Zealand because of one death.

516
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,880
Now that's probably a bit of an overreaction.

517
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,400
Which strikes me as a little bit odd, right, when you consider...

518
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,560
So based on some of the literature I've read, the risk of a fatal arrhythmia might be one

519
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,520
in a thousand.

520
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,200
And that's, depending on what you're talking about, one in a thousand is an enormous risk.

521
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,000
But if you're weighing it against a person remaining addicted to opioids, what's the

522
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,880
natural history of that?

523
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,960
That might be 300 out of a thousand.

524
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,320
Yes, about that.

525
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,760
Yeah, so do you have a sense of what the true risk of Ibogaine use is?

526
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,400
And how much of that risk could be mitigated if it were administered in a proper setting,

527
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,200
which would be a setting with cardiac monitoring, for example, versus someone's house?

528
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Well, one thing's for sure, we're going to administer cardiac monitoring.

529
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Yeah, of course.

530
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah, exactly.

531
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,400
And there are plenty of other drugs which do have cardiac effects.

532
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,720
Usually they're used by cardiologists.

533
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,960
So the answer, you're right.

534
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:27,080
I mean, that's why I want to study it, because if we could get more clarity on its mechanism,

535
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,040
that I think would at least then reassure people there was a science behind it.

536
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,280
Because currently it's, well, you go to West Africa, or you go to Vietnam, and you get Ibogaine,

537
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,280
and your brain is shaken up, and you come back cured.

538
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,560
And I think we could probably improve on that.

539
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,960
I think there's also your point you make that doing in a hospital setting, I think makes more sense,

540
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,440
because not just for safety, but also because I'm not sure it should be given during withdrawal.

541
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,280
That's when it is being given.

542
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,240
And I think withdrawal just, we have, you know, there are other treatments which we have given

543
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,480
for opiate users, which have also been toxic in withdrawal.

544
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,680
You know, people, you know, withdrawal is a serious medical problem.

545
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,520
So you know, you know, they're ill, they're physically struggling.

546
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,640
So I think adding a burden to someone who's in withdrawal is not a sensible idea.

547
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,680
To my thinking is that if we can restore a sensible balance with Ibogaine,

548
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,880
we could potentially use it.

549
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,680
But also, I'm very interested in using other psychedelics,

550
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,880
as I think the fundamental principle is likely to be the same between Ibogaine or psilocybin

551
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,560
or DMT in addictions.

552
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,720
You're disrupting these over-learns, these persistent patterns of over-attention

553
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,360
and over increased, you know, enhanced love for drugs.

554
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,600
You can perhaps break down those habit circuits and then allow people to escape.

555
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Meaning things like the default mode network?

556
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,600
Yeah, that's right.

557
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,600
So I mean, our current thinking about how psychedelics might be used in psychiatry

558
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,120
is to is built from this, you know, remarkable finding that, you know,

559
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,400
the psychedelic state is a state which is where you have completely disrupted the default mode

560
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,280
network. This is the network in the brain, which in which your main sense of self,

561
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the core of you is in the default mode network.

562
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,600
And embedded in that, of course, is whether you are, you know, your depressive thoughts

563
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,680
or whether your love objects, you know, your heroin addict, anything that's really related

564
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
to you is embedded in the default.

565
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,480
And how innate is that versus how formed is that?

566
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,000
Well, the default mode network, I think, exists in children and babies.

567
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,680
And it is what you are.

568
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,800
It is the part of the brain in which where you encode yourself,

569
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,600
your self-referential memories, your plans, your retrospect, you know,

570
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,360
looking back, looking forward, putting everything.

571
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,560
It is where you are.

572
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,440
We know that if you damage the frontal part of the default mode network,

573
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
your personality changes.

574
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,120
You damage the posterior part of the default mode network.

575
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,880
You kind of you become a very strange person who really struggles with coordination and integration.

576
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,560
So the default mode network is a fundamental part of orchestrating what you are.

577
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,840
But in that, of course, are all the things that you have been.

578
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,880
So in the default network coordinates your access to good memories, to bad memories,

579
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,160
to use of drugs, to resisting the use of drugs, etc.

580
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,400
But in a very simplistic way, that sort of current thought thinking is that

581
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,720
some elements of the default mode become misaligned or malignantly over-engaged

582
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,440
with negative thinking and depression or compulsive attitude, the seeking of drugs in drug use.

583
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,600
And if we can disrupt those with psychedelics, then potentially people can kind of restore

584
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,960
a normal balance in that network and have a more rational approach, you know, a less determined.

585
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,520
So the brain is kind of determining things like addiction.

586
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,840
And even though people don't want to use drugs, they often find themselves doing it,

587
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,640
even though they don't want to, because their brain is kind of driving them that way.

588
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,360
And we're going to come back and talk about the impact of psilocybin on the default mode network.

589
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,320
But I guess to your point, this might be one of the ways in which Ibogaine or Iboga

590
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,920
kind of help rewire a brain for an individual who is opioid addicted, which isn't in itself

591
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,760
kind of an interesting thing, isn't it? And that there's got to be a genetic susceptibility

592
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,640
to this, because there are many people who take tons of opioids during, you know, say a post,

593
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,080
you know, post-operative recovery from surgery. And, you know, they take tons of the stuff.

594
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,440
And then when they have to stop it, they stop it. And that's the end of it. And yet there are other

595
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,000
people for whom that's not true. So do we have a sense of what that genetic susceptibility looks

596
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,360
like? And is it more importantly, is it possible to predict that a priori so that we would understand,

597
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,560
hey, this is a person who is at such high risk for opioid dependency that even if they have to

598
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,560
get their wisdom teeth pulled out, we are not giving them this medication. We're going to come

599
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,560
up with a totally different pain management strategy. Yes, theoretically, it is unlikely

600
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,400
to be in the genes. Well, it's probably polygenic, I'm sure. Yeah, yeah, exactly. There's not going

601
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,960
to be a gene. What what do we know about why people become addicted? Well, we know, we know

602
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,800
that social factors are hugely important. You know, I mean, if you've seen The Wire, then you

603
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,680
know that downtown Baltimore. I lived The Wire. Well, I mean, I did my residency in Baltimore. So

604
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,680
I took care of the patients in The Wire. Yeah, it's a frightening place, isn't it?

605
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,320
Unbelievable. The book, The Corner, which The Wire was based on, was the book I,

606
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,440
once I matched to do my residency in Baltimore, a friend of mine who was a year ahead of me

607
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,040
in at medical school who had already now spent a year in Baltimore. I was like, hey, do you have

608
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,560
any advice for what I can do to kind of get ready for it? Because I'm moving from Stanford to

609
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,320
Baltimore. You can't go from the most posh place in the world to the least. And he said,

610
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,840
his only piece of advice was he said, read The Corner, because it's literally what you're going

611
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,200
to be living in. And it will give you a great sense of empathy for the patients that you're

612
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,400
going to be taken care of. And it's a riveting book, which ultimately became a riveting series.

613
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,480
Absolutely. And, you know, a couple of years ago, I was on my way to Philadelphia from

614
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,120
Washington to give a lecture. And as we pulled out of Baltimore, I was looking out the train

615
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,240
window thinking, this is like a war zone. Is this Hiroshima? Because in the downtown,

616
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,360
I hadn't realized quite how destroyed it had been. And if you're living there and you've got no job,

617
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,720
I mean, and the only thing you can do is deal drugs. You take drugs, you deal drugs. So,

618
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:51,040
a lot of drug use addiction comes because that's the one way people can actually achieve both a

619
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,680
sense, something that takes away the misery of their lives, but also in a way, if they become drug

620
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,000
dealers, become some role. So, so coping with life stress is one reason people use drugs.

621
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,960
But there are some people, you know, very, you know, the rich, successful people and

622
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,440
who still use opiates and get into problems with opiates. And the example, I give two examples of

623
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:25,200
this to Oscar winners. Tatum O'Neill, youngest ever Oscar winner, marries the best greatest

624
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,760
tennis player at the mic and rare there's maybe ever been, you know, got two wonderful kids, lives

625
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,320
the life in everyone, envy, you know, she's famous, beautiful, everything there. But when she comes

626
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:44,960
out of heroin treatment, she says, the only time I felt whole was on heroin. And you see that,

627
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
I see that with patients, not just heroin patients, I see it with alcoholics. There are

628
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,320
plenty of people for whom alcohol makes them what they want to be. Only when they're drunk,

629
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,040
that they're actually functioning normally. And why that is, we don't know. And actually, one of

630
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,240
the interesting things, you know, that I don't know the reason I want to study psychedelics,

631
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,960
because I'm wondering whether that gap that can only be filled by drugs could actually be kind of

632
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,840
refilled or at least remodeled with psychedelics. So, yeah, so that's another. And then of course,

633
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:26,080
there are people who use drugs to get high and then they find somehow that their brain becomes

634
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,520
sensitized to the drug use so that they lose control. And that's more classic with people you

635
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,240
use cocaine or crystal. So let's talk about those two drugs, just from a mechanistic standpoint,

636
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,800
and where the risk actually comes from. Take your choice, which one you want to start with.

637
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,400
Well, let's start with the earlier. Let's start with cocaine, because that was the first,

638
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,520
well, there were several cocaine epidemics. But I mean, let's talk about that. Yeah, I mean,

639
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,160
cocaine, I give a lecture sometimes, which is, was Freud right to give up on psychopharmacology?

640
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,640
Because of course, Freud was a great protagonist. Freud used cocaine himself, he thought cocaine

641
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,440
was a very powerful drug for getting people of heroin. He got one of his, his disciples off

642
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,720
heroin, by giving them cocaine. He didn't realize that cocaine also caused dependence. In fact,

643
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,800
Freud and his, his protege both became cocaine dependent. That's another Hopkins, that's another

644
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,160
Hopkins link, by the way, in Baltimore was the, the godfather. Yeah, yeah. So the, basically,

645
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,400
the father of the surgical residency in the United States, and the first chief of surgery at Hopkins,

646
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,920
William Stuart Halstead, himself became addicted to cocaine when he became obsessed with it as a

647
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,520
local anesthetic. And so in the, in the process of experimenting with cocaine as a local anesthetic,

648
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,400
which of course, it became a very potent and remarkable local anesthetic, he and many of his

649
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,720
residents became cocaine addicted. So it's sort of, you know, it's a footnote to the, to this story

650
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,200
of the creation of the great American Surgical Institute. Well, it hasn't stopped. They don't

651
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,440
get addicted to cocaine anymore. They get addicted to remifentanil usually the anesthetist, but that's

652
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:13,680
another story. Let's get back to cocaine. So I think the reason Freud went into psychology was

653
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,000
because he got them, he became completely terrified of pharmacology because he kind of assumed that

654
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,160
any drug would have that problem. So, you know, you can maybe get, maybe give cocaine credit for

655
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,040
the development of psychoanalysis. But when we get to the modern era, you know, then, you know,

656
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,440
cocaine is the ultimate fun drug. It gives you energy and drive and, you know, an enormous sort

657
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:41,440
of sense of focus and purpose, and then a terrible crash. And we now, you know, we know that it's

658
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,840
due to the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain. But it's very spiky. And during

659
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,280
the course of a binge over the weekend, you know, the brain gets perturbed, and then people start to

660
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,440
get paranoid and withdraw. And some of them will get sensitized and become addicted. And some of

661
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,560
them will die because of course, there's a cardiac effect. And also there's this problem that if you

662
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,480
mix cocaine and alcohol, you get a drug called cocaethylene, which is a longer acting and more

663
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,840
cardiotoxic version of cocaine. You know, I have patients who, I mean, our patients are always going

664
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,520
to disclose to us what they use. We asked this question point blank, which recreational drugs do

665
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,520
you use? And a number of them will say, hey, you know, two or three times a year I use cocaine,

666
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,480
and they want to know what I think. And again, the goal in that situation is not to come across

667
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,680
as preachy and dogmatic, but it's to sort of have a point of view and have it be grounded. And my

668
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,520
point of view with cocaine has always been, I don't think it's worth the risk. And I don't think

669
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,680
it's the right kind of drug because, you know, just as much as we're now talking about a framework

670
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,920
for drugs, I have a much simpler framework for drugs, which is, it's really only got two levers.

671
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,160
One is what is the physical risk of this drug to me as an individual? So with cocaine, what is the

672
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,640
true risk of cardiac toxicity? What is the risk of deepening physiologic dependence over time, et cetera?

673
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,840
And then the second component to my framework is, is this a drug that only alters your state,

674
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:20,240
or does it have the potential to alter a trait? I'm borrowing that from the book called Altered

675
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,200
Traits, which gets into this distinction. And so the idea being is, you know, psilocybin for

676
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,200
anybody who's ever taken it is clearly a drug that alters your state. But if it just altered your

677
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,600
state, you probably wouldn't take it because it's really not that pleasurable. But the real

678
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,480
benefit of it is the potential to alter a trait, whether it be depression, smoking cessation, or

679
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,840
something else. And so if a drug can only alter your state, but it has no potential to really

680
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:58,000
alter your traits, i.e. how you behave off the drug, is it worth it? And so my, the way I explain

681
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,440
this to patients is I say, I don't think cocaine can do that. So therefore it has two strikes,

682
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,640
it's O for two in the Peter framework. It has a physical risk that is non-trivial,

683
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,320
and it's not going to make your life better when you're not taking it. And therefore I think

684
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,920
cocaine makes no sense to take. Do you agree or disagree with that? It's a very interesting

685
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,680
analysis. I like that. I might start using it. So do you agree that basically there isn't a

686
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,000
positive to cocaine that I'm missing? There isn't a benefit to it? I certainly would say

687
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,240
absolutely true for crack. For cocaine, I'm not entirely sure. I mean, I think there aren't people

688
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,200
who can use it just once or twice a year without getting into much difficulty, provided they don't

689
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,960
have serious cardiac problems. So I certainly wouldn't be using it at my age. But then look

690
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,360
at like there's the famous example, which basically accelerated the war on drugs was the case of Len

691
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,320
Bias in 1985. Are you familiar with the story of Len Bias? Oh, he was the probably the most famous

692
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,480
high school, pardon me, college basketball recruit. So he played basketball at the University

693
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:15,120
of Maryland, a complete superstar, basically on the level of a Michael Jordan. And he was drafted

694
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,440
by the Boston Celtics and probably had he gone on to play for the Boston Celtics would have altered

695
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,760
the course of the NBA for the next 10 years. The day following the NBA draft, he was back in

696
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Baltimore celebrating with friends. They're at a party in their dorm room. He's, you know, they're

697
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,360
using cocaine, he has a sudden cardiac arrest and dies. And this really, really shocked the nation.

698
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:46,800
This was a really big deal. And, and, and certainly some would argue that that was that only reinforced

699
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:54,480
and doubled down on sort of the Nancy Reagan esque, just say no mantra, which of course reinforced

700
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,920
the war on drugs. So again, when you can have this totally, you know, the healthiest 21 year old in

701
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,520
the country can die and you don't know what you know, the details, right? How much was he on was

702
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,480
at laced with something, you know, one doesn't know. But you've got to remember that, you know,

703
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,320
sudden death in athletes, I don't know, we just had the European Football Championships. And one of

704
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:24,000
the star players, Erickson from Denmark had a cardiac arrest on the pitch. So super fit athletes

705
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,440
might be more susceptible. Yeah. Yeah. Particularly if they've got, you know, if they're big and they've

706
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,560
got to develop some kind of cardiomy. So, so yeah, I don't athletes are, are paradoxically more

707
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,720
potentially, you know, at least as vulnerable as other people to these, to these effects.

708
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,160
So, so talk about methamphetamine, crystal meth, these, these drugs, which obviously the,

709
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,680
the amazing Netflix series Breaking Bad brought everyone awareness of what these drugs are, but,

710
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,280
but physiologically, neurochemically, what is it that they're doing? And what is the danger?

711
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:05,760
Well, they're very similar to KK. I remember as a junior doctor, my very first period as a junior

712
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:14,640
doctor, giving methyl amphetamine intravenously to a man who had serious status asthmaticus.

713
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:23,360
Jeez. Amphetamines were developed as a treatment for asthma. They were developed as an alternative

714
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:30,320
to ephedra. Ephedra is a natural plant product. It was discovered to have this bronco dilating

715
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,240
properties back in the 1800s. There was a huge demand. The plant couldn't supply the demand. So

716
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,640
German pharmaceutical companies went away and made a synthetic ephedra, which they called amphetamine.

717
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,800
And it was used largely for the treatment of, of asthma, really to the second world war,

718
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:56,160
when people realized it could actually be used to keep soldiers awake. And, and, and, and,

719
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,040
it's another interesting aside, I'm very interested in the, the history of drugs and

720
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:08,000
war because they tell us quite a lot about the, the consequences of drug use. And what I often

721
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,280
give, I often give a talk when I talk about amphetamines, I compare the, the allies. So the

722
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,000
Brits and Americans, we use amphetamine sulfate. Whereas the Germans and the Japanese thought they

723
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,360
were really clever because they had this super amphetamine called methane amphetamine, which

724
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:30,000
lasts a lot longer. But what they didn't realize was that longer is not better. And the turning

725
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,920
point of the war was actually the, the North Africa campaign when the Germans were pushed

726
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:45,200
back when they got to Egypt. So, that's right. Absolutely. By the desert rats, the, the, the

727
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,080
allied troops, the Australians, and the way the desert rats used to work was that they would be

728
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:56,800
up all night hanging, working around the Germans, harrying them, blowing them up. And then they go

729
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,200
back, they, that would, they'd be up all night on amphetamine sulfate. And then they go back and

730
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,200
they'd sleep all day. But the Germans would take methane amphetamine to stay up to fight, to defend

731
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,720
themselves against the desert rats. But they couldn't sleep in the daytime. And eventually they

732
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,680
became sleep deprived and paranoid. And the same with Japanese, you know, these descriptions of how

733
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,080
the Japanese became, can pull, have these terrible hallucin, sensory somatic hallucinations

734
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:28,240
from using large doses of crystal meth for long periods. So, crystal meth is, it's longer acting

735
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,520
and probably more neurotoxic than amphetamine sulfate. Talk about the neurotoxicity. What,

736
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,320
what actually happens to the person's brain? Cause we, you certainly have this meme of the crystal

737
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:50,640
meth user, right? No teeth, bruised, pin skinny, emaciated. But that meme doesn't actually tell me

738
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,600
about their brain. What's, what's actually happening to them? Well, they're certainly pushing

739
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,280
their dopamine system to a point where it's probably depleted. And that seems to then lock

740
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,760
them into a state where they can't really function normally in the world without taking the drug.

741
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,440
There's also a bit less good evidence that it might also damage the dopamine pathways to the

742
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:20,880
frontal cortex, which impairs their ability to make judgments to executive function, et cetera.

743
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,960
But I have to caution it. I mean, the, the, the big concern about crystal meth actually came

744
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,920
as a result of the Japan after the second world war, there were, you know, factories, crystal meth

745
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,960
factories in Japan, you know, there were barrels of the stuff and there were a lot of Japanese

746
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,000
soldiers had nothing else to do. And they used to use huge doses of crystal meth, often intravenously.

747
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,440
And the evidence for brain damage really comes from that population. There's not so much evidence

748
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,280
from it being, when it's being used as it tends to be used now, orally without, you know, in more

749
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,800
prolonged periods. So I'm not sure that you get a lot of what you might call cortical damage with

750
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,000
crystal meth, but I think it definitely does distort the dopamine pathways in your brain and,

751
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,600
and will affect your motivation and your ability to, to sort of get up and get activated, et cetera.

752
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,920
So now let's talk a little bit about these drugs that unfortunately, or, you know, for,

753
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:25,680
they seem to have the same scheduling and therefore they're viewed by the DEA as both as dangerous

754
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,080
in terms of harm or risk of, of, of addiction and as medically useless. Cause really that's

755
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:37,920
the criteria for schedule one, right? Is high, high potential for addiction and no medical use.

756
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,880
And so cocaine does not fit in schedule one because while it is highly addictive, we at

757
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,120
least have one appropriate medical use for it, which is, and it's an, it's a great anesthetic,

758
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,680
especially in the nose. Obviously fentanyl is not schedule one because even though we

759
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,960
acknowledge it's highly addictive, it has this pain blunting effect. Remarkably psilocybin is

760
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:12,400
schedule one. MDMA is schedule one. So LSD is schedule one. So let's talk about these three,

761
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,600
which are, if you believe the DEA scheduling the worst possible drugs imaginable, because

762
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,880
by definition, they must have a high addiction for potential and they serve no medical benefit

763
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,000
whatsoever. So take them in any order you like. Well, let's take the psychedelics first,

764
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,520
because that's how it all started. I mean, these drugs were banned,

765
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,720
not because they had any negative impact. They were banned in the face of opposition.

766
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:47,840
Bobby Kennedy confronted the DEA and the FDA when they said we want to ban LSD. And he said,

767
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:54,000
hang on a second, hang on. We spent billions of dollars researching LSD up till this time.

768
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,560
And we got loads of positive results. In fact, his wife-

769
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,560
Was he still the AG when he was having this discussion with them? Was he still the attorney

770
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,000
general of the United States?

771
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
No, no, no, he was, he was secretary of state. He was about to get elected as president.

772
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,680
Yeah, this was, this was, okay, later on.

773
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,920
Yeah. Just before he was assassinated.

774
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,560
Yeah. Okay.

775
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,000
And he's saying to these, come on, guys, we've had 15 years of this remarkable research,

776
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,640
which we've invested. NIH in the States funded over 130 grants to study the therapeutic use

777
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,440
of LSD. And they found it was very therapeutic and very little harms. And then the DEA come,

778
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,600
and the CIA come and say, we've got to ban it. He's saying, what are you talking about?

779
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,840
And of course, what they were talking about was, was the fact that the hippie movement was starting.

780
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:45,280
And the hippie movement was anti the war in Vietnam. And LSD was seen as fueling the hippie

781
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:51,120
movement. But also worse than that, it was changing music and people were dressing differently and

782
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,680
putting flowers in their hair. And, and they were sticking flowers down the guns of the soldiers that

783
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,040
were trying to stop them protesting the war. You know, it was changing the whole tenor of,

784
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,720
I suppose, what you might call sort of intellectual debate in America,

785
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,280
particularly among students. And it was seen as a real threat to the American way of,

786
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,800
of doing everything, which was basically having bigger and better bombs and guns.

787
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:21,040
And so LSD got banned, because it was essentially changing the way people voted,

788
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,720
people didn't want to vote for war. And they had, but they couldn't ban it. In those days,

789
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,080
there were rules which said basically, you had to have to find harms. And those harms can be

790
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,320
physical harms, or they could be social harms. And it's very easy to find social harms, because

791
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:40,560
you just get a few editors of your National Enquirer or similar rags to just invent stories

792
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,800
about the harms, you know, and the way people have been corrupted by using LSD. And there's these

793
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:51,200
wonderful, I mean, it's sad, but, you know, but it's amusing now, but of course, very damaging.

794
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:57,200
It's front covers of these magazines or newspapers, making absurd claims about LSD,

795
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,280
usually with semi naked women. And, and that was enough concern. Editors are socially concerned,

796
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,720
then we can ban the drug and it got banned. And once LSD got banned, all the other serotonergic

797
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,120
hallucinogens that were known about at the time, and actually, in America, you did know about quite

798
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,720
a lot, a lot of countries didn't know there were more than LSD inside of Sydney. So some countries

799
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,680
didn't ban DMT or 5-Methoxy. But you Americans, you just banned it all because you had good

800
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,800
scientists. So LSD was banned for political and social reasons. No, not because of any harm.

801
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,720
If Tim Leary had not been around, would it still have been banned, in your opinion?

802
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:44,800
Probably not. I think the fact that he was encouraging a fundamental change in the American

803
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,080
way of life through using drugs, I think he certainly compounded the problem. And he certainly

804
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:56,880
popularized LSD and encouraged people to think differently about society. I think that, I think

805
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,120
there was a genuine fear that Americans would actually cease to want to fight wars and actually

806
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:09,040
want to have peace. And that was just seen as being extremely bad for the American economy. And of

807
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:17,840
course, the American presence in Sydney. So prior to the scheduling of LSD, you mentioned over 130

808
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,960
grants had been issued to study it. This was a drug that had been manufactured in the late 1930s

809
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,560
by the pharmaceutical company Sandos. What were some of the things that they had learned about LSD

810
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:35,360
under that period of time in which it was studied rigorously? So there were 40,000 patients studied,

811
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:42,400
a thousand papers were published. And there've been analyses of many of these groups of patients.

812
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:48,160
And they discovered that it actually was very safe. If anything, it reduced suicide rates

813
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,840
compared with non-treatment. And you've got to remember at the time in the 50s and 60s,

814
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,840
there were very few alternatives, particularly antidepressants hadn't been really invented

815
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:01,360
till the 1960s. It was shown to be effective. And it was shown to be safe and it didn't cause

816
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:07,120
psychosis. So actually, it was this was the revolution. This was the beginning, the dawning

817
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:15,200
of real psychiatry. Psychiatry was becoming like the rest of medicine. We had tools that we could

818
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,440
help people with other than talking. And in what context, David, so would that be like a single

819
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:28,560
dose of LSD combined with a prolonged period of psychotherapy during the period of time under which

820
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,920
the individuals under the influence, or did it require multiple treatments? I mean, do you have

821
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:40,000
a sense of what was required for that efficacy? But it was used in two different ways. So in the

822
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,320
States, the typical use was how we're using it today, which is give people a bigish dose,

823
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:53,040
give them a big trip, a few hour trip, and then afterwards help them work out what the trip meant.

824
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,880
So it was always done in the context of psychotherapy, because in those days, all American

825
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,360
psychiatrists were actually effectively, mostly Freudian analysts. So it was always done in the

826
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:10,000
context of psychotherapy. It was allowed. But in Britain, and we tended to, we often used lower

827
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,520
doses. And we use that repeatedly to try to break down psychological resistance to actually engaging

828
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,600
in psychotherapy. And what was the difference in those doses, David? So the big trip dose would be

829
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,720
how many micrograms? So for LSD would have been 100 or 125. Okay. And then for the, you know, for

830
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,120
opening up the, reducing the resistance, we would say, in psychotherapy, breaking down the resistance,

831
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,840
it would be perhaps 25 micrograms. And is 25 micrograms perceptible, or is that considered a

832
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,560
microdose where the individual? No, no, that's perceptible. Anything over 10 micrograms is

833
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,840
perceptible. Okay. Even 10, a lot of people can discriminate 10, not in the sense, not because

834
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,560
they're psychedelic, but they, they, something's different. Feel that, yeah, feel things. Yes, exactly.

835
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:58,080
And in the case that you described in the UK, how many treatments at that lower level,

836
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,360
and at what interval were typically necessary to produce the benefits?

837
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,480
Well, they'd be weekly, and they'd be maybe for, you know, 10, 15, 20 treatments.

838
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,160
So it's a, it's a, just an unbelievable loss to the scientific community when LSD becomes scheduled.

839
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,400
Absolutely. Could I just say one other thing? I mean, the, the, the, perhaps the biggest loss of all

840
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:25,280
is relation to alcoholism. A lot of people don't realize that the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous,

841
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:31,520
Bill Wilson, he escaped his alcoholism. He broke free from the chains, as he described it. He

842
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:37,680
escaped the chains of his alcoholism through a psychedelic experience. And then that was before

843
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,600
LSD. And then when LSD came along, and it was legal, he tried it and he said, wow, this drug could help

844
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:49,440
lots of alcoholics escape from this belief that the only thing that matters to them

845
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,800
is alcohol. It could give them a sense that there is more that it is possible to change.

846
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:02,000
And he was, he persuaded or was instrumental in six trials of LSD for alcoholism that were conducted

847
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,240
in the state. So one or two doses in people with alcoholism. And a few years ago, a couple of

848
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,400
Norwegians went back and they dug out the old data and they did it, put it through a modern

849
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:20,640
meta-analysis, collate all the data. You've got an effect size of one, which is twice that of any

850
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,000
subsequent treatment for alcoholism. LSD was a revolution in the treatment of alcoholism.

851
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:33,200
Now, in the 50 years since LSD has been banned, you know, you can make a rough calculation

852
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,360
worldwide, over 100 million people have died prematurely from alcohol use disorder.

853
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:48,160
And if LSD helped perhaps just 10% of them, that will be 10 million lives saved.

854
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,760
Now you ask the question, well, how many lives have been saved from the ban? Well,

855
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,360
I'm not sure LSD, maybe let's say let's say globally, maybe, maybe 50, 50 lives a year have

856
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,160
been saved because fewer people took it possibly. So then you say, you know, we got 50 years times

857
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,960
for just two and a half thousand lives saved and 10 million lives lost. So the equation is so

858
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,320
balanced against the decision that was made. It really, I think it's the worst censorship of

859
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:24,880
research in the history of the world. And what are the typical harms of LSD? Is it basically

860
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,640
self-harm inadvertently through people who are tripping to such an extreme level that they,

861
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,040
you know, you hear these stories, well, this guy thought he could fly and he jumped off a building.

862
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,800
Sure. Well, the CIA were very good at promoting those stories, but they're, they're, okay,

863
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:48,240
unquestionably people do dangerous things when they're taking LSD in dangerous places.

864
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,200
And we should mitigate against that. And I can promise you when we do psychedelic therapy,

865
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:01,040
we lock the door so they can't jump. Okay. Here's a statistic in Britain, and I imagine it's even

866
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:08,800
way worse in the States. Each year in Britain, probably 20 to 30 people die jumping, usually

867
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:15,760
drunk from piers or breakwaters or even from hotel balconies into the swimming pool. So

868
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,320
probably more people die each year jumping from alcohol. Which says nothing of automotive

869
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:27,760
accidents and liver toxicity and respiratory depression. But just the jumping. Okay. So LSD,

870
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,800
if you take LSD in a dangerous situation with people who are also tripping and you're not

871
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:37,920
got someone to look after you, then of course it's, you know, there is a risk. But when LSD was used

872
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,440
in these 40,000 patients in hospitals, there was, there was very little evidence of any harm at all.

873
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,520
Okay. Let's talk about its cousin, psilocybin.

874
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,600
Yes. The psilocybin of course, it's been around a lot longer. Psilocybin is a present in mushrooms.

875
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,360
There are about 200 species of magic mushrooms, different ones in different parts of the world.

876
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:05,120
It was, it was really the beginnings of the psychedelic revolution where LSD and Hoffman

877
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:13,280
and Gordon Watson, the American mycologist who discovered a tribe in Mexico that were using

878
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:18,560
mushrooms for psychedelics experiences and actually went and exposed them and actually

879
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:24,640
rather destroyed their culture by making it a target for tourism. So psychedelic mushrooms

880
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,000
have been around forever because mushrooms have been around way before humans. One of the

881
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,040
interesting theories about Hinduism, you often wonder, you know, why do Hindu gods have so many

882
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:42,480
arms? Probably because the first people that became Hindus have been using this, this cocktail

883
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,880
called Soma, which of course was, the term was adopted by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World. But,

884
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,240
but the real Soma was a powerful mixture, probably of magic mushrooms of Ephedra and cannabis. You

885
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,600
mix that a lot together. It's not surprising your elephants have five heads and four arms. So, so

886
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:07,280
magic mushrooms have been around in many cultures for millennia. The Psi-de-Cybin has been the active

887
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,520
ingredient was also discovered by Hoffman because Watson went to him and said, why is this causing

888
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,000
hallucinations like LSD? And he said, oh, well, because it looks a bit like serotonin, a bit like LSD.

889
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:24,320
And, and we've been working now with Psi-de-Cybin for a number of reasons. The main one is that it

890
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:30,320
doesn't have the stigma. LSD, you say LSD to a politician and they immediately turn off.

891
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:36,080
You know, LSD is a bad thing. Whereas Psi-de-Cybin, they don't know how to say it. They don't have to

892
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,840
spell it. They don't know what you're talking about. And who's, how can you be worried about

893
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,640
magic? That's only a mushroom. The second reason we started using Psi-de-Cybin was because we didn't

894
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,240
have safety, really good safety data on any of these. But we did know that in Britain, magic

895
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:55,440
mushrooms were legal until 2005. And we knew that about a million young people a year were using

896
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,800
mushrooms. And we persuaded our regulators that they could let us use mushrooms because that body

897
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,000
of evidence of safety was adequate. And they said, okay. What led to the scheduling only 15 years ago?

898
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,160
I mean, what, what was happening that in 2005, they said, we've got to ban this thing.

899
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,360
It's complicated. So the active ingredient Psi-de-Cybin was banned in 71 alongside LSD,

900
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,760
DMT. But the mushrooms weren't banned. Why would you ban the mushrooms? They don't have much of it.

901
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,640
Who cares if people are going to go and lie on the side of a mountain and see pretty pictures

902
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:36,400
in the sky. But what happened was that a couple of head shops in Camden town, North London,

903
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,160
started selling freeze dried mushrooms. So they would concentrate the dose?

904
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,560
Like you could take more of it? Or was it just the fact that it was being sold commercially in

905
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:50,640
the head shops? It could be sold in London. And so no one really cares if people go and lie on a

906
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:56,880
hillside in Devon. That's quite fun. But if someone's selling a dangerous psychedelic drug

907
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,600
to our young people in London, the right wing press just went ape. And we had a new.

908
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,600
These are probably the same shops that sold Doc Martens, by the way, because I know those head

909
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:12,320
shops. They're very dangerous places. Yeah, absolutely. And it was a classic example

910
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:19,920
of political expediency. The Tory party had lost the third election in a row to the Labour party,

911
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,360
Tony Blair's Labour Party. And they brought in a new guy called David Cameron.

912
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:31,200
And David Cameron had spoken previously about, you know, he'd use drugs and, and he was in favour

913
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,440
of drug reform. But as soon as he became leader of the Tory party, he became anti drugs, because

914
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:41,600
that's what he was told to do. And he saw these newspaper headlines, head shops corrupting our

915
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,920
young people. And he started goading the Labour party that he had soft on drugs, just soft on

916
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,160
drugs. You know, look, they're selling this illegal, the drug wasn't illegal, but the mushrooms

917
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:59,520
weren't illegal, but they made out they were. And Tony Blair, instead of saying, don't be stupid,

918
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:06,800
he did what many liberal leaning politicians do, in fact, exemplified in your country by Clinton.

919
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:12,800
Clinton was the guy that was told the Democrats had to be harder on drugs and the Republicans and

920
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,040
he's the guy with the three strikes and you're in prison forever. And the same with Labour,

921
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,600
they were told if you're not tougher on drugs, or as tough as the Tories, you're going to lose the

922
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:28,880
election. So he goaded Blair into making the mushrooms illegal. And he did it without consulting

923
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,280
us and without he actually broke the law. But we discovered that actually governments are allowed

924
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:39,040
to do that. We can if you take even if you take them to court, they can just change the law to

925
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,880
prove it, you know, to allow them to have done what they did. So so yeah, so the mushrooms are

926
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:49,680
now illegal, as well as the active ingredient. And then MDMA itself is not really a classic

927
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,360
psychedelic, you know, I, there's sort of a framework for these psychedelics where you've

928
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:58,720
got the kind of the typical the atypical, but sort of if you have sort of psilocybin LSD here,

929
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,240
you've got MDMA here more of an empathogen. And then you've had ketamine is more of a dissociative.

930
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,480
And then these really a typical ones like Ibogaine, which we've already talked about. So correct.

931
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,840
So let's spend just a minute on MDMA, because again, I think it's one that, well, first of all,

932
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,720
people confuse MDMA and ecstasy a little bit. And it's probably worth clarifying the nuances there.

933
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,640
But also talking about the potential that it has, I've had, you know, Rick Doblin on the podcast

934
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,320
before. So we've gone incredibly deep on the benefits of, you know, treatment for PTSD. And

935
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,520
we've talked a lot about maps, we don't need to go that deep. But just for someone who maybe hasn't

936
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:37,520
heard that, what would be the overview? Well, MDMA is a great American invention. Yep.

937
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:44,480
Well, your top drug chemist, Sasha Shulgin, was interested in derivatives of amphetamines.

938
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:51,040
And he, MDMA was made, you know, back in 1904 as a possible agent for blood clotting, but it never

939
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:57,520
never got used. And Sheldon made it in the in the 60s and said, Wow, this drug is different from

940
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:02,080
amphetamines. It's not activating. It's not, it's not driving me like amphetamines. It's actually

941
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:07,920
making, it's giving me a clarity of thought, but also a sense of warmness and empathy. So we gave

942
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:14,160
it to his wife. And she said, Wow, this is a very, this is empathy. This would be really useful in

943
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,040
psychotherapy and couples counseling, it would help potentially help break down, you know, those

944
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:24,480
layers of irritation and grits that build up in relationships sometimes, put people back into love.

945
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,160
And it was widely used for about 10 years by therapists, particularly in the west coast of

946
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,720
the states. And it was called empathy, and everything was fine. And then some smart ass

947
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:38,720
in Texas decided, this is a legal drug, and we could sell this, we can't sell amphetamines,

948
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,600
but we can sell ecstasy because it's legal. But who wants to buy ecstasy? So they changed the name to

949
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,400
ecstasy. So they didn't want to buy empathy, sorry, they changed the name to ecstasy. You got an

950
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:54,800
amphetamine, which can help keep you active, but also make you much more in love with, with other

951
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:00,000
people. And it became, you know, widely used. What's, you know, it's the perfect drug for parties,

952
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,440
isn't it? You know, you've got energy, but you're also happy with you're not fighting people like

953
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,560
what you do if you're taking speed. And it became hugely popular, and it spread into Europe. And

954
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,240
then of course, it just riled the right the Puritans, it riled the right wing press, the idea

955
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:20,400
that young people could have ecstasy, when old when the newspaper owners couldn't even never had

956
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,200
it and couldn't even remember what it meant. They just didn't, you had this moral outrage,

957
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,160
which eventually got the drug banned. But again, you couldn't, in America and Britain in those

958
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,400
days, you couldn't ban a drug just because kids liked it, you had to find evidence of harm. And

959
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:40,560
some of the worst science has ever been done is the science proving or supposedly proving that

960
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,480
MDMA is harmful. And culminating in that an amazing experiment, it was done by Ricciarti,

961
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:53,040
which is very embarrassing for Johns Hopkins, you know, when he claimed that taking MDMA and

962
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,480
listening to the poges overnight gave monkeys brain damage. And we all said, well, hang on a second.

963
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:03,360
None of our kids are coming out of the clubs with brain damage. I think your experiment's wrong,

964
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:08,320
Ricciarti. He said, no, no, it's right. Exocice cause his brain damage. And he got published in

965
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,800
science, despite the fact the referee said, this is got to be wrong. And of course, eventually,

966
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,280
they went back and they audited what they'd done. And instead of giving the monkeys MDMA,

967
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,880
they given them crystal meth, which is way more toxic. That paper was recall. I mean,

968
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,280
he did have to pull that paper, didn't he? He didn't. No, no, he didn't retract the paper.

969
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,360
He was never retracted. I think you can still find it. If you look in science,

970
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,280
you'll still find it's there. It's not struck out. I think you'll just find there's a,

971
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:41,520
there's a correction. Sorry, guys. This wasn't MDMA. This was actually methamphetamine.

972
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,080
Wow. So that's, that's, that's our answer to Andrew Wakefield for you.

973
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,240
Indeed. And it's, it's embarrassing really, because, well, for all sorts of reasons, because

974
01:13:53,760 --> 01:14:00,320
so much American science is paid by the government. The, apparently, I don't know,

975
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:06,880
I heard that the editor of the magazine science was told by senators that the American Academy

976
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,760
of science, which runs a journal, would not get government funding if he didn't put that

977
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:18,080
paper in and get it published to deter young people from using MDMA. Of course,

978
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,440
all that happens is in the end, young people, young people think this doesn't make sense.

979
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,880
And then they discover they've been lied to. So are they going to listen to anything else

980
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:31,520
the government tells them? Yeah. Let's talk briefly about ketamine before we come back to,

981
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,680
to psilocybin. Cause I want to, I want to sort of double click more on psilocybin specifically with

982
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:42,640
with, for the treatment of depression. But let just to round out all of our sort of psychedelics.

983
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,920
Ketamine, of course, is the only drug on this list that is legal. So it's, I believe it's a

984
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,560
schedule three, perhaps a schedule four, used as an anesthetic typically. And it's quite dissociative.

985
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,200
So can you, can you talk, I guess, specifically about the use of ketamine in treatment resistant

986
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:10,320
depression, which seems to be one of the more promising areas of research? Yes. A wonderful

987
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:17,280
story. And it goes back to John Crystal, who's a professor up at Yale, and he was using ketamine

988
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:24,560
to model psychosis. And he was comparing ketamine and THC to model psychosis. And they both produce

989
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,680
altered states of consciousness, which sort of, you know, have some overlap with psychosis.

990
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,840
But he noticed that afterwards, his volunteers often felt better, you know, they actually came

991
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,960
out with the ketamine experience saying, well, that was weird, but they had an improved mood.

992
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,840
Maybe this is mood elevating. So then he and his colleagues went on and he did a study. Yeah,

993
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,040
ketamine elevates mood. And for a couple of days after a ketamine trip, your mood is definitely

994
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:56,000
improved. And now there've been about 30 studies showing that ketamine can have a value,

995
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,720
particularly if you add it on to other treatments of depression, which have not been very successful.

996
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,640
So if people have partially recovered, give a bit of ketamine, and their mood gets better.

997
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,040
The problem with ketamine, compared with what we're going to talk about in a minute with

998
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,320
psilocybin, is the effect is very short lasting, it lasts only two or three days.

999
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:19,360
So currently, what you have now is a licensed medicine. Janssen decided to pursue this,

1000
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,520
because this was the first real breakthrough in the treatment of depression for really for 50

1001
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,520
years. But you couldn't patent ketamine, because ketamine was being used back in the Vietnam War

1002
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,480
as the buddy drug when people were being blown up and having it as an analgesic. So they took

1003
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:39,120
the enantiomer, one of the isomers of ketamine, called S-the S-enantiomer, and they called it

1004
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,440
S-ketamine. And they formulated it for nasal inhalation, so you don't have to inject it, which

1005
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,240
is better and easier for psychiatrists. And now that's sold as a treatment, and it's called S-ketamine

1006
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,880
Spravato. And it works, and you take it a couple of times a week, and then gradually over time,

1007
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,680
you use less and less as the... So you don't develop a tachyphylaxis to it?

1008
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,200
It actually... If you do it twice a week, you don't? No, no. And you are able to get patients

1009
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:09,200
off of it while still preserving the antidepressant benefits? That's less clear, but for certain,

1010
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:14,160
in some that's true. But it does have, there is an advantage of it over ketamine.

1011
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,320
Ketamine clinics tend to... They give it intravenously or intramuscularly. They give it

1012
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:23,840
intravenously or intramuscularly. But also the problem there is that ketamine is a

1013
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,600
dependence producing drug. It's a drug, a recreational drug, it's relatively popular

1014
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,240
in Britain, it's relatively popular in China, probably popular also in the States, I'm not sure

1015
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:39,120
what the stats are. The problem is you do get tolerance, tachyphylaxis, if you use it regularly.

1016
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:47,440
So while it's relatively safe in the doses, you might use maybe 500 milligrams for depression.

1017
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,040
If people are using it recreationally and taking more and more, they're getting up to grams a day

1018
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:56,560
and then you get into serious problems. You get bladder problems, you get a... Basically you get

1019
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,800
severe chronic cystitis, which can cause bladder atrophy, needing bladder resection.

1020
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,920
And you also get a psychological state, you get a kind of... You can get brain damage,

1021
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:13,920
or at least you can get a state of severe cognitive impairment, which actually rather

1022
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,720
mimics schizophrenia. So heavy use of ketamine is actually really to be avoided.

1023
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,160
And what defines that? I mean, those are very scary things you just described,

1024
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:29,600
obviously the psychiatric component much more than the urologic. What is too much? I mean,

1025
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,880
because I'll tell you, this is something I get asked a lot. Hey, I'm going to this ketamine

1026
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:42,080
clinic once a month, it's changing my life. And at what point does that become too much?

1027
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:48,080
Yeah, well certainly daily use is too much. So I mean, people who are addicted to ketamine are

1028
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,640
using it four or five times a day, they might be using five grams a day. And that's when you get

1029
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:57,600
into the serious brain damage. So I think twice a week, oh, I think we know from S-ketamine,

1030
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,360
twice a week seems to be without, doesn't have any enduring... But if you're not using the

1031
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,240
enantiomer twice a week, we'll probably still produce a tachyflaxis and a diminishing return

1032
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,800
at some point. Yes, but this one of the really interesting questions, and we don't understand

1033
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:18,320
this. Why is it that when people use ketamine, and they get tachyflaxis, they can overcome it by

1034
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,680
taking more? By the way, I should explain to people what tachyflaxis is, because we're using

1035
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:27,840
the term without me defining it. It's of course, when the same amount of a medication produces a

1036
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,800
lesser and lesser effect, or when you require more and more of a medication to produce the same

1037
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,000
effect. So for example, we don't generally get tachyflactic to Tylenol, right? You have acetaminophen,

1038
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,120
if you take 500 milligrams and your headache goes away, the next time you take 500 milligrams,

1039
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:51,360
it does about the same thing. So to your point, you can push the dose a little bit and stay ahead

1040
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:59,520
of it with ketamine? Correct, you can, like heroin, like fentanyl, you can overcome the tolerance.

1041
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:05,680
But with psychedelics, you can't. And that's an interesting phenomenon. And it's probably to do

1042
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:12,960
with subtle changes in the downstream mechanisms in the cells, that you get almost complete absence

1043
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,840
of effects of psychedelics after two or three doses. And do you know who told us that?

1044
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,680
The US government. So the US government were very interested in, or fearful actually,

1045
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:30,000
when psychedelics came around in the 50s. They thought, well, maybe the Russians will be spraying

1046
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,800
LSD on our troops. So how can we protect our troops from LSD? So they started giving troops

1047
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,440
LSD to find out what the effects would be to see how they could abort them. And they discovered by

1048
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,680
the third day of giving the troops LSD, LSD had no effect anymore. I didn't realize that was the

1049
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:53,280
case. So if you're talking 250 micrograms of LSD, at some point people are going to stop responding

1050
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,440
to that. Yeah, but the second dose will be less than the first. If you take it every day,

1051
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,080
the second dose is way less than the second. But what if you're taking it once a month,

1052
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:06,400
for example, or? No, no, no, it takes about a week to recover. The effect disappears between

1053
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,160
about one and two weeks. I see. So it's not a lifelong tachyphylaxis. It's very temporal.

1054
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,640
Now, although some people do say, well, a lot of people say that for all drugs,

1055
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:21,680
that the first one's always the best. But you can't overcome the tachyphylaxis with psychedelics,

1056
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:27,120
whereas you can with heroin and you can with ketamine. And why that is, we're not so clear

1057
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,680
as to why that is. All right. Well, there's so many more questions I have about this, David,

1058
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:35,440
but I know we have a very hard stop today. So I want to make sure we have some time to talk about

1059
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:42,400
your most recent work with psilocybin and depression. About three months ago, a study was published in

1060
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,600
the New England Journal of Medicine. You were the senior author on that paper. I've written about

1061
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:53,200
it at length, which compared psilocybin to Lexapro, a very, very popular, commonly used, reasonably

1062
01:21:53,200 --> 01:22:00,880
well tolerated SSRI. Do you want to just give people a quick overview of the study design and

1063
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:08,800
what you set out to test? I'd be pleased to. Yes. So previously we had done a study, an open trial,

1064
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:15,600
we'd taken 20 people with resistant depression. We'd given them a single psilocybin trip and found

1065
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:22,160
very good outcome. But effect didn't last very long. It lasted, you know, one to two months.

1066
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:28,880
But for many of them, the depression came back. Based on that, and also some theoretical work I'd

1067
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:34,400
done with Robin Carhart Harris, who was with me at the time, he's now moved to UCSF. We came to the

1068
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,960
conclusion that psychedelics treat depression in a different way to antidepressants. And the paper

1069
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,960
is published in Journal of Psychopharmacology. It's called A Tale of Two Receptors. It's a free download.

1070
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,760
Feel free to read it because it conceptualizes that there are two ways you can lift depression.

1071
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:57,360
One way is with with Lexapro or other similar drugs that enhance serotonin in the limbic system.

1072
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,280
And there they basically block the stress response. And we know that stress is a major cause of

1073
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:10,880
depression. You block stress induced depressive changes in that system. And that allows the limbic

1074
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:17,440
system to recover. So that it's a bit like if you have a broken leg, you set the leg in plaster so

1075
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:24,240
that the bone can heal itself. SSRIs set the limbic system in plaster. So over a period of six to eight

1076
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:28,720
weeks, they can heal and get you over your depression. And that's through a particular

1077
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:34,080
subtype of serotonin receptors called the serotonin 1a receptor, which is in the very expressed in the

1078
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,680
limbic system. But we think psychedelics, we know psychedelics work in the cortex, and they disrupt

1079
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:47,520
cortical processing and disrupt, we think, the deep, persistent ruminations and negative thoughts

1080
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,520
of depression. So we said, let's do a study where we take depressed people, we scan them with fMRI

1081
01:23:53,520 --> 01:24:01,760
before and after. And then we see if we can look at the if the brain changes are different with the

1082
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:07,760
acetalopram compared with the cytosine. We're predicting that we would see cortical differences

1083
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,880
that the cortex would be changed by the cytosine bin, and the subcortical regions will be changed

1084
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,000
by the acetalopram. So the primary aim of the study was to see if there were differences in

1085
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,840
brain mechanisms. But of course, we have to know whether there are differences in outcome.

1086
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:28,640
So we compared the mood changing effects of these two drugs. But you couldn't just say,

1087
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:33,280
here, you're on Lexoprow, here, you're on cytosine bin, we had to blind it. And that's quite difficult

1088
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:38,800
with psychedelics. So the way we got we did that was to tell everyone that we're going to get

1089
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,480
cytosine bin. But half the group got a low dose, a placebo dose, a one milligram dose, and a half got

1090
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:50,320
a high dose, a 25 milligram dose. But they all went through the same psychotherapy, depending,

1091
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,240
it didn't matter what dose they got, they all got all the same preparation and the psychotherapy

1092
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:59,920
that goes with a high dose of cytosine bin. And then they all got pills. But the acetalopram group

1093
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,480
got acetalopram and the cytosine bin group got placebo.

1094
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,600
So they're both getting two pills. One is getting a placebo plus the high dose of psilocybin.

1095
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,080
And the point of that is what's called clinical equipoise. People have to believe

1096
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:20,400
that they're getting the best they can. And then and we gave them two doses of cytosine bin,

1097
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,720
whether high or low, one at the start and one after three weeks to see how long the effect would

1098
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:30,320
last. And then we measured changes in mood and we measured side effects. And we also looked at other

1099
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:34,800
aspects of depression rather than just looking at depression scores. We also looked at things like

1100
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:41,440
well being, which is a different way of looking at how people are feeling. And in the end, on the

1101
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:48,080
primary measure, there was no difference that cytosine bin at six weeks was as good as or equal

1102
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:53,920
to as acetalopram on that particular measure, which was a particular self-report measure called

1103
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,480
the quid self-report, which has been used quite extensively in research in the states,

1104
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,080
particularly in the stardew study. But when we looked at all the other measures,

1105
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,920
actually cytosine bin did rather well. Yeah. So I want to pause on that for a sec because

1106
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:17,920
I think that the paper was undersold a little bit. I think it was, it read as a negative study

1107
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:26,320
as opposed to a non-inferiority study. Why do you think that happened? Do you think that there was

1108
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,480
a mistake in the way that either the journal treated that or even the way you treated that

1109
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:37,360
as the authors? Yeah, that's a great question, a very perceptive question. That's a question

1110
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:44,240
I think you should ask the editors of the New England Journal. So the reality was, the truth

1111
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:53,760
was it wasn't powered for non-inferiority. If you want a proper non-inferiority study in psychiatry

1112
01:26:53,760 --> 01:27:00,160
takes 150 patients in each arm, we could never afford to do that. There's very few of them have

1113
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,480
ever been done except by companies. Well, probably none have been done except by companies. We could

1114
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:09,360
not statistically do a non-inferiority study. So we had to just do a kind of comparison.

1115
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:17,200
And the answer was that, well, we had to pre-specify, we pre-specified two outcomes,

1116
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,400
the quids and the well-being. And it did brilliantly on the well-being, but because that's kind of not,

1117
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:31,760
well, that's sort of soft wishy-washy psychiatry, they insisted that we use the quids as the primary.

1118
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:37,920
Now, if you don't meet, this is a bit statistical sort of jargon really, but if you don't meet your

1119
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:44,960
primary, you're not allowed to report the second trees. It's kind of, it's absolute, it's, it's,

1120
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:51,920
it's purism, it's puristic statistics. But as you, as you say, it's kind of not very intuitive,

1121
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:58,000
because when you look at it, actually it was very clear that the overall, many, well,

1122
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,640
there was not a single measure that favored Esitala Fray. Well, that's, that's sort of the thing is,

1123
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:10,240
you know, I read the paper in great detail and my takeaway was this is very promising because

1124
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,040
I'm very familiar with, with Lexapro and I'm very familiar with its efficacy, but I'm also very

1125
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:20,000
familiar with its side effects and the baggage that comes with it. Most people, you know, for,

1126
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,560
for the listener, Lexapro is typically given at two doses, 10 milligrams or 20 milligrams.

1127
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,040
Going from 10 to 20, there is a so sizable increase in the efficacy, but there's also

1128
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:34,880
a sizable increase in the side effects, many of them sexual. And when we're talking about treating

1129
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:41,680
young people, old people, middle-aged people, you fix their depression, but you destroy their libido,

1130
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:47,280
you're, you're, you're trading one problem for another often. And the, the, the list of patients

1131
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,640
I've, you know, taken care of who can't tolerate these drugs, despite the benefit that they're

1132
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:58,800
receiving from an anti-depressive or anti-angiolytic standpoint is significant. So, so to me, I read

1133
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,080
that study with enormous optimism, right? Which is if there is a way to give somebody 25 milligrams

1134
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:10,080
of psilocybin and get the same anti-depressive benefits, but without these other side effects,

1135
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,840
this is very exciting. This needs to be explored a heck of a lot further. Do you think that the

1136
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:21,680
study at least accomplished that as, as, as an outcome? Yeah. So people have said, well,

1137
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:25,680
why didn't you fight back with a journal? Why didn't you demand, you know, that they were more

1138
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:32,240
positive? And, and the answer is, from my perspective, being the first ever psychedelic

1139
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:38,880
study in the New England Journal of Medicine tells the world that psilocybin is a medicine.

1140
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,120
And it's as good as Lexapro. And if anyone who reads the paper can see that it does

1141
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:50,720
do better on sexual dysfunction, and it does do better on many of the other issues that Lexapro

1142
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:57,280
has a problem with. And that it fits with the theory that one of the things it's very,

1143
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:04,480
the reason Lexapro and other SSRIs dampen down sexual activity is because they dampen down the

1144
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:09,040
limbic system, which is the part of the brain which drives those behaviors. And also people on

1145
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:14,320
these drugs often say, yes, I don't feel depressed anymore. I don't, I don't, I don't cry. I, I don't

1146
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:20,240
have the distress that comes from seeing sad things on the TV. But they also say, but also I

1147
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,960
don't enjoy life as much because I kind of, my pleasures are blunted. Right. And that all fits

1148
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,400
with that theory. It's blunting the top and the bottom. Exactly. Exactly. Whereas psilocybin is

1149
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,080
stopping the thinking and allowing the rest of your brain to work normally.

1150
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:41,520
A word on microdosing, David, you know, people, it even, I even had to go back and do the conversion.

1151
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,480
So when I was reading the study, I was going, wait a minute, what is 25 milligrams of psilocybin mean?

1152
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:50,160
Because typically when people are taking psilocybin, we're giving it to them in the whole

1153
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,800
mushroom. And that's typically like five grams. So of course, then I had to get really deep in

1154
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:59,360
the weeds and figure out which species of mushroom and what the conversion is. But the point is

1155
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:08,720
25 milligrams of pure psilocybin is on par with about four to five grams of magic mushrooms.

1156
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:15,680
And therefore it is truly a psychedelic experience. What is known about the imperceptible dose?

1157
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:23,840
You know, like a hundred milligrams of magic mushroom or, you know, one to two milligrams

1158
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:29,440
of pure psilocybin and its potential for antidepressant benefits.

1159
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,800
Well, loads of people use it. Loads of people, you know, they go pick the mushrooms, they dry the

1160
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:42,080
mushrooms and they, they take them. I'll give you a, I was talking at a festival a couple of years ago

1161
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:48,080
in Wales. It's, it's, you know, it's got how the light gets in and it's a big intellectual music

1162
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:52,720
and music festival. And after my talk, a lady came up to me and she said, yeah, I got a cherry with

1163
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,960
the, you know, I'm a, I'm a nurse. She says, I got a kid. It's difficult. I mean, I'm not married.

1164
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,600
She says, but I get up every morning, you know, and I get the kid to school and I come back. She

1165
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,760
says, I have a cigarette, a cup of coffee and a mushroom. And I've been really good for the last

1166
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,200
few years. And, and, and there's anecdotally, there's large numbers of people who are using mushrooms.

1167
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:17,280
Do they work or not? We don't know because it's almost, the rules around these drugs,

1168
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:25,280
the Schedule 1 status means that a single mushroom is just as illegal as a bunch of mushrooms or as

1169
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:33,920
pure cytoside. Four years ago, we got ethical permission to do a microdosing study with LSD.

1170
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,400
But they said, this is an illegal drug, a dangerous drug. Every microdose had to be given in hospital.

1171
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:47,840
And then we costed up what it would take to buy all that time in hospitals to do six weeks of

1172
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:52,800
microdosing. We couldn't afford it. And so there has never been a proper controlled microdosing

1173
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:59,840
study of any, repeatedly, of any psychedelic. But from a mechanism of action standpoint, David, do you,

1174
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,760
do you see a plausible path to it, to microdosing being effective given what you now know about

1175
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:11,360
macrodosing? Well, it won't be as good. Obviously not a single microdose won't be remotely as good.

1176
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,760
But say repeatedly, because I believe in your study, they were given this macrodose every two weeks,

1177
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:21,360
correct? Twice. Every two, three weeks apart. Oh, twice. Yeah, that's right. So, but if we

1178
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:28,720
were talking about microdosing three or four times a week at, you know, one to two milligrams,

1179
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,440
and we're talking about this type of a treatment over the course of a year, so apples to apples

1180
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,400
time wise. Is there a plausibility here that you can see from a mechanism standpoint?

1181
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,240
Well, it'd be a great experiment to do. I mean, I think it is, I mean, I think, and I think it's

1182
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:50,800
ethical to do that, because I think it is plausible that microdosing over a long period

1183
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:58,560
might do two things. I would be slightly surprised if it really elevated mood and depressed people,

1184
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:05,280
but it might protect people about people against a lowering of mood. And so one of the interesting

1185
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:10,240
questions, in fact, in many ways, the fundamental question we have now, as a result of our two

1186
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:14,400
depression studies is not that we can get back people better, there's no question with cytosybing,

1187
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:20,800
how can we keep them well. And one of the great things we know about the SSRIs is if you take

1188
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:26,960
them continuously, they do protect against depression, they do protect against the

1189
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:34,240
stresses of life causing depression at the cost of blunting. So the question is, how, what could

1190
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:39,680
we do other than give them an SSRI after the psychedelic treatment and maybe microdosing would

1191
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:45,440
work. But until we get it liberated, until we get it out of schedule one and get it available,

1192
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:50,400
it's impossible to do those studies. Where do you think will be the thin end of the wedge to make

1193
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,960
that happen? Obviously, Roland Griffiths has done great work at Johns Hopkins, someone I'd like to

1194
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:02,960
have on the podcast as well, looking at psilocybin in end of life depression. Though I don't know

1195
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,600
where things are from a pathway perspective, there's obviously efficacy with smoking cessation

1196
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:14,480
and alcohol cessation and now your work with depression. Which of these will be the first

1197
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,200
domino that falls in your opinion, to look to change the scheduling of psilocybin?

1198
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:25,680
I think depression, because a multi-centre study is going on in Europe, in the US,

1199
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:30,480
but there's a company called Compass Pathways and they're doing a dose finding study. They finished,

1200
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:36,000
they've recruited the last subject, they would get the results hopefully by Christmas or the new year

1201
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,200
and that's a high dose, 25 milligram dose, a placebo dose, a one milligram dose like we did

1202
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:47,280
and a 10 milligram dose in between. I think if that's positive, then the floodgates will open

1203
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:53,920
to their second study and also to funding of that research. Now Compass has come under great

1204
01:35:53,920 --> 01:36:01,040
scrutiny from some in their effort to basically do a land grab of intellectual property on a molecule

1205
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:08,320
that basically should be in the public domain. How do you think about that in terms of balancing

1206
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,720
the need to make something as widely available as possible to the public, while at the same time

1207
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:18,160
needing to create an economic incentive to do so? Yes, well of course I have to express and I've

1208
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:23,120
been helping them for a lot, I mean their Compass Pathways exists because of our first depression

1209
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:28,400
study. You know they basically took our data and went and tried to do research with it and they

1210
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:34,880
started off being a bit like maps, they started off trying to raise money by being a not-for-profit.

1211
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:43,040
Now Rick Doblin is a phenomenon but it has taken him 25 years to raise enough money

1212
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,680
to do the maps phase three and after a year or so Compass Pathways realized that they didn't have

1213
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:57,280
the resources or the skill or the personalities. Yeah Rick's a force of nature. He is and they

1214
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,040
realized that they couldn't be a not-for-profit, they had to get the money for this to happen,

1215
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:07,520
they had to go down the more conventional route and so you know much as I would like it not to be

1216
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:13,600
the case you know reality is I think if we want to see cytosybing with enough evidence in my lifetime

1217
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:19,200
to make it a medicine then I think that they're the people that are most likely to deliver that.

1218
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:25,520
But on the other side you've got Oregon, you've got Oregon which voted in November last year

1219
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:32,480
to make mushrooms a medicine in two years time. So it's actually a bit of a race now to see who's

1220
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:38,880
going to win. I don't know how Oregon are going to do it, I just hope they do it carefully and

1221
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,520
sensibly but it might be that the mushroom ends up being the medicine rather than the cytosybing.

1222
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:52,640
It's exciting times. David I promised you that at 6pm I would draw to an end and we are at 559pm

1223
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,800
so I'm going to stick to my word despite the fact that we are only halfway through what I wanted to

1224
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,760
talk about. So I think the only logical conclusion here is that we will have to sit down and do this

1225
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,560
again if you're willing. I'd be delighted it's been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much.

1226
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:13,360
Thank you David. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested

include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every

1231
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:39,760
topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show

1232
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:45,840
notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely.

1237
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:11,920
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in but

1238
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,480
for which I'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to
