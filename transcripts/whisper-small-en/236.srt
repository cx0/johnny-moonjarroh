00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey everyone, welcome to the DRIVE podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,360
All right, Kellyanne, great to be sitting down with you and talking about all things

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,880
neurodegenerative disease. This is something I've been looking forward to for a while.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
And I don't know, I thought maybe just to begin, kind of give us a bit of a sense of

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,280
your background and how this has become of interest to you. Did you always know you want

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,560
to become a doctor?

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,240
So thanks for having me. I'm super excited to be on the show finally. So it's an interesting

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,440
question. I'm going to say I always wanted to be a doctor, sparing the fact that when

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,320
I was younger, I thought maybe I'd be a singer or a mermaid or something crazy like that.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,000
I loved scuba diving, so I had a large fantasy.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,120
That's a good point. Mermaid can combine the love for scuba diving with singing. It's

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,720
like it really is the perfect career.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,920
It was the perfect career for me. But no, I was always a nerd, actually. I don't know

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,520
if I'm allowed to say this, but in high school, the quarterback of the football team joked

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,920
and said that I was a waste of pretty because I never went to any parties. And all I did

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,240
was study. I was obsessed with biology and obsessed with chemistry and was a bookworm

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,880
pretty much.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,280
And did the brain always interest you? Did you always have a sense? I mean, so I found

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,680
that interesting subset of people when they go to medical school already know what they're

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,440
going to do. Many people do not. Were you that person who when interviewing for medical

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,200
school knew you wanted to do neurology?

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,160
No, not at all, actually. So I'm a first generation American. My dad and mom both didn't give

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,440
me a lot of coaching when I was growing up. But one thing that they taught me was whatever

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,240
you're going to do, just love it because you're going to do it for the rest of your life.

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,160
And when I was in medical school, I just loved learning. So I loved every single subject.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,880
But when I got into the clinical rotations, I found myself a little disappointed in them

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,720
because I wasn't interested in the algorithms of the disease and the actual treatments that

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,400
were being offered. And when I was thinking about things like prevention or exercise or

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,520
diet, I pretty much just got shunned. So when I was thinking about specialties, I thought about

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,200
what could I read for the rest of my life and be fascinated by. And that was pretty much the brain

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,680
for me.

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:31,640
Now, a lot of people will say neurology is a pretty depressing specialty because a lot of the

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:40,360
patients you're caring for have conditions that can't really be reversed. So at least in my med

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,000
school, neurology was not a core rotation. We were not required to do it. So I assume that was the

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,840
same for you when you did it as an elective.

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Yes, I did it as an elective. And it is so depressing. Most of these diseases,

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,880
almost all of them, we don't have effective treatments for sparing things like migraines

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,720
and MS now, but kleoblastoma, terrible disease, terrible treatment options. Not much has changed

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,960
in the field. And when you think about things like neurodegenerative disease, which is ultimately

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,560
what I went into, the diseases are devastating for both the patients and their families.

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,960
Now you did your neurology residency at Cornell, which is how you met our mutual friend,

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,640
Richard Isaacson. And that's, of course, how we became connected. And then you did a fellowship

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,520
at Mount Sinai in movement disorders specifically.

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Yes.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,720
I want to take a step back and make sure people, including myself, understand the breadth of this

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,840
field called neurodegeneration. So when you look at the actuarial statistics of mortality,

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,120
neurodegeneration accounts for the third leading cause of death. So you have all of the diseases

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,120
that are lumped under ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

49
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,600
That's number one. Cancer is number two. And then neurodegenerative disease is number three.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,560
And those three basically account for, sorry, there's one other, which actually, no, no,

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,920
those do account, those are the top three. And I think they account for 70% of death.

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,920
Quite a sobering thought. Now, within neurodegenerative disease, you have a lot of different

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,320
types of pathology, some of which we've spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,520
We've talked a lot about Alzheimer's disease. We're going to talk about that again today.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,840
But what I want to do today is be more broad, because in getting to know you, I've come to

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,200
understand that there are some of these diseases that affect men more than women. And we have a

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,600
far better sense of how to discriminate between these diseases than I used to think we did. I

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,160
used to think that, for example, Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia could only be

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,920
distinguished on an autopsy. They couldn't be distinguished clinically. I used to never think

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,760
about Parkinson's disease in the same way that I would think about, say, a cognitive disease.

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,520
And I really, until recently, never understood the differences in the patterns of where the

62
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,720
disease occurred in the brain and how that translated to deficits. Now, the other day,

63
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,880
you explained to me in a way that I thought was so elegant, looking at the different parts of the

64
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,920
brain. Maybe you could sort of rehash some of that for folks. Yeah. So let's take a step back

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,680
and talk about dementia, which is an umbrella term, and then a further step back, which is

66
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,880
neurodegeneration, which encompasses dementias and other processes like Parkinson's disease.

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,480
So when we think about neurodegeneration, everyone thinks about Alzheimer's disease because it's the

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,560
most prevalent and chances are, you know, somebody who was affected by this disease. But the other

69
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,560
diseases that we're going to talk about today are also very common and you've probably never heard

70
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,160
of them, but you should because there's a reasonable likelihood that they will affect you at some point

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,560
in your life or a loved one. So when we think about dementia, we're going to talk about

72
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,080
what falls under that umbrella. We have Alzheimer's disease, we have vascular dementia, we have

73
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,440
Lewy body dementia, frontal temporal dementia. But when we think about neurodegeneration as a

74
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,280
more broad term, we start thinking about diseases like Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,

75
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,760
ALS, and then more rare diseases like progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy,

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:35,720
cortical basilar degeneration. So taking a step back in terms of understanding what these diseases

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,920
are and what symptoms people may present at, I like to look at it as what part of the brain

78
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,960
is this affecting? So neurodegeneration means death of the brain cells. Where is that death

79
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,880
happening? So for things like frontal temporal dementia or vascular dementia, you're talking

80
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:03,480
about the frontal lobe primarily and the frontal lobe is involved in processes such as planning

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,040
events, problem solving, speed of processing. These are all executive lobe functions. When we think about

82
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,240
Alzheimer's disease, we're thinking about the temporal lobe. That's where the degeneration

83
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,520
is mainly happening and that's mainly a memory problem, but it's also a language problem.

84
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,360
The language center is in the temporal lobe. For diseases like Lewy body, we're thinking about the

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,400
parietal and occipital lobe. The parietal and occipital lobe are involved with visual spatial

86
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,760
processing. So you get symptoms like issues with depth perception, issues following plot lines of

87
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,880
movies or following plot lines of books. Patients will have to reread passages over again to really

88
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,480
fully comprehend what's happening. And hallucinations is something that you can see later in the disease

89
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,480
course. And is the difficulty with depth perception part of what feeds into the movement disorder

90
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,480
that we see that kind of differentiates Lewy body from AD? Yeah, I really think so. And it's

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,240
interesting and we'll talk about this later. So maybe we'll sticky note it for now. But visual

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,320
impairment is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. And how does that relate to how we can

93
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:25,800
prevent these diseases? Well, it's possible that the visual processing is needed to reinforce the

94
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,800
neuronal circuitry. And what I mean by that is our brain needs sensory input. It needs sensory

95
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,440
stimulation. When we don't have that, those neuronal circuits aren't getting exercised, for lack of a

96
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:46,760
better term, and they're more likely to atrophy. So if you don't use it, you lose it. And so in

97
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,800
relation to your question, yes, I think that that visual processing is why you have the depth

98
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,760
perception issues that you see in Lewy body. So I definitely will make a note of that because I want

99
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,240
to come back to not just the visual part, but the auditory part as well. Yes, I want to go back to

100
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,160
something you mentioned at the outset. You talked about how vascular dementia overlaps with frontal

101
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,040
dementia. What is it about that when I think of vascular dementia, in my mind, I'm thinking of

102
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,000
small vessel disease that's similar to atherosclerotic disease, basically some form of

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,160
ischemia. Why is that unique to the frontal cortex? And why is that not something that,

104
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,680
you know, the rest of the brain is just as sensitive to? So I actually think vascular

105
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,200
dementia and Alzheimer's dementia are the ones that overlap more. And the reason I say that is

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,880
because it's very difficult to discern clinically the difference between Alzheimer's and vascular

107
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,920
dementia. We classically will say, yes, the speed of processing issues are more prevalent in vascular

108
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,320
dementia versus Alzheimer's disease. It's more of a memory issue. But when we're looking at

109
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,880
metabolic changes in the brain, we see that the frontal lobe is hypometabolic in terms of glucose

110
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,080
utilization, in frontotemporal dementia, and in vascular dementia. And why is that? It's hard to

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:21,640
know exactly, but it may have something to do with the vasculature of the brain and what areas of the

112
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,720
brain are more sensitive to glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and vascular risk factors.

113
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,360
Yeah, it's very interesting because there is such a high association with diabetes

114
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,320
and this condition, but my recollection is that the brain doesn't require insulin the way the rest

115
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,120
of the body does to facilitate glucose transport into neurons. In other words, insulin resistance

116
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,080
per se should not be an issue in the brain proper. But of course, I've seen experimental data that

117
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,160
look at intranasal insulin injections that temporarily alleviate some of the symptoms

118
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,280
associated with this type of dementia, suggesting that maybe insulin resistance is playing a role

119
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,680
paradoxically. And of course, you always have to wonder if the metabolic syndrome that is associated

120
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,640
with type 2 diabetes in that entire spectrum is simply a marker of the underlying vascular

121
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:21,160
problems as well. So this is an area at Kellyanne where I really find myself confused. In the end,

122
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,360
it might not matter that much from a preventative strategy, but nevertheless, it creates a little

123
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,640
bit of confusion in terms of mechanism of action, at least in my naive mind. It's really interesting

124
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,920
clinically when you look at data. So we do cognitive testing on a ton of patients. So we

125
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,440
get to look at this in real time and we get to compare it to serum biomarkers. So thinking about

126
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,200
high cholesterol, meaning high ApoB, when we see high ApoB in patients, we often do see reduced

127
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,080
speed of processing. And clinically, we see that if you correct things like the ApoB, you see

128
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,520
improvement in speed of processing. Tell me about the time course there. Yeah, it can happen

129
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,480
rather quickly over a course of six months, but it's dependent on the person. That's kind of

130
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,680
amazing. I mean, obviously, we take this approach with patients, but a lot of our patients that are

131
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,520
in our practice don't really have the MCI that you were seeing in your clinic. The patients that you

132
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:29,160
and Richard took care of at Cornell were obviously far more advanced. And is there a point at which

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,520
you just didn't see any improvement in symptoms regardless of intervention? So like I said,

134
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,080
everyone's different and there are a lot of different factors that could influence something

135
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,240
like executive function and speed of processing. I think what's most helpful is looking at an

136
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,640
individual and putting their lab values and an understanding of what their risk factors are next

137
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:59,080
to each other. Because if you see somebody who, for example, does have out of control cholesterol

138
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,680
and you're looking at their executive function in tasks like generating words that start with

139
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,560
F or A or S, that's a really popular test that gives us clues into is the vascular risk factor

140
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,000
affecting this person's cognition. If you see that, the chance that you intervene on their

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,440
cholesterol and they have a notable outcome in the next 6, 12, 18 months is pretty high, but it

142
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,800
depends on the person. And it also depends on what other factors are playing a role. For example,

143
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:37,160
sleep. Sleep is huge and I can't emphasize enough how important sleep is to speed of processing. If

144
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:45,160
you are getting shit crap sleep, sorry, you really aren't going to see high speed of processing. You

145
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,160
really have to be sleeping in order to process information. So I want to put a pin in that as

146
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,320
well because I do want to come back to sleep staging. We've obviously separately and previously

147
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,560
talked a lot about REM sleep disruption and the implications for that. So I want to come back to

148
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,320
sleep, but let's go back to kind of this broader sense of what's going on. So you have sort of

149
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,520
these three areas of the brain that can be impacted that can lead to various types of

150
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:23,720
dementia. And each of them seems horrible in their own right. Ironically, Alzheimer's seems the least

151
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:31,480
horrible in that it's mostly a deficit of memory and language relative to robbing you of executive

152
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,800
function processing speed in the front of the brain and movement disorders and visual disorders

153
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,760
in the back of the brain. But to be sure, these are all awful conditions.

154
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Let's talk a little bit about some of the things that we think about more with respect to movement.

155
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,520
So Parkinson's disease and obviously perhaps the worst disease of them all, ALS.

156
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,800
So ALS and Parkinson's disease are very different because ALS is more of a peripheral nerve problem.

157
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,040
Parkinson's disease is more of a central problem more related to Lewy body.

158
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,880
ALS is really rare. Only about 18,000 people in the US have ALS. Unlike Parkinson's disease,

159
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,720
which is much more common, a million people in the US have Parkinson's disease and the incidence of

160
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,840
Parkinson's disease is actually doubled in the last 25 years. It's the fastest growing neurological

161
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,880
condition in- And just for comparison, how many people in the United States carry a diagnosis of

162
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,960
Alzheimer's disease? About 6 million. Okay. So 6 million to 1 million to 18,000.

163
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,240
For Lewy body, it's about 1.4 million. So less common than Alzheimer's disease, but still-

164
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,960
That's actually pretty common. That's 25% of it.

165
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,120
Right, but still very common. So still a reasonable likelihood that someone listening

166
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,800
to this podcast today is going to be affected by one of these diseases, ALS less so. But the

167
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
interesting thing about ALS is that there's a connection between ALS and frontal temporal

168
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,680
dementia. So there are certain genetic risk factors. One is C9 ORF, is what I say, C9ORF.

169
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,360
It puts people at risk for both ALS and frontal temporal dementia. So some family members will

170
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,960
have the frontal temporal dementia and other family members will have ALS. We don't know what turns

171
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,320
one person to develop the more peripheral nerve problem versus the more central nerve problem,

172
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,240
but it's an interesting connection that you'll see. Now Parkinson's, again, I didn't realize it

173
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,520
was quite that prevalent. So is it a different disease when it occurs in young people than when

174
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,840
it occurs in older people, or is it basically the same disease and it just has a variable time of

175
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:48,680
onset? So we, in my opinion, aren't very good at the way we're diagnosing these diseases. So we're

176
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,400
using a clinical diagnosis to say somebody has Parkinson's disease. So you need to have

177
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,480
resting tremor, bradykinesia, which is slow movements, rigidity, which is stiffness of the

178
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:09,480
muscles, and or postural instability. So falling, not being steady on your feet. That is a really

179
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,960
rudimentary way of looking at the disease. Yes, it's saying that there's something going on in

180
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,920
the brain that you're losing dopamine neurons, but really these diseases are starting way, way,

181
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,560
way before those symptoms are actually presenting. So if you look at people who have REM sleep

182
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,400
behavior disorder, which is acting out your dreams, so punching, kicking, screaming in your sleep,

183
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:44,600
that is over 90% positive predictive value that you will go on to develop either a Parkinson's

184
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:52,120
or Lewy body-like disease. And that starts 20 to 30 years before a tremor or muscle stiffness

185
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,320
or postural instability will ever present. Wait, that's going to be a little scary to

186
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,800
some people because I think a lot of us think, boy, I move around a lot in my sleep, but

187
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,320
how is this diagnosis made? Is it relying on a spouse or someone in the bed with you,

188
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,960
or is it something that can only be done with polysomnography? So the gold standard is

189
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,720
polysomnography, but you actually don't need polysomnography to diagnose it. And in fact,

190
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,280
one simple question has a greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity for picking up

191
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,520
REM sleep behavior disorder, which is does your bed partner know that you are punching,

192
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,640
kicking, or moving a lot in your sleep? And when we're saying moving a lot, we're not just talking

193
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,680
about tossing and turning, we're talking about it's clear that this person is having some sort

194
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,760
of dream and they are acting that out in their sleep. It's different than just the tossing and

195
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,760
turning. And to be clear, are you saying that if that exists, so if someone in their 30s is experiencing

196
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,320
that there's roughly a 90% chance they're going to go on to develop Parkinson's disease or Lewy

197
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,280
body dementia? Correct. And it's a terrifying fact. It is a terrifying fact. But the way that

198
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:17,160
I think about it is knowing that is like picking up breast cancer when it's localized to the breast

199
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,160
tissue. The way that we're doing it now, we're picking up Parkinson's disease by the time we get

200
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,960
the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. So by the time someone has tremor rigidity, pretty good.

201
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,120
Yeah, it's like diagnosing metastatic breast cancer.

202
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,400
Yes, 50% of the dopamine producing brain cells are already gone.

203
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Okay, so let's actually tell people a little bit about what's going on in Parkinson's disease.

204
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,480
So let's explain what dopamine is in the basal ganglia and all these things so that people

205
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,560
understand how that happens. And so let's spend three minutes on just the med school explanation.

206
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,680
Because I think it's important to understand a little bit about the anatomy and the neurobiology

207
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,920
of this to understand the prevention stuff that we're going to want to talk about. So what's

208
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:07,640
happening in Parkinson's disease? So rudimentary medical school 101,

209
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,680
what is happening in Parkinson's disease? So dopamine producing brain cells, so dopaminergic

210
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:23,320
cells live in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is a center

211
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,040
that controls movement in the body. These cells are dark colored. And in Parkinson's disease,

212
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,880
these cells start to die, you need dopamine. So these cells produce dopamine, you need dopamine

213
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,640
to move. But you also need dopamine for a slew of other neurological processes, including mood

214
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,640
regulation. So if you don't have adequate dopamine, you often suffer from anxiety and depression.

215
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,800
So do we have any sense of what leads to the loss of those cells?

216
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,040
So what are the risk factors for Parkinson's disease is what you're asking.

217
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,640
Yeah, or even just more pathologically, like, for example, has it been ruled out that it's

218
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,280
autoimmune? Is there any reason to believe that the immune system is attacking those cells and

219
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:16,040
destroying them? Is it, you know, does it seem to be unaffected by anything else? Is it programmed

220
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,680
cell death, presumably not? Is it inflammatory? Is it is it an inflammatory environment that

221
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,640
destroys those dopamine producing cells? Do we have some sense of what it is mechanistically

222
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,320
that's doing this? So the immune system and inflammation seem to play a large role here,

223
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:39,480
but it may be more related to the mitochondria and the lysosome function. So autophagy and

224
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,560
removing damaged organellis seems to play a really big role in these diseases.

225
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,000
Which seems to be a common thread across all of neurodegeneration. We've talked about this on a

226
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,560
previous podcast with Eileen White. It's probably been two and a half years ago, but one of the

227
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,520
surest ways to impart neurodegenerative disease onto a mouse is to knock out the genes responsible

228
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:07,000
for autophagy. They'll basically also come to neurodegeneration. I want to say it's something

229
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,360
as absurd as at four months of age. Now four months for a mouse, right? That's the equivalent of,

230
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:20,360
I don't know, probably 15 or 20 years old for a human, maybe less. And to think that if the only

231
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,080
thing you've done is knock out autophagy, you might argue, well, they would have gotten other

232
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,360
diseases later on, but that the very first thing that they get and the thing that ultimately kills

233
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,000
them as neurodegeneration probably speaks to the importance of this process in homeostasis within

234
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,080
the brain. Absolutely. And I mean, we don't have perfect models for Parkinson's disease because the

235
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,640
models that we use are either models that are induced by toxic exposures or genetic models,

236
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,160
which there's no one size fits all. I think this disease is just so broad and can present in many

237
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,960
different ways and can have many different etiologies. But if you look at the genetic

238
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,920
models for the disease, really one of the main genes is called GBA. And what happens is that

239
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:16,440
enzyme gets stuck, the glucose cerebrocytes enzyme gets stuck in the endoplasmic reticulum and it

240
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,840
can't break down glucose fingocines. So you're not getting these chemicals broken down where

241
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,920
they should be. They start building up and when they start building up, the lysosome can't get to

242
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,640
these substances to break them down appropriately. So the lysosomal function is really impaired.

243
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,200
And once you start impairing the lysosomal function, then the mitochondria becomes affected,

244
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,600
then you start triggering a whole slew of inflammatory cytokines and the process just

245
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,880
is a vicious cycle. Two questions then, you can take them in whichever order you like.

246
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,160
We have a sense of what are the causative triggers, not just associative. What are the causative

247
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,040
triggers of Parkinson's disease? We should talk about the same for Lewy body, of course, as well.

248
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:13,400
But let's just focus on one. And secondly, if you're talking to that person who's 40 years old,

249
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:21,000
who is having the sleep disturbances that we now think have a high likelihood of predicting

250
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:29,880
the beginning of this damage, what do you do? So this is touching on so many points. So if you

251
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:37,320
want to first start with what is triggering the disease, well, we don't have the perfect answer,

252
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:44,680
but we know certain things do trigger it or seem to play a role. So pesticide exposure

253
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,600
seems to play a role. Solvent exposure. Which pesticides do we know? Yeah. So it's Paraquat

254
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:59,400
and Rodinone, which Rodinone is not used in the US anymore, but Paraquat is still used in the US.

255
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,960
So we see a higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease in people who live in more rural places

256
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,080
in the US. And if you look at epidemiological studies on where is Parkinson's disease

257
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,120
distributed in the US, you'll see there is a quote, Parkinson's disease belt,

258
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,720
and it really runs through the Midwest. Of course, the USDA and the FDA would never acknowledge this

259
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,240
because they would have to say that this is just noise and that there's no data there,

260
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,240
or they would have banned this pesticide. So what is it that you think that they don't see

261
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,720
in those data? Or how are they explaining that away as a confounder for something else?

262
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,600
You know, I don't think I have a very good answer to that. I don't know why they don't acknowledge

263
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,480
that these studies are real and these associations are pretty profound. There's clearly just like

264
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,960
there's a stroke belt in the South. There's a Parkinson's disease belt in the Midwest.

265
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,440
What are these pesticides used for? Agricultural farming.

266
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,800
Any foods in particular? Is it?

267
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,480
I don't know.

268
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,120
Okay. And you probably don't know if there's substitutes that could be used at a slightly

269
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,360
higher cost that are less toxic.

270
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,920
I'm not sure.

271
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,960
Are these pesticides in greater use today? What explains the fact that you said earlier,

272
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,360
Parkinson's is the fastest growing neurodegenerative condition in the US?

273
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,120
Yeah, great question. And there have been a lot of theories hypothesizing why the prevalence of

274
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:40,440
Parkinson's disease will grow in the future. And one of them, which makes me laugh a little bit,

275
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,960
is smoking. So smoking is quote, protective against Parkinson's disease. It's like one of those weird

276
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,800
things that you read about and you're like, oh, wait, why? Just like I think inflammatory

277
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,240
bowel disease also smoking is quote, protective against it. And they're saying, well, less people

278
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,800
are smoking now. So maybe that's what's driving the disease. But I don't really buy into that

279
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,640
because I don't really think smoking is offering that much protection to your brain. And it's doing

280
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,480
so many other terrible things for your brain and body that it's just not something to ever consider

281
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,280
when we're thinking about ways to optimize our health. I actually think it has a lot to do with

282
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,200
the movements that we're going through day to day and how much screen time we're spending every day.

283
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,440
But we can touch more on that later.

284
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,640
So you think it's a loss of movement capacity, basically?

285
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,400
Exactly. And just like we were talking about, or I think Richard talked about it in his podcast,

286
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,080
the idea of cognitive reserve, building as much cognitive reserve as possible. Well, you want the

287
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,800
same with your body. You want to build up as much movement reserve as possible because if you don't

288
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,840
use it, you lose it. And the less you move, the more likely you are to develop one of these

289
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,480
neurodegenerative movement processes, I believe. How many of those cases of Parkinson's disease

290
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,960
percent wise do we think have a clear genetic predisposition? And you mentioned one gene already.

291
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,800
We were going to talk a lot about the genes around Alzheimer's disease. What does the genetic

292
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:33,800
landscape look like here? So right now, we say 10% of Parkinson's disease is related to a clear

293
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:40,440
genetic etiology. GBA is one gene. LARC2, L-R-R-K2 is another one. And both of these

294
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,440
genes are tested in 23andMe, only one variant of each. So it's not a perfect test. So if it's

295
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,280
negative for you, it doesn't really mean you don't have a variant in one of these genes,

296
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,840
but those are the most common. There are other less common.

297
00:28:52,840 --> 00:29:00,680
And are these more like ApoE4 where they are risk factors, but they're not fully penetrant

298
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,280
in the way that Huntington's is? Yes. Exactly. So if you have one of these genes,

299
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,480
it depends on a lot of factors, especially ancestry. So Ashkenazi Jewish people with Ashkenazi

300
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,080
Jewish ancestry have a higher risk that these genes will express, but we're looking at penetrants of

301
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,960
around 30%, but for LARC2, it can be much higher up to 80%. Some studies quote actually 100%

302
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,240
depending on how long you live, but I don't know if I believe it.

303
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,480
Okay. But not a huge, you said that's 10%. 10%. Yeah. Whereas in Alzheimer's disease,

304
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,760
two thirds of cases have E4, at least one copy of E4. So you could say E4 is playing a bigger role

305
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:53,560
there potentially. Yeah. I would say that our understanding of Parkinson's disease is so far

306
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,680
behind our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. And our understanding of the genetic architecture

307
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,200
of it is so far behind. I would say that we're probably at least 10 years behind the field of

308
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,600
Alzheimer's disease. And we will identify more genetic risk factors for this disease. I have

309
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,480
no doubt about it because the number of patients that I've seen that have a clear family history

310
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,320
and multiple family members and testing for every known gene that we could has just turned up

311
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,400
nothing. There's clearly something there that we are missing. Yeah. So again, we see this also with

312
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,840
breast cancer. We see women in whom breast cancer runs in the family up and down sideways, and they

313
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,560
test negative for every known gene associated. But you've got to tell that woman, your daughter's at

314
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,600
risk, even though we can't identify what the genes are. Yeah. Which makes it really challenging as a

315
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,240
provider because we love looking at genes because it gives us a clue to what the possible underlying

316
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,160
pathophysiological mechanism that may be driving the disease that they may be at risk for. When

317
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,920
we don't have that to grab onto, we're really grabbing at straws and just throwing everything

318
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,200
under the kitchen sink at a person because we don't really have a good clear sense of what

319
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:18,600
pathway they're on. So what would you say to that person who's 40, who's having these sleep

320
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,480
disturbances? But while they're awake, everything is totally fine. So the idea here being that those

321
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,360
sleep disturbances are the canary in the coal mine for this problem occurring in their brain.

322
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:41,160
What do you say to that patient as far as steps to take to maximize the odds of avoidance or at

323
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:48,120
least maximal delaying? So again, there's no one size fits all here. So it really depends on the

324
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,640
person. And the first thing I would want to do is definitely check out their genes. But besides that.

325
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,080
So let's say you do this and they don't test positive for either of these two genes.

326
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,080
And yeah, let's just let's say you have access to everything. What do you want to know? What else

327
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,520
do I know about this person? What toxic exposures could they have? Or did they grow up? Were they

328
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,120
drinking well water? Were they drinking city water? All those things matter. So let's say

329
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,880
they grew up on a farm, but now they don't live anywhere near it. So their exposure is in the past.

330
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:29,560
It's no longer present. And let's assume that there's nothing that's actively contributing

331
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,000
to it from a from an exposure standpoint. And now you're just kind of going on defense as far

332
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,240
as what you can do. Okay, so first and foremost, a movement assessment is absolutely key. So

333
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,040
the one thing that I think is so fascinating about this disease is that we see abnormal

334
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:55,800
movement patterns in these patients years and years before tremor, slow movement start. And

335
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:03,320
the patterns that we see are very similar among people. So most frequently, and maybe we should

336
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,720
rewind a little bit here. So our bodies are naturally asymmetric, just like our brains are

337
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,000
naturally asymmetric, we have despite the way they look, our bodies look symmetric, our brains look

338
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,440
symmetric, but we know that the right side of the brain has certain functions and the left side of

339
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,040
the brain has certain functions. So the left side is really a language, verbal side, and the right

340
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:34,440
side is more of a visual side, emotional side. We have a dominance for one hand and one leg. So in

341
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,720
people who are right handed, which is most people, we'll see the symptoms start of Parkinson's disease

342
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,720
start in the dominant hand and be most severe in the dominant hand. So taking into account someone's

343
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,160
handedness, the pattern of movement that we usually see is patients don't really load the

344
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:59,800
left leg and they won't spend time on the left leg. So most of their time is spent on the right leg

345
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:07,560
and they can't really sense or get a good sense of grounding through the left leg. And the right arm

346
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:15,960
is stiff and not swinging very freely when they're walking. That is something if you see

347
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:23,800
REM sleep behavior and this abnormal movement pattern, I want to deconstruct their movement

348
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:30,360
and make them sense on the left side and free up the right side, which often starts with breathing

349
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,760
because they're also not really breathing into the right apical lung or the right lung at all. So

350
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,200
first deconstructing that into what is their abnormal breathing pattern and how can we get

351
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,760
them to feel on the left side and move the right side more freely. So obviously this overlaps a lot

352
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,800
with stuff that Beth Lewis and I talk about and you and Beth, of course, are very close and work

353
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:04,520
together with patients as well. Is the idea here that you can start to train out the pathology,

354
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,880
if that makes sense? Yeah, I think I like the way you put that, train out the pathology.

355
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,720
I think that everyone has asymmetries in their body. The problem is when that asymmetry goes

356
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,960
too far in one extreme and that can happen for a lot of different reasons. It may be triggered by

357
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:31,400
an orthopedic injury. For me, for example, I actually noticed this. So I had a spinal fusion

358
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,720
when I was just a teenager and I thought I was totally fine until my med school boyfriend took

359
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:44,520
me skiing and I realized I could not control my right leg. No matter what I did, I couldn't

360
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:53,160
get my brain to talk to my right leg to make my right leg internally rotate. And that showed me

361
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:01,480
that there is some poor control between my leg and my brain. That neuronal circuitry is just not

362
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:08,120
developed appropriately and that's what you're trying to reinforce because by building up

363
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:15,080
stronger circuitry between all aspects of your toes, your fingers, your breath, that's how you're

364
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:21,000
training out these abnormal movements. But in a sense, it's not really training it out. It's

365
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,440
reinforcing the movements that you may have neglected because you just swung so far in one

366
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,360
direction, either left or right. Let's assume that you proceed through that. You do the

367
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,520
assessment. You find some of these early warning signs. You begin to work on the training.

368
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,480
What else can you do to, again, let's not necessarily even use the word prevent,

369
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:52,440
but delay the onset of this. So in association with the REM sleep behavior disorder,

370
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,320
patients aren't getting a lot of REM sleep. So I think sleep tracking is really huge in these

371
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:06,440
patients. So you know better than I do even that different sleep stages affect different functions

372
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:13,160
in the body. REM sleep is really important for not just memory formation, but also dealing with

373
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,080
your emotions. That's how our bodies handle anxiety, depression, stress throughout the day.

374
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,680
These patients often have a lot of anxiety and a lot of depression and often aren't getting

375
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,280
enough REM sleep. So optimizing their sleep with simple sleep hygiene is huge.

376
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,840
One of the things I tend to worry about with sleep trackers is that they can create more anxiety.

377
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:44,760
And so my fear with that is you take that patient who's probably by now pretty nervous and you say,

378
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,840
we're going to start tracking your sleep and lo and behold, oh, your REM sleep is quite

379
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:56,040
interrupted. Is that a good piece of information to have? So I think it's a good piece of information.

380
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,680
I agree. There is a person for a sleep tracker and there is a person that should not have a

381
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,560
sleep tracker because they're just going to enter a vicious cycle. But knowing that they aren't

382
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,520
getting enough REM sleep is really huge specifically for Parkinson's disease. So we know that the

383
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,280
melatonin signaling pathway in Parkinson's disease is off and they've actually done studies

384
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,240
where they put people in front of bright lights. So light box therapy for Parkinson's disease

385
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,160
early in the morning, 20 to 30 minutes a day, 10,000 lux. And that actually helps regulate the

386
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,440
melatonin signaling cycle and helps improve REM sleep in these patients. So knowing that,

387
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,280
I think it could change outcomes. Yeah. I'm going to be having Matt Walker back on the podcast in a

388
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,640
few months and we're going to go into much, much more detail about both the pharmacology and the

389
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,520
supplement side of how you can augment various sleep stages. Matt's helped me a lot with this

390
00:38:50,520 --> 00:39:00,680
kind of stuff. So the other question I suppose I have, you mentioned anxiety. How do we know which

391
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:08,920
one's the chicken, which one's the egg here? You know, by the time somebody is even told this

392
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,600
information, even if they're completely asymptomatic, it seems to me that that would

393
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,360
produce anxiety. And so how do we know that the anxiety was playing a causal role versus

394
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:26,360
it's just the response to what's happening. So from personal experience, if you just talk to

395
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,800
patients, a lot of them will tell you I've never been an anxious person, but in the last five years,

396
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,600
my anxiety is just through the roof. And I think it has something to do with the dopamine signaling.

397
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:47,400
So if you think about, is it a chicken or the egg thing in terms of sleep, that's another question

398
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,160
because yeah, that's the sleep is promoting anxiety. If you're not getting enough REM sleep,

399
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,120
you're not dealing with the anxiety. So that's a whole cycle. But-

400
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,840
And again, we know that, again, whether it be dementia or Parkinson's disease,

401
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,160
these things disrupt sleep. Of course. And disrupting sleep maybe makes them worse.

402
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:13,080
Exactly. Exactly. But knowing that you may be at risk for one of these diseases, I mean,

403
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:21,400
this is what we see every day, whether it's a risk factor in terms of a genetic risk factor or a

404
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:30,280
prodromal symptom in terms of REM sleep behavior. I think knowing the data doesn't tell you anything

405
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,920
in terms of what's going to happen to you as an individual. We haven't ever tried to do anything

406
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,360
for people who have REM sleep behavior disorder. Just like previously, we didn't try to do anything

407
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:49,800
for people who had an APOE gene, an APOE4 gene. We just kind of thought, well, they're at a higher

408
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,800
risk for dementia and we're just going to let them be at that risk. Well, this is our opportunity

409
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,360
to do something about it because ultimately our treatment options once 50% of your dopaminergic

410
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:08,680
cells are dead aren't so good. We're just giving people back levodopa. That isn't going to change

411
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:17,400
the outcomes that this person ultimately is facing. But maybe starting earlier, knowing that this is a

412
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,840
red flag, maybe we are going to delay onset of full-blown symptoms or maybe we're going to slow

413
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:32,440
the loss and maybe at that point the dopaminergic cells could be reversed. We could repair the

414
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,280
damage that's done or at least if we can't, we can stop any more from happening and they may never

415
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,080
get the disease. Well, that last one is certainly interesting if we believe that we have a sense of

416
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:52,280
what the environmental trigger is. Of course, it seems to me that, well, I don't actually know how

417
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:00,200
the NIH is allocating resources to the biology of this disease. I can't comment as to whether

418
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,240
it's adequately funded or inadequately funded, but it would seem to me until we have a very clear

419
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,360
sense of what's happening at the cellular level with the dopamin-producing cells, that's the thing

420
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:18,280
we want to be able to halt. It's great to now shift our mindset from diagnosing breast cancer

421
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,720
when it's metastatic to when it's a one centimeter early lesion, but at least with breast cancer,

422
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,680
we know what to do when it's early. You cut the damn thing out, done. We knew that 200 years ago,

423
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:41,880
probably longer. Certainly in the 17th century, 18th century, we knew removing and by the 19th

424
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,400
century, the late 19th century, we actually had perfected the sterile way to do this.

425
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:52,360
That's what we're still missing, I think, here is. Step one is we now think we can figure this out

426
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,400
20 years before it's happening. Step two is removing the causative agent.

427
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,320
Right. There's no way to cut this out. We're not looking at a tumor that we can cut out, but

428
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:13,480
we also haven't ever studied doing anything this early, which is a huge loss in my opinion,

429
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,280
because we know that these people are at risk. We should be doing things. Even if we're only

430
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,120
moving the needle a small amount by certain lifestyle interventions or supplements,

431
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:32,680
which we know also play a role in disease risk, specifically B vitamins, then we're moving the

432
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,600
needle maybe just a little bit, but maybe a little bit at the right time actually moves the needle

433
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:44,840
a large amount. Yeah. Again, and I think we can think about that, like how do we do that clinically

434
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,280
with our patients? It's one thing. I think the challenge is how do you scale that up to being

435
00:43:50,280 --> 00:44:03,800
the standard of care where without a biomarker, it's very difficult to do that because prevention

436
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:11,240
is too long a study. It's actually the one thing that has made our progress for ASCVD so great.

437
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,200
There's really two things. One is we have a really good biomarker in APO-B and LDLC.

438
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,920
LDLC being not quite as good, but still decent. Right. We have this causative agent. We have this

439
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,880
thing that is necessary, though not sufficient to cause the disease. When you have something like

440
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,840
that, you know almost without exception that lowering that thing will lower the incidence of

441
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,800
disease. Then it simply becomes a question of how long do you need to study it in your given

442
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,040
population to see the reduction. We don't have that biomarker here. Now we're going to talk about

443
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,520
Alzheimer's in a minute and we're going to talk about other potential biomarkers there. I'm very

444
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,680
curious to understand from you the utility that we think of, for example, serum amyloid or TAL.

445
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:06,440
Is there anything on the horizon with Parkinson's that we can even point to, be it radiographically,

446
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:13,080
be it certainly a blood biomarker would be the most desirable? Are there people working on this

447
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:20,120
sort of thing? We didn't really talk about the difference in terms of histopathology for these

448
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:26,680
diseases. Alzheimer's disease is what we call a tauopathy. You see a lot of amyloid and tau

449
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,280
proteins. Parkinson's disease, Lewy body, are called alpha synucleinopathies. A different toxic

450
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:41,080
protein builds up in these diseases. While we've advanced a lot in terms of our ability to develop

451
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:49,800
blood-based biomarkers for amyloid and tau, we haven't done so well in terms of alpha synuclein.

452
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,200
You can biopsy different parts of the body and get a good sense of alpha synuclein deposition.

453
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,120
There is a school of- An alpha synuclein being this other protein deposition.

454
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,120
Is it a misfolded protein? Yep, exactly. It's very similar to amyloid. It's analogous to amyloid. It

455
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:13,720
develops into little Lewy bodies that go into your brain cells, but also other parts of your body,

456
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,600
which is what I'll talk about in a second, and cause degeneration of brain cells.

457
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,720
Do we have the contrapositives? We know that there are lots of patients on autopsy that have

458
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,640
amyloid and tau who were cognitively normal. Sounds like we don't have the opposite. We don't

459
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,960
have people with Alzheimer's disease that are missing amyloid and tau. Is that correct? Yes.

460
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,680
Suggesting that amyloid and tau, if anything, are necessary, but clearly not sufficient.

461
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:50,040
What about on the other side with alpha synuclein? Do we know that there are people who live a normal

462
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,040
life with this present in old age, and at the time of their death, it's there as an incidental

463
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:05,080
finding? It's a good question, and I think there is a threshold before symptoms will present.

464
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:13,640
When we're looking at how much alpha synuclein, which will correlate to how many dopaminergic

465
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:20,600
cells have been lost, what is that number? How much deposition do you need for clinical symptoms

466
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:27,880
present? Yes. In answer to your question, there are studies that show there is alpha synuclein

467
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,200
deposits in this person's brain, in this person's gut, in this person's skin, in this person's

468
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,240
salivary glands, but this person didn't have Parkinson's disease. What if that person lived

469
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,280
five more years? Would they have Parkinson's disease? I don't know. Maybe.

470
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,840
Lots to unpack there. Is the alpha synuclein accumulation directly proportional to the

471
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,960
death of dopaminergic cells? Yes, pretty much. That means patients with Parkinson's presumably

472
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:00,440
have more of it than Lewy body? Not necessarily, because in Lewy body, you primarily have alpha

473
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,120
synuclein, but you can also have amyloid and tau accumulation. In Parkinson's disease, although

474
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:14,040
it's still considered an alpha synucleinopathy, you could have tau deposition. I like to view

475
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:20,840
these diseases as a continuum. I think the way that we have been trained to view these diseases

476
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:27,560
is just wrong. They are neurodegenerative processes, and the underlying mechanisms are

477
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,000
shared between all of them. That's why we really have to start viewing them as such related

478
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,600
diseases. Whether one person develops an alpha synuclein process or an amyloid tau process

479
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:48,840
is really less relevant in terms of what is the pathogenic mechanism that's driving that

480
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:56,120
abnormal protein to actually be deposited. Yes, that starts with adequate risk stratification,

481
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,280
risk assessment for a person, because it's clear that this person may be on the path to developing

482
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,960
an alpha synucleinopathy, but what's driving that? Well, it's still all a neuroinflammation

483
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:15,560
autophagy problem. Let's dial back and start more basically with what are the commonalities

484
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,480
between these diseases, and can we target one and affect the outcomes of many?

485
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,080
Let's not talk about Alzheimer's disease then. This is the elephant in the room.

486
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,280
At least 6 million people in the United States have it. That incidence also seems to be rising

487
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,680
disproportionately at the population. You always run into the question, are we just diagnosing it

488
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:46,920
more? Are people getting sicker? What's at the root of this? Let's not pick it up at the pathology.

489
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,960
Again, this is not really a movement disorder, therefore it's not really something where we see

490
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,400
the alpha synuclein accumulation. Everybody thinks of this as the lens of being an amyloid tau

491
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,920
problem. Maybe just let's explain to people again, what is amyloid? What is tau? Let's explain what

492
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,440
the APP protein is, and how does it get cleaved, and how does it turn into amyloid, etc.

493
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Toxic proteins, what are we looking at? Amyloid protein. Amyloid can be misfolded into things

494
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:25,800
called amyloid plaques. If they're not cleaved properly, they are sticky and they fold up into

495
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,960
cells in the brain and can cause a whole slew of problems including neurodegeneration. Tau is

496
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:38,440
something that will develop into an equivalent called a neurofibrillary tangle in cells. Alpha

497
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,280
synuclein on the other hand does the same thing, it develops into Lewy bodies. Basically, these are

498
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:56,280
physical structures. These are actual proteins that due to misfolding end up in, and do they end up

499
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,680
inside the neurons themselves? Do they end up adjacent to the neurons? Where do they actually

500
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:09,800
accumulate? Inside the neurons. Inside the neurons. I assume that the critical problem is the

501
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,520
relationship between that protein and the inflammatory state that comes with it, or does

502
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:20,840
the protein by itself interrupt the neuron minus the inflammation? That's a great question. Does the

503
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:27,800
protein change cell signaling? Is that what you're asking? Correct, by itself. Or is it the inflammatory

504
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,640
process that's triggering all of the problems? I'll give you the analogy. We know that cholesterol

505
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:41,080
by itself, when the ApoB particle carries the lipid, the sterile, into the sub endothelial space,

506
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:49,320
that's really not a big problem. When it gets oxidized there and the inflammatory response

507
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:57,320
comes to repair it paradoxically, that inflammatory response is what leads to the tissue damage

508
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,480
that results in atherosclerosis, that results in the plaque formation and ultimately the plaque

509
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:12,120
rupture. In that sense, our bodies are doing the damage to ourselves. I'm curious as to whether

510
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,320
that's the case in neurodegenerative disease. That's what I believe the case is. Whether or

511
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,880
not there's some contribution that is directly related to impaired cell signaling once these

512
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:31,320
proteins build up in the neurons, that's possible. But I think the bigger problem is what you just

513
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:39,640
pointed out, which is once these proteins develop, the whole inflammatory cascade that drives

514
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:46,520
neurodegeneration is the big problem. It's essentially our body's reaction to these proteins

515
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,480
being built up in the brain that are causing a problem.

516
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:58,040
Okay. Now, historically, this was something that you only got to figure out on autopsy.

517
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Person had dementia, you clinically thought they had dementia. Nobody was trying to distinguish

518
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:09,640
between frontotemporal, occipital, those are all details. This person was normal,

519
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:15,160
they're no longer normal. Maybe we'll do an autopsy on grandma and we'll figure out that

520
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,880
this is what she had. But a lot of that's changed recently. What's an amyloid PET scan

521
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:28,200
and how does that shed light on this? Let's even rewind it to just a regular PET scan.

522
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,920
An FDG PET scan, which is really helpful when we're thinking about this whole frontotemporal,

523
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:42,760
parietal, occipital pattern. Because if you get a FDG PET scan, you're looking at glucose

524
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,720
hypometabolism in the brain. Well, where is the brain hypometabolic?

525
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,120
Maybe I'll even just tell people what's going on. So FDG PET, you label glucose

526
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,320
with a radioisotope and when you inject it into them, the PET scanner is not an anatomic image

527
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,000
like an MRI or a CT scan. It's a functional image. It's just looking for glucose uptake.

528
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,320
Typically, when you do a PET scan, the brain really lights up the most because you're seeing

529
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:15,560
so much glucose trafficked to the brain relative to its size. And so what you're saying is hypometabolism

530
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:21,720
shows up as less signal in that area, which says, hey, there's less metabolic activity,

531
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,120
less glucose went to this part of the brain versus this part of the brain versus this part of the

532
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:33,400
brain. Correct. And that less glucose correlates to neurodegeneration in that part of the brain,

533
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,520
or at least eventual neurodegeneration in that part of the brain. So looking at patterns of

534
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:44,920
hypometabolism in the brain can be rather helpful in differentiating between things like Lewy body,

535
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,240
Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, because you see different patterns of glucose

536
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:55,960
hypometabolism. So that can be helpful, but it's not perfect. It doesn't tell you what the underlying

537
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,320
protein deposition is and if there's underlying protein deposition. And you can see abnormal

538
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:07,560
patterns, quote, abnormal as a part of normal aging. So metabolism in the brain changes as we

539
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:13,400
age, and that's not necessarily a pathology. It could be just a process, normal process of aging.

540
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:20,840
But an amyloid PET. So amyloid PETs, there are three different tracers that are available and

541
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:26,120
FDA approved now. Essentially, they all have the same sensitivity and specificity, but what you're

542
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,200
looking at with an amyloid PET is completely different than metabolism. You're actually

543
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:37,960
looking at a tracer that is tagging onto amyloid deposition in the brain and you're scoring what

544
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,480
that tracer looks like. So how diffuse is that uptake in the brain? And here it's the opposite.

545
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:51,400
You expect to see the area with pathology being the big signal as opposed to the lack of signal

546
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,520
being the pathology with the glucose PET. Correct, correct. So amyloid PETs can be helpful in terms

547
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:05,320
of showing us is there amyloid deposition in the brain, but there's a caveat there because

548
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:11,240
we can see amyloid deposition in the brain in cognitively normal people. And in fact,

549
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:17,560
amyloid is abnormal, but in many ways it's normal. I've read an interesting study and this is sort

550
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:23,720
of unrelated, but I can never get this fact out of my brain where they looked at young, healthy people

551
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:30,360
and young, healthy 30 or 40 year olds and they made them sleep deprived. So they said you couldn't

552
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:36,040
go to sleep. And then they did amyloid scans and CSF biomarkers for amyloid and found that after

553
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,560
a single night of sleep deprivation, amyloid deposition increased by 5%. Well, that's because

554
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:49,000
amyloid is present in everybody, but we just are able to clear it. Exactly. So say it, looking at

555
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,920
an image at one point in time and saying that there's amyloid building up in the brain,

556
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,400
does that mean that that person is on the path to Alzheimer's disease? If they're cognitively

557
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,920
normal, does that, what does that mean? Is that reversible? It doesn't really tell us very much

558
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:11,960
more information. Yeah. To me, this is the thing that I'm most intrigued by is what, what does it

559
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:18,600
mean that there are people, nevermind just having amyloid pet positivity, there are people who die.

560
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,840
And when you biopsy their brain, you can't really distinguish their brain from somebody who had all

561
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,600
simer's disease, from the amount of amyloid that's in there. There's, it's very difficult for a

562
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:33,960
pathologist to look at this and tell you what this person looked like when they were alive.

563
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,800
And that's different from the heart, right? A pathologist can look at your heart on autopsy

564
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,480
and can clearly distinguish who was healthy from who was not, which is not to say a pathologist in

565
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,040
a blinded fashion can tell you that this person had a heart attack. Because if they died quickly

566
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:58,040
enough, you might not see the damage. But it's, it's a stunning indictment of our ignorance of the

567
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:04,040
brain. And of the fact that the, not this, not to oversimplify the heart, but the heart in some ways

568
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:13,640
is an easier organ to understand. It, it behaves in a more mechanical way than the brain. But this

569
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:20,360
makes it very difficult then to really stratify risk in an individual. That's, that to me is like,

570
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:26,120
this is really less a philosophical discussion for me and more of a practical one, which is where do

571
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:33,000
we need to act and how do we need to act and how do we measure progress? Yeah. And like along the

572
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,880
same lines there is looking at amyloid in terms of what does that tell you about cognition? Because

573
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,560
the two could not be related at all. So someone could have a ton of amyloid deposition in their

574
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:52,840
brain and be cognitively normal, as you said, but does that mean that they're in this weird delicate

575
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,440
balance of if there is any more neurodegeneration or any more amyloid or any more tau, which we'll

576
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:04,520
talk about soon, build up that they're going to just fall off a cliff and symptoms will present.

577
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:11,160
Or does that mean nothing in terms of cognition? And this comes up a lot more recently with all of

578
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,040
the new studies. What are we looking at? Are we looking at amyloid deposition, amyloid biomarkers,

579
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,520
are we looking at people's cognition? What markers should we be following? And I think

580
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,840
you and I both agree that it really should be cognition. Yeah. And I want to, I've made a

581
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,560
note to actually come back to cognitive testing because I think it's super interesting. Let's,

582
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,000
let's go on to tau. Talk about these, these neurofibular rectangles and, and, you know,

583
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,760
where do we see them being distinct from amyloid? And then I want to come back and talk about

584
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:45,640
amyloid serum amyloid as well. And the advent of that in the past few years. So right at the start

585
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:54,040
of COVID sometime in 2020, they FDA approved a tau scan. So there isn't a tau scan. It, again,

586
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,440
both amyloid and tau scans are not covered by insurance. So the clinical utility of these

587
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,080
scans is pretty low just because the cost of them is so high. It costs several thousands of

588
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:09,720
dollars to get these scans to pay out of pocket, but tau scans are. And there are a ton of radiation.

589
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,480
So these aren't scans. You just want to be doing willy nilly. Like it's not like,

590
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,400
Hey, I'm going to go through McDonald's drive through, get a burger fries, and then go head

591
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:23,720
over and get a tau scan. I mean, that's, I want to say they're in the 10 to 20 milli-sieverts.

592
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,040
Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's an insane amount of radiation for shits and giggles.

593
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:35,240
It's you need a real reason to do that. Yep, exactly. So understand, there's a school of

594
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,640
thought, let's rewind a little bit here. So there's a school of thought that says that,

595
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:45,080
and I don't necessarily subscribe to the school of thought, but you first have amyloid, then you

596
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:50,840
have tau, then you have neuro inflammation, and then you have neuro degeneration. So amyloid is

597
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,960
thought to be one of the first markers, but I don't, I don't really agree with this a hundred

598
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:02,440
percent. And I think every person is different. So you can't really make this a hard and fast

599
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:09,320
rule. But looking at tau scans in the setting of also having an amyloid scan could be helpful.

600
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:14,680
If you're just looking at tau scans, you're looking at, does this person have tau accumulation in the

601
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:21,000
brain? These tau scans may be more sensitive, may, may, may be more sensitive at detecting

602
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,400
Alzheimer's specific tau versus other tau related to other tau opathies like frontotemporal dementia.

603
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:36,680
But the utility of the tau scan is that it tells us more about the progression or the likelihood

604
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:45,400
that someone will develop cognitive impairment. So if someone has positive tau on their tau scan,

605
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,080
the likelihood that they'll ultimately develop cognitive decline is higher than just amyloid.

606
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,280
So looking at them together, although we would never do that because of radiation and cost

607
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:02,200
concerns, like you said, if you had the amyloid and tau simultaneously at the same time, you could get

608
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,680
a pretty decent snapshot of what someone's brain looked like and where they are.

609
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,960
Is tau also this thing like amyloid where it's there all the time and we're clearing it and it's

610
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,800
potentially our impairment of clearing it that leads to the pathology?

611
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,960
So you're asking, is tau reversible? Actually, I wasn't asking that, but we should discuss that.

612
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,680
I guess what I'm saying is, look, we know that amyloid is present all the time, but we, again,

613
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:37,800
using sleep as an example, sleep is a very powerful tool to clear amyloid. Is the same true of tau?

614
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't think we have a good answer for that. We don't really know because we really haven't

615
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,800
been looking at tau for that long. Yeah. And so is there no serum biomarker on the horizon for tau?

616
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:56,280
So there is. We can talk about serum biomarkers now because I think it's a good leeway. So C2N,

617
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:02,760
if it's okay, if we talk about the Perciviti test, came out recently and that's actually a great

618
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:14,280
marker for amyloid. So it shows you the amyloid beta 40 to 42 ratio. So it encompasses someone's

619
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:20,760
APOE status. So it gives an amyloid probability score based on someone's APOE status. And the

620
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:30,360
accuracy at predicting just from the simple blood test, a positive amyloid scan is around 80, 81%.

621
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:37,880
So super, super high when you add tau, which now is not clinically available, but is available

622
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:46,680
for research purposes. So tau 217 is a new biomarker that has been brought to this game and

623
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:56,200
looking at ratios of phosphorylated to non phosphorylated, PTau 217, it adds to that. So

624
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:03,160
you're looking at accuracy of around 90% to amyloid scans. As you know, we've got one patient in

625
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:12,040
particular who were using this serum amyloid level to track interventions in, and in particular,

626
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:18,680
one kind of unusual intervention, which is rapamycin. So too soon to really know with an

627
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:25,800
N of one, but very interesting that rapamycin is dropping his serum amyloid score. Well, this

628
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:31,560
patient is fascinating in so many ways if we want to think about just biomarkers because we collected

629
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:38,120
every single biomarker possible minus the tau scan on him. So first and foremost, the old school way

630
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:43,000
of diagnosing these diseases was to do a spinal tap and look at cerebral spinal fluid. Well,

631
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,600
we did that. We looked at amyloid. I was kicking and screaming not to, but you and Richard overruled

632
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,040
me. Yes, I know. And he was such a good sport. The patient was such a good sport. Such a good sport.

633
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,360
Bless him. So we looked at CSF biomarkers in him and actually they were all normal,

634
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:09,080
all negative, but we got the C2N's Perciviti test and that showed that it was positive, that

635
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,760
the likelihood of him having amyloid pathology was high. We discussed this with so many people,

636
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,600
including our neuro radiologist colleague. And she was like, let's just do an amyloid scan. Let's

637
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:26,920
get to the bottom of this. We did an amyloid scan and he had amyloid deposition in the brain. So

638
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:34,280
this brings us to another really, really interesting and exciting direction for these

639
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:42,520
serum tests because we're noticing that they may be more sensitive at detecting early, early

640
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,000
Alzheimer's disease pathology, even better than amyloid, even better, amyloid scans,

641
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,720
even better than CSF biomarkers. And certainly more available. I mean, CS, I mean, it's, I don't

642
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,920
think people understand like, yeah, lumbar punctures are not the most invasive procedure

643
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,800
in the world, but if you have one patient that needs a blood patch, you just never want to do

644
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:09,640
that procedure again to somebody. Yep. Yep. But looking at that and then having the ability to

645
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:16,920
so readily repeat measures, while we don't know if we can follow amyloid over time to see if our

646
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,400
interventions are actually effective, in theory, it makes a lot of sense. And as you pointed out,

647
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:29,800
we put him on a slew of neuroprotective agents and tried to optimize everything possible for him

648
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:37,400
and including rapamycin and his amyloid biomarkers have gone down and now he's considered normal,

649
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,640
like low probability of having Alzheimer's disease, but we know that his scan was positive.

650
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:47,640
It's a really fascinating case. So let's segue then into something that I think is

651
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:56,920
the art form of this, which is the cognitive testing. And it's in some ways the hardest part,

652
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,920
because it's not easy to standardize. I mean, there's a reason that we have someone like you

653
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:07,640
in our practice, because this is not something that me or Eve, Suzanne, Abhi, like the rest of

654
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:13,160
us can't learn to do this. We can't outsource it to a computer. We can't tell our patients to go

655
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,760
take a test that will give us the results. There's real subtlety to this in terms of

656
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:26,040
everything from movement to vision to olfactory to these. So give people a sense of what a cognitive

657
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:32,680
test looks like. What does a gold plate cognitive test look like if you're really trying to probe

658
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:39,800
the earliest leading edge of these types of diseases? So I will also correct you that some

659
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,600
of it can actually be self-administered, but some of it needs to be administered by a trained

660
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:50,440
professional. You can get a lot of information by having patients do some things by themselves,

661
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,440
but paying attention to them gives you a lot of clues. Yeah, I think that's what I meant. I think

662
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,280
it's like it's the, well, by all means, correct me and point out what can be completely done

663
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,800
automated. But yes, I think part of it comes down to the art. I mean, Richard has done a great job

664
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,720
of sort of helping me understand what you learn by watching somebody take the test as well. Yes,

665
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:19,480
that's the art of this assessment. So first and foremost, getting a sense of their olfaction

666
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:26,680
is key because olfaction is- That's why I can't do this test today. I'm so congested. Yes. I'm

667
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,480
going to go, there's like nine things that we make them smell, right? Yes, yes. There's nine things,

668
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:36,200
although we might be elaborating that battery to include a lot more, so stay tuned for that.

669
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:41,160
Great. I'd fail that test today. So what are those things that we make people smell and why

670
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,080
does this matter so much? Yeah, well, I can't tell you what they are because then there are

671
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,320
patients on the call that may know the answers to the test. Very well, very well. Okay. So there

672
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:55,320
are nine things that you're going to have to smell. Yes. And the idea here is, you know,

673
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:03,160
cranial nerve number one is your olfactory nerve. Correct. So you have basically from your nose,

674
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:10,200
a cranial nerve that goes straight to the front of your brain that presumably is like that leading

675
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:17,560
edge of immediate access to a cranial nerve that could be degenerating. Is that the thinking? Yeah.

676
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:24,120
And if you think about just sense of smell in general, it feeds directly into the amygdala

677
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:31,000
and the hippocampus. So the whole memory circuit, if you think about odor is actually one of the

678
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,560
strongest sense that relates to memory. If you smell something that you smell before,

679
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,000
you just get very nostalgic for whatever that experience is. Positive or negative? Yes. It's

680
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:49,480
very, very ingrained into memory. So it's one of the first nerves, for lack of a better word,

681
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:54,840
first parts of the nervous system to degenerate in these diseases. And it happens not just in

682
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,400
Alzheimer's disease. It happens in Lewy body. It happens in Parkinson's disease. When it does

683
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:05,000
happen in these cases, we actually note that those patients are more likely to have cognitive

684
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,440
decline. So it really does relate to memory. So yes, first and foremost, olfactory testing.

685
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
Has COVID changed that with people?

686
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:19,880
COVID has made this so, so difficult because the earlier strains of COVID really did impact

687
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:28,120
sense of smell. And for some patients, that sense of smell has taken months to a year or more to

688
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:33,080
recover. And for other patients, it still hasn't really recovered. And what are the implications

689
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:40,040
of that long-term? I don't know if we know yet. Does it relate to later likelihood or higher

690
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:46,200
likelihood later of developing a neurodegenerative disorder? I don't know, but it's something

691
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,320
interesting and something that only time will tell. Okay. So they get these little sticks,

692
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,640
these little cards, and they have to go through that exercise. Okay. What else do they, what other

693
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,920
types of things do we test for in cognitive testing? So memory function is another one,

694
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:06,840
but there are so many domains to memory. So there's registering the information, reading,

695
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:13,000
registering, auditory, and visual registering of information, which go into memory. Then the

696
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,640
encoding process. So just to be, when you hear something, do you remember it? When you see

697
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,840
something, do you remember it? And does it matter how you report that you remember it? Is it, is it

698
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:28,440
reporting it by writing versus reporting it orally? Do those things matter as well? So for most people,

699
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:33,320
auditory processing is more difficult. And when you're doing auditory processing, all of it has

700
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:39,320
to be done auditor, through auditory. So I would ask you, I'm going to read you a story and you're

701
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:45,560
going to tell me everything you remember from that story. And that's your immediate one learning of

702
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:50,520
the information. So I'll read it to you three times. You'll try to remember as much as you can,

703
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:57,160
how much did you learn over those three trials? That's all auditory. And then in 20 or 30 minutes,

704
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,640
how much do you remember? That's delayed memory. So you're looking at immediate learning,

705
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,080
working memory and delayed memory. Now, how do we

706
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,880
ferret out the people who underperform these tests because of distraction?

707
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:19,240
Yeah, so that's why we do attention tasks. So there are a whole slew of different attention

708
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:26,200
tasks and speed of processing tasks. Usually you have to get people in a quiet room,

709
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,560
undistracted, make sure their cell phones are off, make sure they're not doing anything on

710
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:36,040
their computers to really focus on the test. But you have to add in these other cognitive

711
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:41,080
exercises, which are looking at their attentional capacity, because often you will see distraction

712
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:46,920
is a huge, huge confounder when you're looking at memory. If you're not paying attention to

713
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,280
something, you're never going to remember it. Yeah, I can think of, imagine me trying to take

714
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:59,720
this test at home, like would be a disaster compared to if I woke up in a quiet place and

715
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,680
got to take it under those conditions. Yeah, we tell people get a good night's sleep. If you didn't

716
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,280
get a good night's sleep, we're not going to do the test for you because you're just not going to do

717
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,480
well on it. Make sure you do it first thing in the morning is really better. Or sometimes you feel

718
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:19,240
relaxed. Don't try to squeeze it in between work meetings because you're going to rush and again,

719
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:24,600
not really focus on the test. So there are things that you should do to optimize your chances of

720
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,000
giving this your best shot. Yeah, treat this like it's the one shot you get at the SAT.

721
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,680
Exactly. Your MCAT. Yeah. Okay, so those sound really stressful. What else?

722
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:42,600
Visual spatial processing and episodic memory, which is really, really difficult for a lot of

723
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:49,000
patients, actually, it's one of the ones people struggle with. So trying to see where an object

724
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:55,560
is and remember the sequence that you saw that object. So you're given a series of objects.

725
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:01,480
When did you see this? And what order? And what order? Put them in the order that you saw.

726
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,960
So like a series of cards, for example. Yes. So you got to remember if you saw the car before

727
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:13,960
you saw the garbage can. Very difficult. And it's easy when you're only shown four or five or six

728
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:19,160
objects, but when you're shown 10 or 12 objects, it becomes very, very challenging. So that's really

729
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:25,640
testing your working memory, but also some visual spatial. Visual spatial skills are tested a lot by

730
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:31,320
writing and drawing, copying cubes, drawing clocks, old fashioned things from med school that you

731
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:36,520
probably remember actually give a lot of information and there's still things we use today.

732
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:47,160
What about horsepower, like executive function, problem solving? Yeah. IQ test stuff. IQ test stuff.

733
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:55,240
So verbal learning and being able to pronounce very tricky words is actually a really good proxy for

734
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:02,520
IQ and is one of the ways that we look at that. Just showing us an understanding of what this

735
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,240
person's cognitive reserve is because having that foundation is really important for understanding

736
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:14,680
what, how you should interpret the results to follow. Because if someone's IQ is much lower

737
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:20,120
than you expected, then you really have to interpret the rest of the results in the setting of that.

738
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:25,800
So there's obviously a language bias then. So how are you testing? Like if you're encountering

739
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,800
a patient for whom English is their second language, how are you able to administer this

740
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,560
test and not be misled by it? Yeah. So there are different versions of the test. And if English is

741
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,920
not your first language, it's just something that we note because we could get access to all different

742
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:49,000
versions of the test, but it is challenging to do that because the norms are all different and you

743
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,320
have to just purchase a bunch of different forms and norms. Ideally, you would do this in person,

744
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:01,160
but I know since COVID, it became more possible to do this remotely. Do you still feel that's the

745
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:07,960
case? Yes. There are certain pen and paper tasks that we send to patients because you do need to

746
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:14,200
do some of the motor activities by writing, but pretty much we can do everything remotely now.

747
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,640
How long does the test take? An hour, an hour and a half.

748
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,960
Okay. That's less than I thought. I thought it was longer. Yeah. Other things that we test for.

749
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:29,320
So executive function is really, really broad and really cross-cutting on a bunch of different

750
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:36,680
tasks, but without giving away too many secrets, thinking about naming certain categories of

751
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:43,320
objects or naming certain words that start with specific letters. That's how you look at

752
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:48,520
executive function. Now, how do you retest people? What's the frequency at which you can retest so

753
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:54,440
that you don't sort of run the risk that they're learning the test and improving because of

754
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,400
getting better at the skill of the test as opposed to getting cognitively better?

755
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:03,720
You change the forms first and foremost, so you don't really administer the same test multiple

756
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:11,960
times. Interestingly, APOE-4s are immune to the learning effect, so they actually don't learn as

757
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:18,040
well. So you can retest them in about six months and learning isn't really a factor to consider for

758
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:24,280
them, but there are equations to correct for that when you're looking at normative values.

759
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:32,120
How often does the FDA use the performance on a battery of tests like this as an endpoint?

760
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,160
Oh, I mean, when the FDA is using things, they're looking at

761
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,400
things like mini mental status and the Montreal MoCA test.

762
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,320
Tell folks what these two helpful tests are.

763
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:48,760
Yeah, so one is the Trump test. So if people have heard of that, how Trump aced a very difficult

764
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,400
cognitive test, well, yes, that was one of these where you have to name, this is a lion.

765
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:59,240
These are a sequence of numbers. Just repeat them back to me forward and backwards. So they're

766
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:06,200
basic 30 question tests where you're asked what the date is, where are you?

767
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,720
Who's the president?

768
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,520
Who's the president? They're very basic and rudimentary.

769
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,600
Yeah, these are tests we would use in the emergency room when we wanted to know if someone

770
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,880
was psychotic or heavily under the influence of alcohol, drugs, things like that.

771
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:26,360
Yeah. And to be fair, they do give you a very good sense of if someone is very cognitively

772
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:32,680
impaired, they're going to do very poorly on this test. But for most people who come to you and say,

773
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:37,480
I just noticed I'm forgetting things, they're probably still going to ace the test and it's

774
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:44,440
not giving you a good sense of, well, is it an actual memory problem or are they distracted?

775
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:49,960
Like we pointed out before, is it an attention problem? There are so many things that can go

776
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,520
wrong when someone says that they're forgetting that you really have to dissect that problem more.

777
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:03,160
The potential risk here is that we're not using a sharp enough outcome tool to measure

778
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:08,600
either drug efficacy or timing. And that kind of gets to another question, which is,

779
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:15,160
are we looking at intervening too late? So I think most people are familiar with the notion that

780
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:24,200
the track record for Alzheimer's treatment drugs is pretty abysmal. How many FDA approved

781
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,840
drugs are there for treatment of Alzheimer's disease?

782
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:32,920
Well, if you count, we have denepazil or Airecept, we have, so there's a couple in the same class,

783
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,920
I think there's three of them. And N amenda, those are the big ones and Aducanumab, I mean,

784
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,920
that's all we're looking at. Aducanumab being the most recent one approved about a year and a half

785
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:51,240
ago. Yeah. Which now has had a lot of backlash and Medicare is not paying for it. So it's been a

786
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,960
whole big mess. Yeah, which is, and I think we've discussed this on a previous podcast,

787
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,080
so I won't rehash it, but the gist of it is basically this was a drug that was

788
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:10,120
targeting amyloid directly. It really split the FDA. And I think members of the advisory panel

789
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:19,560
even resigned over its approval. If you're in the bull camp on that, you'd say that drug is

790
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,800
misunderstood, that drug would have efficacy if used early enough. And if you use the right

791
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,760
metrics to assess its performance, if you're in the bear camp, you'd say it's an incremental drug

792
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:34,760
that if it has any benefit, it doesn't come close to justifying its cost. Yeah. And I think this

793
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:40,360
gets back to, I don't know the answer to that question, but this gets back to we need to do

794
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:48,760
a better job at identifying what stage someone is in the disease process and where, when and how the

795
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:54,440
disease can be reversed if it can be, which I think that it can be. I think the breast cancer

796
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:59,560
example is really apt here, which is my fear with all of these neurodegenerative diseases

797
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,240
is we are acting at the wrong time. Exactly. And it's exactly like saying,

798
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,840
we take a bunch of women with stage four breast cancer and we do lumpectomies on them

799
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,480
and they don't live any longer. And we think therefore the lumpectomy has no place in the

800
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:18,600
treatment of breast cancer. When in reality, the lumpectomy has no treatment in the place of women

801
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:24,280
with metastatic breast cancer. And it is the standard of care in women with stage one breast

802
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:29,880
cancer and it will save their life. Exactly. And that's my fear is when it comes to neurodegeneration,

803
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:35,160
we don't know what the, as you said, we don't know the stages. We don't know the difference

804
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:39,240
between stage one, stage two, stage three, stage four. And we certainly don't know what treatments

805
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:43,720
to apply when. And most of the treatments that are being applied are being applied at what would be

806
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,440
the equivalent of stage four. Exactly. So by that time, what can you really do? Because

807
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,760
you can't reverse the neurodegeneration once it's already happened. You have to start earlier and

808
01:21:53,480 --> 01:22:02,680
another large target for these drugs and new biotech companies are the inflammation process,

809
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:07,160
the neuroinflammation, which is a huge factor. And I do think plays a huge role. But again,

810
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:14,600
the question is in who and when, and without having a plethora of biomarkers that you're

811
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:19,960
looking at to really handpick patients appropriately, I don't know how we'll show

812
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,800
efficacy of these drugs. Let's go back to something you alluded to very briefly earlier,

813
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:33,320
which is the role of the visual and auditory systems in these diseases. So I think it's

814
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:39,320
generally well accepted that there is an association between hearing loss and dementia.

815
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:44,520
Is it Alzheimer's specific or all forms of dementia? It's all forms of dementia, but most

816
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:49,400
of the literature is surrounding dementia as a broad term, which they usually mean Alzheimer's

817
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:55,160
disease. I've talked about this with Richard quite a bit. And he's really of the mindset that

818
01:22:55,160 --> 01:23:00,760
there's a causative relationship there. And that's a big deal because again, if you can just say,

819
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,040
well, there's an association between hearing loss and dementia, it's like, well, okay, yeah,

820
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,880
I mean, that makes sense. But if you think that that relation is causative, and that's why it's

821
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:13,480
just so important to understand causality, it means that treating hearing loss will reduce

822
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:20,600
the risk of dementia. It means that screening for hearing loss early and treating it aggressively

823
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,000
will improve outcomes. And that's totally different from just saying,

824
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,840
yep, they're just highly associated. So Richard's view is that, yeah, we should be doing this. I

825
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:37,160
think you share that view. Why is that? Yeah, we should be doing this. So there are a lot of

826
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:43,560
schools of thought on how this is related to neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer's

827
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,520
specifically. But the one that I think I like the most or the two that I think I like the most are,

828
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:58,200
when you can't hear, you're increasing cognitive load to the brain, which is taking cognitive

829
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:04,280
function or taking cognitive abilities away from other processes of the brain. So for example,

830
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:10,360
memory function, working memory, because your brain is focused on trying to hear or trying to see it's

831
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:15,960
using all of its power to do that. And it's diverting resources away from building memory

832
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:23,320
function. But the other factor, which I think really relates to the movement aspect is our

833
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:31,000
brains need sensory input. And when you aren't giving that sensory input to the brain, you lose

834
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:37,160
that function. And hearing is so important for verbal processing, vision is so important for

835
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:42,920
visual spatial processing. These are all cognitive functions that if you're not giving the sensory

836
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:48,440
input that the brain is craving, you're probably not building those pathways anymore. You're not

837
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:54,440
diversifying your brain, your brain's experience. I think both of those are, they again, I don't

838
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,800
know if those things are right. But if, if, if there is a causative relationship between visual

839
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,280
and hearing loss, those two mechanisms make a lot of sense. I want to make sure I understood them.

840
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:12,200
The first is, if you were becoming deficient in those areas, you're wasting, quote unquote,

841
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:20,680
more of your cognitive energy on the acquisition of those inputs to the system. And in doing so,

842
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:25,480
you're detracting from the capacity to do other things. We have a finite amount of this reserve.

843
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:32,120
The second thing is you're now deficient at gathering inputs that foster the neuro development,

844
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:40,360
plasticity, formation creation of better outputs. So you're going to process information worse if

845
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:46,760
you can't hear, you're going to process your environment worse if you can't see. Correct.

846
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:54,360
Correct. So you'll move worse. You'll think less. And there's just clinical evidence to support this.

847
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:59,320
So there's something called recurorescence in stroke. When someone had a stroke a while ago,

848
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:03,160
it might have been a small stroke, it might have been a large stroke, but they pretty much recovered

849
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:08,440
from their stroke until their body's under some sort of other stress. So they have a urinary tract

850
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:14,840
infection or an ammonia, something that puts any sort of stress. That stroke, those symptoms that

851
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,800
once were a part of their old stroke come back out called recurorescence. It's like the brain

852
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:27,240
can't handle doing too many things at once. It can only divert, it can only deal with that wound

853
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:33,000
in its brain by having all of its brain power focused on it. If it doesn't, then it's diverting

854
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,680
some of its resources someplace else, then those symptoms come back out again. It's sort of similar

855
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:44,040
to that. Wow. Let's talk about oral health. This is something you're interested in, something you've

856
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:51,320
spent a lot of time thinking about. It certainly makes sense. I've, as you know, become more and

857
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:57,080
more interested in this idea that the health of your gums, the health of your teeth is

858
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,760
actually quite a strong predictor of the health of you as an organism.

859
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:09,240
It's hard to have very poor health in your mouth and have very good health in the rest of your body.

860
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,080
How do you think this pertains to the brain specifically? 100%, I could not have said that

861
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:21,960
better. So there are certain red complex pathogens, three bad guys in particular, one Trepanema,

862
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:31,640
Dendicola, P. gingivalis, and T. forsynthea. These microbes are associated with a higher risk of

863
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:37,560
amyloid deposition, tau deposition, and inflammation. So knowing if you have these

864
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:42,600
red complex bacteria, which drive periodontal disease, these are all gram negatives, gram

865
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:49,400
negative bacteria. Right. So when you have a high colonization in your mouth with these bacteria,

866
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:56,200
your peripheral inflammation is driven way up. And when you think about somebody who has an apo

867
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:06,680
E4, for example, a 3,4, or 4,4, why would you ever want them to be under any more inflammation?

868
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:12,920
If you know E4 is priming my greglia activation, then adding any layer of something that's going

869
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:19,000
to trigger more inflammation is just a bad idea. So focusing on oral health, especially in high

870
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,440
risk patients is huge. And I think really an overlooked part of this whole picture,

871
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,920
there is some debate and there is some evidence for this that potentially these bacteria can

872
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:36,200
ectopically migrate either through the blood or through cranial nerves to the actual brain

873
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,640
because they've identified them in autopsy specimen. But I don't know if that's true. I

874
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,480
don't know if it's the bacteria going to the brain themselves that's causing damage.

875
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:51,640
I think it's more of the inflammation that's triggering part of the damage and it being in

876
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:57,320
such close proximity to the brain, having all of these cranial nerves kind of right there,

877
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,200
right by the mouth. I think that's the bigger issue.

878
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:06,760
And do we know if the greatest driver of that risk is simply poor oral hygiene?

879
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:15,240
Poor oral hygiene, but also which comes first here. So dental implants, root canals,

880
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:21,640
just external hardware in your mouth. Those are just, they're just night is for these bacteria

881
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:27,080
to form on. And we notoriously don't clean them as well. People who wear retainers at night after

882
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:33,000
their braces or a mouth guard because they grind their teeth at night. They aren't really cleaning

883
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:41,800
these specimen very effectively and they're just loaded with bacteria and often flossing is

884
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:47,720
overlooked. And it's not just flossing. Flossing is great, but really using a water pick or an

885
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:52,360
interproximal brush or something that goes in between the teeth that has a little feather at

886
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:56,440
the end that you're really scraping away. The bacteria is what you need.

887
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:05,400
Okay. Let's return to AD and double click on the genes. Again, I think most people listening to this,

888
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:10,600
if they've spent any time listening to this podcast, they're very well familiar of the APO

889
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:16,840
E4 situation. We've got these three isoforms for the same gene, APOE. You've got the two,

890
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:22,360
three and four isoform and they can combine in every possible way. So there's six combinations.

891
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:27,400
The normal one is the three, three combo. That's 50 to five, 55, 60% of the population, correct?

892
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:33,480
Yep. The high risk gene is the four. High risk isoform is the four. The low risk isoform is the

893
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,400
two. The two seems very rare. I don't think I've ever seen a two, two. We have seen one person with

894
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:42,200
a two, two. I've never seen a two, two, but two, three is two fours and it's 5% less than 5% of

895
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,280
the population. But let's talk about the four fours and the three fours. These are your higher risk

896
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,440
populations. Your three fours are probably 20 to 25% of the population. Four fours are one to

897
01:30:52,440 --> 01:31:01,480
2% of the population. In our practice, it's four or 5% of our practice is four, four, but I think

898
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:07,000
we have a selection, a little bit of a selection bias. Maybe more than that actually. Obviously,

899
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,080
when you were still at Cornell, you saw lots of four fours. That was probably a quarter of your

900
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:19,640
population. Yep. You've often said, and Richard said this as well, you don't get that stressed

901
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:25,000
out when you see a patient when you have a really clear sense that their risk is predicated through

902
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:34,280
their E4-ness. Yeah. Not to make light of E4, but you talk about it like it's the enemy you know.

903
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:41,640
Easy peasy. Piece of cake. Yeah. So first, expand on why you would make such a statement and then

904
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:47,800
two, I want to talk about the things that are able to either make the E4 worse or potentially

905
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:54,920
even make the E4 better. Meaning reduce the risk or amplify the risk of E4. We know what to do when

906
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:02,760
we see an APOE4. It's when somebody doesn't have an APOE4 and has a family history. That's very

907
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:08,200
notable for dementia Alzheimer's, some neurodegenerative disease. Also,

908
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:14,520
Lewy body E4s are at risk for Lewy body dementia too, which is something that we frequently

909
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:21,800
overlook. So when we see a three three and we see a family history, then we start scratching our

910
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:29,400
heads. Like what is the pathogenic mechanism that's driving this person and this family to

911
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:36,040
develop Alzheimer's or a related neurodegenerative disease? When we see an APOE4, we kind of

912
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:44,840
understand more about how that impacts the body. We understand its role in peripheral cholesterol,

913
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:53,000
which also relates to its role in central or brain cholesterol. We know how it impacts their

914
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,080
ability to metabolize carbohydrates. We understand kind of what we're up against when we see it. And

915
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:04,280
I just want to emphasize because so many people come and they're so afraid once they found out

916
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:10,040
that they have an APOE4 or they're just so afraid because they have a family history and they don't

917
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:16,840
want to know what their genes are, but your genes are not your destiny. There are ways that we can

918
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:23,640
intervene to mitigate some of the detrimental effects of these genes. So what are some of the

919
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:32,280
other genes that are cousins of E4 that travel with E4 or that frankly don't, but add independently

920
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:39,640
to risk or subtract independently from risk? Yeah. So APOC1 and Tom40 are two genes that are

921
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:44,760
located right around the APOE4 upstream downstream. That's two M's in Tom, right? Yeah, Tom with two

922
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:54,440
M's 40. And they are tightly associated with APOE4, meaning they're linked. Most people, if they

923
01:33:54,440 --> 01:34:00,600
inherited the quote harmful copy of APOE4, I'm going to say quote because I don't know how harmful

924
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:06,440
it is anymore now that we're better at managing it, but they'll also inherit the quote harmful

925
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:14,280
copy of Tom40, harmful copy of APOC1, most cases 90% of the time. But in some patients, they don't.

926
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,760
Are these protein coding genes or are they in the non-coding regions that Tom40 and C1, APOC1?

927
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:27,960
They're protein coding genes. So when you don't inherit them and you're looking at someone who

928
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:36,680
is a 3, 4 or a 2, 4, 2, 4s are really great examples because if you see that they inherited

929
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:44,200
the lower risk variance in Tom40 or APOC1, then I'm thinking, well, they're less likely to behave

930
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:51,320
like an E4 and more likely to behave like a 2, 3 versus the other way around. Then I get very

931
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:57,320
worried about their E4 expressing themselves. And I start thinking we need to really hammer down on

932
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,520
their cholesterol. We need to do much better with vascular risk factor control. Yeah. So the Tom40

933
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:10,360
APOC1 can swing the balance. Yes. Yes. So it does provide a huge piece of information for a small

934
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:16,280
portion of people, but for that small portion, it's really, really life-changing and changes

935
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:24,200
management. Yeah. So what about genes that are less tightly linked to APOE4 that either up or down

936
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:31,080
turn the risk? So Clotho is a big one. And I know you're a huge- It's my favorite gene. Yeah.

937
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:39,320
You love Clotho. Love you some Clotho. So Clotho seems to offer a protective role against APOE4.

938
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:46,680
It doesn't completely erase the harmful effects of APOE4, but it really does lessen it. And it has

939
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:53,800
an effect on the rate of cognitive decline. So if you have Clotho heterozygosity, then we're more

940
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,840
optimistic about how we look about your- And just so people know what we're talking about,

941
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:01,160
we say heterozygous, meaning you have one wild type, and then you have one of the protective one,

942
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:11,080
which is the KLVS SNP. Yes. Yes. And this is- We were talking about this the other day. In the

943
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:19,080
literature, this is like, I don't know, one in six people would be heterozygous. It's actually pretty

944
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:27,800
hard to make this diagnosis because there is no off-the-shelf test for this SNP. No, there's not.

945
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:33,320
You need whole genome sequencing. Yeah. Which again, for the listener, that is a real impediment

946
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:41,320
to this work right now. It is. We have some E4s in our practice, E4E4s, who you and Richard have

947
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:45,640
looked at and you don't even think they're worth talking to. They're so uninteresting, which is a

948
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:51,480
good thing. If you don't want to talk to them, that's a good sign. E4E4s, think about that. And

949
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,760
I remember the first time Richard met some of these people two or three years ago, he's like-

950
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:59,880
Nard. This person has nothing wrong with them and will have nothing wrong with them.

951
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:08,680
I'm convinced that they are cloth OK LVSs, but it's not just that you got to spend all the money

952
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:13,800
on the whole genome sequence, it's that you got to get somebody to go through the data and pull

953
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:22,520
out the sequence. Yeah. Richard and I are working on a process of streamlining this. It is so labor

954
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:28,440
intensive. It's a little back of the napkin mom and pop right now, but you have to manually go

955
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:34,680
through the genome and pull out all of the relevant SNPs. There's no SNPs, meaning portions

956
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:45,000
of the DNA that pertain to risk. There's no fast way of doing it. And more than that, you have to

957
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,600
do it in a logical way because if someone has an E4 versus an E3, you're going to look at a

958
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,720
completely different set of genes and a completely different set of SNPs or variants than you are

959
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:01,800
going to look at for someone who is a three. It's so frustrating that this is such an easy

960
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:07,960
problem for AI to solve. Yes. And it doesn't need that many resources. It just needs somebody to say,

961
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,880
you know what, we should just automate this once and for all, spend a few million dollars on the

962
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:19,160
process. Yes. And everybody can drop their whole genome sequence in there and you can get the

963
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:24,360
answer. That's what we're trying to do a better job and work on because I think we can develop

964
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:30,120
a software that is able to do this more rapidly, but right now it is so labor intensive and so

965
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:36,520
expensive. Yeah. I also think that the KLVS clotho mutation would be a great CRISPR target one day.

966
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:44,840
Yes. Yes, it might be. Yeah. I think the longevity benefits of that transformation would be enormous.

967
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:50,440
But going back to, I mean, just teaching a software how to do this, part of it is, and thinking about

968
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:56,280
the example that you pointed out that there's E4 fours that we're just not interested in,

969
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:03,000
part of that is you have to understand that person's risk factors. So if they have no family

970
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:10,200
history of Alzheimer's disease or a neurodegenerative disease whatsoever, they're a lower

971
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:18,520
likelihood of getting this disease later, even if they're four four. Yeah. Okay. The other one I know

972
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:22,360
we've talked a lot about is mitochondrial haplotype. This is a bit more complicated because it's not a

973
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:28,120
gene per se. So explain what the mitochondrial haplotype is and what it tells us about risk and

974
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:34,920
how difficult is that to measure? So the mitochondria going way back to evolution. So

975
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:42,200
they were once thought to be their own organisms that the body devoured and developed a symbiotic

976
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:49,080
relationship with. So they are one of the few organelles in the cell that have, the only organelle

977
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:57,960
in the cell that has their own genome. So the mitochondrial genome has genes that relate to

978
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:04,840
oxidative phosphorylation or how the body makes energy. So the Cox genes and NAD genes,

979
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:13,320
all of these genes are encoded in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial haplogroups are labeled based on

980
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:20,920
what different variants are found in different genes in that mitochondrial DNA. And there are

981
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:27,000
more than 4,000 mitochondrial haplotypes. So there are a ton of mitochondrial haplotypes. And again,

982
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,240
they're based on what variants are common among all members of a shared group. So for example,

983
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:42,760
there is a risk snip that I wouldn't say risk, there's a snip that is associated with

984
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:50,040
mitochondrial haplogroup H and all members that are categorized as haplogroup H have this variant.

985
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:57,320
So two things, one, how difficult or easy is it to determine your mitochondrial haplotype? Is it as

986
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:04,600
complicated as, is it more clotho or more Tom 40 E4? So it's very, very difficult. 23andMe

987
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:10,040
generates their own mitochondrial haplogroups. And the way that they do it is they have a few

988
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:17,800
markers that they pull out of the DNA that pertain to each specific haplogroup. So that's how they

989
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,680
identify someone's haplogroup. It's actually not perfect. If you really wanted to know someone's

990
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:27,560
haplogroup, you have to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome and use specific software.

991
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:33,160
No, I don't think 23andMe can do that, right? No, 23andMe cannot. But you can do it through

992
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:39,480
whole genome sequencing, adding on mitochondrial DNA sequencing and analyze the mitochondrial

993
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:44,440
genome, but you need specific software to do so. And it's really much more challenging than the

994
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:50,920
whole genome or the. So why does this matter? Why do we want to know the haplotype or haplogroup

995
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:57,560
of the mitochondria? How does it tell us less? I mean, let's just assume it tells us risk is up,

996
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:03,000
one, one enough. But even if it's telling you risk is higher, what insight does it impart as far as

997
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:09,880
preventative strategies? So super helpful and understanding risk, especially for APOE4s,

998
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:15,160
but also for other neurodegenerative diseases. And interestingly, the same haplotypes that

999
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,960
put you at risk for Alzheimer's also put you at risk for Parkinson's disease. So for example,

1000
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:27,800
haplotype H, if you have this haplotype and you're in APOE4, it seems to enable the E4 or act

1001
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:33,000
synergistically with the E4. So when we see that combination, we become a little bit more concerned

1002
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:40,120
about this person versus somebody who is a haplogroup K because K seems protective,

1003
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:48,520
especially for APOE4s. Okay. If you have someone that's a type H, do you have any sense of what

1004
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:53,880
preventative measures are more important than others? So just knowing what type of haplogroup

1005
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:59,960
they are gives us insight into how their mitochondria are behaving. So if we know someone

1006
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:05,480
isn't an efficient energy producer or their mitochondria aren't acting efficiently,

1007
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:12,120
let's rev up their zone too. Let's try to get them as many mitochondria as we can. Let's increase

1008
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:18,360
their density of mitochondria because that might circumvent some of the negative effects of their

1009
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:24,280
mitochondria, just not working as efficiently at generating ATP or energy. So talking about that,

1010
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:33,240
talking about exercise, my view has largely been that there's probably no activity that you can

1011
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:39,080
participate in that will have a greater impact on your brain's health than exercise. Now, obviously,

1012
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:44,360
you have to take that with a caveat. All the exercise in the world won't help you if you're

1013
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:51,880
sleeping four hours a night. It can't offset that much damage. But in terms of additive activity,

1014
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,760
it seems to me exercise matters more than anything else. It certainly matters more than

1015
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:02,200
the finicky nuance that someone might make in their diet of like, oh, I'm going to take out

1016
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:05,960
nightshades and all of a sudden that's going to fix all my problems or something

1017
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:13,480
sort of idiotic like that. Would you agree that exercise has the most potential to

1018
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,040
improve brain health? And that's not just in the healthy, but obviously in the preventative

1019
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:22,920
strategy. Wholeheartedly. I think exercise has the potential to move the needle the most.

1020
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:30,360
So what is it about that? Because exercise does so many things. What do you think are the levers

1021
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:36,040
that it's pulling? So when I think about exercise, I kind of break it down into categories in my head.

1022
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:43,800
So there's the coordination proprioceptive balance type exercise, which you can include dance under

1023
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:48,520
that, for example, which some people don't really think about dance as an exercise, but it's an

1024
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:55,960
incredibly powerful exercise for the brain because you're not just getting the physical heart rate

1025
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:03,720
elevation. You're getting the cognitive training, which is involved in the coordination and the

1026
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:11,880
choreographed movement. So you're trying to process the visual information and make your body do that

1027
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:18,520
activity or do that movement, which is both a cognitive workout and a physical workout. So this

1028
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:24,680
is a way of increasing cognitive reserve, increasing neuroplasticity that has probably a different

1029
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:32,200
effect than something like zone two, for example, which is involved in improving someone's energy,

1030
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,880
metabolism and inefficiency, which is very different than strength training, which is equally

1031
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:43,240
important for building muscle mass and metabolic health and so on. So you have the metabolic

1032
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:50,920
component, right? You have the vascular component. You then have like BDNF. What role do you think

1033
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:58,120
BDNF plays here? So I think BDNF plays a huge role, but it's hard to say how much that plays versus

1034
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:03,960
how much just higher intensity cardio exercise is increasing cerebral blood flow, which is

1035
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:10,040
increasing nutrient oxygen delivery to the brain. But BDNF is what we call a fertilizer for the

1036
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:17,480
brain. So it helps protect new brain cells, but also helps grow new brain cells specifically in

1037
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:24,440
the temporal lobes or the memory centers of the brain. So stimulating BDNF is a potential one of

1038
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:30,600
the potentially large benefits of exercise. Does anything stimulate more BDNF than exercise?

1039
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,400
I don't think so.

1040
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:41,640
What role does hypertension play here? There are certain organs that are so clearly related to

1041
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:47,560
high blood pressure negatively, right? So the kidney and the heart, there's just no ambiguity.

1042
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:52,440
More blood pressure is just bad for the kidney, is bad for the heart. Once baseline perfusion

1043
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:58,200
levels are met, obviously every organ suffers if blood pressure is too low in a pathologic sense.

1044
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:04,600
So if somebody's hypovolemic in shock or something like that, but 120 over 80 is all you need to

1045
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:11,320
perfuse the kidney and to perfuse the heart. And we now know that 135 over 85, that's going to start

1046
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:17,000
causing damage. What do we know about that with respect to the brain? So the sprint mind study

1047
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:24,600
looked at this and lower is better. So 120 over 70 more strict blood pressure control seems better

1048
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:30,120
for cognitive outcomes long-term. I will also circle back and say that what we see in some of

1049
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:35,960
these diseases, especially the Lewy bodies and Parkinson's is autonomic instability. So blood

1050
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:42,280
pressure fluctuations, which is very tricky to deal with because what we'll see is at night,

1051
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:47,480
someone may have higher blood pressure when they're laying flat, but when they're up and about during

1052
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:52,440
the day, when you're actually measuring their blood pressure, it's not very high. So you could

1053
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:57,560
be misled living a fool's paradise, thinking that they're actually norm intensive, which

1054
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:04,040
we'll consider less than 120 over 70 or brain, but they're not. So you really got to check what

1055
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:07,960
their blood pressure is at night when they're laying down or first thing in the morning before

1056
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:12,680
they get out of bed. Yeah, it's funny. So I'm just going to get back up on my soapbox,

1057
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:18,680
climb back on it. So I was on my soapbox a minute ago, pleading for somebody to do the AI work to

1058
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:24,280
figure out, so we can figure out everybody's clotho status and mitochondrial haplotype like that.

1059
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:29,560
This might even be a slightly higher soapbox. People know how much I'm a fan of continuous

1060
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:35,160
glucose monitors because that type of information, whether you only choose to wear one of these

1061
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:40,040
things for a month or you choose to wear one for a year, even if you're not diabetic, the insights

1062
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:46,280
are profound and they will forever change the way you think about eating, exercise, stress, and

1063
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:54,280
sleep. 100%. They just show you that in your play. As much as I'm a fan of that, I would right now

1064
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:01,240
get rid of CGM for the non-diabetic, if I were Czar for a day, if in exchange I could have a

1065
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:06,920
continuous blood pressure monitor that was perfect and seamless and you could stick a patch on and

1066
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:12,200
have real time continuous blood pressure monitoring, that would be even more valuable for the reason

1067
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:19,640
you just stated. 100%. This is one where I just lose sleep over it for myself and for my patients,

1068
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:26,840
which is I really don't know what my blood pressure is most of the time. Even if I check my

1069
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:33,080
blood pressure twice a day sitting at my desk, it tells me nothing about what my blood pressure is

1070
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:43,400
the other 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 30 seconds of the day. We don't have a tool to do that yet well.

1071
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:50,600
I've tried every supposed continuous blood pressure monitor out there. The ones that work

1072
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:55,320
are so cumbersome that you can't use them. The clinical grade stuff where it's a cuff

1073
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:59,160
attached to a big battery pack and you're walking around, it looks like you've got an LVAD.

1074
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:05,000
Those work, but they're not practical. Then the little wrist bracelets and stuff are total garbage.

1075
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:13,000
We're just waiting for some technology to change the game. I just can't wait for this and I hope

1076
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,800
it occurs soon because it's such an urgent need. Not just in terms of everything we're talking about,

1077
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,960
but when you start to think about cardiovascular disease, we're really missing. It's like imagining.

1078
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:32,280
Imagine not knowing if you were a smoker. As dumb as that sounds, you can't tell if you

1079
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:39,720
smoke or not, but you might. Yeah, no. We have no data. What's worse is it's very difficult to

1080
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:44,680
think of how you could develop a device that isn't interfering with your sleep because if you want to

1081
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:49,240
check it when you're sleeping, you don't want it to cause another problem, cause you not to sleep.

1082
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:53,320
But then you start thinking about, well, even if you did have just high blood pressure at night,

1083
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,880
well, there probably are things you could do because there's short acting medications that

1084
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:02,360
you could maybe just dose before bedtime. During the day when your blood pressure is fine, you're

1085
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:07,800
up and around great. But at night when you're actually hypertensive, which is half of your day,

1086
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:12,840
essentially, you are treating that. But right now we're just living in fool's paradise because we

1087
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:17,880
have no idea what your blood pressure is doing at night. Okay. So good to note that, or bad to note,

1088
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:21,560
but good to note that we got to keep our blood pressure low here as well. Yeah.

1089
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:28,200
We all know that Alzheimer's disease disproportionately affects women two to one.

1090
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:34,280
My belief personally, which is not unique, is that I think it's the hormone reduction that's

1091
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:38,600
doing that. I don't think it's, I think very little of that is explained by women slightly

1092
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:45,000
outliving men. I really think it's the sudden loss of estrogen in particular, and maybe testosterone

1093
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:50,920
that feeds into that. What do you think, what do you think is driving this two to one gap between

1094
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:56,840
men and women in Alzheimer's? Well, so something that's interesting and recently discovered in

1095
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:02,680
nature, I think it was published in April or maybe May, but we can link to it in the show notes.

1096
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:11,640
The MGMT gene. So the MGMT gene is a very powerful DNA repair gene in both men and women, but

1097
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:19,080
it seems to, there are certain variants in this gene which seem to independent of ApoE influence

1098
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:24,440
Alzheimer's risk specifically in women. And this gene is related to breast cancer as well.

1099
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:32,680
So what is it about women that put them in a different category, even in terms of what

1100
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:38,760
genes matter than men? It's more than just hormones, I think, but I don't know the answer.

1101
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:43,400
I do think hormones play a huge role as you pointed out and the menopause transition,

1102
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:48,680
which is a huge area of research right now and something that we really focus on in our patients

1103
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:55,720
is something that has to be a high priority in women specifically because of this role of hormones.

1104
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:01,560
But I think there are other factors at play. And just thinking of the counter argument to that,

1105
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:07,560
when you think about Lewy body Parkinson's, well, that's much more common in men to a two to one

1106
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:14,840
prevalence in men versus women. And is it sex and hormones that are driving that? Probably,

1107
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:19,880
but in what way? I don't know. Yeah. Well, that's actually where I was going to ask you is what do

1108
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:25,480
we think is explaining the opposite, which is why are men getting Lewy body and Parkinson's two to

1109
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:33,000
one more than women? I don't know. I don't know what it is about the male sex that's really giving

1110
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:41,160
us a higher risk or a lower risk for disease. But it's easy to point to hormones as the answer,

1111
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:47,800
but I don't know if we have the data out there to actually say that. I think one day we'll be better

1112
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:55,640
at really pinning down someone's risk in terms of incorporating biological sex and genetic risk

1113
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:02,280
to give someone a more accurate understanding of what their individual risk is and then be able to

1114
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:07,960
give them lifestyle and preventive strategies based on what we find there. But I don't think

1115
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,120
we're there yet. It's hard to know what to do with hormones, especially in men.

1116
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:19,080
So kind of thinking about this in terms of a wrap up, right? It seems that there are two big

1117
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:28,120
themes that have come up here. One is the higher your cognitive process, the higher your cognitive

1118
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:37,960
reserve, the more likely you are able to weather a storm here. So similarly, in a recession, it's

1119
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:46,600
easier to weather a recession if you're not living paycheck to paycheck. It sounds like if I've

1120
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:54,360
understood you, the same is true on the movement disorders that maybe the more facile you are with

1121
01:54:54,360 --> 01:55:02,200
movement, the more reserve you have to combat and delay the progression and or onset of the

1122
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:09,000
alpha synuclein based pathologies as well. Yeah, I think which might, by the way, be the kind of the

1123
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,800
other reason why a diversified portfolio of exercise matters. Yeah, I think when you think of

1124
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:22,920
brain health, it's not just the cognitive piece, but it's the movement piece too, because there

1125
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,840
are nerves throughout our whole body, not just our brain. So when we think about how do we optimize

1126
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:35,400
our brain health, it has to be, yes, diversifying your cognitive experiences and managing your

1127
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:41,320
vascular risk factors, but also bringing in the movement piece is such a huge piece of the puzzle

1128
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:47,080
and something that I don't think people have really come to realize because we've been so

1129
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,800
hyper focused on looking at what what's the blood work show. Let's look at what the movement

1130
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:57,480
patterns show too. Yeah, this is something we're really excited about you and Beth working on

1131
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:01,000
together with our patients. And then hopefully we can sort of figure out a way to share this more

1132
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:10,040
broadly, which is, you know, using adding movement to cognitive testing to identify these problems as

1133
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:14,440
soon as possible. Again, on the movement side, you know, we've been doing this for a long time. And

1134
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:19,960
you know, you can sort of say, I know you're not in pain now, but because you move that way, you're

1135
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:24,680
going to suffer an injury at some point might be a year from now, might be 10 years from now,

1136
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:29,000
but you're on you're on the wrong path. If you make these changes now, you're on a better path.

1137
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:35,480
When we can start to make that same relationship between movement and movement disorders. I mean,

1138
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:40,760
that's fantastic. That's taking it to the next level. And that's where we need to be. And for

1139
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:45,960
all the people that are listening who may be at risk for one of these movement disorders, or have

1140
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:50,520
a loved one that is suffering from it, getting to the crux of the movement problem might be the

1141
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:56,520
key to answering the question of how to prevent the disease. So I don't want you to overstate it.

1142
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:04,600
But my final question for you, Kellyanne is with ambition, but not wishful thinking.

1143
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:10,200
Where do you think we can be in five years with respect to everything we've talked about today?

1144
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:19,320
So I will say that no one has incorporated exercise and movement the way that we're looking

1145
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:28,440
at it now. I think just that alone is going to push the needle so far in the direction of making

1146
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:34,680
it advance in the world of movement itself. In the world of Alzheimer's, like I said, they're so

1147
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:39,800
related. Whatever we learn about one disease tells us so much about the other disease. We have to

1148
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:47,000
stop thinking about them as so separate and more think about them as a continuum. I don't know what

1149
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:54,360
the future holds, but I think if we start changing the way we're viewing the diseases and put them

1150
01:57:54,360 --> 01:58:01,880
more broadly under the term of neurodegeneration, identify what the problem is from the get-go,

1151
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:07,800
not look at amyloid, not look at tau, not look at alpha synuclein as the ultimate problem,

1152
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:13,960
but scaling way, way back. I think we can get much further than we've been.

1153
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:18,840
And you think we will be able to do that with a better attention, a finer tooth comb,

1154
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:23,000
on cognitive testing, which includes all of the dimensions you've talked about,

1155
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:29,480
plus movement assessments. You think that those together, even before biomarkers, can start to

1156
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:35,880
give us that very early indication of where someone might lie on a spectrum?

1157
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:41,160
And genetics. I don't think you can do this without understanding genetics and family history.

1158
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:45,880
I think with those pieces of information, yeah, we can move the needle pretty far.

1159
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,320
And you're confident that we can then target preventative strategies.

1160
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:56,520
Yeah. Once you understand what someone's at risk for and understand what their baseline is,

1161
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:01,400
you can curate what strategies there are to prevent it in a particular person.

1162
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:07,880
Yeah. We were talking about this last night. I just don't think there's any set of diseases

1163
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:12,040
that are more frightening than this. I think when you look at all the big buckets on the

1164
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,320
death bars that we so fastidiously keep track of.

1165
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:18,440
Totally.

1166
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:21,720
Yeah. Heart disease is the number one killer. Cancer is the number two killer.

1167
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:29,000
I think we accept those risks. I think we kind of get it. And deep down, I think we all kind of

1168
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,200
hope we're going to die of a heart attack in our sleep when we're 96 and that's that.

1169
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:40,760
And nobody wants to die that way and nobody wants to die period, I suppose. And certainly

1170
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:46,040
nobody wants to get cancer. But there really isn't any of these neurodegenerative conditions

1171
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:53,400
that doesn't just leave you feeling completely petrified yourself and then completely at a

1172
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:58,680
loss for what to do to help somebody who's suffering from it. So I applaud you for being

1173
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:04,840
able to go into the world's one of the three most depressing fields of medicine and then somehow

1174
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:07,400
carve out an optimistic piece of it.

1175
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:15,640
Honestly, our waiting list at Cornell was more than five years long. And what one patient actually

1176
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:20,600
said, I was told by my doctor that it's harder to get into this clinic than it is to get into

1177
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:28,600
college, which is really, really sad. But that just goes to show the tremendous need for people

1178
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:37,160
to start reevaluating how and when we're looking at disease. So, so much need. And the first thing

1179
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:43,720
that patients would say when they would come to see us is how petrified they were. They saw their

1180
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:49,080
family member go through such a disease that robbed them of essentially the person that they were.

1181
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:54,680
They're no longer able to communicate. They don't recognize them like that's a terrible thing

1182
02:00:54,680 --> 02:01:00,280
in so many ways, so much more terrible than a heart attack. At least you still have your cognition.

1183
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:09,320
I mean, granted, none of these things are good, but just losing your whole person is just so,

1184
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:18,280
so hard. And that experience for so many people really drives and empowers them to do everything

1185
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:25,080
that they can to ward off the disease. And most people would leave in tears just because they feel

1186
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:31,400
like for once someone is listening and there's something that they can do to anything that they

1187
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:37,400
can do to just change their fate. And their fate may not be what their parents fate was or their

1188
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:43,880
grandparents fate was. It's huge. Well, Kaelianne, thanks for sitting down with us and walking

1189
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:50,200
through all this stuff. It's super interesting and I'm excited about what we can do together.

1190
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:55,800
Yes, me too. Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to more discussions in the future.
