00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,900
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,680
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,920
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in health

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,280
and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,640
If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you far more

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,640
in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level. At

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,880
the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,400
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,680
today's episode. I guess this week is Lou Cantley. Lou is the Meyer Director and Professor

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,920
of Cancer Biology at the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medical College

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,800
in New York City. Lou's research has made significant advances in cancer research stemming

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,520
primarily from his discovery of the signaling pathway for PI3 kinase or PI3K in the mid 80s.

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,880
And his results here have really touched multiple fields, including cancer first and foremost,

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,160
but also diabetes and autoimmune disease. Lou is a very decorated scientist, to put it mildly.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,880
It would take me too long to rattle off all of the awards that he's won, but I'll leave it to the

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,920
four most prestigious, the Gairdner Award, the Breakthrough Prize in Science, the Wolf Prize,

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,880
and most recently the Horowitz Prize. Arguably, the only two prizes that are not on that list

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,320
would be the Lasker Prize and the Nobel Prize. And I think that many people suspect that Lou

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,560
will ultimately be awarded at least the Nobel Prize, if not both. This is a podcast that at

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,280
times gets very technical, but most of the technical stuff falls at the end of the podcast.

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,560
It's actually what we started with, but much like we did in a previous podcast, we're going to move

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,960
that to the back end of the podcast so that we can jump right into the more concrete stuff that I

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,960
think people want to hear about with respect to science. And we'll treat what was the first 45

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,320
minutes of this interview as a technical tour de force of the discovery of PI 3K, and we'll move

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,520
that as basically an appendix. So if you're listening to this and you really want to understand

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,720
science and you really want to understand how discovery is done, stuff that I really like to

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,440
hear about, by all means, you'll just listen to this as it's laid out. And if you really just

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,600
want to hear about the implications of Lou's work as it pertains to cancer, then you will probably

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,960
just listen to the first hour and 45 minutes or so of this and not the remaining 45 minutes.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Before we jump into this, there are just two things I want to say. The first is I want to note

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:59,280
Lou's disclosures. Lou is the co-founder of two pharmaceutical companies, Agios and Petra. And he

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,840
is also the co-founder of a company that is just getting off the ground called Feith. That's F-A-E-T-H.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Feith is a company that hopes to pair nutrition with pharmaceuticals, and that will all make sense

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,640
during the podcast. These are all really interesting companies, but I think it's important, obviously,

35
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,440
to list those disclosures at the outset. Secondly, I want to be sure that everyone understands that

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,560
we have a discussion here that is very detailed at times and very tactical at times with respect to

37
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,040
cancer treatment. And certainly every time I talk with Lou, I come away with a new way of thinking

38
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
about the care of patients with cancer. Please do not mistake what we are talking about here as

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,580
medical advice. It is impossible to provide medical advice to someone with whom you do not have a

40
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,320
doctor-patient relationship. And so unfortunately, I hate saying that, but it is an obligatory

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,080
disclaimer that I must provide. And whatever we talk about here, the combinations of therapies

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,440
with respect to drugs for diabetes, drugs for cancer, and of course nutritional therapies

43
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,200
really needs to be had in discussion with your physician. Actually, I lied and I said two things.

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,560
There's one other thing I want to talk about, which is there is a cancer trial that is about

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,120
to take off that is a really interesting and exciting prospect through one of Lou's companies.

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,800
The enrollment for that trial is just kicking off now, and we will list to that should anybody

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,480
listening to this podcast either have the type of cancer that's being studied or know somebody who

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,600
does. And it would be great to know that people are able to more readily get enrolled in that

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,880
clinical trial. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Lou Cannery.

50
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,640
Lou, thank you so much for coming over. It's great to be here, Peter.

51
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,080
You live like 10 feet from me here, and yet this is the first time you've been here, I think, right?

52
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,800
Yeah, it took me five minutes to walk in. It is great to see you always. You're definitely one

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,040
of the most generous people with his insights and with the work you've done, and I consider you an

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,120
absolute mentor in how I think about these problems in biology. So we've been trying to get on this

55
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,320
podcast together for a year, but it's a testament. I was going to say to how busy I am, but it's no,

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,000
it's to how busy you are. I'm busy, but you are even busier than me. I do keep pretty busy.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,160
Well, there are a lot of things I want to talk about today. I think to set my own expectations,

58
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,160
we probably won't be able to get through them all, which speaks in some ways to the breadth of your

59
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,520
work. We're going to talk so much about cancer and metabolism and things here, but there's what we

60
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,360
know today about PI 3K, which I think would be a nice thing to spend a moment on. But I also love

61
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,520
this idea. Like I have this idea, Lou, which is we should be teaching kids science, not the way you

62
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,000
were taught biology as a 16 year old, which was rote memorization. We should simply teach science

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,160
through the lens of discovery. So in other words, every biology class, even at the high school level

64
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,800
and even younger should be less about memorizing what it is that you see looking at this microscope

65
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,360
and memorize all the organelles or something like that. It's more of let's tell the stories of

66
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:11,240
science because one, if our goal is to train scientists, well, they're going to go and become

67
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,680
experts in whatever they're going to become expert in. We don't have to worry that in high school,

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,840
they're not going to learn enough content. But if we're trying to screen for people who are

69
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,840
interested in science, what you have to be screening for is the process is the discovery,

70
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,680
is the game, is the thinking that went into the experiment. It's the blind luck. It's the bad luck.

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,400
And that comes out in the story of everything. I've yet to hear a single world-class scientist,

72
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,840
and I have the privilege of sitting down with so many of them, tell their story without some element

73
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,920
of good luck and bad luck combined. Serendipity. Yes. Serendipity in science is absolutely critical

74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,480
that when you get a result that's unexpected, you should be laser focused on understanding

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,160
at the biochemistry, at the chemical level, why you got a different result than you expected to get.

76
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,760
And following these journeys is to me a better way to weave the narrative arc of science. I mean,

77
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,760
I think frankly, it's not that there's no value in knowing that DNA is a helical structure and it

78
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,200
has these base pairs and it has this backbone, but that shouldn't be the focus. To me, actually

79
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,280
walking through the fumbling of how those guys got there, that's a very interesting story.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,160
And that probably will serve a non-scientist better when they're done with science class,

81
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,880
because they'll have an appreciation for the process. And now I'm getting on my soapbox

82
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,480
about it would be better if policymakers understood that that's how science worked,

83
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,760
as opposed to trying to remember what they learned in a biochemistry class 30 years earlier.

84
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,680
And of course, for the people who are going to go into science, I still think they're going to

85
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,240
go back and learn the basics anyway, so we don't have to through rote memory get that stuff into

86
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,640
them. But it's this process of thinking and collaborating and walking down the hall,

87
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,640
and seeing the result, as you said, that doesn't quite make sense and saying, well, wait a minute,

88
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,320
there's something in there. There's a story. I mean, science is basically just one big mystery.

89
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,040
It's really about curiosity. That's what I'm hearing in your story is it's less about your

90
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,120
innate brilliance and more about your obsessiveness, your ability to make an observation and not let

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,720
it go. Yeah, if I get a result that suddenly doesn't make sense, to me, that's more exciting.

92
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,760
It means there's something more complicated going on than the simplest explanation for what I'm

93
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,360
seeing. If the simple explanation works, then fine, you publish it in some second rate journal.

94
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,320
But if you've broken up a whole new field, because your simple explanation doesn't work

95
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,280
and you figured out why it didn't work and what was wrong, then that's where most breakthroughs

96
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:53,240
come from. When did cancer become such a high focus? We met in 2011, two years after you,

97
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,440
Matthew Vanderheiden and Craig Thompson wrote what I thought was sort of the one of the most

98
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,200
interesting papers I'd read on cancer in the journal Science. It's hard to believe we're

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,680
10 years away from that paper. What was the lead up to your collaboration in that paper and less

100
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,560
about the paper, but more about thinking about cancer metabolism? Because today when I think of

101
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,240
Lou Cantley, I think of cancer metabolism. When did that transition occur? It was a postdoc

102
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,400
joined my laboratory, Matt Vanderheiden, who had trained with Craig Thompson. Matt's an MD, PhD,

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,560
now on the faculty at MIT. But he had been obsessed about glucose metabolism as a graduate

104
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,400
student with Craig. In fact, I'd gotten one of his papers to review, which I was very impressed by.

105
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,880
He suddenly showed up at my office one day saying that he was interested in doing his postdoctoral

106
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,800
work as he finished his clinical training. At that time, a graduate student, Heather Christoff,

107
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,680
had been working in my laboratory, and she'd made the observation that if she used tyrosine

108
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:10,040
phosphorylated peptides to pull down a degenerate sequence context, it wasn't a single peptide,

109
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,360
it was a whole mixture of billions of peptides all the same length, biotinylated so you could pull

110
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,480
down anything they bound to, and then use mass spec to identify all the things that came down.

111
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,040
First of all, she rediscovered all the proteins that were known to bind to,

112
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:32,360
that have SH2 domains. This is a domain that many proteins, including PI3 kinase,

113
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,400
have that allow them to bind to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. In that one experiment,

114
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,680
she rediscovered everything that had been published of all the things that bind to tyrosine

115
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,400
phosphorylated proteins. But she discovered the thing that bound better than anything else in the cell,

116
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,160
or that was most massively pulled down, was an enzyme in metabolism, pyruvate kinase.

117
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,600
That was shocking. I remember her first response to that was, well, the only novel thing I found

118
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,040
here that wasn't already known was this affinity for pyruvate kinase. She said, well, that's a

119
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,520
metabolic enzyme, and they're all boring, so I don't think I really want to work on that. I said,

120
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,920
no, no, that's whenever you get to resolve. You pulled the lube. The totally unexpected result.

121
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,880
That's the thing you should focus on. And so she did, and at the time that Matt was interviewing

122
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,400
with me, I told him about her results, and he got very excited about that, and the two of them worked

123
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:40,200
together to show how that was working. So this is early 2000s, right? This was 2000 and...

124
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,560
Mid-2005? 2005, maybe. Matthew Vanderheiden was a classmate, I believe. I've obviously met Matt

125
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,120
since, but I believe he was a medical school classmate at one of my close friends, Ted Schafer,

126
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,320
who actually I had on the podcast. And Ted also was an MD PhD, did his PhD in Harold Varmus's lab.

127
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,880
So it all kind of comes full circle. A lot of smart folks came out of the University of Chicago.

128
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,200
So anyway, so he, Matt and Heather ended up publishing two back-to-back papers in Nature

129
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:15,080
that both explained structurally how phosphatyrosine peptides or proteins binding to

130
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,640
pyruvate kinase could turn off its activity. And then also explained why turning off the activity

131
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,280
of pyruvate kinase was important to increase anabolic growth. And that is kind of the basis for

132
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:34,360
why we decided to start AUGIUS, that Craig was interested in how metabolism was regulated in

133
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,200
cancer cells. And we had made this observation that pyruvate kinase regulation was important in

134
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,720
oncogenic regulation, anabolic processes in cells. And so we proposed pyruvate kinase activators

135
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,080
rather than inhibitors as a way to reduce tumor growth as one of the targets to go after at AUGIUS

136
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,840
as we were starting the company. So that review, which I should say that Matt played a much bigger

137
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,160
role in writing that review than Craig or I did. He was the first author. So yeah, that was pretty

138
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,840
clear. When did the Warburg effect, when did you start paying attention to it? I mean, obviously

139
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,880
it was around before you were born. Yeah. So actually I mentioned F. Racker earlier. F. Racker

140
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,640
was, knew Warburg quite well and they overlapped in Germany. He was obsessed by understanding the

141
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,600
Warburg effect. The Warburg effect being a result published by Warburg back in the 19,

142
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,080
21 or so, almost a hundred years ago, that if you chemically induce cancer in rats,

143
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,960
the tumor that evolves takes up glucose and metabolizes it in an anabolic way much, much

144
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,240
faster than the tissue of origin prior to transformation. This was chemically induced

145
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,440
cancer formations. And this also, this observation was that even when there was sufficient

146
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,360
cellular oxygen to generate ATP much more efficiently through the mitochondria,

147
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,240
it was as though the cancer cell elected to go this faster, less efficient route.

148
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,680
That's right. The surprising result was, well, there's plenty of oxygen. We've taken a tumor

149
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,240
out. We are in an oxygen environment. Why doesn't it make ATP through mitochondrial

150
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,120
oxidative phosphorylation instead of through glycolysis? Why do you think the Warburg effect

151
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,920
was largely forgotten in the forties and fifties and sixties? I mean, it wasn't, it felt a lot of

152
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,640
favor, really not until late sixties, early seventies. And what was taking over at that time

153
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:37,160
was evidence for virally induced cancers, V-SARQ, Harold Varmus and Mike Bishop. So once it was

154
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,040
shown that viruses could turn on cancers, the idea that it was just an altered metabolism fell out

155
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,160
of favor. Of course, the discovery of oncogenes of which V-SARQ was the first clear oncogene,

156
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,240
because it told us that we've met the enemy and it is us. It is our own genes that are getting

157
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,040
altered in cancer. And so proto-oncogenes were being picked up by retroviruses.

158
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,360
Did anyone at the time think these two mechanisms aren't mutually exclusive?

159
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:14,200
The expression of or the amplification of, or the mechanism by which this viral injury to the genome

160
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,040
can perpetrate and can perpetuate could be through this defective metabolism?

161
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,760
I think people who thought about it deeply and who were trained as biochemists who were doing

162
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,880
metabolism, which F. Racker was one of the prime examples, continue to realize you have to alter

163
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,720
metabolism to do cancer. You need to switch a cell from a quiescent, not only from a quiescent state

164
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,520
to a dividing state, but in order to divide and make a bigger cluster of cells, you have to drive

165
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,040
glucose and amino acid uptake and anabolic processes, converting those to proteins and

166
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,560
lipids and DNA and RNA. So there was no doubt you had to turn up metabolism. The question was at what

167
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:06,200
level did metabolism play the role? Was it just a consequence of the viral transformation or the

168
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,480
ocogenic transformation or did they work cooperatively in some more complicated way?

169
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,240
So the R. P. R. on pyruvate kinase suggested yes, there is some clear cooperation where the active

170
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,520
tyrosine phosphorylating proteins was directly regulating the activity of metabolic enzyme,

171
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,360
rather than just turning up the expression, for example, through a transcriptional cascade.

172
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,960
So that's why it shifted the emphasis back to there may be targets in metabolism

173
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,920
that could give you an efficacy toxicity ratio for treating cancer. The truth is chemotherapy,

174
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,160
as you know better than I, is really targeting metabolism. You're blocking DNA synthesis or

175
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:52,280
other steps in metabolism as a way of killing cancer cells. So that's in a way targeting

176
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,080
metabolism is our first approach to curing cancer and now we're back to doing it in a more serious

177
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,160
way today. What was the point that you guys made that was so novel in that 2009 paper? Because

178
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,240
it's a subtle point that I think you can easily miss. You could easily look at that paper and say,

179
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,680
oh, this is just another paper discussing the Warburg effect. But you came up with a very clear

180
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:18,120
explanation for why the Warburg effect might exist that was different from the explanation

181
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,840
that I think I had looked at before, which was the mitochondria are defective. So I think

182
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,840
the easy explanation for the Warburg effect is the mitochondria don't work.

183
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,200
Therefore, the cancer cell has no choice but to undergo anaerobic glycolysis. You guys proposed

184
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,240
something different. Yeah, we proposed that you could even with totally functional mitochondria,

185
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:47,400
you could divert intermediates and glycolysis into anabolic processes by regulating steps in

186
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:55,560
glycolysis. And so the biggest question we know that if you have high ATP in the cell,

187
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,960
it will shut off glycolysis. And that's a feedback that there's high citrate and high ATP, either one

188
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,640
of those directly bind to phosphofructokinase, shut off its activity, and the remaining glucose

189
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,320
that comes in, it gets phosphorylated, either goes to the pentose phosphate shunt, or it goes to

190
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,960
glycogen storage, or it just goes back out of the cell again. So there's a break right there.

191
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,880
And so, if Racker was obsessed by how you relieve that break, because how do you get a 10 to 50

192
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:33,560
fold increase in glycolysis, if you're making so much ATP, it should shut it off again. So the

193
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,200
idea that was defective mitochondria was a simple explanation. There's no other way to make ATP. So

194
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,640
you have to make it through glycolysis. But the idea that there was something more complicated

195
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,080
than that was really what we were discussing in that review, that there was a way to regulate

196
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,760
steps in glycolysis that would divert intermediates in glycolysis from making ATP

197
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,040
to the carbon atoms of glycolysis and go into lipid synthesis, serine synthesis, glycine synthesis.

198
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,800
So it was sort of like a mass balance argument. It was an energetics for construction argument.

199
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,640
It was basically saying, look, the way to really think about this is, cancer is growing like crazy.

200
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,160
It's easy to talk about the energy requirement, but just think about the carbon requirement of growth.

201
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,600
Right. So one analogy I like to make is, imagine you have a river flowing through a valley,

202
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,560
and you want to flood some fields in order to get enough water to grow plants. So if you put a dam

203
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,600
here, then those other little canals that you've generated, the water level will go up to flood

204
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,880
into those other canals and allow you to grow plants. That's sort of what happens if you turn

205
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,680
off pyruvate kinase, then you slow down ATP production. That means there's less ATP made.

206
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,920
That means glycolysis, upper part of glycolysis continue. But instead of going to make more ATP,

207
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,800
it goes off to make serine and glycine and ribose and lipids. And that gives you all the molecules

208
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,000
you need to grow without shutting the system off because you don't let it go all the way to ATP.

209
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,240
Right. And that allows the mitochondria to make whatever ATP you need. And glycolysis is now used

210
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,400
to do anabolic processes instead of make ATP. That still makes some ATP, but you can now rebalance

211
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,680
that whole equation so that you can grow better rather than just make ATP.

212
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,200
Now, this had a profound impact on the way you thought about your life. You're one of the,

213
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,400
I don't want to say the few, but there are a lot of people who, a lot of great scientists,

214
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,240
frankly, who their professional work and their personal, the way they go about conducting

215
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,920
themselves and their own choices around food or whatever, there seems to be a disconnect there.

216
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Not the case with you. I remember the first time we had a meal in probably 2012, you were quite

217
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,080
particular about what you ate and what you didn't eat. And the thing that you were most careful

218
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,800
about was fructose. So what is it about the work that you were doing in the 2000s, the early 2000s

219
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,760
into this decade we're in today, the beginning of the decade we're in today, that had you start to

220
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,200
think about nutrition in that way? So I have to say that I made my decision about what to eat and

221
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,920
not to eat before I knew anything about metabolism. And it came from a simple empirical observation.

222
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,880
So I grew up, I mentioned earlier, I grew up West Virginia, Blackwoods, West Virginia. In retrospect,

223
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,600
I realized that as I was growing up in the 50s, we were eating incredibly healthy meals.

224
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,040
In those days, the most expensive thing to buy at the grocery store was sugar.

225
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,280
And my grandparents, who I spent a lot of time with working on their farm,

226
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,480
raised everything they ate. They were sustenance farmers. They had essentially no income. They

227
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,760
sold some strawberries in the spring. My grandfather would plow fields for people to make additional

228
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,720
money, but they had very minor income. But they lived off of everything they grew. The one thing

229
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,840
they couldn't grow, for a while they grew some sugar beets, but it was hard to get enough sugar.

230
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,480
And so when my grandmother went shopping, essentially the only thing she would buy

231
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,760
was flour and sugar. And one five pound bag of sugar had to last several years. And so when she

232
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,760
would make what she called a cake, we would call it a biscuit today. It had essentially no sugar in

233
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,680
it because it had to be sprinkled in very small amounts. And so that, as a consequence, we were

234
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,080
all very healthy, nobody in my family. In fact, I didn't know anyone who was overweight in my

235
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,040
spring because most people lived like my grandparents. And that was in the fifties.

236
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:40,760
What happened in the sixties was really what was tragic. It was all triggered by Castro,

237
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,360
as you know the story. And Castro's taking over Cuba and us boycotting sugar from Cuba

238
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,800
and the anticipation the cost of sugar would go up even higher. A German scientist had worked out

239
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,840
a way to convert cornstarch into high fructose corn syrup, which could be made much, much more

240
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,240
cheaply than raising cane. It's funny. I always thought it was a Japanese scientist. I didn't

241
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,400
realize it was a German scientist. I could be wrong on that. I would take your word over mine.

242
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,120
Well, blame somebody from World War II. The irony of it is it's always someone that got

243
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,560
hurt in World War II. And the joke is this was their payback. Exactly. And then Castro's payback.

244
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,480
So Castro did this to us. We did it to ourselves is the truth. And we saw doing it. And as long as

245
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,600
I was where the primaries are held, first primaries, and where nobody's going to cut off

246
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,360
taxpayer support for cornstarch and growing corn. But you had this profound belief. I mean,

247
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,480
I guess you got to experience something very few people do, which is a natural experiment.

248
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,960
Yeah. So I watched West Virginia go from what I would argue in this fifties was the

249
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,080
skinniest state in America. I never saw anyone overweight. None of the kids in my school,

250
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,040
none of my relatives, none of them were overweight in the fifties. Most of them were very thin. And

251
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,560
then along came high fructose corn syrup. And suddenly the cheapest thing you could buy were

252
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:13,400
sodas that normally at a six ounce Coke would be my total allowance for a week to buy one six ounce

253
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Coke. And now suddenly you've got 10 times as much for that cost. And so people advent of very

254
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,560
sugary drinks. People would start consuming 10, 20, 50 times as much sugar as they were consuming

255
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:35,800
before. And over from the mid sixties to mid seventies, I watched when I went back, I was at

256
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,080
that time at Cornell getting my graduate degree. And then didn't go back to Western into that

257
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,320
often. But when I did go back, I every time noticed a dramatic change in that all my friends

258
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,080
and relatives were suddenly becoming obese. And I just watched what they ate. And I realized they

259
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:59,800
were consuming massive amounts of sugar. Many of them were consuming diet drinks. But then at the

260
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
end of the day, because of their addiction, the sweets would eat like a gallon of ice cream per

261
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,880
person. When I asked them, how can you eat a gallon of ice cream? And they would tell me if I don't

262
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,320
eat a gallon of ice cream, I'll wake up two hours later and go to the refrigerator. So I can't sleep

263
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,080
through the night without eating a massive amount of sweets. So at that point, I realized this is a

264
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,800
real addiction. And I cut out drinking anything that was sweet. And I cut out eating dessert. So

265
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,280
that was 1975. Didn't know anything about the metabolism of fructose or glucose. Just empirically,

266
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,520
I saw the change in diet and the consequent massive change in obesity. So you basically

267
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,360
have these two sort of separate stories, which is this is this observational journey of your life.

268
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,720
And then you have the work of your career that is bringing you closer and closer to cancer

269
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:57,320
metabolism. When did you finally realize in the laboratory that this observation of yours had

270
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,640
mechanisms to it that could go far beyond obesity, but also play a role in metabolic diseases

271
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,600
inclusive of cancer? What really brought it all together, and this is why I keep emphasizing

272
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,040
insulin as a postdoc and ultimately starting my own lab, I kept coming back to how does insulin

273
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:22,520
work. And whenever we managed to see this PI kinase activity coprecipitating with SARC and insulin

274
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:30,360
receptor, I realized that the same enzyme was mediating the effects of the oncogenes and also

275
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:40,520
effective normal insulin signaling. And so that by 1990, it was very clear in my mind that insulin

276
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,440
was triggering cell growth in exactly the same way that oncogenes were. They were both activating PI3

277
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:53,160
kinase. And that suggested then a correlation between the two. And particularly as we began to

278
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,480
notice that the mutations, so many years later mutations in PI3 kinase were identified, it was

279
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,840
more than 15 years after we discovered the enzyme, the mutations were picked up from Burt Vogelstein's

280
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,600
laboratory. And as we began to explore what those mutations did, we realized they increased the

281
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,280
ability of insulin to activate the enzyme. So this whole connection between everything that

282
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:24,920
insulin does goes through PI3 kinase and most oncogenes managed to activate PI3 kinase by either

283
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,320
directly binding or indirectly activating it. Not necessarily through insulin, but they were

284
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,760
bypassing the need for insulin. We're going to come back to that very important observation in a

285
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,960
moment, right? Yes. You know exactly where I'm going with the next line like questioning. Okay.

286
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:48,200
But it also raised the possibility that being insulin resistant, which results in elevated

287
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,440
serum insulin because the pancreas has to generate more insulin. If your liver and muscle and fat

288
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,880
cells are failing to respond to insulin, then more insulin has to be made in order to bring glucose

289
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,080
back down. So insulin resistance is pretty much a silent disease because you don't really know it

290
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,240
if you go for an overnight fasting glucose measurement in the urine, your glucose is okay.

291
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,120
But if you do a glucose tolerance test, which very few people do, you realize that the glucose has

292
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,400
goes up much higher, takes longer to come back down. And the insulin level is much, much higher

293
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,240
than normal during that process of adapting. So that's how insulin resistance is defined.

294
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,880
But I realized that high level of insulin, if we add it to our cells and culture, cancer cells

295
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,240
and culture, it makes them grow better. And we've known that since the 1960s and 70s. We use fetal

296
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,160
calf serum to make our cancer cells grow in culture. And if fetal calf serum doesn't work,

297
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,480
we either order another batch, you know, another lot from the company, or we just add insulin.

298
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,600
And adding insulin always makes it work again. And so we've known for a long time that if you

299
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,800
have high levels of insulin, you can make almost any cancer cell grow better than just pure fetal

300
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:10,200
calf serum, which already has some insulin and it's variable from batch to batch. So in a way,

301
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,240
it's been staring us in the face for years, that insulin will drive the growth of cancer cells.

302
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,840
And cancer cells tend to have more insulin receptor than the tissue from which they emerged.

303
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,600
So in the process of tumors growing out evolving, they turn up the expression of the insulin

304
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,440
receptor, and that allows them to respond insulin better. So as I kept seeing more and more data on

305
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:40,040
this, over the last 15 years or so, I became convinced that the active being insulin resistant

306
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,440
or the state of being insulin resistant in humans sets them up to accelerate tumor growth.

307
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,520
When I interviewed Sid, I don't know how long it's been, probably six, eight, nine months ago,

308
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,800
he shared something with the listeners that I think for many people is still hard to believe,

309
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,480
which is smoking is the leading environmental cause of cancer, obesity is second. In fact,

310
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,760
I think he even mentioned that in the documentary that was made after his book, you were in that

311
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,440
documentary as well, great documentary. It was not named after the book, was it? Was the documentary

312
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,600
also called the Emperor of All Maladies? Yes, it was. Okay, okay. Phenomenal, we'll link to it in

313
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,400
the show notes because it's a real gem. I mean, it's worth every penny you got to pay to download

314
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,360
on Apple and watch that PBS special. Ken Burns, of course, is a master, but Sid made the point

315
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,680
there as well. And hearing you say what you're saying makes you think it's really less the obesity

316
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:41,320
and more the hyperinsulinemia that accompanies obesity in 80% of cases, which is high enough that

317
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,960
you could easily, just from an epidemiologic standpoint, identify obesity per se as the

318
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,800
trigger, meaning excess adiposity. But my belief, and I think yours, is that no, it's probably the

319
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,400
hyperinsulinemia, which means if you're lean and hyperinsulinemic, you're worse off. And I think

320
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,320
those data are becoming abundantly clear. There was a paper published a few years ago out of

321
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,920
Montessori Albert Einstein showing that in fact, if you take breast cancer patients and separate

322
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:16,040
them into overweight slash obese insulin sensitive, because a lot of people can, if you put on

323
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,440
peripheral fat, but don't have don't have visceral fat, you don't necessarily become insulin resistant

324
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,000
with overweight. So body mass index is not, yeah, it's not enough. It's a first order term,

325
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,680
that subset of overweight women who were insulin sensitive did not have an increased risk of breast

326
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:37,320
cancer, but the ones that were insulin resistant did. So that says a lot. And that paper also had

327
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,040
data on lean women who got breast cancer. And that correlated with insulin resistant lean women.

328
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,800
And in many nationalities, particularly Asians, they may look very lean, but still have a lot of

329
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,280
visceral fat. And so that I think we, our current mechanism of using body mass index is our

330
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,480
correlation is not a good one. Yeah, it's just not good enough. And Mitch Lazar in 2013, I believe,

331
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,440
published a paper showing basically the two by two of lean and not lean, metabolically healthy and not

332
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,520
as a proxy for hyperinsulinemic. And it turned out that it wasn't the body mass that was the thing

333
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,200
that tracked with health. Now, a moment ago, you gave this very eloquent explanation of the role

334
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,360
of insulin in cancer. Now, four months ago in science, you published a really interesting paper.

335
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,560
What did that paper show? So this is a paper in which was inspired by Mayor Bloomberg's attempt

336
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:38,440
to ban the 40 ounce Coke. So GA Young, a postdoc in my laboratory who migrated with me from Harvard

337
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:46,280
to Wal Cornell 2012-13, decided that she was inspired by Mayor Bloomberg and she would try

338
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:52,680
to test the possibility that high sugar consumption would increase colorectal cancer. She had worked

339
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,720
with Bert Fogelstein as a graduate student. So she knew a lot about colorectal cancer and

340
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,360
was working on mouse models of colorectal cancer as she migrated into my lab. And so we decided

341
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,720
we would design an experiment to test whether there was higher risk for colorectal cancer

342
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,520
with high sugar consumption. And so it was really two questions there. And my hypothesis going into

343
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,680
this was the insulin level, that if you go on a high sugar diet, that you'll eventually become

344
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,360
insulin resistant and that will drive high levels of insulin, which may accelerate the growth of

345
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:36,520
colorectal cancer. And in fact, we had data that said that what I just said was true, that in fact,

346
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:43,320
yes, if we allowed the mice to have sugar in their drinking water so they could ad lib feed as much

347
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,400
sugar as they wanted on top of their normal chow diet. How much sugar was in the chow?

348
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,960
So the normal chow diet, I don't remember exactly. Normal chow might be 10%, but you can buy these

349
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,760
really high sugar standard American chows that are. Yeah. So we just gave them the normal. Okay.

350
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,120
Child diet. And so because they were consuming massive amounts, they could drink as much of

351
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,400
the sugary water as they want. They drank five, three to four times as much water, sugary water,

352
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,120
as if they just had the controls without the sugar. And a consequence, they became massively

353
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:23,400
obese and they had accelerated polyp formation in the context of having knockout of the APC gene.

354
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,080
So APC is the first gene in human cancer that gets lost to initiate the process of

355
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,280
colorectal cancer development as birth focal steam. So the controls drinking normal water

356
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,360
versus the sugar drinking water is both had the APC knockout. They both had the APC knockout.

357
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,720
And what was the difference in polyp formation? So in that three or more fold size of polyps,

358
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,560
they were much more aggressive. And what about the cancerous transformation? Well, these mice,

359
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,520
the polyps became so big that we had to sacrifice the mice because they literally could not digest

360
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,640
food anymore. They didn't go into metastatic disease. So we couldn't call it a progressive

361
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,080
other than the fact that they were massive and it was beginning to include polyps. Now in this

362
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,800
experiment, you also tried to figure out what was playing the role in this and you looked at

363
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,800
glucose. So you could do this experiment with glucose water and fructose water, correct?

364
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,200
That's right. But let me get to the next step first. So that was nice and fine. It was consistent

365
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:29,880
with my idea, but GA wanted to challenge me on the idea that maybe the sugar was directly feeding the

366
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,480
growth rather than just making the mouse insulin resistant obese. Oh, I'm sorry, because at this

367
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,560
point your hypothesis was all still through the insulin. This was all being mediated through

368
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,360
insulin. Yeah, that was my hypothesis. So in order to try to always challenge people in my lab to

369
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,640
prove me wrong rather than prove me right. And because it's always learned more if my

370
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,160
simplest idea is wrong. Another great tenant of science. So she challenged me on this and Marcus

371
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,280
Goncalves is the other postdoc in my lab that worked with her and the two of them worked together.

372
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,720
And they designed a diet that would not allow the mice to become obese. In other words, they were

373
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,720
taking the total amount of sugar they ever consumed. It was the equivalent of a 12 ounce

374
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:19,240
cola sugary drink. And so on that diet, at least over the six months or so that they were on the

375
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,480
diet, they really didn't gain weight, maybe 5% increase in total calories consumed. So they did

376
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,120
not gain weight. They did not become insulin resistant. We didn't see elevation and C peptide,

377
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,080
clicosylate hemoglobin. So by all characteristics, those mice were normal, they were not insulin

378
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:42,440
resistant. And yet they still had increased polyps by two to three fold size. So at that point,

379
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,280
that raised the possibility that the sugar might be directly feeding the growth of the polyp. And

380
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:56,760
so we characterize that by using either radioactive glucose or radioactive fructose, or carbon 13

381
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,560
labeled and non radioactive, but traceable form of carbon atoms in fructose or in glucose. And we

382
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,000
also tried feeding them only glucose, the same number of calories of glucose, or the same number

383
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,280
of calories of fructose versus the mixture of glucose plus fructose. And they had to have both

384
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,440
sugars, fructose and glucose before the polyps would grow faster. So that was really surprising.

385
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,440
And do you think that that could be because the glucose provides the insulin and the fructose is

386
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,280
what do you think the fructose is doing in there? Because based on everything you said earlier,

387
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,720
a glucose water alone, just a pure dextrose solution should have been sufficient, right?

388
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,920
That's right. So that turned out not to be the case. And the way to figure it out is again using

389
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,080
carbon Tracy, either by radioactivity or heavy atom. So we did both. And first of all, does the

390
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,680
fructose or glucose get all the way to the colon? Question number one, it would seem highly

391
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,160
improbable. But it turns out if you add, if you have glucose plus fructose, the glucose competes

392
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,920
for the fructose for entry into the small intestine. And as a consequence of glucose is not as

393
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,680
efficiently taken up. And it makes its way all the way to the colon if you give it in a sugary drink.

394
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,600
I was just about to say, Lou, does this have something to do with it being in a liquid so

395
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,520
the transit speed is quicker? That's right. So if you gave the same amount in a solid food,

396
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,840
it would never make it to the colon. But because it was in a watery mixture, it would transit the

397
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,240
intestines fast enough that there was still fructose left. Your experiment was elegant

398
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,600
because you didn't have to do what my next experiment would have been, which is why I'm

399
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,880
not a postdoc in your lab is I would have done colonic lavage. I would have gone retrograde

400
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,760
and seen if I could bathe the polyps and not even deal with the absorption. But I would have

401
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,440
missed this detail. We wanted to replicate what you what's physiologic, of course, yeah, the condition

402
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,280
which humans do it. And other labs had already shown that again, give me a fructose glucose

403
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,960
mixture as a liquid at a certain volume, the fructose would make it all the way to the colon.

404
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,360
So what we found if the fructose made a colon, the glucose got absorbed in the small intestine,

405
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,720
but there was some local increase in glucose level in the bloodstream that's that is this is

406
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:23,240
the first time I've ever seen this elegant a demonstration of how you could miss in blood

407
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:32,760
sugar a problem, because by definition, the faster it's going through you, the faster the glucose and

408
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,480
fructose are getting through and bypassing the small intestine, the more likely you'll get actual

409
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,640
colonic content of them. And the less likely you'll see glucose in the blood sugar, which is why the

410
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,320
group that in the second experiment who were not being given ad libitum access to it didn't get

411
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,720
obese and didn't develop hyperinsulinemia, but still developed the polyp phenotype. Yeah, as a

412
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,040
side issue along the lines you're saying, we actually found in the case where we had the water

413
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:09,640
fed rather than a fixed amount to 12 ounce soda equivalent that the subset of mice that had the

414
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:16,600
APC mutation actually had more protected from insulin resistance. There was the polyps reading

415
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:23,080
so much of the sugar that it was protecting the mouse. That is unbelievable. And at some point,

416
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,560
you'll blow through that and they'll become quite insulin resistant and get hypertrophic polyps.

417
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,680
Yeah, yeah. But in this case, we weren't allowing that to happen. It was a very small amount of sugar

418
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,240
equivalent of a single drink a day, 12 ounce sweetened drink. The real surprise was when we

419
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:47,960
got to the molecular mechanism. And that was that you had to have fructose and glucose because the

420
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:55,240
actual carbon atoms that were being used to grow the tumor were coming from the glucose and not from

421
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:02,200
the fructose. And what the fructose was doing is when it went into the polyp, it was converted to

422
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,160
fructose one phosphate by an enzyme called ketohexokinase, also called fructokinase. That

423
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,160
enzyme is only found in three tissues in any significant concentration, the liver, the kidney,

424
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:23,080
and the gut. And so these polyps like the normal gut cells have that enzyme. That has been something

425
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,040
of a mystery of why that enzyme exists in it at that location. But in any event, it does.

426
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,720
What happens is the fructose goes in and it gets phosphorylated by that enzyme. And it happens very

427
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,880
rapidly. It's a very active enzyme. And that drops the ATP level in the cell because you're

428
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,680
consuming ATP to phosphorylate that fructose is coming in. Now, I mentioned earlier that the thing

429
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,840
with the Warburg hypothesis is that in order to get glucose to flux at a high rate into a cell,

430
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:59,080
you have to drop the ATP level. Well, this is a way to drop the ATP level. Instead of consuming

431
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,720
it in some other way, you're consuming it by phosphorylating the fructose. There's an additional

432
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,880
complication or not complication, but intervention that is also important, which is once you start

433
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:16,120
doing glycolysis at a higher rate, process of doing glycolysis incorporates an inorganic phosphate

434
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,320
to make the doubly phosphorylated glycerol and 1,6-bisphosphate. And so that additional

435
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,920
consumption of inorganic phosphate drops a negative regulator of inosine deaminase.

436
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:35,880
And that drops the ability to keep ATP synthesis going on in the cell. So the combination too

437
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,360
drops the ATP level dramatically. And now the glucose that's coming in is flooding through

438
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,720
glycolysis, but it's going into all these anabolic processes. It's being used to make lipids. We see

439
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,520
all the label from glucose going into fatty acid synthesis and serine synthesis and

440
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,440
nucleotide synthesis going up five or 10-volt. It's really quite dramatic what happens. But if you

441
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,920
leave the fructose out, even though the glucose gets in the cell, it can't go through glycolysis

442
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,880
at a high rate. And so you don't get growth. You have to have both molecules. The carbon

443
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:15,480
atoms are coming from the glucose. The fructose is basically driving the kinetics. Exactly.

444
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,760
When you describe it this way, you sound crazy. I mean, you're the guy that nobody wants to talk

445
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,600
to at the party. Your wife must be annoyed senseless by her crazy husband who's got this

446
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:33,000
hypothesis that now has so much emerging data behind it that says if you wanted to create a

447
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,240
molecule to kill people, it's not just glucose. It's not even just fructose. It's put the two

448
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,480
together. And guess what? Nature did that. Nature came up with a 50-50 mixture of this thing.

449
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:53,160
And if that weren't enough, she made it taste so good. Right. How do we reconcile this? Yeah,

450
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,320
so that's the part I like best. Because I think about everything in regard to evolution.

451
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,240
Why did things evolve? Why do we evolve to be addicted? Because you're ruining the party right

452
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:09,720
now. Exactly. So I think this allows if you think about humans 100,000 years ago, our metabolism

453
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:17,400
hasn't changed in the last 100,000 years. So 100,000 years ago, how often during a typical year in a

454
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:25,800
temperate climate would you have available high amounts of fructose and glucose? I mean, maybe in

455
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,960
the fall. A month, a month or so. So you would get berries ripe and apples ripe. And keep in mind,

456
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:38,280
these are very small berries, very small apples for domestication of plants. And so as a consequence,

457
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:44,600
what that means is at the end of the growing season is when most of the sugary producing

458
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,280
fruits are being produced. If you could eat enough of those, and you could keep your appetite up

459
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,960
enough to just keep consuming anything in place, anything available, you could put on weight. As

460
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,200
you go into the cold season. As you go into the cold season. And if you put on enough weight,

461
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,600
then you might actually survive to the next spring period when there's actually some roots

462
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:12,360
to dig up to eat and keep going. And anyone who probably almost anyone 50,000 years ago,

463
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:20,200
who didn't put on 50 pounds or so in the fall would not be alive for the next spring. So very

464
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,560
strong requirement to gain weight in order to survive a period of time when no food is available.

465
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,040
Yeah, Rick Johnson has written so eloquently about this. And I'm blanking on the name of his

466
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,960
collaborator, who's an anthropologist. And they even trace it back to which primates probably

467
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,440
developed this first. And they were primates that had left Africa, gone to Northern Europe.

468
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,520
And most of them die off. It was only the primates that could develop this mutation. And I believe

469
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,400
it was a mutation in both uricase and frictekinase. I could be wrong on that. And I've interviewed

470
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,680
Rick. And so we can go back and listen to that. But you had to develop this mutation or else you

471
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,800
wouldn't survive the winter. And then what happened was tens of thousands, if not longer of years,

472
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,040
of strengthening that is what allowed those primates to then come back to Africa to basically

473
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,040
become our descendants. So we as humans, as a species, have these mutations that would have

474
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,440
served as well when glucose and fricteaus combined were provided just at the right level.

475
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,600
Yeah. So if you didn't anticipate that you needed to gain weight, your body would tell you to do it,

476
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,200
basically how it came about. And so makes perfect sense. The extreme example is the hibernating bear.

477
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:41,640
We call it the honey bear often, right? Because in the fall, not only do they eat every berry they

478
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,360
can find in the woods, but they also climb up the trees and get to the honey bees. And they put on

479
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:55,240
150, maybe even 200 pounds within a period of two or three months. And then they go into extreme

480
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:01,960
insulin resistance and they hibernate, they fall asleep. But because of being insulin resistant,

481
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:10,440
having metabolic syndrome, their ability to break down fats is impaired. And that keeps them from

482
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,400
quickly burning up. The metabolism slows greatly. They preserved a little bit of glucose they have

483
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,560
for their brain and they feed their body off ketones and fats, I assume. Very long period of

484
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:27,480
time and then they survive. So we don't hibernate, but we probably became insulin resistant every

485
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,800
fall, a hundred thousand years ago in order to survive these periods of starvation. I mean,

486
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,920
you've touched on this briefly from a public health perspective. I know you're not a

487
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:45,000
policymaker, you're a scientist. Many would say it's impossible. Like we're just never going to

488
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,120
see the day when sugary beverages go away, but the data are becoming harder and harder to ignore

489
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,720
that there is something uniquely toxic, chronically toxic. People don't like the word toxic because

490
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,640
they think it only has an acute implication. Like ethanol can be acutely toxic, but I'm talking about

491
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,320
the chronic toxicity, but the chronic toxicity associated with sugar sweetened beverages,

492
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,160
inclusive of juices and things like that, right? It's not just a Coke. These data are becoming almost

493
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:21,720
impossible to ignore, yet they still proliferate. I believe their consumption is down. I don't believe

494
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,760
people consume nearly the amount of sugar sweetened beverages that they consumed 20 years ago. I believe

495
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,600
we peaked at around the turn of the century, but we're nowhere near what you consumed growing up

496
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,520
in West Virginia. Is it possible to get back to that? Is there a solution or is it simply something

497
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,080
that each person must be accountable for? Do you have a view on that even? How you reverse the

498
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:48,840
policy? I think changing cigarette smoking, there's a lesson to be learned there. What was the

499
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,840
incentive? How did the government make this happen? Reducing advertisement is one way to do it. I mean,

500
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,160
if you look at TV commercials, almost every commercial about food is about sugary food,

501
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,080
and there are many of them tailored to young children to get them to buy the sugary cereals,

502
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,440
to get them addicted to young children. You've got them for life. Just like cigarette smokers,

503
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,120
you get them addicted at 15, 14. They're addicted for life and there's a market for you. So I think

504
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:19,400
that's the appeal we have to make. And the question is, how do you do this? One way

505
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:25,800
taxing also helps. If sugar suddenly becomes like it was in the 50s, the most expensive thing that

506
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,600
you bought at the grocery store, then maybe you would quit buying it. But of course,

507
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,520
most people don't buy sugar anymore. They buy processed foods that have sugar already added

508
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,360
to them. By the way, looking at your experiments, was there any distinction between if you used

509
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:46,920
sugar as the substrate versus high fructose corn syrup? No. Succrose by sugar, we typically mean

510
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,720
sucrose from cane sugar, which can be crystallized because it's a pure molecule.

511
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,480
While high fructose corn syrup is a mixture of fructose and glucose, that's 60, 40 rather than

512
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,680
50, 50. But in our experiments, the difference between those two doesn't make a whole lot.

513
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,160
The fact that you need to, if it's sucrose, you have to hydrolyze the bond is irrelevant to the

514
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,520
kinetics you should describe. Yeah, that happens very quickly. So you don't buy the argument that

515
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,400
some, I don't buy it either by the way, but that you should eat your sugar in natural form, which

516
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,040
is it should say cane sugar or beet sugar or something on the ingredient. And there's this

517
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,440
whole group of folks who believe that high fructose corn syrup is horrible, but quote unquote,

518
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,480
naturally occurring sugar is not. There's so much confusion around this, but I just want to know if

519
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,760
experimentally you see any difference. No, I think whether sucrose, what shows the difference is

520
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:43,720
whether the sugar is embedded in a fibrous fruit as opposed to being pure in a water. There's

521
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,840
something about that liquid that is devastating. There are two things. One for colorectal cancer,

522
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,880
it is, as I said before, the fact that having it in a sugary water drink gets it all the way to the

523
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,640
colon. If you had the exact same amount of sugar, but it was embedded in a fibrous fruit, like an

524
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,920
apple, then none of that fructose would make it to the colon. The transits to the intestine would be

525
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,400
so slow that the sugar would have get absorbed. But does that increase the risk of cancer

526
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,080
in other organs? No, I think this is absolutely unique to colorectal cancer. But I would argue

527
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:24,920
on the other hand, the difference between eating an apple and eating apple juice, not only is

528
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,960
whether the fructose makes it all the way to the colon, but whether or not your glucose levels

529
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:38,200
spike after consuming an apple, a whole apple eating it as opposed to apple juice. And the

530
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:44,200
answer is with apple juice, you're going to get a glucose spike for sure. Eating an apple, you may

531
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:50,280
get hardly any change in your glucose because it takes so long to break it down that the absorbance

532
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,040
is slow. And you might, you know, what I've observed, I don't drink apple juice. I don't drink

533
00:51:54,040 --> 00:52:00,280
beverages that have sugar in them. But what I notice is nothing has ever spiked my blood sugar

534
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:06,840
more than a raisin on a per mass basis. You took a fixed mass of raisins and you contrast it with

535
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,880
a fixed mass of anything else. It's pretty stark because it doesn't have the water, doesn't have the

536
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,360
fiber, doesn't have anything else. And even if you ate, say call it, compare apple to apple juice,

537
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:25,080
if you did equal grams of glucose, you might even get a similar area under the curve. But where

538
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:30,920
it's going to look different is the apple juice, which will have, you'll get a big spike and the

539
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,560
apple, you'll get a gradual, you're going to have different insulins in response to this. So the

540
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,960
glucose AUC could be the same, but the insulin response could be quite different. That's the

541
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,600
point. And it's, in my opinion, it's all about insulin. Most endocrinologists worry about the

542
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,000
glucose. I worry about the insulin. So really there's three things you're worried about. You're

543
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
worried about glucose, fructose, and insulin, but in how they coexist. Right. So colorectal cancer

544
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,800
is unique and you can feed directly off the fructose if you get it all the way to the colon

545
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,160
through a liquid form. But it has to be in liquid form. But the difference between liquid form

546
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,400
and apple juice is, as you say, the area in the curve is the same, but the fact that the glucose

547
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,360
isn't going up as high means you don't get as much insulin release. And of course, if digested very

548
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:23,480
slowly, the rate at which you're ambitly burning glucose in your brain and muscle may be almost

549
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,240
equal to the rate at which it gets absorbed in the bloodstream, in which case you hardly see any

550
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:33,480
increase at all. And that means no spike in insulin whatsoever. So that's the ideal situation,

551
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,360
is to never allow that insulin to get high. Now, before we go into the why, I want to go back to

552
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:48,600
some experiments, some drugs, and something you said earlier. Let's go back to PI3 kinase.

553
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,480
Everything you said about PI3 kinase would make someone listening to this think,

554
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:01,160
if you could block it with a drug, could you block cancer? Well, obviously you thought of that.

555
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:08,600
So tell us about drugs that block PI3K inhibitors when given to cancer patients.

556
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:15,960
Okay, so by 1990, I was quite sure that everything insulin did went through PI3 kinase. And it was

557
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,160
also quite clear to me that many cancers have emerged because of activation of PI3 kinase.

558
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,560
Some pharmaceutical companies came to me and said, should we develop the PI3 kinase inhibitor?

559
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:35,240
And I said, well, I can't imagine how you would be able to thread that needle of being able to

560
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:42,360
inhibit PI3 kinase without causing diabetes, without causing severe diabetes. And unless

561
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,160
insulin went up high enough to offset the inhibition of PI3 kinase, you would have to go

562
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,520
off the drug because of the hyperglycemia. If you raise the insulin level, it could override the

563
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:57,320
PI3 kinase, it's also going to activate the tumor to grow more. So it could be worse.

564
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Yeah, so I was skeptical and never, in spite of all of our data saying that PI3 kinase

565
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:09,880
was driving a lot of cancers, I never pulled the trigger in starting a company or even encouraging

566
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:16,280
anyone else to start a company to make inhibitors of PI3 kinase. The fact that mutations in PI3

567
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,680
kinase were picked up in Bert Vogelstein's laboratory in colorectal cancer and ultimately

568
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:26,200
shown to be in many types of cancers led the charge to actually develop an inhibitor because

569
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:32,600
by then it was clear that other mutant-hirusin kinases, when they were hypermutated or

570
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:38,600
hyperproduced in cells, could be drugged and those would be effective ways to block cancer growth.

571
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:44,920
So with those observations, numerous companies, probably 15 companies, went after projects

572
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,360
developing PI3 kinase inhibitors. I was still skeptical that you would be able to manage the

573
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,360
insulin problem, but agreed, in fact, applied for and got funding from Stand Up to Cancer,

574
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,920
American Association of Cancer Research, to put a team together to try to figure out how to most

575
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:08,200
effectively use those inhibitors as they went into the clinic. And I remember after we received that

576
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:15,400
money, several pharmaceutical companies contacted me and said, will you work with us? We have a PI3

577
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,800
kinase inhibitor in human phase one trials. And they said, what's more, it doesn't cause

578
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,800
hyperglycemia, so it's going to be a safe drug. And I said, well, if it doesn't work,

579
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,280
if it doesn't cause hyperglycemia, it's not hitting PI3 kinase. So no, I'm not interested

580
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:34,920
working with a drug that doesn't cause hyperglycemia. Ultimately, we decided to work

581
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,280
primarily with Novartis that had a drug that we, several drugs actually, that clearly called

582
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,640
hyperglycemia. So I was convinced that they were hitting PI3 kinase and that that was in one target

583
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:53,160
effect. And the question then is, can you thread that needle? Can you manage the glucose level

584
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,840
without getting insulin levels so high that they would reactivate PI3 kinase in the tumor?

585
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,760
And that had been the challenge. So we suspected, I should say that in working with Novartis,

586
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:11,320
we got them to agree that if when the patients got hyperglycemia, that the endocrinologist would

587
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:18,840
judge was not tolerable, that they would ensure that if the patient could not be managed on

588
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,320
metformin, that they would have to go off the trial. In other words, I didn't want them to be

589
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:29,080
given insulin. I didn't want them to be given insulin or an insulin secretagogue, which also

590
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:35,160
raises serum insulin. And I should say that the endocrinologists who were called in and consulted

591
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,360
for these patients who were hyperglycemic on the trial disagreed with me. They said insulin is

592
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,120
totally safe. They should be able to get insulin. And we should do it that way. But I was quite

593
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,960
adamant. I said, well, I won't work with you on these trials unless you exclude patients who have

594
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,920
to be managed on insulin or insulin secretagogues. So Novartis kind of reluctantly agreed to do that

595
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:03,080
and went all the way through their approval trial with that as their requirement. Anyone who couldn't

596
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:09,080
be managed who would need an insulin or insulin secretagogue would be off the trial. And their

597
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:14,920
drug got approved just in May this year. It took a long time because roughly half the patients who

598
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:21,160
tried to enroll could not be managed on metformin. Could you also use SGLT2 inhibitors? So at that

599
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,800
time, the SGL2 inhibitors had not yet been approved. So we're talking about 10 years ago,

600
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:34,280
when the phase 1B trials that were the lead into the approval trial were being where we worked with

601
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,960
Novartis on that. But Novartis stuck with the initial requirement through their approval trial

602
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,600
that everything had to be managed on metformin. Otherwise, they had to go off the trial. And

603
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,960
that's why it took them a long time to enroll enough patients to complete the trial.

604
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,520
Now the SGL2 inhibitors are approved sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors that reabsorb

605
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:01,480
glucose from the ultrafiltrate in the kidney. If you block that, then the glucose ends up in the

606
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:08,440
urine. And so that's a good way to lower glucose and thereby lower insulin. So that tool wasn't

607
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:14,200
available at that time. It's now available today. So we did a study over the last four years. It took

608
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:20,360
a long time to do this. Lots and lots of mice and lots of experiments to test whether in a mouse

609
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:26,440
model for cancers, a variety of cancers, 12 different types of cancers, if you give a PI3

610
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:33,400
kinase inhibitor and use either a sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor or put the patients on

611
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:41,480
a ketogenic diet, which means that they only have about 8% of their total diet as carbohydrate. And

612
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:49,160
even that is slow release carbohydrate. The rest, 80% is fat and 12% is protein. And we ask now

613
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:55,480
comparing metformin versus insulin versus sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor versus a

614
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,960
ketogenic diet, what works best in getting the PI3 kinase inhibitors to shrink the tumor.

615
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,600
And I want to just pause for a moment. This is something you alluded to in passing 30 minutes

616
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:13,720
ago, which is very important, which was insulin can go around the PI3K inhibitor when you block it.

617
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:19,880
And that's why just blocking PI3K alone wasn't going to be enough. Is that correct?

618
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:29,720
More accurately, we know that if you take a tumor that has PI3 kinase mutations, for example,

619
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,440
ex vivo. So we did a lot of this work in organoids from our human patients at Weill Cornell,

620
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:40,280
and we would take an organoid in a mutual tumor, for example, and give it a PI3 kinase

621
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:46,920
inhibitor at the therapeutic dose, and we could kill every cell in that organoid. But if we now

622
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,520
added back the level of insulin that would be in the bloodstream, at the level of glucose that they

623
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,520
would have experienced, and the level of insulin that we actually measure in the blood of the

624
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,400
patient 30 minutes after giving them the inhibitor, how high is an insulin level typically in that

625
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:08,440
patient? So 10 nanograms per mil is roughly what we see within 15 to 30 minutes. And by 90 minutes,

626
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:15,400
it's up to twice that 10 to 20 to 30 nanograms per mil of insulin. And by two hours, the insulin

627
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:22,200
level was high enough that the glucose now in the bloodstream starts to drop. So that tells us

628
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:28,680
that that massive amount of insulin is enough to reactivate PI3 kinase in the liver and muscle.

629
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:34,280
And so it's not going around PI3 kinase, it's just reactivating in spite of the presence of the drug.

630
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,560
Because you can't develop a complete inhibitor for physiologic reasons.

631
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,000
That's right. At the dose that you can tolerate. Fighting this battle.

632
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,800
I see. I see.

633
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,080
If you completely turn off PI3 kinase.

634
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:48,360
So insulin still has to go through PI3K no matter what. You're putting up a porous dam

635
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,960
because a complete dam would kill the patient. Exactly.

636
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,920
And insulin is tougher, and in the end, it's going to win.

637
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,000
So let's suppose you're giving an estrogen receptor antagonist,

638
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:07,000
and you start getting toxic effects of losing estrogen. Would you decide that you would now

639
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,360
get estrogen? Yeah.

640
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,600
To correct that problem. And so that's what the endocrinologists are saying. We want to

641
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,360
give them insulin to bring their glucose down. You're like, that's the whole thing we're trying

642
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,200
to stop here. That's what we're trying to stop is insulin because insulin is what's driving

643
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:28,360
the activation. Those mutations in PI3 kinase will not activate PI3 kinase unless insulin is

644
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:33,080
added to the tumor. And I recall, I think I even told this story. I may have told this story when

645
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:39,160
I was talking with Sid on the podcast, but we were having dinner one night and I talked about

646
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:45,080
a friend of mine with breast cancer who was in a trial and she was in an arm in one of the Boston

647
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:52,520
hospitals and she was on a PI3K inhibitor. And I think it was a phase two. She was the only woman

648
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:58,680
who survived. She's still alive today. The only woman with metastatic breast cancer that survived

649
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,720
who on her own went on a ketogenic diet. And I remember telling you this out of curiosity,

650
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,560
like, Lou, what do you think of this? Do you think this is just an odd coincidence?

651
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:14,360
And that was the time that you and Sid were starting these experiments. As Sid described it,

652
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:19,880
that was sort of maybe the final clinical, the little pearl that sort of made you guys go off

653
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,040
and do this. And that paper was published a year ago, right? That was published last summer,

654
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:31,080
last July. So what was the efficacy of a ketogenic diet versus an SGLT2 inhibitor in

655
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:37,720
Metformin? Were they equal? So if you did a run-in to the ketogenic diet, so they have an entire week

656
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:43,320
on the diet, and then they're given the inhibitor, it's incredibly effective because by then you've

657
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,920
depleted all the glycogen, all the relevant tissues. If you just start on the ketogenic diet

658
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:55,000
a day before you give the first PI3-kinase inhibitor, it's still pretty effective,

659
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,360
but not as effective as the whole week run-in to deplete glycogen. Is there any reason not to

660
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:06,440
combine these? Ketogenic diet, Metformin, SGLT2 inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor as a

661
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,280
FU to cancer? Four cancers dependent on this pathway of course. Yes. Well, let me address

662
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,480
the sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor first, because that is almost as effective as

663
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,480
a ketogenic diet in our mouse models. It keeps the glucose level not quite as low as a ketogenic

664
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,960
diet, but pretty damn low. And the importance of course is in both cases, it brings the insulin,

665
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,840
imid insulin in the serum drops dramatically. But the important thing is that every single 12

666
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,440
different types of cancers, some of them had PI3-kinase mutations, others didn't, some were rasp

667
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:46,920
mutant tumors, didn't matter, some were, one was AML and SIDS study. That's right, we're talking

668
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:51,880
about that then. And I was skeptical that AML would have, because you never see a PI3-kinase mutation

669
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:58,280
at AML. But the bottom line was, there was a benefit in every single cancer we looked at.

670
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,120
The reason we did 12 different types, we were trying to find one example of a cancer. That

671
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,800
would violate this principle. That would violate the principle. The bottom line is, I think all

672
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:12,520
cancers require some amount of PI3-kinase to survive. And so if we can keep the insulin level

673
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,440
low, and insulin of course is the best way to activate PI3-kinase, if you can keep the insulin

674
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,600
level low, and now turn off PI3-kinase, you don't get that rebound of insulin, and the tumors just

675
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,520
go away. So ketogenic diet, if you can stay on it, would be my recommendation if you have cancer

676
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:33,880
and you're going on a PI3-K inhibitor. Sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor, however, is

677
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,760
easier for most people to take. It's a pill. And that's, I would say, the second best.

678
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,360
And of course, again, it's hard because we're sitting here, we can't give medical advice to

679
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:47,000
people. I get asked this question all the time. It's a very difficult question to answer because

680
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,640
I'm not managing the given patient. But cancer patients are among the most motivated patients

681
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,240
you'll ever meet. I mean, you know this, you've been involved in these trials. They will do

682
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:00,280
anything they believe has some modicum of science behind it that can increase their odds of survival.

683
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:08,520
Tragically, we're still kind of living in a world where the mainstream approach to this is a little

684
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:14,200
bit convoluted. Obviously, one of the most significant concerns that many oncologists have,

685
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,200
well-meaning, is that patients are going to lose weight. I don't know how bad it is today, but

686
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,320
certainly back when I was on the wards, we would force feed cancer patients with Insure.

687
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,600
I don't know if you've ever had Insure, Lou, but let me ensure you, it is full of sugar.

688
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,840
So now we're back to force feeding patients liquid sugar when they have cancer because we're

689
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:40,440
afraid of them losing weight. Exactly. So one caveat or one concern which came out of the SIDS

690
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:47,720
part of our trial is that, at least in the mouse models of AML, ketogenic diet alone...

691
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,880
It was actually negative, wasn't it? Ketergenic diet alone in most of the tumors doesn't have

692
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,560
too much. So just switching to a ketogenic diet, I think it's rare that that alone is going to work.

693
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:04,920
Maybe in some cases, but in the case of the AML, there was some evidence of some toxicity that came

694
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,520
in the context, not normal-miced ketogenic diet, they're perfectly healthy. They live a normal

695
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:16,520
lifespan. In fact, probably live a little longer, but in the context of this AML model that SIDS lab

696
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,960
was using, there could be some adverse effects. So we're cautioning people don't automatically go on

697
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,680
a ketogenic diet if you have cancer, unless you can have somebody paying attention to

698
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,800
potential side effects. Well, I had the luxury of sending... I mean, you've been so generous and

699
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:37,800
I've sent many tissue specimens to you from patients or friends, relatives of patients,

700
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,080
and you've got your own CLIA developed assay to look for insulin receptors. And we've even made

701
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:47,960
clinical decisions based on that, which is this is a patient who has lots of insulin receptor on

702
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,920
their tumor. This is a favorable approach to cancer. This is a patient who doesn't,

703
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,360
might not make that sense. How far is that type of an assay away from being a mainstream

704
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:05,720
assay that any physician can use as part of their toolkit to start to customize cancer therapy?

705
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:11,320
To reveal my conflicts here, I do have a company I've started, Petro Pharmaceuticals, that is

706
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:17,160
beginning a PI3 kinase inhibitor trial. It will be combined with sodium glucose co-transporter

707
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,840
inhibitor. Oh, I didn't even realize I'm bringing up all this stuff. I'm teeing it up for you here,

708
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,560
right? Yeah. That trial will be starting any day now. What type of cancers,

709
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,640
Lou? Are you looking for enrollment? So in phase one here, it's going to be a combination

710
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,600
with sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor plus PI3 kinase alpha inhibitor. Initially,

711
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,240
we'll be looking at solid tumors, breast endometrial, where you see high rates of mutations,

712
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,720
but we won't... So breast endometrial in what stage of disease? Is this stage four? Yes,

713
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,120
in stage four disease. So have you fully enrolled or? No, no, we're just, you know,

714
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,440
trials just hasn't enrolled. So in other words, someone's listening to this that either has or

715
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,720
knows someone with breast or endometrial cancer, who is stage four, how can they best find out

716
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,800
information on this trial? So Petro Pharmaceuticals, so of course, this will be registered at

717
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:07,400
clinicaltrials.gov, where you can find every single trial. So if you just go to clinicaltrials.gov

718
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:13,960
and type in Petra, P-E-T-R-A, that will... We'll link to that for sure. How many patients will you

719
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:19,400
take in the phase one? I've forgotten the exact number, but there depends on how many responses

720
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:24,200
we see and so forth. But the dose escalation... The dose escalation is going to be pretty quick

721
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:29,240
because we already have, we know what the dose is without a... Each of these drugs, you sort of know

722
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,800
what they do. We know, we don't anticipate any... So the hope is to get to phase two quickly. Yeah,

723
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,120
we should get to phase two very quickly. And the person, patients on the phase one could transition

724
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,720
into the phase two. This is really exciting, Lou. So in that case, we will recommend that they have

725
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,640
for breakfast because all these drugs, most of these drugs require that you eat breakfast before

726
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,120
you take the pill because that limits some of the toxicity you should get from and increases

727
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:57,320
the absorbance. But I think it makes a hell of a lot of difference what you have for breakfast.

728
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:04,040
So you'll recommend scrambled eggs and avocado and... Whole milk yogurt and not yogurt with sugar.

729
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,720
Yeah, yeah. Or high fat yogurt and... High fat yogurt.

730
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,360
With some crunched almonds in it or something like that, yeah.

731
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,920
Right. Now, Lou, is there any way to pair? Absolutely no juice, no inshore.

732
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:19,720
Yeah. In that time in the morning now, by the evening, the drug will have already

733
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:25,320
be below effective dose. So one might have some elasticity for what you had for your evening meal.

734
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,000
Although I will tell you something, Lou, you probably see this thing on my arm, right?

735
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:36,200
That's a glucose meter. I know what a nighttime high glucose meal, I know what a dessert at dinner

736
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:41,880
can do to my glucose in the morning and my insulin and it's still high. So for people listening to

737
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,360
this who want to enroll in this trial or even for you, Lou, I would just say the more stringent

738
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:52,600
people can be based on what you're saying. If the hypothesis that's being tested is more insulin is

739
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:57,320
worse, I think you're almost better off just biting the bullet and saying we're going to do

740
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:04,520
ketogenic diets. In fact, is there any probability in this trial of actually providing the meals to

741
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:10,760
the subjects to make it easier? So I have another conflict here. I've also started a company that

742
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:17,480
says making meals for dietary intervention in cancers in general. And this company, also,

743
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:23,240
Sid Mukherjee is a co-founder of this company as well called Feas Pharmaceuticals. How do you spell

744
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:33,240
that? Feas, F-A-E-T-H, which is a Welsh name for health, F-A-E-T-H. So my co-founders are Karen

745
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:40,360
Valston and Oliver Maddox from her laboratory, Ben Hopkins and Marcus Concalves from my laboratory.

746
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,120
These are a lot of the folks that were on that paper last summer. Ben was the first author,

747
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,600
right? Right. Sid Mukherjee, also founder of this, also Scott Lowe and Greg Hannon. I think I got

748
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:59,240
every question. And the idea here is for patients who have cancers, which the KD will be potentially

749
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:05,320
a viable adjunct to what they're doing, the idea is let's pharmaceuticalize it, basically. So is

750
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,920
Feas already selling product? No, it's just now getting started. We've gotten it funded and we're

751
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,880
looking now for where we're going to be making the meals and how and whether we contract some

752
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:21,400
of the meals out or we do them internally. This isn't going to be purely ketogenic, although we

753
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,200
will focus on preparing the meals, make sure they have exactly the composition that we expect,

754
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:32,760
rather than just giving advice and hoping people find the right foods. But it's not purely

755
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:38,840
ketogenic. In some cases, there's evidence coming out of Karen's lab and also my lab that reducing

756
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:45,800
serine levels can make some drugs more effective. Producing methionine levels can make other drugs

757
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,440
more effective in different mutational backgrounds. Say more about those two. I mean, those

758
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:55,960
methionine and leucine might be two of the more potent activators of the target of rapamycin,

759
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,600
TOR. Tell me about serine. That one's a bit, we don't hear about that as much. So serine,

760
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:06,760
some tumors rely on synthesizing, can either use serine in the serum or they can synthesize their

761
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:14,840
own serine. So the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, PHGDH, is the first step in

762
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:20,200
converting intermediates of glycolysis into serine and glycine synthesis. You need serine

763
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:25,800
and glycine in order to make nucleotides as well as glutathione. So for redox potential

764
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:33,640
and for combating ross rather, and also for building nucleotides, you need serine and glycine.

765
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,840
So you're trying to selectively deprive a cancer cell from nucleotide precursor.

766
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:45,240
That's right. How difficult is it to restrict methionine and serine in food?

767
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:51,320
So this has been done both in humans and in mice. Diets have been tried too. And you can get the

768
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:58,200
serine level down about tenfold and still have quite viable human. What about methionine?

769
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,960
Similar. You can also. Without just restricting protein. Right. We've been using diets for

770
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:09,480
metabolic disease intervention for years. Children lacking enzyme in particular. Sure.

771
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:15,320
Ketogenic diets for epilepsy and things like that. But even ketoneuria. PKU. Yeah. PKU.

772
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:23,000
You need to reduce the phenylalanine in the diet. So this idea that you could get better clinical

773
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:30,120
outcomes by changing amino acids, for example, in their diet, it's been proven clinically and

774
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:35,160
in bone areas and metabolism. So the idea that the same kinds of interventions and in fact,

775
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:40,360
ketogenic diets, as you say, were developed for not for cancer, but for epileptic seizure syndromes.

776
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,040
Yeah. Have you seen the data that have suggested this is a little changing gears. I don't want to

777
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:51,240
let you leave without at least some discussion of this, that in certain cancers, when you restrict

778
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:56,120
glucose, which would then imply potentially a ketogenic diet, you actually make the cancers

779
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:01,240
more robust and in particular in pancreatic cancer. Have you seen some of these data?

780
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,840
Actually, I've seen the opposite in pancreatic cancer. If you use a ketogenic diet in combination

781
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:14,600
with the drug. So in our hands, putting the mouse that has a K-RAS, P53 mutant pancreatic cancer,

782
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,280
which is majority of human cancers have those mutational events. So in that context,

783
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,280
ketogenic diet doesn't really do anything. It doesn't accelerate. It doesn't slow it down.

784
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:30,440
But if we combine that with the PI3, and PI3-Kineson never doesn't do anything to those tumors either.

785
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,200
But we give the two together, the tumors completely disappear. So you have to combine

786
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:42,680
the diet with the right drug or it doesn't really work. And it's really this diet drug pairing that

787
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:49,160
is really on the cusp of innovation right now. We're scratching the surface of that, right? And

788
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,280
will these two companies, Feith and what was the other one? Petra. Petra. Is the goal that

789
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:59,160
these companies collaborate and start to pair diet with drug? Yes, we could certainly do that

790
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:04,760
at this point. As I say, for Petra, we focused on the sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor

791
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,800
because we think compliance will be easier to monitor. And at this stage, we aren't yet revved

792
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:16,920
up to produce the diets that would allow those trials to continue. But yes, we could move on to

793
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,080
a ketogenic diet and even possibly on top of a sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor.

794
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:26,040
But we'd have to do a phase one study. Yeah, you still have to go back to phase one.

795
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,200
Phase one B. How many PI3-K inhibitors are currently approved by the FDA?

796
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:37,560
So there's the alpolisib, the varnish drug just approved in May that hits specifically only the

797
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,760
alpha isoform. Now that's the isoform that insulin activates and mediates everything insulin does.

798
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:49,560
And that's the one that's caused all the problems with hyperglycemia. But there is also a delta isoform

799
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:57,960
of PI3-K that's seldom mutated, but it's actually required for B cell growth. And we discovered that

800
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:05,400
back when we started knocking out PI3-K in a metapoietic lineage cells in mice back in the

801
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,280
late 1990s. At David Fruman, a postdoc in my laboratory, was doing those mouse knockouts.

802
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:20,760
And found that B cell lineage cells failed to thrive if you knocked out PI3-K. T cells on the

803
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,440
other hand were fine if you knocked out PI3-K. And ultimately it turned out to be the delta isoform

804
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:33,320
that was critical for the growth of B cells. So when delta inhibitors were developed, they went

805
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:39,560
into B cell lymphomas as the first possible place to work since that enzyme was already known to be

806
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:44,840
critical in B cells. And they turned out to be effective. Adele and Lissab was approved

807
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,120
about five years ago. It's a delta specific PI3-K inhibitor.

808
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,160
Who made that?

809
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,640
That was made by Gilead.

810
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,680
Oh, Gilead, okay, yeah.

811
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:04,760
And then more recently a drug called Capan-Lissab was approved about three years ago by Bayer.

812
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,520
This is a drug developed by Bayer.

813
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,800
And which isoform is that?

814
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,080
Again, it also hits delta, but it also hits alpha.

815
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,880
So the alpha one is the only one that causes the hyperglycemia. Yeah, that's the one that my

816
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,000
friend was on by the way.

817
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,400
Right.

818
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:22,360
But that was approved in May. And that seems to have the most ubiquitous application, doesn't it?

819
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,360
It's certainly where you see the most mutations. And of course,

820
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,040
breast cancer is far more numerous than lymphoma.

821
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:34,280
Yeah, but that's the one that's going to need the most management of the hyperglycemia and

822
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,120
the hyperinsulinemia. Is that message reaching the oncologists?

823
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,160
Slowly, I think they're beginning to understand what we're saying,

824
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,000
why it's important to keep the insulin down.

825
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:48,600
The problem, as you know better than I, that we are so specialized today in medicine,

826
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:54,520
that people commit to go into either oncology or endocrinology. And from there on, their studies

827
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,520
are completely, they're studying completely different things. And if you have an endocrine

828
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:03,880
problem as an oncologist, you don't try to solve it yourself. You call in an endocrine consult.

829
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:09,960
So your brain isn't really even focusing on how to solve a problem because you have an expert

830
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:17,080
who can do it for you. And the problem is the endocrinologists are not really that alert about

831
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:22,440
what's going on with cancer. Their job is to make sure the glucose is in line.

832
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:28,040
Yeah, sort of, I think it's time that we either, I mean, there's really two ways around this.

833
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:33,320
I see one is you sort of create a new specialty, which is metabolic oncology.

834
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:37,800
So just today, if someone wants to study oncology, they choose between surgical oncology,

835
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,840
medical oncology, radiation oncology. Of course, the challenge is you have to differentiate very

836
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,080
early. You don't do oncology first, then surgery, then medicine, then radiology. It's you do radiology

837
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,560
or medicine or surgery and then subspecialize. So therein lies a problem. How would you become

838
01:19:53,560 --> 01:20:00,280
a metabolic oncologist? So the other option is basically oncologists learning more about the

839
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:06,520
metabolism of cancer so that when it comes to managing understood and predictable complications

840
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,640
of these medications, which are actually desired features, as you point out, if you're using this

841
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,880
drug correctly, you should see hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia and you should treat it

842
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,840
accordingly. Which reminds me, by the way, how often with the alpha isiform does that drug need

843
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:26,360
to be administered or in your trial? Decision of how frequently the dose is based on PKPD,

844
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,760
fast the drug level goes into the bloodstream and how long it stays high

845
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:37,320
and following how quickly it declines. And so most of these drugs that make it in the clinic

846
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:43,320
can stay at their therapeutic dose for three or four hours. So a lot of the companies want to do

847
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,360
buy two drugs a day, one in the morning, one in the evening. And what's the total cycle? How long

848
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,760
are you being given drug? How long are you given a rest from the drug? And so, for example, the

849
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,960
Novartis drug is daily. It's once a day daily after breakfast on a full meal. And why does it

850
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,240
need a full stomach? Because otherwise absorption problems, you don't get as good a PKPD if you eat

851
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:09,640
your own empty stomach and you get more side effects, diarrhea or nausea or whatever, if you

852
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,920
try to do it on an empty stomach. But there's no recommendation in the approval trial as to what

853
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,320
you're supposed to eat for breakfast before you take the drug or whether you take it with insure

854
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:25,560
or apple juice or water. Hence the importance of a company like Feith that could start to standardize

855
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,440
that because look, everybody wants to do the right thing here. And wouldn't it be great if as a doctor

856
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,680
you could write a prescription that's not just covering the drug but covering the food? Yeah.

857
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,840
So we have, that's what we're anticipating at Feith at some point. If you can prove in a clinical

858
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,960
trial setting that you need this particular food for the drug to be effective. To maximize absorption,

859
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,920
minimize symptom side effects, and most importantly, maximize efficacy. You should be able to get that

860
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,520
food paid for, the delivery of the exact food that matches what your need is. And think about

861
01:21:54,520 --> 01:22:00,600
it, what a trivial cost it is compared to the drug. I mean, you could send people caviar spread

862
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:07,240
all day long at 1 1 hundredth the cost of a drug. Exactly. But you have to prove it. You've got to

863
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,520
prove it in a phase three clinical trial. Well, don't get me started on that. I mean, think of how

864
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:15,240
many drugs have been approved that haven't proved Jack. I mean, it's Ambien should have been

865
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,480
approved. Anyway, don't get me started on the drug approval process here, but I'm completely

866
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:24,600
with you on that. Lou, I want to be kind of mindful of your time. There's kind of one last theme I want

867
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,600
to explore. So you're going to be 70 this year, right? Which is kind of hard to believe because

868
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:34,760
I already passed. You already passed it. So you don't look a day over, I don't know, 56. You've

869
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:41,560
got this ageless phenotype to you. So I don't want to for a moment suggest your career is anything

870
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:47,480
other than continuing to go up in terms of the work you have to do. So as you think about the

871
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:54,040
next chapter of your career, what is the question that you are most obsessed with? What is the

872
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:59,160
question you want to spend as much time as you can trying to answer that currently really don't have

873
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:05,320
an answer to? That's hard for me because I'm the most unfocused. In some ways, I'm compulsive

874
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:11,000
about getting the answer of every question that I get curious about. And as you can tell from this

875
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,200
interview, I have an opinion on how everything works. And having never taken any biology course,

876
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:22,680
I have no prejudice about how it should work. I just so for me, everything that I run into biology

877
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:27,560
is here's a mystery. I don't bother reading the textbooks because I know they will prejudice me

878
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:32,360
to the wrong answer. And so I'd like to get to the bottom of what's really going on. But the bottom

879
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:38,680
line is that I get absolutely brilliant postdocs and graduate students come to my laboratory.

880
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:45,560
I allow them to do anything they want to do. And if it obviously gives them advice and help

881
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:53,720
interpret the experiments. But this has kept me in so many different fields for 40 some years as I've

882
01:23:53,720 --> 01:24:01,400
run my own laboratory. It keeps my mind continually alert about every possible thing. So yes, epileptic

883
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:07,160
seizures. It turns out probably most of the people have epileptic seizure fits have PIC3CA mutations

884
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:14,200
as a mosaicism in neurons in the brain. Ketogenic diet was developed to minimize that. It makes

885
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:20,040
perfect sense to keep insulin down. If a PIC3CA mutant neuron was solved, you're going to get less

886
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:25,320
firing of that neuron that's going to solve the problem. But that wasn't how the ketogenic diet

887
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:31,640
was developed. So my curiosity, if just studying everything that's which PI3-kinase is involved

888
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:37,240
at some level could keep me busy for several years. But that's not the only thing I'm interested

889
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:42,520
in. I'm interested in whatever curious observation that comes up from experiments in my lab.

890
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:49,480
It can't be easily explained by current knowledge. To me, that means there's an opportunity to break

891
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:55,960
open some new explanation for some disease. So I'm willing to work in almost any disease that's not

892
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:01,560
yet solved. And there's an opportunity to figure it out. I'm a chemist. So to me, unless I understand

893
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:06,440
something at the molecular level, I don't really understand it. But I think with PI3-kinase,

894
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,440
I really understand it at the molecular level. I think that's an understatement.

895
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:17,160
There's still some mysteries there. I should say that we're about to publish a couple of papers,

896
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:22,040
hopefully over the next six to nine months, that are going to completely change how everybody

897
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:27,400
thinks about PI3-kinase regulation. So there's still some major things to learn about this enzyme.

898
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,840
Well, there's so many other things I'd love to speak with you about, Lou. But I know that some

899
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:37,160
of them are still work that you're doing. And therefore, I know you would prefer to wait until

900
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:42,040
things are a little further along to talk about them. But we'll have to come back in a year or so

901
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:46,520
and do this again, because there's so much other stuff that I know we've talked about informally

902
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:52,280
about cancer that is I want to believe it's where the field is going to start to go. I want to

903
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:59,080
believe that because I get so many emails from people who say, you know, my mother has cancer,

904
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:05,400
my husband has cancer, and they're being offered this therapy. And it's a very standard therapy.

905
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:12,280
The patient is progressing through it. What metabolic options are there? And people like

906
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,320
you are people like Sid, people like all your colleagues and Matt and Ben and all these guys.

907
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:22,680
I mean, you guys are the guys that are kind of driving that forward. And you've made a lot of

908
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,120
progress in a decade. It doesn't feel like it sometimes. Like sometimes I feel like it's not

909
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,680
going fast enough. But I think having a discussion like we did today makes me realize how much has

910
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:35,480
happened in a decade. And it's actually quite a bit. I have no doubt that you're going to be here

911
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:40,440
a decade from now working just as hard. Well, my real motivation, of course, is to convert

912
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:45,880
every observation we make in a laboratory to actually change in practice for whether it's

913
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:52,200
diabetes or cancer or what other disease that we begin to understand in molecular mechanism.

914
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:58,280
If we don't convert those observations into actual change in behavior or change in practice

915
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:05,880
or change in drug metabolism and diet, then in the end we failed. And so that's my goal.

916
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:12,680
And as being a cancer center director, people sometimes listen to me now when I suggest this

917
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:18,360
is the way, this is the trial we should do, and this is the way it should be designed to test the idea.

918
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:24,680
For me, it's spectacular being here in New York City at Wild Cornell, New York Presbyterian,

919
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:29,000
where we really can translate these breakthroughs into new therapies.

920
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,440
That's what my goal will be over the next 10 years.

921
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,760
I hope you enjoyed that discussion with Luke Antley, and I hope you found it half as interesting

922
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:47,960
as you can probably tell I did. As you may recall, at the outset of this podcast, I said that the

923
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:55,160
first 45 minutes, which was a much more detailed technical description of Lou's initial work in the

924
01:27:55,160 --> 01:28:00,520
70s and 80s that led to the discovery of PI3 kinase, that content would be bumped as almost

925
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,560
an appendix to the end of the podcast. And that's what you're about to hear now. So I hope you enjoy

926
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,040
what was originally the first part of my discussion, but ultimately the appendix to this

927
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,640
fun discussion with Luke Antley.

928
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:21,800
There are a lot of things I want to talk about today, but I do want to start with

929
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,280
the discovery that you led that probably most people would associate with you if they go to

930
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,400
your Wikipedia page. That's probably the first thing they're going to see, although I haven't

931
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:37,720
been to your Wikipedia page in a while, so I don't recall. But let's talk about PI3 kinase. How do we

932
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:43,480
define it, by the way? Tell people what it was. So PI3 kinase stands for phospho-inositide 3 kinase.

933
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:50,120
And the 3 means that it phosphorylates the 3 position on the inositol ring, which is the

934
01:28:50,120 --> 01:29:00,440
head group of this lipid. And so in the mid, early mid-1980s, phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation,

935
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:08,280
which was known to occur from 1949, the purpose of it was totally ambiguous. Why did this lipid

936
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:17,000
get phosphorylated? And in early 1982, 1983, there was a breakthrough with the discovery that the

937
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,800
phosphorylated form, phosphatidylinositol was phosphate at the 4 and the 5 positions of the

938
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:31,080
inositol ring. By the way, inositol was hexa-hydroxycyclohexane. So there's six hydroxys,

939
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:36,760
one of them connects to the glycerol backbone, and then the others are potentially available

940
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:43,880
to be phosphorylated. Anyway, the 4 position and the 4 plus 5 position were both identified the

941
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:51,080
year I was born, 1949. And the purpose of that was not known. It was called the futile cycle,

942
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,400
maybe a way of just getting rid of phosphates or something. We're getting rid of ATP. Yeah.

943
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:00,680
Just phosphorylated, indeed phosphorylated. And sort of like an ATP sync. And then the idea,

944
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:08,120
the observation that this phosphorylation could be stimulated by various GPCR pathways and growth

945
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:12,760
factor pathways, got people thinking about what it might be doing. And it tended to correlate with

946
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:20,120
calcium elevation. And so the breakthrough paper showed that in fact, when cells are stimulated

947
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:27,880
with certain growth factors like EGF or certain subset of GPCR activators. No stand for. G protein

948
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:34,120
coupled receptors. And EGF just for folks. Epidormal growth factor. Okay. So all growth.

949
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:42,360
And so these signaling pathways would activate the hydrolysis of that lipid that the inositol

950
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:48,120
1,4,5-trisphosphate that comes off when you hydrolyze it away from the lipid,

951
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,680
turned out to regulate calcium release from cells. And that was a huge breakthrough

952
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:58,360
because no one knew how calcium got elevated and that explained it. So I, in the meantime,

953
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:03,560
it was not working on that particular pathway. And let's pause for a moment and remind everybody

954
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:09,080
you trained, you were interested in science from a young age, but you were sort of deciding,

955
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,680
I think a little bit, if I recall between chemistry and biology, you were very interested

956
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:19,400
in both. Correct. I was a pure chemist. The last biology course I took was in 1964 when I was a

957
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,720
sophomore in high school. So you very quickly declared chemistry your obsession. I hated

958
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:28,600
biology because at that time, at least in the backwoods of West Virginia, where I was growing up,

959
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:35,160
biology was just a bunch of descriptive memorization. And so I was bored with that

960
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,920
and decided I would never take another biology course. And I stuck to that. I was pure chemistry,

961
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:46,360
mainly organic chemistry. And then I switched into physical chemistry, but was totally

962
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:53,720
uninterested in biology at all until I took one semester of biochemistry and realized maybe

963
01:31:53,720 --> 01:32:00,040
there's something interesting going on in biology. So I went to Cornell and Ithaca to get my PhD.

964
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:06,520
And there I focused on biophysical chemistry. It was the chance to apply chemistry to

965
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:12,760
questions like how do you get molecules across membranes? And that's what I worked on. How do

966
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:19,800
you synthesize ATP in the mitochondria or chloroplasts? So that kind of slippery slope

967
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,760
of going into biological questions that could be addressed by simple chemical questions or

968
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,640
physics questions. Now, what got you interested in the mitochondria so early? I read a paper

969
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:35,960
when I was an undergraduate that was an idea that Peter Mitchell had proposed, that the way you

970
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:43,240
make ATP in the mitochondria and or chloroplasts was using a proton gradient. And his idea was

971
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:49,160
that that gradient would allow you to pull the protons in one direction, the hydroxy ions in

972
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:56,920
the other direction, and remove water from phosphate plus ADP and condense that into ATP.

973
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:02,440
That was just very simple physical property that if you could move those two ions in different

974
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:09,240
directions, it would produce ATP. In effect, the idea was not correct. It was correct that ATP

975
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:14,680
was made from the proton gradient, but the actual mechanism was turned out to be different.

976
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:19,480
There are actually three Nobel prizes given for how ATP is synthesized in the mitochondria.

977
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,880
I wasn't aware that there were three separate Nobel prizes. Do you recall who won all of them?

978
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,560
So Mitchell. Mitchell obviously. Then there was a second one by Boyer

979
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:33,480
on the figuring out the actual mechanism by which this occurs. And then a third one from Peter

980
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:39,080
Walker, who figured out structural basis for how this all worked. Oh, I didn't know the Walker one.

981
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:44,760
He was a crystal structure, did crystal structures. And I met all of them when I was a young man

982
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,920
before becoming a professor. And so it's, I was very invested in that. That's what I worked on.

983
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,520
For the person who's listening to this, whose world is not necessarily wrapped up in this,

984
01:33:54,520 --> 01:34:01,320
which is most people, it's worth pausing for a moment on how much is involved for the Nobel

985
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:07,880
committee to recognize one body of work that says something that three times they would recognize

986
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:15,160
a different angle of the same body of work probably speaks to why there is so much to this day,

987
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:19,800
complete interest and fascination with the mitochondria beyond just the obvious,

988
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,080
the energetics, which is what was initially how we would think about it.

989
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:27,480
Well, it was a fascinating question in the 1960s. This was the biggest mystery

990
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:33,400
because we knew how you made ATP from glycolysis, but how you made it into mitochondria. And how

991
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:37,720
could the mitochondria do it so much more efficiently than glycolysis? That was the

992
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:43,080
big question when I was a graduate student. I think this podcast may represent the

993
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:48,760
point at which mitochondrial topics exceed all others. It also speaks to that nature.

994
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:52,280
So Mitchell the great, tell me about how you interacted with Mitchell. How did you come

995
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:59,400
across him? So he came to give a talk at Cornell. And I should say, Efraakr, Efram Raker, who was

996
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:04,440
chaired the biochemistry department at Cornell, and who I got to know as first year graduate

997
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:11,880
student, because I was getting mitochondria from his laboratory in order to purify the enzyme that's

998
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:17,560
synthesized ATP. Every time I would be waiting for the centrifuges to stop running, if he saw me,

999
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:23,160
he would grab me and pull me into his office and start throwing out ideas of how he thought ATP

1000
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:30,280
was synthesized. And the truth was, at that time, he did not believe Kimme Osmotic hypothesis,

1001
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:36,280
Peter Mitchell was proposing. And so as a consequence, I got all of these ideas that

1002
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:41,480
he was throwing at me. I personally believed that Kimme Osmotic hypothesis was correct.

1003
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:46,200
Between those discussions, as I continued to, I was working in physical chemistry,

1004
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,800
I was in the chemistry department, not the biochemistry department. But the fact that he

1005
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,120
would spend so much time with me, even though I wasn't even in his department, to me was quite

1006
01:35:54,120 --> 01:36:00,280
flattering and really exciting that this world quality person had done it, was willing to talk

1007
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:08,200
to me. So he went on because he was trying to prove Peter Mitchell wrong. He completely purified

1008
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:15,560
every component, generated a synthetic membrane, reconstituted the proton pump into that membrane,

1009
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:21,640
generated a proton gradient and was able to quantitatively synthesize ATP. And it was the

1010
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:26,760
year after he published that paper saying that Kimme Osmotic theory is actually correct.

1011
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:32,840
But he did the definitive experiment that the prize went to Peter Mitchell. Today, I'm almost

1012
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,560
guaranteed they would have shared the prize. Mitchell had the idea Racker proved that it was

1013
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:43,320
correct, even when he was trying to prove that it was incorrect. So that was an interesting story

1014
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:48,520
that Mitchell was invited to come and give a talk at Cornell just at that time my last year as a

1015
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:57,000
graduate student. And so he met with me and my advisor Gordon Hammes. And I went through my

1016
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,680
entire PhD thesis with him and F Racker, showing them the various experiments I did about the

1017
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:09,480
mechanism by which this enzyme worked. It was really quite interesting because this was before

1018
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:14,280
Racker had actually published the definitive proof paper. So he had still some questions.

1019
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:20,360
And every slide I would show, Mitchell would say that's consistent with the Kimme Osmotic theory.

1020
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:27,480
And Racker would say, no, but this is why it's not right. And so I hardly get to say a word

1021
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,840
because the two of them argued every piece of data I showed. But you provided the substrate

1022
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:36,440
for the argument. Yeah, it's the data from my PhD thesis. That was a fun experience.

1023
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:45,640
So this is early 70s. It was 1974 when I met Peter Mitchell. At any event, the next year I decided

1024
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:50,600
finishing my PhD that I would look for a place that was asking questions that were a little more

1025
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:55,080
biological. But I didn't want to dive too deeply into biology. So I was looking for someone who was

1026
01:37:55,080 --> 01:38:01,000
working on like red cells or something. It was pretty simple study and ended up going to Guido

1027
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,360
Guidotti's laboratory, who had focused on membrane biochemistry. He was an MD PhD, but he understood

1028
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:13,560
medicine quite well. But his real focus was in biochemistry was not a practicing clinician.

1029
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:18,280
And he was in the department of biochemistry molecular biology at Harvard, recruited there

1030
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:25,640
by Jim Watson. He was absolutely is still a brilliant biochemist. I learned a lot from him.

1031
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:32,760
And he was working on sodium potassium ATPase. It had first been purified in his laboratory,

1032
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:39,000
the enzyme that pumps sodium out of cells and potassium into cells. And since I'd already

1033
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:45,000
worked on how you pump protons into cells with an ATP molecule, I thought this would be

1034
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:51,400
easy for me to understand. I knew how to do those kinds of assays. So that's why I started working

1035
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:57,000
on it. But it turns out that Guido was also very interested in how insulin worked, because

1036
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,840
whenever you add insulin to cells, within seconds to minutes, they take up a massive amount of

1037
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:09,880
glucose, but they also turn up the sodium potassium ATPase, the sodium pump, use that sodium gradient

1038
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:16,680
to move amino acids into cells. And so there was a lot of membrane transport being regulated by

1039
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:22,200
insulin. Was it understood at that time how anabolic insulin was? What you've described are

1040
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:28,280
anabolic attributes, but was it understood clinically how anabolic the hormone was?

1041
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:35,720
Yes, it was because just by observation that type 1 diabetics failed to thrive. They were very small.

1042
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:41,000
They did not put on weight. They didn't, their cells didn't grow. And so during development,

1043
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:48,680
insulin is an anabolic molecule. In a mature adult, it no longer, except under certain

1044
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:54,760
situations, drives growth. It will continue to drive growth of fat cells. It can also facilitate

1045
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:01,160
growth of muscle, but most tissues do not grow further than those two major tissues.

1046
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:07,960
So yes, it was well known it was an anabolic process. But now you were seeing the steps by

1047
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:13,000
which it could carry out that anabolic property. Yeah, and it was generally known. What I just said

1048
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,720
was generally known that amino acids uptake accelerate immediately within a minute or so.

1049
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:24,360
Sodium export of the cell went up and glucose flux of course went in, particularly in muscle

1050
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:29,560
and fat cells and glycogen was stored. And then of course there was a whole lot of change in

1051
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:34,920
transcriptional regulation of all kinds of things. So we knew all of that, but the actual

1052
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:41,960
mechanism was totally unknown. In the mid-1970s, no one had even purified the insulin receptor,

1053
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:47,320
had no idea what the receptor was. People could quantify it because if you added radioactive

1054
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:53,960
insulin to fat cells, it would stick to the surface and with very high affinity. And that

1055
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:59,720
correlated with the responses that you see. So we knew it existed. We knew roughly how many copies

1056
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:04,280
there were per cell. We could quantify by radioactivity, but no one had quite purified

1057
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:09,000
the enzyme to homogeneity. And so the numerous labs were trying to purify it. So eventually the

1058
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:15,400
insulin receptor was purified and it was about the same time that SARC, the SARC tyrosine kinase,

1059
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:26,120
the SARC oncogene for Ralcisarcoma virus was shown by Harold Varmus' lab to be protein that had

1060
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:35,800
amology to pKa, a protein kinase. And that also was an endogenous protein that had been picked up

1061
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:41,400
by the virus and altered. So that really was a major breakthrough. It got Nobel prize for

1062
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:46,280
Harold Varmus. He shared that one with Michael, right? Michael. Yeah, Michael Bishop. Michael

1063
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:51,560
Bishop and. 89, they shared it. 79, I think. Oh, but they won the prize in 89 maybe? Maybe I'm...

1064
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:58,520
Oh yeah, the prize was... The prize awarded. Yeah, the discovery was 78, 78. Yeah. So that was about

1065
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:02,920
the time the insulin receptor was being purified as well. And then Ray Erickson's labs showed that

1066
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:08,440
SARC had a kinase activity. They thought it was a threonine kinase. They looked for that possibility.

1067
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:14,360
Joan Grogy was his lab at that time given the sequence homology to protein kinase A,

1068
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:20,280
that it's probably also a protein kinase. And then Tony Hunter showed that actually by thin layer,

1069
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,360
the molecule that was thought to be phosphotanthine was actually phosphotyrosine.

1070
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:32,360
And phosphotyrosine had never been seen as a product of a protein kinase before. It had been

1071
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:38,520
picked up as an intermediate in DNA unwinding. And so he could get a marker for that from Jim

1072
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:44,200
Wyng's lab that showed that he could use on the thin layer and showed that what SARC was actually

1073
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:50,440
producing was actually phosphotyrosine. So that opened up a whole field. And then comparing the

1074
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:57,240
sequence of the insulin receptor to pKa versus SARC is clearly most highly related to SARC.

1075
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:02,920
And so multiple labs at that point showed that yes, the insulin receptor was like SARC,

1076
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:09,000
a tyrosine kinase. But in this case, a transmembrane protein had an extracellular insulin binding

1077
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,200
component, and then the intracellular kinase activity. So putting that in English for folks,

1078
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:19,640
insulin hits this transmembrane tyrosine kinase. And when the molecule of insulin hits it,

1079
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:27,080
inside the cell, this kinase pathway kicks up, it moves the GLUT4 transporter. Well,

1080
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:31,960
there's another step in there, but oversimplifying a little bit, that chemical reaction is necessary

1081
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:37,240
to translocate this transporter across the cell to bring glucose in. And that's, so the leap there,

1082
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:44,040
the new insight was exactly how insulin got glucose in the cell chemically and mechanically, right?

1083
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:49,880
So the initial observation was then insulin binds and about the same time EGF receptor was purified

1084
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:56,520
and FGF receptor and PDGF receptor. And they all sort of were like insulin receptor.

1085
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:02,360
They had an extracellular. And this was back, I mean, today, a young student who's in a lab

1086
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:06,040
doing this now is scratching their head going, what do you mean? Why didn't you just use PCR or

1087
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:10,680
something like that? But I mean, you guys were literally what, crystallizing a protein or how

1088
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:15,480
were they actually figuring out what the structure was? So these proteins were all being purified to

1089
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:20,600
homogeneity by just plain fractionation. There was no way to knock out genes and knock them down.

1090
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:26,600
So you just had to purify the protein based on its ability to bind insulin. You just run it over

1091
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:31,480
column after column after column. And eventually you've got to a single band on a gel and you said,

1092
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:35,080
that's your protein. And that only gives you the primary structure of the protein. It doesn't tell

1093
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:38,920
you how it's folded, does it? No, that only tells you. It tells you the molecular weight, basically.

1094
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:41,560
All the thing you get is the molecular weight. Yeah. You see, it's.

1095
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,880
Here it is on the band. Yeah. Insulin receptor is, it gets cleaved.

1096
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:51,240
But it's a heterodimer, isn't it? It's a single polypeptide that gets clipped during processing

1097
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:59,000
into two proteins, but are held together by disulfide bonds. So it's, and then a dimer of

1098
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:07,560
that composition. So that we knew late 1970s and EGF receptor and all these other receptors are all

1099
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:13,080
look a lot like the insulin receptor. And they all had tyrosine kinase activity

1100
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:20,040
that was triggered by binding the growth factor insulin. IGF-1 receptor also very similar to

1101
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:25,640
insulin receptor. One by one by one, different labs purified them. They all found the same thing.

1102
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:31,160
You had the growth factor of the cell and you get the tyrosine kinase activity activated on

1103
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:37,400
the inside of the cell. You know, that was a huge breakthrough. But still, if you ask when you

1104
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:45,320
triggered the cell with insulin or EGF or PDGF, and you ask what was the major thing phosphorylated,

1105
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:49,640
it was the receptor itself. So you just ask, where's the radioactivity going? Phosphate,

1106
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:55,240
radioactive phosphate, it goes mainly to the receptor, cytosolic domain. It's auto phosphorylated.

1107
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:01,000
So now we were left with this several years of, we have a tyrosine kinase that explains how all

1108
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:07,160
these growth factors work, including insulin and how SARC works, but we can't find anything other

1109
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:13,160
than auto phosphorylation. How does that help? So the breakthrough ultimately then came with

1110
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:19,480
the observation that these auto phosphorylations or phosphorylation of adapter proteins were

1111
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:24,840
recruiting a host of other proteins to the membrane that we're actually doing the work that was

1112
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:31,240
required to drive the cell growth. And so that was again, early 1980s, these were all being figured

1113
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:38,040
out. So I got interested as soon as I saw that there was a different kinase activity, this tyrosine

1114
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:42,680
kinase, I got very excited about it and realized there was an opportunity now if I can figure out

1115
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:48,760
what that tyrosine kinase does to figure out what might be the downstream signal. So we got one step

1116
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:53,960
into the cell. We didn't know how many steps we needed to explain glucose uptake or amino acid

1117
01:46:53,960 --> 01:47:01,080
uptake, etc, etc, or glycogen synthesis. So I saw a paper by Ray Erickson's laboratory

1118
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:09,160
in which he found an activity associated with SARC that would phosphorylate glycerol.

1119
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:16,040
And he published it in JVC. It co purified with the protein through numerous steps of purification.

1120
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,280
And so in addition to having the ability to phosphorylate tyrosine antibodies that got

1121
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:28,040
phosphorylated on tyrosine on the purified protein, there was also an activity there that

1122
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:35,000
phosphorylated glycerol. And I looked at that and thought, no, glycerol looks like half of an

1123
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:41,400
anositol. So anositol is six carbons, glycerol is three in both cases. But in the pure glycerol

1124
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:47,160
case, it has OH on each of the carbons. Yeah, three carbons with an OH on it. Yeah. Anositol has six

1125
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:51,640
carbons with an OH on all. So if you took two. Yeah, if you took the two rings and shoved them

1126
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:56,120
together, yeah, glued them together, you would get anositol. And then what the paper showed was

1127
01:47:56,120 --> 01:48:04,680
the KM, you know, it's a 50% concentration of glycerol, you need it for it to be phosphorylated

1128
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:11,800
was something like a hundred millimolar enormous concentration, huge, like a hundred to thousand

1129
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:17,480
fold higher unit ever finding a cell. Yeah. So they weren't claiming this was a physiologically

1130
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:22,360
relevant. I see. They were just saying, here's a chemical reaction that can take place. And they

1131
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:27,080
just noticed it because they saw this molecule running on their thin layer that ran faster than

1132
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:32,360
proteins. When they isolate, it turned out to be phosphorylated glycerol. It was sort of out there.

1133
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:38,040
Here's, we saw this other activity. What might it be? And so I went to Ray Erickson and said, well,

1134
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:43,400
that looks a lot like anositol. So why don't we was Ray at Harvard at the time? Yeah, one floor

1135
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:49,320
below me at Harvard. So my graduate student, Malcolm Whitman, who knew how to do kinase

1136
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:56,120
assays on small molecules collaborated with Ray Erickson's postdoc to see whether phosphatidyl

1137
01:48:56,120 --> 01:49:02,040
anositol might be a better substrate than glycerol. And he tried it and sure enough,

1138
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:08,760
he got this KM now of like five micromolar. Wait, wait, wait, how is this even possible?

1139
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:14,360
Let me make sure I understand what you just said. You take glycerol and you need a KM of

1140
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:21,800
a hundred millimolar to get it phosphorylated. You simply take the same structure, but now it's

1141
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:26,920
basically two of them stuck together in a ring and you get down to five micromolar. And it's also on

1142
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:33,080
a membrane component. So the anositol is in a membrane bilayer. So you sonicate the lipid and

1143
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,920
instead of free molecule floating around. Oh, so it's not a free anositol. It's the

1144
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:41,480
anositol in the phospholipid or in the lipid. Yeah. Tell me from a chemistry standpoint,

1145
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,840
and I apologize. I know that for some of you listening right now, you're thinking, wow,

1146
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:48,040
you guys are really in the weeds. I promise we're going to get out of the weeds in a minute. But

1147
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:53,640
I also think this is just an interesting example of the specificity of biology too. What is it

1148
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:58,680
about that lipid holding that? Is it the position with which it holds the ring in place that enables

1149
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:03,720
that phosphorylation? Well, now that we know the structure of PI3 kinase and how it works in its

1150
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:09,400
mechanism, it's easy to explain in retrospect. But at that time we didn't know that there was

1151
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:16,120
anything there other than SARC. So it was hard to explain why the SARC, tyrosine kinase itself,

1152
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,680
was carrying out this reaction. What did the editors even say of that? I mean, that's one

1153
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:24,920
of those things where people are like, is there a mistake here? Because that's like a five log

1154
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,560
difference. Physicists who had no problem understanding what I just said. If you can find

1155
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:34,360
things to two dimensions, they can come together much more readily than if you do it in three

1156
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:38,600
dimensions. And that would account for the difference? Yeah, easily. Try closing your eyes,

1157
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:44,440
bringing your two fingers together in space, in three dimensional space, and then do it again on

1158
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:49,000
the table. When they're on the table, yeah. You'll find each other. Yeah. So combining things to two

1159
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,040
dimensions is the way nature continually uses membranes. And the lipids basically keeping it

1160
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:58,120
in a two dimensional plane. Yeah. So in any event, we're really getting in the weeds here now.

1161
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:04,200
But just personally, I mean, all of that is intuitive to me. What's not intuitive to me is

1162
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:08,360
five log difference. I would take a one log difference for what you said. That's what's

1163
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:13,160
amazing to me. I didn't- Well, there are other reasons that will come clear. Let me move on.

1164
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:18,600
So the bottom line was that that SARC preparation, which we assumed was completely pure,

1165
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:24,760
wasn't completely pure. It was a certain amount of the SARC harvested out of the cell

1166
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:31,240
brought along this second enzyme, which ultimately turned out to be PI3K,

1167
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:37,560
phosphonosatide 3 kinase. But we didn't know that at that time. And so we suggested in the paper

1168
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:44,440
that the SARC very same enzymatic pocket could both accommodate tyrosine as a substrate and also

1169
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:50,760
accommodate the head group of phosphatide and onositol. That in the end turned out to be incorrect

1170
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:56,840
in that even though by all criteria that we could characterize at that point, we couldn't

1171
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:02,520
prove that there was a separate function. If you used a kinase dead SARC or a mutant of SARC that

1172
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:08,520
no longer had activity, then the phosphonotidol and onositol kinase also went away. That's why

1173
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:13,320
we thought it was the same pocket that was doing both. Retrospect, it turns out that the enzyme

1174
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:19,240
has to be active in order to bind to PI3 kinase. And that's why that activity was coming along.

1175
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:25,960
So we published that. We're very clear to say that we used sonicated membranes to do the assay,

1176
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,880
which was necessary to get this mini log preference for that substrate. In the meantime,

1177
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:36,760
after publishing that, multiple other labs tried to reproduce it. But they didn't have

1178
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:42,680
the machine that would sonify the lipids to make the membrane bilayers. So they just added detergent.

1179
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:48,440
So even though we showed in our paper that if you added detergent, the enzyme activity

1180
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:52,920
completely disappeared. Wouldn't the detergent break the glycerol off the lipid?

1181
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:58,440
The phosphotidol and onositol would now get embedded into the detergent rather than being

1182
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:02,920
a bilayer. Yeah, it wouldn't stick to it at all, right? Right. So you're going to lose that

1183
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:07,560
advantage of having a membrane. And that wasn't known at the time, I guess. Well, we knew it

1184
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:12,840
because I'd worked on membranes for the previous 10 years. But the other labs didn't, I guess at

1185
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,440
the time they didn't know that. They were not membrane biochemists. They were all molecular

1186
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:21,960
biologists. So they tried to reproduce the result, but they didn't have a sonifier to make

1187
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:27,000
membrane lipids. And they assumed it phosphorylates the head group. Phosphotidol and onositol shouldn't

1188
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,080
make any difference how you present it. And so they presented it to detergent micelle and they

1189
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:38,200
could not reproduce the results. So there were three prominent papers coming out a year or so

1190
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:43,320
later saying, Nope, this is incorrect. This is incorrect. This is incorrect from major laboratories.

1191
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:47,560
So at that point, it already started collaboration with Tom Roberts. But at that point, Lou,

1192
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:51,800
did you have confidence that you had done this correctly? Or were you questioning yourself?

1193
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:57,400
I had no doubt. So you knew this was a methodologic error on the part of these other three labs.

1194
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:01,560
And despite the fact that at this point, the scientific community would look at you and say,

1195
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:06,120
Lou, you're probably wrong. You were confident in your methodology. Yeah, there was no doubt. All

1196
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:12,360
my research had been on membrane enzymes and membrane reconstitution, etc. So I knew what I

1197
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:17,160
was doing made sense. And I knew our results are reproducible. Because not only can multiple

1198
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:21,720
people in my laboratory do it, but multiple people in Tom Roberts laboratory who we started

1199
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:28,520
a collaboration with could do it. And Brian Schaffhausen's lab, which was a third collaborator,

1200
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:33,080
could also reproduce it. So multiple people in multiple independent labs all got the same

1201
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:39,240
result. If you sonified the lipid, and if you added MP40 detergent to solubilize a lipid,

1202
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,840
then the activity went away. So there was no doubt about that. And so I had no lack of confidence

1203
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:51,720
that we were right. But the problem was how to convince these other laboratories that they needed

1204
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:55,800
to do the essay right. They didn't want to buy a sonifier. They were like, I'm done with that

1205
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:03,560
when there doesn't work. So we actually sent David Kaplan, the graduate student Tom Roberts lab,

1206
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:08,520
and Malcolm Hootman, the graduate student of my laboratory, to these other laboratories with the

1207
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:14,840
sonifier. They went there, they sonified the lipid form, gave them to their graduate students

1208
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:20,120
who then did the essay again. And now they got the same result we got. Are you pushing this hard

1209
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:25,160
to get the other labs to see it because you know how important this is going to be? Or you have

1210
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:30,040
sort of premonition about the role that PI3K is going to play in growth? I mean, you couldn't

1211
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:37,320
have possibly seen in the early 80s what you know today. So how much of this was just scratching an

1212
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:45,720
intellectual itch versus a biologic intuition about the importance of this to overall growth,

1213
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:50,920
which is obviously where we're going. I'm amazed we are this far in and we haven't used the c-word

1214
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:59,320
yet. So the reason I was completely convinced by 1976, 1977, that this was driving growth of cancer

1215
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:05,960
cells is the collaboration we started with Tom Roberts lab. And Tom Roberts had been working on

1216
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:15,400
polyoma middle T. So polyoma virus is a DNA virus while SARC is an RNA virus. So it causes,

1217
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:21,640
as the name implies, the formation of multiple tumors in mice. So you infect a mouse with this

1218
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:30,520
virus and all kinds of tumors show up everywhere. And so Tom had begun mutating various regions of

1219
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:38,120
polyoma middle T. And reason we looked at polyoma middle T is because his lab and Sarah Courtney's

1220
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:45,480
lab and others in Schaffhausen had shown that SARC copurifies with polyoma middle T. We already

1221
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:52,200
knew by the mid 70s that SARC was somehow implicated in how polyoma middle T transforms

1222
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:56,360
cells and forms all these tumors. That's why I went to collaborate with Tom because he had

1223
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:01,160
additional tools that we could collaborate with to understand. And so he had made all kinds of

1224
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:07,640
mutations. He'd also found that SARC phosphorylated his site in polyoma middle T, a tyrosine site was

1225
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:14,760
highly phosphorylated. And even more importantly, that if you mutated that tyrosine residue to

1226
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:21,000
phenylalanine, polyoma middle T completely lost its ability to transform cells. It's a single point

1227
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:27,560
mutation. Even though the SARC protein was still bound, there was no longer tyrosine phosphorylation

1228
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:35,080
315 and that eliminated the ability to transform cells. So we said, well, if PI3 kinase is not

1229
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:41,640
SARC itself, maybe it binds to middle T independently. But we found that if you prevented

1230
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:46,120
SARC from binding the middle T, then you didn't get that tyrosine phosphorylation. And now there

1231
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:53,880
was no PI3 kinase activity bound to middle T. So you needed SARC for middle T to bind to PI3 kinase.

1232
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,800
At this time, we didn't know it was phosphorylated in the three position, which we'll come back to.

1233
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:03,640
However, the shocking result was that if you eliminated that tyrosine residue,

1234
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:10,120
now PI3 kinase would no longer bind and middle T would no longer transform cells,

1235
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:14,760
even though SARC was still there and was still activated. So that said that activating SARC

1236
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:21,160
is not sufficient to transform a cell unless you also activate PI3 kinase. And we published that in

1237
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:27,960
Nature in 76, I think, 76, 77 in Nature. Were you collaborating with Bishop and Varmus at this point

1238
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:33,320
in time? 86, 86, and then 86, 87. So 84 was when we published the paper with Ray Erickson.

1239
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:38,760
And then a couple of years later with Tom Roberts and a couple of papers we had, and we showed that

1240
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:45,640
PDGF receptor also when activated brought down COPRIS of the PI3 kinase activity, etc, etc.

1241
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:54,280
So that's where we were in 1986, 87 or so. And at least some of the people who had gotten sonicators

1242
01:58:54,920 --> 01:59:01,560
also believed us that this was really uniquely associated with tyrosine kinases after they were

1243
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,960
activated by growth factors. We saw the insulin receptor would also bring down PI3 kinase only

1244
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:12,840
if you stimulate insulin first. Then you could also bring down this PI kinase activity.

1245
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:20,680
But at that time, the only monophosphorylated form of phosphatidylinositol known was phosphatidylinositol

1246
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:28,760
4-phosphate. That was discovered in 1949. I mentioned earlier there's a 4-phosphorylation

1247
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:34,600
and there's a 4 plus 5 phosphorylation. And those are the only two species of phosphorylated

1248
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:41,240
phosphatidylinositol. So we assumed that this was phosphorylation at the 4 position.

1249
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:50,040
But as we began to characterize the ability of proteins from cells to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol,

1250
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:54,520
we found that there were two activities. There was one that required that you sonic

1251
01:59:54,520 --> 02:00:00,520
by the membranes for it to bind and get for it to have activity. And another that would work

1252
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:06,920
perfectly well, in fact even better, if the lipid was dissolved in a detergent. So we called those

1253
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:15,320
two enzymes type 1 and type 2 PI kinase. And it was only the type 1, the one that required sonified

1254
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:22,280
lipids that coprecipitated with all these tyrosine kinases. The type 2 had completely different

1255
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:28,280
enzymatic characters. So it was inhibited by adenosine, the type 1 wasn't. And so we had a whole

1256
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:33,160
lot of profiles that said these were two different enzymes. So Malcolm Whitman, registered in my lab,

1257
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:40,120
decided to separate them. So he ran column fractionations and mid-S activities with or without

1258
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:45,560
detergent, with or without adenosine. And he characterized the two enzymes, separated them

1259
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:52,440
completely. And he had a lab, we had a lab meeting which every other spot on the thin layer,

1260
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,720
which is how we characterized the lipid phosphorylation, we ran it out

1261
02:00:56,360 --> 02:01:03,560
to separate the molecules based on migration in a solvent on a silica plate. And we noticed in the

1262
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:10,280
lab meeting that every other spot migrated about one millimeter different from the previous spot.

1263
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:16,280
And the way that Malcolm had spotted them on the thin layer was it was type 1, then type 2, then type 1,

1264
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:21,880
then type 2, type 1, type 2, all the way across. If you looked at where the radioactivity ran,

1265
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:29,080
it went up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. And the bottom line was, to me as a chemist,

1266
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:32,760
the fact that they migrate differently means they have to be chemically different.

1267
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:39,400
That meant that one of those molecules was being phosphorylated at a different position on the

1268
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:44,840
inositol ring from the other. And so we began the process then of chemically characterizing

1269
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:50,360
the product of the type 1 and the type 2 enzyme. And how subtle was this, by the way?

1270
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:54,840
Was this obvious in looking at it? Or was it something that could have easily been dismissed?

1271
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:58,520
I guarantee almost everybody would have dismissed this. One millimeter.

1272
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,920
Yeah, I was about to say that just doesn't sound like...

1273
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:06,760
The spot was at least 10 millimeters diameter, and the center of the spots were one millimeter

1274
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:07,640
different.

1275
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,920
Do you naturally have an eye that gravitates towards symmetry?

1276
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,040
I have an eye that gravitates towards unexpected results.

1277
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:20,840
And to me, there's no way to explain it. If you had only two spots beside each other,

1278
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:24,680
you could say, well, that side of the thin layer migrated a little faster because of

1279
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:31,480
the solvent front was not completely horizontal. But you couldn't explain the up, down, up,

1280
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:32,920
down, up, down, all the way across.

1281
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:34,360
Do you still have a photo of that?

1282
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,920
It's in figure one in the Nature paper that we published.

1283
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:38,440
From 88?

1284
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:39,400
88.

1285
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:39,960
88.

1286
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,440
We'll link to that figure.

1287
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:50,440
But the observation was made in 1987. I bumped into Peter Downs, who's one of the best lipid

1288
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:56,360
chemists in the world, and at a meeting at Cold Spring Harbor, and I told him this result. And

1289
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:03,080
I said, I know you must have standards for anositol degradation. So can we work together? And

1290
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:07,880
so we knew it had to be some site other than the four position, but it could have been the five,

1291
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:08,840
it could have been the three.

1292
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:12,040
Yeah. Was there a chance it could have been you were looking at four

1293
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:14,920
versus four plus five? Four versus four plus five?

1294
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:20,200
No, because we knew at four plus five, it would migrate to about three inches different.

1295
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:25,880
So that would look totally different. So the null hypothesis is you're just looking at four

1296
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:30,840
and your assays a little dirty, but you're thinking, no, it's something else.

1297
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:36,600
Yeah. Of course, we repeated it multiple times. And we also did HPLC separation, reverse phase,

1298
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:41,960
every way you could look at it. And in every way we did it, they were chemically different.

1299
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:47,160
They migrated differently in numerous. The nature paper, we only put that one slide,

1300
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:53,960
that one figure of the slightly different migration. Because from there on, we did the

1301
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,880
chemistry to prove that it was a three position.

1302
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:01,720
Why do you think the three position had such a similar look to the four versus the five?

1303
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:07,320
Well, keep in mind, there were only two species known to exist. At the time we made this discovery,

1304
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,480
phosphotidylinositol, four phosphate.

1305
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:11,160
Oh, and four, five.

1306
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:11,720
And four, five.

1307
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:13,000
It was not a five by itself.

1308
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,440
It was not a five by itself.

1309
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:14,920
Got it.

1310
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:22,040
So this told us there's a three by itself. And then we went on to show there's also three, four,

1311
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:27,800
and also three, four, five. PI three counties could phosphorylate the three position,

1312
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:32,840
whether or not the four or five were already phosphorylated.

1313
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:40,200
So we now, that generated three new species, PI three P, PI three, four, and PI three, four, five.

1314
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:44,040
But I have to say the three, four, five, this is sort of another

1315
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:50,520
sidebar that we could drop out of this, but it's so cool. Never published it because it

1316
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:53,880
was embarrassing. But to say it, you may as well get embarrassed.

1317
02:04:54,840 --> 02:05:00,760
So we knew that there were species that had been claimed to be four, five that were probably three,

1318
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:07,560
four for the same reason that the three P was thought to be four P because separating the three,

1319
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:15,000
four from the four, five was also hard. So we looked for that carefully and found that in fact,

1320
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:21,080
there was a three, four being made and proved that the same enzyme was making three P.

1321
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:24,680
And if you gave it PR four P to the substrate, it would make three, four P two.

1322
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:30,760
Leslie Serunian in a postdoc in the laboratory was doing the experiments to really verify that

1323
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:36,360
those two species really were being made from the same enzyme. And in the course of that work,

1324
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:41,960
she came into my office one day and said, I no longer get the same results that I've been getting

1325
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:47,880
for the last six months. Something has changed. And so we went over all of her thin layers.

1326
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:54,280
Again, this is how we separated all the species. And sure enough, after getting numerous results

1327
02:05:54,280 --> 02:06:02,520
in which she could give PI four P and get PI three, four P two, suddenly over the past week,

1328
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:08,920
she no longer got that doubly phosphorylated lipid when she added purified PI three kinase

1329
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:16,040
to that lipid. So the question was what had changed? And she said, well, the only thing

1330
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:23,960
that changed is we ran out of the PI four P and I had to buy a new jar of PI four P from

1331
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:31,640
Baron Germanheim. That's interesting. As I looked at the thin layer more carefully, I noticed that

1332
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:36,760
just when the experiments were no longer working, there was a new spot on the thin layer that was

1333
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:42,120
just off the origin where we assumed it would probably just be ATP. There was always a little

1334
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:49,560
bit of contaminating ATP that got left over when you separate the lipid out. And we assumed that

1335
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:56,360
that was ATP, but I noticed it ran just a little bit faster than ATP. And that it only appeared in

1336
02:06:56,360 --> 02:07:02,840
experiments where she could not find the three, four P two. And I said, okay, stained is what I

1337
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:09,640
had and it'll tell you where the lipid that you used from Baron Germanheim runs. And I'll bet

1338
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:15,000
that it's actually four or five P two. And that turned out to be the case that they'd mislabeled

1339
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,320
the bottle. What was commercially sold as phosphatidylinositol four phosphate was actually

1340
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:29,240
phosphatidylinositol four or five bisphosphate. And so by accident, I almost think that God looked

1341
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:34,520
down on us and said, look, they're missing the most important lipid PI three, four, five P three.

1342
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:40,520
It never occurred to us to look for it because we were, no one had ever claimed of something like

1343
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:46,600
that to ran on a thin layer. That was because it runs so close to the ATP that was always missed

1344
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:51,960
because it's got three phosphates. Yeah. It's very highly charged and therefore runs.

1345
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:59,720
I never once thought of that until you just said that Lou, I never, I never would have had that

1346
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:05,720
thought actually. And then of course, when you say it now, I mean, that's, think about how dominant

1347
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:10,360
those three phosphates are, right? In fact, a year after we made this observation, the paper came out.

1348
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:14,520
In fact, I got called by nature saying there's this paper claiming they found something that

1349
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:20,600
looks like triply phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol. And they asked, do you think that's

1350
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:25,400
possible? And I said, yeah, in fact, I know it's possible. We already have results showing that

1351
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:30,760
that can happen with purified enzyme. Lou, thank you so much for the generosity with your time and
