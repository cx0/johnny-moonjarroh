00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,400
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Catherine Eban. Catherine is

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,120
an investigative journalist, a Fortune magazine contributor, and an Andrew Carnegie Fellow. She

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,000
has written quite a lot about pharmaceutical, counterfeiting, gun trafficking, coercive

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,840
interrogations by the CIA, et cetera. But what we focus on today very specifically is her most

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:38,360
recent book called Bottle of Lies. This book is a really interesting and truthfully at times

50
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:47,560
infuriating look at the culture of incredible deceit and fraudulence that exists in the generic

51
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,680
drug manufacturing industry. I think Catherine does a great job in the book, and I think we

52
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:00,200
do so in the podcast as well, walking you through basically how the stage is set. In other words,

53
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,960
what are the regulatory, environmental, cultural factors that allowed this type of practice to

54
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:15,640
flourish? And then we dive really deep into one specific and infuriating example. I think I'll

55
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,760
leave it at that. I'm half tempted to say more, but I realize everything that we have to say on

56
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,040
this topic is covered nicely. This is not a technical podcast, meaning you don't have to

57
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,400
know anything about how drugs work, and I think you'll get through this pretty clear. And the only

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,080
thing I'll say before closing is if you find yourself throughout this podcast getting frustrated,

59
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,480
don't worry. At the end, we offer some semblance of things that you can do to at least protect

60
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,800
yourself. It's not a magic bullet, but it's better than flying completely blind. So without further

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,720
delay, please enjoy my discussion with Catherine Eban. Well, Catherine, thank you so much for coming

62
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,200
up here today. It's great to be here. For the listener, within about 30 seconds of meeting,

63
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,000
I was already peddling Topo Chico to you. When you let it be known that you love bubbly water,

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,760
I couldn't resist. It's good stuff. I like it. That's great feedback for the listener because

65
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm sort of an unabashed enthusiast and totally not sponsored by them, have no financial affiliation,

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,520
but I never waste an opportunity to talk about it. So feel free to say you don't like it because I

67
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,480
want people to know this is a legitimate Topo experience. I'm a bubbly water junkie. I'm adding

68
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,840
it to my list. Awesome. Well, Catherine, I don't even know if I mentioned this in the initial

69
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,760
communication we had over email. If I did, it'll also be helpful for the listener for context.

70
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,960
A couple of months ago, I was talking with a friend of mine named Sam Harris. Do you know Sam?

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah. Yeah. And we were talking, talking about something and the discussion shifted to something

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,800
had really upset me the day before. And I had just gotten super pissed off about something. And in

73
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,560
some ways, Sam is kind of like my spiritual guidance leader guy. He's the one I turned to

74
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,560
when I need sort of help. And I said, Sam, do you even know what it's like to get pissed off anymore?

75
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, are you so far past this? Is your practice of mindfulness so evolved that you are able to

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,800
constantly distance yourself from your thoughts and not find yourself in a state of outrage,

77
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,360
even if it's not prolonged, but just momentary? And he said, no, not at all. Like I still get

78
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,400
really upset. And he goes, in fact, I just read this book yesterday and I can't tell you how

79
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:32,920
angry I am. And I was like, well, say more. And he said, it's this book about generic drugs and

80
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,360
the total chicanery that goes on along with it. And then he said, you know, in fact, you really

81
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,600
need to interview the author of this book. She is the perfect person for your audience. And I think

82
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,720
you could have the right discussion with her, a very detailed nuanced discussion. And so, I mean,

83
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,000
I was literally sitting here in my office and I looked it up and I did a quick read and I was

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,640
like, I wonder how this has sort of escaped my radar. And I think just on that moment's notice,

85
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,200
I must have just sent you a direct message on Twitter and it all went from there. So in advance,

86
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,280
I'll thank Sam for putting this on my radar. I'm sure it would have got there eventually,

87
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,560
but he put it there in a moment. And I guess for the listener who doesn't know Sam,

88
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,960
that something could make Sam that upset probably speaks to what you are in store for

89
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,160
in the next, I don't know how long. I want to start with the story, but I'd love a little bit

90
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:32,840
of the motivation you've written about healthcare before. How did you dip your toe into this very

91
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,080
muddy, disgusting cesspool? So before I started with this project, I thought about generics the

92
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,040
way I think most people do, which is we need them. They're affordable. Nobody can afford their

93
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,680
brand name drugs. And they're sort of an engine that makes government health programs run. I mean,

94
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,480
how would we prescribe to the VA, Medicare, Affordable Care Act without these affordable

95
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,640
life-saving drugs? So that was, you know, they're a public good. But in 2008, I got a phone call

96
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,040
from a radio show host named Joe Graydon, who runs an NPR program called The People's Pharmacy.

97
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:18,120
And he said, I'm deluged with these phone calls and emails from listeners who are complaining about

98
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,360
side effects from their generic drugs. They were stabilized, then they were switched to a drug. It

99
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,040
doesn't work. The complaints are similar in nature. And so he took these complaints to the FDA

100
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,640
and FDA senior officials, their reaction was basically, well, it's psychosomatic because if

101
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,440
patients get switched, the pills look different, it's a different color, but the drugs are fine.

102
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,000
So Joe Graydon really didn't believe that. And he said to me, we need somebody with investigative

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,760
firepower to look into this. He knew of my work. I'd been on his program before. And that's really

104
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,080
where it started. I mean, it was an unusual phone call. And I just started digging.

105
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,640
Now, you must have had a pretty high quotient of belief for Joe, because I'm sure someone like you

106
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,360
would be brought ideas like this pretty often for you to say, I'm going to stop what I'm doing and

107
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,440
do some digging. I mean, by definition, you can't really do a little surface scratching. Digging is

108
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,040
digging. Was it just Joe's reputation? Or was there something that also personally resonated

109
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,440
where you thought this is more than just plausible? I've been an investigative journalist

110
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,560
now for about 20 years and you really begin to get a sense. Something sort of tingles inside you.

111
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,320
I get tips all the time. I get tips from whistleblowers, all kinds of people. But,

112
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,480
you know, when there's somebody with a certain amount of credibility, he's very legitimate.

113
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:53,800
He was asking a big question. It was intriguing to me. I mean, what were all the complaints about?

114
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Why were these patients having problems? It just seemed to me that it was something where there

115
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,880
was some depth there. I just felt that it was going to be a pretty deep well to go down.

116
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:14,600
I just had that sense. And so I began. Well, I'm going to resist every sort of temptation in my

117
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,200
body right now, which is to let you naturally go into the story, which you've so eloquently

118
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,440
written about. But I think given the format we have and assuming that the listeners don't necessarily

119
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,040
have some of the background, let's take a step back and put a few things in place. So you've

120
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,280
already alluded to this idea of generics versus branded. Can you say a little bit more about what

121
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,160
that distinction means? Yeah. So generics, a lot of people will you go to the supermarket and you can

122
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:52,600
buy a Costco brand cling wrap, which is a version of Saran wrap or Kleenex versus tissue paper.

123
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,040
Right. And the idea that most people have about generics and they have it because the FDA has

124
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,680
told them this is that they are identical to the brand name, but just at a lower price point.

125
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,600
So a great bargain. If everything is working well, the truth is a little different.

126
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:19,320
So a generic is a version of a brand name drug that is made either after a brand name drug has

127
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:27,000
gone off patent, it's no longer legally protected. Or if the generic company has successfully

128
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,040
challenged the brand patent in court and then the FDA gives them permission to make a generic.

129
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,440
So the FDA recognizes just to take a step back, if you make two batches of drugs in the same

130
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,080
manufacturing plant using the same ingredients, those two batches will be a little bit different.

131
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:56,200
There will be a little variation. So now if you take a generic where a company has reverse

132
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,040
engineered the brand, sort of broken it down in a lab, tried to figure out how to put it together,

133
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,880
maybe with a different set of manufacturing steps, but then concocted it, maybe they've used

134
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,520
different excipients, which is additional ingredients, but you have the sort of central

135
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,960
molecule, which has already been tested for safety and efficacy. Then they have to present data to

136
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,960
the FDA. The FDA recognizes there's going to be differences. So they've provided a range,

137
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,960
which is a range of the absorption of the drug into the blood. And basically the generic has to

138
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:37,000
present data to the FDA showing through their testing that they've hit within that range and

139
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,200
that the drug is essentially clinically equivalent in the body, which is called bioequivalent.

140
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Now, I think for some people, it might come as a surprise that the company that makes the branded

141
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,080
version of the drug would be anything but cooperative with the generic, because the only

142
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,280
thing the patent really discloses is the actual molecular composition. And the little bit that

143
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,760
I know about pharmacology, which is to say truly just a little bit, is that the methods by which

144
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,160
one creates the compound are often where some of the secret sauce lies. In other words, there's

145
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:26,840
lots of value within the manufacturing process that is usually deliberately not put into the

146
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,920
patent application. Is that generally correct or do the methods typically try to capture that? I

147
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,800
mean, I guess maybe I'll explain for the listener what we're talking about here. When you want to

148
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,440
patent on something, you have to fully disclose it. So in exchange for fully disclosing something,

149
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,280
you have protection. The downside is when that patent is expired, you no longer have any protection.

150
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:54,920
So for example, Coca-Cola chooses to not patent its formula. Instead, it is a trade secret because

151
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,040
they never want to have the expiration. So technically, if you could wave a magic wand

152
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,320
and figure out how to make Coca-Cola, you could do so legally. You would not be infringing on

153
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,080
their patent. But of course, the people at Coca-Cola would, that secret is guarded apparently very

154
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,040
heavily. And so my understanding is that in pharma, yes, they'll disclose the molecule

155
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,920
because they sort of have to to get that protection. But a lot of the know-how is in

156
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,400
how you went about making it. So when the generic manufacturer comes along and says, well,

157
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,080
this drug is now off patent, we're going to go ahead and make it just because we know what it

158
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,680
looks like in its final, final state, we might not realize the 47 steps required to make it.

159
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,720
And that's sort of this reverse engineering you're talking about, right? So a generic reaches the

160
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,520
market through a process of really warfare, which is that the brand name company surrounds its drugs

161
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,280
with patents. All different aspects of the drug are patented. So the time release formula might

162
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,520
have a different patent. And the process of manufacturing, each manufacturing step may be

163
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,720
under a patent. So they surround the drug with these protections. And then what a generic company

164
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,920
does is get a sample of the drug, they try to break it down in the laboratory and figure out

165
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,880
reversing the steps, how do you get to formulate this drug? One way to get around a patent is

166
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:31,480
instead of ABCDE manufacturing steps, it's AEDCB. You reverse the steps, which is by the way legal

167
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,440
to do in India, which is where I know we'll get there in this interview, but that's where some of

168
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,520
the best reverse engineers in the world come from in India. But then they have to figure out,

169
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,720
well, how do they make the time release formula? And what sort of excipients or additional

170
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:55,240
ingredients do they add? And how do they get the drug to dissolve properly? And is it stable under

171
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:03,160
various temperature conditions? And those are all kinds of manufacturing secrets, which the brand

172
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,360
name companies put in something that's called a drug master file. And that's like their cookbook.

173
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,160
And that is proprietary, that is not disclosed. So any generic company that wants to propose to

174
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,480
make a drug, they're sort of going their own way in the laboratory. Yeah, they're using the same

175
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,720
molecule, they have to prove that it absorbs similarly in the body, it has to be same route

176
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,520
of administration. So is it a pill? Is it an injection? But otherwise, it can vary in significant

177
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,880
ways. So when I make my favorite sort of lamb shank, which is a 12 hour cooking process

178
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:51,240
with seven steps and call it 13 ingredients, the analogy here would be once my lamb goes off

179
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,200
patent, anybody can taste the final product, do anything they want with it, stick it into an

180
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,680
analyzer, look at every element of that final lamb shank. But shy of knowing I started with a lamb

181
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,080
somewhere back there, they don't necessarily know the other ingredients. That's right. They don't

182
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,320
know the temperature of the oven. They don't know what else I added, how I changed the temperature

183
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,040
because of course, in my cool lamb recipe, it's actually multi temperature that I use. So it's

184
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,240
very complicated. They don't know any of that stuff. And they're expected to produce something

185
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,840
that is plus or minus a little bit almost identical to the finished product in flavor,

186
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:37,560
firmness, texture, everything without knowing how I actually made it. Yes. And I'll add one more

187
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,120
thing to your analogy, which is they have to follow a set of rules that are imposed to use

188
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,200
your analogy in every kitchen. So this is the same set of rules called these good cooking procedures.

189
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,160
For the next dude listener, you'll get the reference there. Right. Exactly. So it's in theory,

190
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:04,200
the same very stringent set of rules, the same central active ingredient, and the same route of

191
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,400
administration within a range. Yeah. Now another kind of topic, a little off the beaten path,

192
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,240
but just to set the stage for people, anybody knows that they can go in and buy drugs off the shelf

193
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,000
that are not prescription based, such as Tylenol, aspirin, Advil, that also come in

194
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,520
generic. So you can also buy acetaminophen. So every drugstore has their own branded acetaminophen,

195
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,960
but there's only one Tylenol. Everyone has their own ibuprofen, but there's only one Advil. Only

196
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:41,480
Bayer makes true aspirin, but you can buy generic anywhere. These compounds, these drugs are in a

197
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,400
different regulatory schema because they do not require a prescription. But is everything else

198
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,680
that we're going to talk about today and that you've talked about already still applicable to

199
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:59,240
the difference between a generic acetaminophen and the Tylenol acetaminophen? Well, I'd even say, I

200
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,320
mean, over the counter drugs are less regulated, but some of the issues we're going to talk about

201
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,640
today really do apply to this drugstore brands that you're talking about, the drugstore generic

202
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,960
brands. Got it. So if you're listening to this and you buy anything that is a drug that is over the

203
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:27,640
counter or with a prescription, what you're about to talk about probably applies on some level. And

204
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,840
one of the things I've been trying to understand going through your book is the average magnitude

205
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,640
of the problem. As we'll talk about today, you make a case for what the extreme examples of this

206
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,160
look like. I still don't and hopefully by through our discussion today, we'll be able to sort of

207
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,840
tease out some of these things. But with that said, I think that's a pretty good background for most

208
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,280
people to now understand what we're about to talk about. So let's go back and talk about the FDA. So

209
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,000
you've already made reference to this organization a number of times. Where did they come from? How

210
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:10,360
were they created and why were they created? So the FDA really has its origin in a series of

211
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,960
public health disasters that have taken place over the years. It was first formed in the 1930s. And

212
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,320
this was after numerous children died from taking cough syrup that had been tainted with, I think

213
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:33,480
it was arsenic. But all of this had galvanized public sentiment around the need for food and drug

214
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:42,200
safety. And so the FDA was born in 1930 out of history of tragedies around this. But the sort of

215
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:50,840
modern day FDA as we know it, really has stemmed from a crucial moment in US history. There was

216
00:21:50,840 --> 00:22:00,040
a reviewer at the fledgling FDA who refused to approve a drug called thalidomide. So this is now

217
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:07,000
30 years after. Yeah, this is early 60s. Yeah, which was being widely dispensed in Europe to help

218
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,520
pregnant women who are having trouble sleeping, morning sickness, and she basically held firm,

219
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,560
basically saying that she didn't have enough information on the drug. And of course, it turned

220
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,880
out she was correct. America dodged a bullet because that drug was associated with children

221
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,440
who were born with flipper like arms. So it was associated with horrible birth defects. And it was

222
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,160
really sort of on the basis of that and other. Do you remember her name? By the way, I don't remember

223
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:44,440
her name. Yeah, but I love the story. Yeah, Frances Kelsey, Frances Kelsey, who really became a hero.

224
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,960
She's sort of the one that, as you said, took the FDA from being sort of, I guess, FDR had sort of,

225
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:58,280
it was created under FDR, but kind of limped along until the hero moment, which was the thalidomide

226
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:04,120
story, right? Right. Well, what's interesting is that in the beginning of the FDA, there was not

227
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:13,480
this idea to focus on the manufacturing process. The idea was, well, you can't market something

228
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,680
with absolutely no basis in fact. But then the question is, well, how are investigators empowered

229
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:29,160
to figure out what is true and what is not? And really the evolution of the FDA was around a focus

230
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,680
on the process of manufacturing, because the idea was it's impossible to test every single pill in

231
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:44,120
every batch. But what became sort of vital and sort of underpins the modern FDA is this idea that

232
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:53,000
the process is the product. That was right, the key change in how public health enforcement evolved,

233
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,920
that basically you have to be able to document and prove that your process is under control,

234
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,440
that there's a control in there in the process. And that's sort of, I mean, again, I don't know,

235
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,240
it's not even like I'm hungry, by the way, but I'm just keep coming up with these dumb food

236
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:14,680
analogies. But McDonald's can't test every Big Mac or French fry, but it's much easier at the

237
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,120
centralized level to create procedures and then decentralized locally to be able to enforce the

238
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,920
procedures around where we buy our feedstock, how we manufacture in the store, what the temperature

239
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,040
is of the oven, how long a piece of food can sit here, et cetera. And if you put all those things

240
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,040
in place, you have much greater faith that every French fry, every Big Mac is going to meet the

241
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,640
safety requirement. Right. So one of my sources early on gave me this analogy and we were sitting

242
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:51,160
at a lunch table at a restaurant. He said, a good FDA investigator is not just going to come in here

243
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,360
and say, is there a glass on the table? Is there a fork? Is there a knife? That's a kind of

244
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,200
checklist inspection. But a good FDA investigator is going to say, what is the temperature of the

245
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,480
dishwasher and what is the procedure in the kitchen for bringing out these dishes? It's a very

246
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,480
different sort of a mode of inspection than most people think of. Now, using your analogy, which

247
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,720
seems to largely stop at the border of the restaurant, inclusive of the kitchen, right?

248
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,720
So what's the temperature of the dishwasher? What are the temperature of the heaters on the food

249
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,800
behind the thing? And in that analogy, does the inspector also have the liberty to say,

250
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:39,480
where is the meat coming from? How far do the potatoes travel and how were they planted?

251
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,040
Absolutely. So anything that enters that restaurant is under the purview of the FDA.

252
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,360
That's correct. And so for people like me, most of the time, and I suspect this is probably,

253
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,120
I don't know, we'll see, maybe this is not what how everybody thinks about it. When I think about

254
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,720
the FDA, I normally think about it through the lens of approving new drugs. So going from this

255
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,680
standpoint of what's called an investigational new drug and IND application through to a phase one,

256
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,560
phase two, and a phase three approval and embedded within those processes are two things that are

257
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,920
absolutely necessary. You can't approve a drug unless you can confirm that it is safe. And that's

258
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,920
done primarily in phase one, but the safety monitoring continues into phase two and phase

259
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,800
three and even beyond into post marketing. And then the second thing that becomes more important

260
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,400
by phase two, and then again in phase three is efficacy. Does it work? And it's those two things

261
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,120
that go hand in hand. And the FDA seems to have a very heavy role in saying, does this thing do what

262
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,320
it's supposed to do? And does it not hurt people? Were those mandates equally important at the time?

263
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,920
I mean, clearly the thalidomide case brings the safety piece to light. Was efficacy also

264
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,160
front and center on their radar throughout this evolution? Well, no, actually it wasn't always. In

265
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:07,960
fact, proving the efficacy of a drug was a somewhat new idea. I mean, I think that that was one of the

266
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,760
things that Francis Kelsey was asking of these thalidomide manufacturers is what are the studies

267
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,760
around the efficacy of this drug? Now, I mean, it's interesting fast forward when Trump was elected

268
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,560
president and there were sort of names being floated. Well, who would his FDA commissioner be?

269
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,840
And some of the names that were floated as possible commissioners were people who had made

270
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,000
crazy public statements basically saying, well, manufacturers shouldn't have to prove that their

271
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
drugs are effective in order to market them and let the market take care of and sift out all those

272
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,840
questions, which basically was impossible for the industry to even comprehend because our whole

273
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,000
system is based on the idea that the drugs that you're taking had been proven to work. Right? I

274
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,080
mean, how would an insurance company even decide what to cover you for if we're all potentially

275
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:11,000
taking drugs that are not effective? So effectiveness is like key to the modern concept of drug

276
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,640
approvals. Yeah. And luckily Scott Gottlieb became the commissioner, although he is at the time of

277
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,360
this recording, no longer the commission, which I didn't know Scott. I don't know Scott, but I know

278
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,120
many people who do. And fortunately everything I've ever heard about him is that he was the right

279
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,280
person for the job. So it's in the sixties, the FDA kind of gets a second wind on the basis of this,

280
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,840
as you put it eloquently, they dodge a bullet. I mean, the United States, I can remember this was

281
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,760
in Canada as well. If Canada dodged the thalidomide bullet, but certainly United States, the bullet

282
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:46,280
was dodged. So you've already alluded to this idea of there being branded drugs. So pharmaceutical

283
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,960
companies are pretty smart when they create a drug. The branded name is really easy to remember.

284
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,360
The generic name is really hard to remember. That's a design choice. I remember learning

285
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,080
this in medical school class in pharmacology, which was you show up and you only learn the

286
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,240
generic names. That's the way you're taught every drug. And I remember thinking, God, these are

287
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,120
so complicated names. Like just come up with something normal. And the professor sort of said,

288
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,040
look idiot, they don't want the public to know these names. They want you to think

289
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:23,000
Lipitor, not a Torvastatin. They want you to think Viagra, not Sildenafil. Right. These are

290
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,400
very deliberate choices. So up until about the early to mid eighties, you could make the case.

291
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,600
It was almost impossible for a generic company to compete with a branded pharma company based on

292
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,120
the regulatory environment. Is that a safe statement? Well, that is because basically

293
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:47,480
anybody applying to market a drug had to prove safety and efficacy. So the branded companies

294
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,960
were required to do these huge clinical trials, create these enormous new drug applications.

295
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,400
And so really, what was the point of a generic, which was supposed to be a lower cost version,

296
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,600
doing all these studies all over again? Yeah. The only advantage they have going for them is the

297
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,800
risk of failure goes down. So I don't know what the numbers would have been in the mid eighties.

298
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,360
And truthfully, I don't know what the numbers are today, but about a decade ago, when I was paying

299
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:21,160
more attention to this particular issue, it was about one billion dollars to do what you described,

300
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:28,440
to go from an I.N.D. to a phase three approval cost a billion dollars. And so there aren't that

301
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:37,000
many companies that have deep enough pockets to spend roughly a decade navigating that to then

302
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,720
have about a decade to sell their drug without competition. So if you want to open up your own

303
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,840
generic drug company and you know that Viagra is about to come off patent, what advantage do you

304
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,720
have that Pfizer didn't? That's a bad example because of how Viagra was discovered, but drug

305
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,680
X, whatever you at least know it should work. You know, you're not in store for a phase one,

306
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,600
phase two or phase three disaster, all things equal, but there's no denying the cost of doing

307
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,560
all of that. And to your point, how can you do it? So of course, this brings us into the question of

308
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,720
how the generic industry really got its start in the United States. And so wasn't Orrin Hatch

309
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,520
half of this law or am I mistaken that with another one? No, no, no. So what happened was actually the

310
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:32,360
generic industry owes a lot to a crusading investigative journalist named William Haddad.

311
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:41,800
And he did an investigative series on cartel like pricing practices in the antibiotic market

312
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,200
of branded companies. And sort of in the wake of that, he became very interested in generic drugs

313
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,440
and also interested in the fact that there was no good pathway for generic drug makers to market

314
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,680
their drugs. So to be clear up until this point, generics existed. They were created and largely

315
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,040
consumed outside of the US though. Right. And they existed within the US, but sort of they were few

316
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,000
and far between. There were many, many drugs that had come off patent years earlier and there was

317
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,320
no generic substitute for them. So he ended up walking the halls of Congress with a couple of

318
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:24,280
like-minded colleagues. And his efforts led to what was called the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984,

319
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:32,680
which Reagan signed into law. And basically what that said is it created a pathway at the FDA for

320
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:40,920
generic drug makers to apply for approval and said the safety and efficacy of these molecules

321
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,360
has already been established. So you don't have to reprove that. You don't have to do clinical trials

322
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,920
on thousands of people. What you do need to do is prove that your drug is bio equivalent

323
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:01,720
to the branded product. So you have to submit data from your tests, which shows that your drug

324
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,320
falls into that range we talked about of absorption into the blood and that it remains stable at

325
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,160
certain temperatures, that it dissolves properly in the body. And then we're going to review your

326
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,960
data and see if we're going to give you approval. But the generic drug makers still faced a significant

327
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,720
risk, which is they would almost certainly have to litigate against the brand name companies and

328
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,120
they might not end up getting approved by the FDA. So there was a really crucial little deal sweetener

329
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:41,000
in Hatch-Waxman. What it said was if you are first to file your application and you get approved,

330
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,560
you will get six months of exclusivity on the market without any generic competitors. And what

331
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,440
that meant for generic makers is they could price their drug at about 80% of the brand name drug

332
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,160
price. So they would get this six month window where they could make big money. And that was a

333
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:08,440
big incentive. At the time, was there an understanding of what the price would collapse to after six

334
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,320
months with multiple entrants? Was the idea that the steady state ultimate price is going to be,

335
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,760
was there an expectation at least baked into Hatch-Waxman that said, look, by the time it's

336
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,240
an all hands on deck open field running generic market for drug acts with 10 generics out there,

337
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,640
they're making 30 cents on the dollar. I just wonder how the six months came about as the

338
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,440
period of time because truthfully that doesn't strike me as very long when you consider how much

339
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,360
protected time the branded person got for the risk they took. Six months seems a little short. It

340
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,920
shouldn't have been 20 years, but it struck me as that was always a bit short. That created a bit

341
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,680
of a perverse incentive in my mind. I mean, as we saw it created a perverse incentive.

342
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:54,600
Yeah. I mean, there's no question about that, but it actually, I mean, it really was the difference

343
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,360
between, as I have said, making a fortune and making a living. I mean, you look at generic

344
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:07,240
Lipitor, the first generic Lipitor that came on the market, six months was worth about $600 million.

345
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,200
Yeah. Which is staggering when you realize how much is saved in not having to run a billion

346
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,000
dollars worth of clinical trials. Right. Right. Wasn't it our friend that actually came up with

347
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,640
the first generic? Wasn't it a Torvastatin? It was Rambaxi. There you go. Well, we're going to

348
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,160
hear a lot more about these bozos. That's charitable. When you're not on NPR, you can

349
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,400
just come out and say bozos. Uh-huh. So I want to plant a question with you now that I'm going

350
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,800
to ask you at the very end, but it's a question that I've been mulling over for a long time

351
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,440
without a great answer. And therefore I don't think it's fair to ask you in a moment. And the

352
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,880
question is this, knowing what you know now, everything that happened, the best of intentions,

353
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:59,320
the best laid plans falling. If you could go back in time to Hatchwaxman, how would you rewrite that

354
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,760
reg? Because truthfully, I think at least one aspect of Hatchwaxman made sense. I think it was

355
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,400
reasonable to get rid of the efficacy, safety, huge clinical trial. I think that was fair.

356
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,360
I think everything that came after it in the reg fell short. But I haven't got a great answer for

357
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,600
what I would do different. I have a whole bunch of little answers. And so I want to plant that seed

358
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,280
with you because not that there's huge value in looking through the retrospective scope, but it

359
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,720
is an interesting philosophical question, if nothing else. And it might actually offer an insight into

360
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,840
part of the way out of this problem going forward. So we'll come back to that in a little while.

361
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,320
So I guess there are a couple of other interesting historical things. I guess the last piece I want

362
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:50,520
to bring into it before we jump into the story is this use of taxpayer dollars. And the internal

363
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,960
culture, meaning internal to this country, the internal culture toward generics took another big

364
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,360
shift during the presidency of George W. Bush based on the program in Africa, Petfar, correct?

365
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:09,560
Petfar. Yeah. So talk a little bit about that program, which I think does factor into this

366
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:19,400
story in the broad arc. So Petfar was really born of the best of intentions and was sort of maybe

367
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:29,080
one of the most sort of brilliant, innovative globalization ideas, which is that the developed

368
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:38,600
nations of the world and us, the US, could use taxpayer dollars to buy low-cost generics from

369
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:46,920
India and send it to Africa to address the AIDS crisis. So in that sense, it was really remarkably

370
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:56,040
innovative. So George W. Bush announced the intention of Petfar during 02-03, and this creates

371
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,120
a little bit of attention within the administration, right? Because how are you going to fund it? Well,

372
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,760
the question isn't how are you going to fund it. It's what are you going to buy? Right. So it was

373
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:12,680
the low cost of Indian generics that made Petfar possible. It was based on that concept that the

374
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:20,920
price of the AIDS drugs had fallen down to about a dollar a day, which allowed a taxpayer-funded

375
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,080
program to send these AIDS drugs to Africa, which was reeling from the AIDS crisis. You had

376
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,720
basically an entire continent under a death sentence. But then the question inside the

377
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,880
administration was how do you guarantee the quality? And Scott Gottlieb at that point was

378
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,080
in the Bush White House. It's a great line in your book about how he referred to generics. He

379
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,280
refused to call them generics. He referred to them as counterfeits. Right. And there were people on

380
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,120
the other side of the aisle who were saying the World Health Organization, they can come in and

381
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:01,000
inspect these plants and certify them. And those are going to be fine. And the view of Gottlieb and

382
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,600
other people was what's who going to do? That's just like some guy in a back room in Yugoslavia

383
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:12,360
with a couple of people helping him who are going to go into these plants and verify the quality.

384
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:21,800
So the idea was created that the FDA would do expedited review of these drugs and approve

385
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:29,720
these companies. And then they'd be cleared to sell drugs under the PEPFAR program. But with the FDA

386
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,760
suddenly in the business of approving these Indian companies, it created this idea. Well, if these

387
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:42,600
Indian drugs are good enough for our regulators to approve, shouldn't Americans be taking them too?

388
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,280
And this, of course, is in the backdrop of even though at the time, I think the thing that was

389
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,520
on most people's mind was foreign affairs. The Iraq war had reached sort of its peak or I shouldn't

390
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,800
say it reaches peak, but probably reached its peak attention, maybe. But clearly in the backdrop was

391
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,240
the rising cost of health care. And a big component of health care is drug cost. So this became,

392
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,200
well, if PEPFAR is making a very strong, compelling case that we can be using

393
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,480
Indian manufactured drugs to pay for a program in Africa, shouldn't we be looking at the same drugs

394
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:26,200
here in the United States? Absolutely. And you had Indian companies who had long been regarded as just

395
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:33,160
fakers and counterfeiters who were suddenly cleared by the U.S. FDA, which was a huge point

396
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,600
of pride for those companies. So they wanted to get into our market because if you make drugs,

397
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,640
we're the market you want to sell to. We're the biggest, most profitable market. So it was really

398
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,120
a convergence of these two things. And so everything that I think we've just talked about

399
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:53,320
sort of sets the stage for the listener to now really understand the story about one company

400
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,760
that you use as I don't think anybody would believe that they're the only company that's out there

401
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,600
at the depths. They just happen to be the one for which a set of circumstances, which you'll

402
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:10,680
explain allowed us to be able to do the post-mortem at the level that it's been done. So tell us about

403
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,640
this company. So Rambaxi was India's largest drug company. And in India, that meant it was a generic

404
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,960
drug company. I mean, India by and large was not innovating, creating molecules. What they were

405
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:32,760
doing is they had become master reverse engineers. And Rambaxi was one of the sort of handful of

406
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,320
companies that was a true multinational. It was out there in world markets. And it was one of the

407
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,240
first companies, Indian drug companies to get approved under the PEPFAR program. So Rambaxi

408
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,880
was closing in on a billion dollars in global sales and had its eye on becoming one of the

409
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,880
world's top drug companies in short order. It was very ambitious. It had a lot of what are called

410
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:05,960
the first files. So it had been approved by the FDA to be first to launch various high profile

411
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,520
drugs in this market, including generic Lipitor. And in 2003, the company ended up recruiting a

412
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,720
young engineer named Dinesh Thakur. He had been working at Bristol-Myers Squibb, which was a

413
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,880
highly regimented corporate culture. He moves his whole family to Gurgaon in India, which is outside

414
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,320
of New Delhi. Was he working at BMS in Europe or? No, in New Jersey. Okay. So he was working at BMS

415
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:36,120
in New Jersey. And the environment, just so your listeners understand, the environment of a western

416
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:43,160
drug company, which is so heavily regulated, it's hard to move an inch without a stack of paperwork.

417
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,440
Everything is documented. The controls are really rigorous. That said, obviously, we know there are

418
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,640
scandals all the time, but the atmosphere is one of real control. So let's use the food analogy,

419
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:05,400
right? You're walking into the cleanest, most pristine kitchen that looks like you could eat

420
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,800
off the floor. If one crumb is left on the counter, it is swept up three times. It is cleaned. It is

421
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:22,120
disinfected. On any given day, the kitchen looks as it looked any day before and will look any day

422
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:29,880
in the future. You picture it being white. You picture it having sort of a stainless steel sort

423
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:37,240
of clean conveyor atmosphere. And let's contrast that with where Dinesh went. Yeah. I mean, and just

424
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,640
to say, Dinesh was a senior Indian colleague of his at Bristol Myers Squibb who was leaving for

425
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,320
Rimbaxi and made a job offer to him. They were walking around the lake on the Bristol Myers

426
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,440
campus in New Jersey. So I went to that campus so I could recreate it in the book because it's in

427
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,240
the opening chapter. I mean, that campus, there's not a blade of grass out of place. There's safety

428
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:08,360
poles, emergency phones, every hundred feet. Even the turtles in the pond have a special crossing

429
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,640
lane that they're supposed to use. I don't know how they know. You know, and every blade of grass is,

430
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,880
I mean, it's just perfect. It's an environment of total control without variation. And that is like

431
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:27,240
the goal for any drug company. So Dinesh moves his family to Gurgaon. And Dinesh grew up in India?

432
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,960
He grew up in India. And at this point in time, do you get the sense? I know it's,

433
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,880
the story will get so much more complicated that the answer might change, but do you think he thinks

434
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,960
of himself here as more American or more Indian as he's about to leave New Jersey for a return to

435
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,960
India? Well, that's an interesting question because so many of the Indians who work in the US,

436
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,920
who I interviewed for this book, you know, a number of whom went to go back to India, they really saw

437
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,480
it as such an important homecoming. I mean, it's a moment in time where India is emerging onto the

438
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:12,760
world stage and they saw it as such a sort of patriotic act to help bring their. It's a reverse

439
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:19,560
brain drain. Yeah. Yeah. So the return to India, there was a lot of pride for them in it. They

440
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:26,280
imagine themselves as creating a kind of Pfizer of the 21st century for India. So I think that

441
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:34,200
was really significant for them anyway. So he gets to India and he finds complete chaos at this

442
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,560
company. I mean, there is just active ingredients that are in the employee refrigerator next to the

443
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:46,840
half and half. There's fist fights in the boardroom. There's orders to just delete documents that are

444
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:53,960
required for regulation. They don't even have the same sort of format or font for any of these

445
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:01,080
presentations. I mean, one of the first, so his job was to help standardize and track all the

446
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:07,080
information in this company. I mean, his job was to sort of collate information about the global

447
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:13,720
pipeline of this company. I mean, they didn't even have any standardized financial reporting

448
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:20,440
in their presentations and in their bookkeeping. Are they keeping track in rupees or in dollars?

449
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:28,680
Nothing was standardized. So he senses from the chaos that he is needed and he's built a team

450
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:36,360
to sort of be information architects to keep track of the company's records. Is he hiring people

451
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:42,360
under him from India or is he inheriting people? He hired his team. So he hires some people from

452
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:49,080
India. He hires some people from Bristol Myers Squibb who had the same vision of the job as he did

453
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,800
to help bring this company into the 21st century. Remind me what year this is. So this was in 2003.

454
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,840
He ends up going over there. Wow. So true, true and unrelated, but remarkable timing with the

455
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,280
PEPFAR discussion that we had in terms of being there right at the genu of this thing about to

456
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,680
explode. Absolutely. He and his colleagues were basically saying everything is becoming generic.

457
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,280
That's where all the growth is. That's where all the energy is. Foreign manufacturers are flooding

458
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:27,080
into our market. By 2005, the FDA has more companies to inspect overseas, more plants to inspect

459
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,480
overseas than it does within US borders. And I know we'll talk about that a little bit later.

460
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,760
That was actually just about to go there for a second, but we'll come back to it.

461
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,520
Give us a sense of how the FDA could exercise its authority. Again, thinking about this through the

462
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,320
sort of Cluj analogy of a chain restaurant or something or something. Basically, the reason

463
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,080
I use that example is because it's like making your commodity product. Like a Big Mac is a Big Mac

464
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,720
is a Big Mac. Do they just get to show up at McDonald's and inspect the McDonald's in India?

465
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,080
How do they have to give advanced warning or notice before they come? Is it done remotely?

466
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:06,520
Is it done in person? How does this process work? The FDA basically has two sets of tools to figure

467
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,040
out whether a generic drug should be on the market. One is the review of all this data,

468
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,240
which the companies submit in what's called an ANDA, an abbreviated new drug application.

469
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:25,000
The other thing they do is a pre-approval inspection. So you submit your application

470
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,560
to market a generic drug and wherever it is, whether it's in Mumbai or in Memphis, the FDA

471
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,440
wants to come and inspect your plan to make sure you're not going to be manufacturing these drugs

472
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,360
in your garage or in an outhouse. And at a minimum, to be clear, this happens at least once because

473
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,800
after I submit all of the data that back up my claims that I basically have a bioidentical drug.

474
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,960
So it has the same chemical composition. It has the same distribution within the body. It reaches

475
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,120
the same concentrations in the same periods of time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Assuming

476
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:03,880
those data are righteous in your mind, you still have to at least once come and lay eyes on my

477
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,880
facility. Right. And ideally you come to do a pre-approval inspection. Can you make the drug

478
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:17,480
in question? And then under regulation, the FDA would come back in two years. And how is it going

479
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,240
in that plan? Are you still making decent drugs or are you just running a pharmaceutical slaughter

480
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:30,360
house and following no rules? So they will come back and check that. But some of their techniques

481
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:35,880
changed because of a massive scandal that hit the generic drug industry in the late 1980s. So

482
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:43,080
once Hatch-Waxman passed and then you had this first file incentive and every generic drug

483
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:49,080
company wanted to be first. You write something very funny in the book about how when that first

484
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,200
mover advantage clause was still in existence, you literally had generic companies camping out

485
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:02,120
in parking lots waiting to petition the FDA on the nanosecond the patent expired. Right. Which is

486
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:08,120
what led to these street fights. Like it was true mayhem. It was true mayhem. So it wasn't just

487
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:14,920
about who was first on what day it was what second. So you would have generic companies sending in

488
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,640
representatives in stretch limos into the FDA parking lot sleeping in the back of the limos,

489
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:29,400
queuing online. I mean, I even describe one company executive pushing another one out of the way just

490
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,240
before the doors of the FDA open so they can be first. So there were actually fist fights in the

491
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,520
parking lot. And so the FDA ended up changing that requirement a little. But suffice it to say that

492
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:47,960
first a file was like rocket fuel for the generic drug industry. And what you saw very quickly was

493
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:55,160
a massive scandal. It started with a company called Mylan, which was a West Virginia generic company.

494
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,560
And they noticed that they were not getting drug approvals anymore. And that there were other

495
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,760
companies that didn't seem to really merit it, but they were getting approved before they were.

496
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:12,040
And they hired some private detectives who started going through the trash of FDA reviewers

497
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:20,120
and found that they were being bribed by these companies to get online first. And that led to

498
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:26,440
a huge scandal, congressional hearings. And the result of that was more stringent

499
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,360
inspections by the FDA. That was where the pre-approval inspection came in. And that was also

500
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:38,840
where something called an application integrity policy came in. It was a new tool for the FDA

501
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,280
to say, you know what, if you're faking your data in applications, which some of these companies were,

502
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:51,560
we have the right to basically remove your applications from the queue, to shut down your

503
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,640
pipeline, to not review your applications because we don't trust you anymore.

504
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,600
And was that a durable response or was that for just that compound? In other words, if a company

505
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,960
was caught falsifying data, was that just disqualifying them from that drug or were they

506
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,160
then disqualified as a producer of generics in general?

507
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,760
They could be disqualified as a producer of generics generally.

508
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,040
And did the FDA exercise that much muscle on any company?

509
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,920
Very infrequently. It became a very, very rare enforcement tool.

510
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,920
And what was the sort of net effect of the bribery within the FDA? Were those individuals

511
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,800
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law?

512
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,040
There were huge prosecutions. I mean, there were details like literally company executives who were

513
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,840
roaming the halls of FDA and dropping envelopes of cash on people's desks.

514
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:46,680
So in the congressional hearings that followed, the question was, who's clean?

515
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,960
How do we trust any of these companies? And so these enforcement mechanisms were added

516
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,320
to the FDA's arsenal. So supposedly everything was fine after that.

517
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,680
I mean, the whole thing just, you got to, like, I'm only laughing because the alternative is just to

518
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,240
scream. And sometimes laughing just feels better than screaming and raging.

519
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:13,480
But it really speaks to on some level, the worst of human nature, which if you're a cynic is like,

520
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:22,200
look, in the end, entropy always wins. Gravity always wins. Chicanery always wins.

521
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Create a rule. The scum of the earth will always, even if they start out with well intentions,

522
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,760
the scummiest of the scum will always figure out a way to cheat the system.

523
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,280
And if you haven't read it, I can't resist. I cannot resist a chance to always plug her

524
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,640
amazing work. Mistakes were made, but not by me, by Carol Tavras. Have you read this book?

525
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,440
I haven't.

526
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,840
So it's a must read. And in fact, I've already interviewed Carol on the podcast, along with

527
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,040
Avron Blooming, who's a partner of hers on a totally different topic, which is around

528
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,400
hormone replacement therapy. I will be interviewing Carol subsequently on this book, which she has

529
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,960
written so many years ago and told me she will never again do a podcast on because she's so sick

530
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,720
of talking about it. But as a favor to me, she is going to do a podcast and we'll talk about it.

531
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,040
But it talks about this sort of very slippery moral slope. And I realize that's not really

532
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,080
front and center to what we're talking about, but we do have the luxury of time and we can

533
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,640
pause for a moment because it is a question that comes up a lot when a person would read a book

534
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,160
like yours, right? Which is how can there be so much moral corruption? And we, myself included,

535
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,720
and perhaps myself first and foremost, we're so quick to put ourselves on the pedestal,

536
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:34,600
the moral high ground. You know, I could never have been that FDA officer that would have been

537
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,080
corrupted by the bribe. I could never have been that executive that would have pushed the other

538
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,160
guy out of the way to get in line or that would have dropped the cash in the situation or blah,

539
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,520
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the way Carol writes about this, you realize that the first

540
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,360
infractions are never these big ones. They're very minor infractions and they often come with

541
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,520
a reasonable rationalization. She uses a great example among many, which is the cop who plants

542
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,720
evidence on the suspect. In the end, you see what it looks like when it's Mark Fuhrman and everybody

543
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:11,400
knows how that story ends. But was that the first time he would have done that? No, the first time he

544
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:17,560
did it is probably more like this. There's a suspect who is absolutely the drug dealer of the town.

545
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:25,320
You barricade the house just as you break in. He manages to lock himself in the bathroom

546
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:32,120
and is flushing down barrels of cocaine and heroin. And as you finally break the door open,

547
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:38,280
you see the last of the cocaine and heroin go down the toilet. And in theory, he walks away free.

548
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,440
But you're not going to have it. Not this day, not on your watch. You're going to take a little bit

549
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,640
of cocaine. You're going to throw it down. You've planted it. You arrest him and you can live with

550
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,520
that because in fact, you actually saw it with your own eyes. You knew he flushed it down the

551
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:59,480
toilet and this is simply justice. But now you're on the wrong side of morality for a moment,

552
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,800
albeit very briefly. And now you have a choice, which is you continue to rationalize your behavior

553
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,120
or you walk back from it and most of us can't. And we take one step further and further and further.

554
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:17,160
And so I couldn't help but wonder as I read your book, what were those first infractions like for

555
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:23,400
all of these actors that you've talked about and will continue to talk about? Because you're showing

556
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,720
us the most extreme state of these behaviors, which at the individual level, I think probably

557
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,320
follow an arc like that described by Carol. And I think frankly, at the population level,

558
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:41,160
just follow the laws of nature, which is you create a weakness. It will be exploited.

559
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,800
I think we'll get into this a little more. But what's interesting is you take that example that

560
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:55,080
you gave of the cop and the suspect, but now put 7000 miles between them. So there is this whole

561
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:03,080
question about integrity in a globalized world and different actors in different cultures

562
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:11,800
who are supposed to be following one set of rules and it becomes like way more complicated.

563
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:17,800
Yeah, I want to come back to this point about the cultural differences between them. I've already

564
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,560
sort of derailed you enough. Let's go back to the point of basically there's a congressional hearing

565
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:29,240
in the late 80s, early 90s that finds out the FDA is not entirely clean, right? So you've got a bunch

566
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:35,880
of bad actors. The belief is the bad actors are now out. And how does that change the FDA going

567
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,240
forward? And what are the implications for these inspections? So the FDA is this agency that never

568
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:47,240
has enough funding, never has enough resources and never has enough authority. There's not a cabinet

569
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,680
member from the FDA who sits at the table with the president. So the FDA ultimately reports up to

570
00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:01,720
HHS. Right. So it's sort of a stepchild as an agency. It's a kind of under resourced agency,

571
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:09,960
which is in charge of safeguarding like a quarter of our economy. I mean, anybody who has had a meal

572
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:16,680
they haven't died from or taken a pill that hasn't killed them, we're all relying on the FDA to save

573
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:24,200
us. So it's an incredibly important agency. It's been lacking in authority. So there's always a

574
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:30,440
question of whether it has been an effective policeman. But in theory, after the big generic

575
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,960
drug scandal of the late 80s, we were off to the races. The generic drug industry recovered from

576
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,800
the scandal. It became, as we've talked about, a crucial player in PEPFAR, a sort of life-saving

577
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:50,680
player as brand name drug prices, rose and rose, generic drug industry was ever more important

578
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:59,320
until it came to be 90% of our drug supply. And you also write that we're kind of at the mercy

579
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:07,960
of non-US suppliers for the feedstock for branded drugs as well. I think is it 40%? So 80%. So

580
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:15,960
basically what happened was starting in around 2005, as generic drugs are growing in our market,

581
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:22,920
the FDA is hit by this wave of globalization. Suddenly, it's got way more plants to inspect

582
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,640
overseas than it does within the US. We've got many more applications for drugs coming in from

583
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:39,000
overseas than in from the US. So the FDA is tasked suddenly with becoming a global agency almost

584
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,640
overnight. And then fast forward to where we are now, which is 80% of the active ingredients in

585
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:52,280
all our drugs, brand or generic, are coming from overseas. 90% of our drug supply is generic,

586
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:58,040
and the majority of those drugs are being made overseas. 40% of our generics alone are coming

587
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,160
from India. We make almost none of our own antibiotics anymore, which means if you go to

588
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:09,240
a pharmacy and fill an antibiotic prescription for your kid, it's coming from India or China.

589
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:17,400
So suddenly, we're in this whole new world where the FDA, which has in the past struggled to

590
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,800
inspect plants that are driving distance from their headquarters, is now having descended

591
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:30,440
specters 7,000 miles away. Which brings us back to Dinesh. Right. When does Dinesh start to figure

592
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:37,480
out that, okay, I acknowledge I've gone from the pristine campus of Bristol-Myers Squibb to

593
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,640
rural India, it's going to be different. But when does he realize it's different in an unethical

594
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:49,640
way or in a way that isn't what he signed up for? The mentor from Bristol-Myers Squibb, who recruited

595
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:55,080
him to come to Rambaxi, Rashmi Barbaya. Well, this is not Kumar. Kumar was his boss there. Well,

596
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:01,000
to start with Rashmi Barbaya. Barbaya says to him, I'm leaving, and he's disgusted with the company,

597
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,680
and he won't really say why. So Dinesh is upset. He moved his whole family over there, but now his

598
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:14,760
boss is leaving, but he gets a new boss. Raj Kumar, he's a kind of blue chip professional who came from

599
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:21,400
GlaxoSmithKline in London, and he comes in as the head of research and development. And he's been on

600
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:28,120
the job about six weeks where he summons Dinesh to his office early in the morning, and he says to him,

601
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:35,800
we have a big problem. It turned out that the World Health Organization went and inspected this

602
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:41,400
contract research organization that was doing some testing for Rambaxi. And it turned out that the

603
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,320
tests were fake, like the patients that they were testing the drugs on- Wait, I'm sorry. So the CRO

604
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:54,600
was themselves fraudulent? The CRO was fraudulent. Okay. And the quote unquote patients that they

605
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:00,440
were testing the drug on didn't really exist, and they were just sort of Xeroxing blood test results.

606
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:08,680
But Raj Kumar, his new boss, had learned that that might not be the only problem that Rambaxi has.

607
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:15,560
He's beginning to get suspicious, and he's very ethical. So he gives Dinesh an assignment. He says,

608
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:22,200
I want you to take your team, and I want you to research all of the global drug filings of

609
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:28,360
Rambaxi. So all the applications that the company has submitted to regulators around the world,

610
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:34,760
I want you to research them, figure out is the data real? Is the data fake? Where does the

611
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:41,240
company's liabilities lie? And so that's what Dinesh begins to do. It's hard to sort of understand

612
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,040
what you just said. I mean, I understand the words you said, and because I know the story,

613
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:52,680
this isn't the first time I'm hearing said words. It's quite another thing to try to actually put

614
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:59,560
yourselves in the shoes of, for example, Kumar and the people who were there seeing this for the first

615
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:08,680
time, because your thinking is, wait a second, this isn't a mistake. A mistake is the wrong batch

616
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:15,640
of the drug got shipped to this study, and the patients are receiving something incorrect, or

617
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:22,120
there was a contaminant in this batch. We didn't know about it. In fact, even if you go into next

618
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,920
level mistakes, like there's a contaminant that's there, we saw the data, now we are trying to cover

619
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,920
it up and pretend it didn't happen while we repeat the experiment. Like you can come up with

620
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:38,440
lots of shades of dark gray. This is as black as it gets. I mean, this is sort of make believe.

621
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:44,360
I mean, put it this way, if you're going to the level where you are fabricating data to this

622
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:51,000
extent, at best you're shipping a placebo pill. That would be the best scenario. At worst,

623
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,360
you're not even taking the time to ensure you're shipping a placebo.

624
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:01,240
So at that point, Raj Kumar, Dr. Raj Kumar did not know what he was looking at. He'd heard

625
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:07,000
murmurings about some falsification. He'd gotten this letter from the World Health Organization

626
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,520
saying that the CRO was submitting fake data. Was the CRO an Indian company or a non-Indian

627
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:20,280
company? It was an Indian company. So at that point, Kumar is coming to Rambaxi with a mindset

628
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:27,400
from his time at GlaxoSmithKline where anybody who signs off on a regulatory filing is

629
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,920
certifying that it's all legit. So this is a failure of imagination at this point. He can't

630
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,280
even imagine what's going on. He's not sure what's going on, but he's saying to

631
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:44,680
Tucker, I want you to take your team and tell me what's going on because I don't know. Now I have

632
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:51,880
questions about the legitimacy of some of these filings. Okay. Does Nash ever go back and talk to

633
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,840
his original boss and find out? Because if six weeks or eight weeks on the job, your new boss

634
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,240
drops this bombshell on you, do you go back and think, wait a minute, does this have anything to

635
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,240
do with why my old boss left? Who's the guy who recruited me here in the first place? Well,

636
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:11,880
you know, at this point, Tucker is wondering that his boss left with a great deal of bitterness.

637
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:17,560
There were some murmurings about some huge settlement he got. He had said cryptic things

638
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:23,400
to him like I was trying to change the tires on a car that was going 80 miles an hour,

639
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:33,400
but he never said what he knew. He just left. So Tucker begins this crazy research project,

640
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,000
which is to do research on every single global filing that the company has made going back 20

641
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
years. So the questions were, what was the data that was filed with different countries?

642
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:53,000
What was the raw data connected to that data? Did the raw data exist? How were the studies done?

643
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,560
Where were the studies done? At what manufacturing plan? What were the processes and procedures

644
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,360
that led to the creation of that data? I mean, this is the sort of vast undertaking

645
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:10,360
that Tucker's team began on. And you know, because of just a word about Dinesh Tucker,

646
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:20,520
I mean, he was this kind of single minded, very ethical, and somewhat sort of blinkered individual

647
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:27,880
who was like given a task. And he was going to do that task. And he didn't step back and say,

648
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,120
well, wait a minute here, folks, I'm investigating my own company. So what are the possible

649
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:39,800
ramifications of that? I mean, he didn't really stop and think about that. He was just intent

650
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:46,120
on getting the right answers. So of the filings that he investigated going back to the early 80s,

651
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:53,320
what did he find? So his team begins to uncover Rambaxi secret, which is that they have basically

652
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:01,880
fabricated data for more than 200 drug products in 40 countries. Some of the data they just

653
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,200
completely made up, some of it they manipulated or altered. In some cases, they were using brand

654
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:13,480
name drugs, which they would just crush up and test in order to generate data that of course,

655
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,760
made the drugs look bio equivalent, because they were testing the brand name drugs and representing

656
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:23,960
them as their own. And then presumably when approved, they would then ship what? I mean,

657
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,320
if you're going to go through the trouble of testing on a brand, you're not going to ship

658
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:33,000
a brand that would be too expensive. So what were they actually selling? So they were making

659
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,200
generic drugs in their laboratory. But in many cases, these generic drugs were either totally

660
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:44,280
untested or did not meet specifications. I mean, for example, you're supposed to do stability

661
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:51,080
testing on drugs, which means you put them in these special chambers that replicate conditions

662
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,680
of heat and cold. And you're supposed to test three months, six months, nine months, 18 months,

663
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:03,320
these are various stability stations that you test to see does the drug remain stable. So if you're

664
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:08,760
selling a drug into Mozambique, where it's very hot, you have to be able to reflect that those

665
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:15,000
drugs will remain stable at very hot temperatures. No, he discovered they were testing all of these

666
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,200
different periods of stability. They would test them all on the same day and they would alter

667
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,920
the data and then make it appear as though it was three months. What's the denominator on this?

668
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:34,440
You said 200 drugs falsified across 40 countries. Is this 200 out of 200,000? I'm being facetious.

669
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:40,520
200 drug products. So that would be like much of their inventory. In other words,

670
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:46,840
had he found any evidence they did anything correctly? No. In other words, that 200 is the

671
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:54,360
denominator and the numerator. I am not certain, but it looked like it that basically. It's unlikely

672
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,800
that they did five of them right and then they BS their way through 200 of them. Right. So that

673
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:05,640
basically this was their business model. The business model was fraud. Right. Their business

674
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:12,840
model was fraud and everyone in the company was in on it in that people were given orders to

675
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:19,320
swap out ingredients, to replace higher quality ingredients with lower quality, to do all the

676
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:24,760
stability testing on the same day, to use the brand name drugs. And that was just how the whole

677
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:29,800
company rolled. So a little PowerPoint presentation gets whipped together.

678
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,120
I tell you something. Do you have a copy of that PowerPoint presentation? I do and a lot of people

679
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:42,120
want it and I haven't posted. I've posted one slide of it online in a Twitter thread. But yeah.

680
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,040
Are you permitted to? Is there a legal reason or is there a reason you haven't been able to post the

681
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:50,600
whole PowerPoint presentation? Maybe because I don't want to crash the internet. I was once

682
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,640
approached by the Atlantic magazine as they went to a group of investigative journalists. What is

683
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:01,480
the biggest fraud? What is the most remarkable fraud in the history of the world? And I given

684
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:10,200
them an example. This was before I did this book, but I will say that it is hard to imagine a more

685
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:18,440
incriminating document than this PowerPoint, which basically says we have falsified data

686
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:26,200
in every market where we sell drugs, in every product that we sell. We have done it simply

687
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:32,760
for the purpose of facilitating our business needs. We have put all our partners at risk

688
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:41,240
and there is only one solution, which is to notify every regulator in every country where

689
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:49,400
we sell our drugs, pull all our drugs off the market and fly right. So basically two guys put

690
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:54,280
this PowerPoint presentation together. That's right. Dinesh and his boss. Dinesh and Kumar. And

691
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:03,800
it's hard for me when reading this to put myself in their shoes because truthfully a part of me

692
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:11,560
thought, are you guys idiots? I mean, I totally get the naivete at the outset with, hey, this

693
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,840
CRO, this contract research organization seems a little shady. Let's go do a little digging.

694
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:22,200
I don't know where my analogies are coming from today. That's like me coming over to your house,

695
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,000
Catherine, you invite me over for dinner and you give me a little something to eat. You bring me

696
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,280
a nice bowl of soup and I'm eating it and I find a tip of a thumb in it. And I think I look at your

697
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:39,080
hand and you have perfectly tipped fingers and thumbs. And I think that's really odd. I wonder

698
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:44,760
if there are more bodies in here. And I send my kid, I say, hey, I'm going to sit here and keep

699
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,760
eating dinner. You go look throughout her house and see what you find. And 30 minutes later,

700
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:56,120
while you and I are still eating dinner, he comes back and says, daddy, there's 200 bodies

701
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:02,680
stashed in the house. And my first reaction is I'm going to put a PowerPoint presentation together

702
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:08,360
and say, Catherine, I found 200. In fact, there's not a room in your house that doesn't contain

703
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:13,800
10 dead bodies that have been mutilated. I think we should do something about it. Like it wouldn't

704
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:20,200
dawn on me that you are the killer of all of these people. Taking this PowerPoint presentation,

705
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:25,560
which became known as the SAR document. What does that stand for again? The self-assessment

706
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:33,160
report. I love it. Taking the SAR document into the board room. I mean, I guess if I'm going to,

707
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:38,920
you could argue maybe they somehow thought that the CEO was the only one in on this on the board

708
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:45,320
and the non-executive directors had no clue. I mean, I guess in their defense, that's possible,

709
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:51,960
but it seems improbable. And I guess it actually in their defense speaks to the lack of a regulatory

710
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,920
environment that they could go to. In other words, if this were in the US, that SAR doesn't

711
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:03,160
go to the board of Pfizer. That SAR goes directly to the FDA and the New York times. You know what?

712
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:09,320
That's probably what it speaks to. I think that is a really good point, but also I will say for

713
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:15,400
Raj Kumar coming from GlaxoSmithKline, this heavily regulated environment, and he's like,

714
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:23,160
oh my God, every single drug product is tainted with fraud. But he tells Dinesh Thakkar,

715
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:29,320
I'm a little bit hopeful that I'm going to present this to a subcommittee, the board of the directors,

716
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:35,240
and they're going to let me fix it. And again, I just have to, because you're going to tell us

717
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:43,080
what happened, which is certainly among top 10 most ridiculous moments in the history of corporate

718
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:49,480
board governance. But do you think on some level, do you think he kissed his wife and kids a little

719
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,800
harder that day when he left for the office? Was there some part of him that thought he wasn't ever

720
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:59,160
coming home again? Because in the movies, he'd have been killed. He wouldn't have left the boardroom.

721
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,880
I mean, and if it were funny movie, if it were like Austin Powers, it would have been like one

722
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,480
of those little, you probably haven't seen Austin Powers in a while. Of course, I still know every

723
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,520
scene off by heart, but there's the funny version where the chair catches on fire or a little trap

724
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:18,760
door opens and you drop or it ejects you into a shark tank. And the not as funny version of this

725
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:24,360
and the godfather, good fellas version of this on the way out to the car, you get sort of clubbed

726
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:30,200
bag over the head. You're never seen again. How did he not think that that was a strong possibility?

727
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:36,680
I'm not exactly sure what was going through his mind at that moment. But one interesting anecdote

728
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:43,400
that we didn't mention is as Dinesh Tucker was putting together his findings, he comes home and

729
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:50,520
he has his three year old son there and he realizes, wait a second, I gave him a Rambaxi drug

730
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:56,760
because he had an ear infection and he did not get better. And the doctor then switched him to

731
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:03,400
actually to a GlaxoSmithKline antibiotic and the boy got better right away. So he is as he's doing

732
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:09,240
this research. He's putting the pieces together and he's like, okay, I'm not going to give my

733
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:16,280
family a Rambaxi drug until I know the truth. So Raj Kumar is now in the boardroom and he's

734
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:22,440
handing out his document. How many pages are in the self-assessment review document? The S.A.R.

735
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:31,480
I love that just the name is so nondescript. Yeah. 24 slides. Just 24 slides. 24 slides with

736
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:37,160
smoke coming out and fire coming out of every single one. I'm just picturing him at the office

737
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:44,440
printer, just rattle in these things off. If he's anything like me thinking about, do I staple

738
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:49,080
vertically or horizontally? Do I go with the diagonal staple on this one or do I just put

739
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:55,480
the little mini clip on it? So many options. Color, black and white. Do I want to be showy or not showy?

740
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:02,280
Okay. How does the board receive this? So he presents this to a silent boardroom. Like you

741
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,720
could hear a pin drop and just to give a context, I mean, sitting in that boardroom, it was a

742
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:14,440
subcommittee. It was the scientific subcommittee of the board of directors. So you've got a guy like

743
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:22,200
Tehinder Khanna, who is the, was Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. You've got super high profile

744
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:29,800
surgeon in India. I mean, you've got real power players in that room and the room is silent. And

745
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:39,080
then one of the board members asks, well, can we not bury the data? Which also is a funny question

746
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:49,560
to me because Kumar has clearly gone to great lengths to uncover this, synthesize it and now

747
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:57,480
present it. My general take on this is a culture of incompetent incompetence. You see, if you want

748
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:03,320
to be a true fraud, shouldn't you be watching more gangster movies? Shouldn't the board's response

749
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:11,320
have been, Raj, this is exactly the kind of stuff we are looking for our lieutenants in the field to

750
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:17,720
bring us. Thank you. We will take action immediately. By the way, can we borrow your laptop? We want to

751
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,600
make sure we have more copies of this. And then they let him leave and then they destroy the laptop

752
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,640
and then they unserve on a C4. Like, again, not to give the criminals too many pointers here, but

753
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:33,800
was anybody competent in this arena? Like these guys don't even know how to get out of a bad

754
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:40,440
situation because now you've just told the guy who's telling you, I think this is the biggest scam

755
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:47,640
in the world. Yes, it is. And we want to continue hiding it. It's important to know the mentality

756
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:55,080
comes in part from being in a culture of impunity. I mean, they're not afraid of their own regulators.

757
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,520
They can buy off their own regulators. Well, clearly, right, because they have the

758
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:03,960
lieutenant governor of one of the largest cities is on their board. Right. They're not worried about

759
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:09,960
regulators storming their offices. In their mindset, they think this can be covered up.

760
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,440
And I guess it speaks to not having a, I mean, even though India is a democracy in the sense,

761
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:20,600
their press presumably doesn't have the chops that a press would have in Western Europe or North

762
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:25,960
America. I think that that is true. So Brian Tempest, who is the president, he was sort of

763
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:32,200
an acting president for a year. He says he tells Raj Kumar to leave behind his laptop,

764
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:38,760
which then gets broken down piece by piece. I'm picturing like office space with the base, like,

765
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:44,360
by the way, that photocopier hasn't been working either. So that photocopier plus Raj's laptop,

766
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,640
get him in the parking lot. Right. And throw it all into the Ganges. Right. And they had sent the

767
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:57,560
secretary out of the room. So there were no minutes of the meeting. And basically to Raj Kumar,

768
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,280
he got his answer right there. So what does Raj do at that point? What does he tell Dinesh? He tells

769
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:08,920
him what happened. And two days later, he submits his resignation with or without a hush package.

770
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,720
It's a question I don't know the answer to. Because his predecessor probably went through

771
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:18,920
something similar. And it sounds like there was a settlement. There was, I think, a very large

772
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,960
settlement. I mean, his sources had told me he got a million dollars upon leaving. So I don't know

773
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:31,240
what kind of settlement Raj Kumar may have had. But all of these very dramatic events left Dinesh

774
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:38,840
Thakur, the sort of architect and author of all of this information, alone without protection

775
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:45,240
in the company. At this point, does Dinesh realize he's in trouble? I don't think he fully understood

776
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:53,800
how much trouble he was in. So what happens next? So then the auditors of Ram Bakshi come into his

777
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,600
department to say they're going to do a review. It seemed clear at that point that they were looking

778
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:06,440
for some sort of dirt on him. And what happens next is that they plant dirt on him. And they

779
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:16,360
put his IP address on some porn searches. And he is accused of looking at porn on his work computer.

780
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:22,760
Which, by the way, still, that also made me laugh out loud because we're in a culture where apparently

781
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:28,280
if you look at porn in your work computer, it's a terminable offense. Go to jail. Do not pass

782
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:36,440
go. Do not collect $200. Lie falsified data. Jeopardize the lives of millions of people.

783
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:43,240
That's standard operating procedure. We'll promote you for that. But don't you ever look at porn around

784
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:49,080
here. I never quite thought of it that way. But you may have a point. And an attorney for Ram Bakshi

785
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:55,000
who left the company and spoke to me later said, you know, in retrospect, I don't think he was doing

786
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:08,120
porn in the office. I mean, again, I'm laughing only because I need another response beyond rage.

787
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,520
I just I have to make fun of a lot of this, even though there's nothing funny about this.

788
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:18,520
Dinesh, remind me how many kids he has. Does he just have the three year old? So at that point,

789
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:26,680
he has a toddler basically at home and his wife and he's moved his young family over to Gurgaon

790
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:33,000
from New Jersey. And is his wife also from India originally? She is. And is she a breast of what's

791
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,120
going on? No. And that was another very interesting thing in both the reporting this and writing it

792
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:47,000
and thinking about it. They had an arranged marriage. They had seemingly a good working

793
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,880
relationship, but really never communicated about any of this. She didn't know why he was

794
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:59,400
down in his basement office working until midnight, collating these streams of data.

795
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,800
He was actually looking at porn on the company computer. She obviously missed that detail.

796
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,720
He never told her. She never asked. So he's kind of going through this alone. He's lost his mentor

797
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:14,920
who brought him. He's now lost his boss. All jokes aside, this is an incredibly frightening,

798
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:21,800
isolating experience for him. And so he submits his resignation letter. What year? Are we up to

799
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:29,080
05 now? In 2005. Okay. He comes back to the US at this point if I recall? No. So there he is in

800
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:35,560
India and he's trying to get on with his life. He's doing some consulting, but of course he had

801
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:42,040
no plan to leave. It's not like he had a job lined up. So he's worried about money and he's trying to

802
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:48,760
figure out what to do next. So what comes to him? So it's monsoon season. He's lying there at night

803
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:56,280
and all he can think about is all this data that he prepared on all of these world markets. And the

804
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:03,080
thing that he really focuses on, which is interesting is he knows that the AIDS drugs that the company

805
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:09,640
is sending to Africa are terrible. He knows that they're not going to cure people. He knows that

806
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:16,920
they are going to degrade in the heat in what are called zone four conditions. And he can't get over

807
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:23,960
what he's uncovered. He just can't get over it. Do we know looking back now what percentage of

808
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:32,680
PEPFAR's incoming drugs were coming directly from that company? They were certainly a very substantial

809
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:38,360
player in PEPFAR. I mean, they were definitely supplying a lot of drugs to that program. I don't

810
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:43,880
know what percentage. And it's interesting, again, bringing it back to on the one hand,

811
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:50,840
PEPFAR changed the culture of generic acceptance. Did PEPFAR include anything in it that said,

812
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:57,400
oh, and by the way, whatever generic drug maker that's going to sell a product directly into this

813
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:03,000
program will have an even higher level of scrutiny than the FDA current authority is, given that

814
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,800
we're going to spend, I mean, billions of taxpayer dollars on this, you'd think that that would give

815
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,840
the FDA, which is basically like, here's a private purchase agreement. Now I really have the authority

816
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:20,120
to put my foot in your ass. FDA approval was viewed as the gold standard. It almost sends a

817
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:25,400
negative message, which is if we need a higher level of standard, it undermines our basic approval.

818
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:32,680
Really worldwide, I have to say this, the view is there is no higher standard than the FDA's approval.

819
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,120
It is the gold standard. Many regulatory agencies, they will just look to the FDA for guidance. Oh,

820
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:45,160
they approved this company will approve this company. That's it. And regulators around the

821
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:53,160
world sort of hang on the FDA's decisions. So Dinesh is unemployed, but realizing that there's

822
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:58,040
a tsunami coming metaphorically as well as potentially literally through the monsoon,

823
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:08,920
which is we're about to unleash a torrent of at best placebo, at worse, something harmful to an

824
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:14,600
entire continent. Well, it wasn't even about to. It was happening. I mean, those drugs were going

825
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:20,120
regularly to Africa. I mean, millions of patients around the world were getting all those drugs

826
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:25,960
as he lay there and he couldn't sleep. So what did he do? So he did something very interesting.

827
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:32,920
He set up an email account and he gave himself a pseudonym and the pseudonym he gave himself

828
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:40,920
is Malvinder Singh, who was then the CEO of the company. So Malvinder Singh was this sort of

829
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:47,000
scion of the Ram Bakshi family. It was his grandfather who had started the company.

830
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:55,160
His father who was revered, who took it multinational and Malvinder Singh quickly ascended to

831
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:01,320
the role of CEO after Brian Tempest left. But Malvinder Singh, I mean, that was like a name

832
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,520
familiar to every Indian household. He was a famous. Yeah, it would be like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos

833
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:12,520
in the United States. So he creates this Yahoo email account where he's Malvinder Singh and he

834
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:18,520
starts writing to regulators around the world. And he's a very educated fellow, but he writes in

835
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:24,760
broken English and he pretends to be a bench scientist at the company. And he basically writes

836
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,760
and says, I am being forced to falsify data against my will, very dangerous, et cetera. So

837
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:36,920
to the FDA's credit, almost every regulator around the world blows him off. Thank you for your

838
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:43,400
interesting email and we'll be back to you in due course. He keeps writing to the FDA and keeps

839
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,440
writing. He doesn't get a response. And finally, any attachments to these emails? Is he actually

840
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:54,440
showing any of the data in the song? Not yet. Keeps writing. And then finally, out of just pure

841
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,840
frustration, he writes to the FDA commissioner who at the time was Lester Crawford and he writes to

842
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:07,320
him and he says, he puts aside the broken English, puts aside being a bench scientist. And he says,

843
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:14,200
I am pleading with you to put a stop to this crime. And several days later, he gets an email back

844
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:20,280
and it is from a deputy at the FDA saying, we're in receipt of your emails from this date, this

845
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,160
date, this date, this date, this date. We'd like to talk to you. So he comes to the US or they come

846
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:32,840
out to India? This is interesting. So Dinesh had thought, all I need to do is tell them there's a

847
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,680
fraud. Right. And then I'm done with this. I'm done. They'll show up and they'll do what they do.

848
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:42,280
That's right. They'll come racing across the world. They'll descend on the company and my job has been

849
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:48,360
done. And what he did not realize is that he was barely even at the beginning. So when they say,

850
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,560
we would like to talk to you, he's surprised. Talk about what? I told you. I just told you.

851
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:05,960
Oh boy. So what begins is this kind of weird game of chicken with the FDA where they're asking for

852
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:12,280
more information, more documents. They don't know who he is. They just call him M. He's using the

853
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:16,600
same name as the CEO. They haven't figured out that that's a pseudonym. Oh, well, they know he's

854
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,280
not the CEO of the company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but they haven't asked him his real name.

855
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,360
Like they know that obviously that's not his real name because it wouldn't be by coincidence. Right.

856
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:32,360
Right. Okay. So he's presumably at this point, dripping out pieces of the SAR and the supporting

857
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:39,160
documents that led to it. No, he hasn't yet said anything about the SAR and he keeps sending them

858
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:43,880
emails. Is he talking about the specific company or is he talking more? Okay. No, he's talking about

859
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:50,440
the specific company and he's sending snippets of emails that basically implicate officials at

860
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:56,360
the company in fraud. But meanwhile, while this is going on, what is the FDA doing? It's approving

861
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:03,800
one drug after another made by Rambaxi. Including a Torvastatin. They did. They didn't do it yet

862
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:10,040
because that was later in the story. That was 07 if I remember. It was actually 2011. Oh geez.

863
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:17,240
So they had been investigating the company for almost six years and they knew it was saturated

864
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,720
with fraud at the point that they approve a Torvastatin. Because we're coming up to the

865
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:29,880
Valentine's day massacre. Right. All right, let's go there. But finally these FDA officials,

866
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:35,960
I mean, they're doing some investigations around what he's telling them and they finally say,

867
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:44,120
we understand that you have a document that basically delves into this and we would like

868
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:49,720
to see it. And at that point he says, well, do I need a lawyer? I mean, good question. They provide

869
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:56,600
him with reassurances. He gives them the document and as you said, so that leads to a raid on the

870
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:06,280
company on February 14th of 2007. And I mean, I guess it's wise that the FDA of course chose to

871
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:11,320
raid the US plant. The headquarters, the corporate headquarters. I didn't realize the corporate

872
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:15,080
headquarters was in the United States. So you're just saying the US headquarters. The US headquarters.

873
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:19,720
What is their authority there versus their authority in India? Presumably they have a fraction of the

874
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:25,800
authority on Indian soil, correct? Can they raid an Indian plant? No. They have no authority in

875
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,920
India. I see. So that's why they do these Clujy sort of, hey, we're going to come do a surprise

876
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:38,680
inspection in two weeks. I mean, let's take a step back and think about this. So we are completely

877
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:46,840
dependent on countries, manufacturing, life-saving drugs. We have no authority, no real legal

878
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,600
authority on the ground. We have no US attorneys in India. I mean, we can't serve a search warrant.

879
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:57,080
But hang on a second. This seems kind of crazy to me given that, let's use the TSA as an example.

880
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:04,200
Okay. So we have complete authority on US soil who gets on and off a plane. Don't we have some

881
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:09,000
authority who gets on and off a plane that's coming into the United States, even if it leaves on foreign

882
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,760
soil? Well, that's interesting you should bring that up because aviation is governed by an international

883
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:21,880
treaty. And all these countries are signatories to a treaty. We have no treaty on drugs, even though

884
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:28,040
it's completely globalized. We have a few formalized agreements, but they don't give us any legal

885
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:32,920
authority. So that's we need the equivalent of airline security in the drug world. We need some

886
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:38,520
ability to police. The United States doesn't seem to care if someone flies between Nigeria and

887
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:43,240
Bangladesh to the same extent that they would care if you were flying from one of those two

888
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:51,800
places into the US. Right. But what the aviation treaty says is you all in your own country,

889
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:58,120
have to police your airlines and set up your airports in the following manner. And you're

890
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:05,240
all agreeing to do that. And if you don't do that, you can't enter our airspace is what it says.

891
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:11,160
Yeah. And so that's obviously missing here. And so to your point, the FDA had no choice

892
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:18,120
other than to raid the US headquarters. Right. That was the most they could do. Right. But I mean,

893
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:23,320
on the other hand, it does make sense that they go and raid those headquarters because that is

894
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:29,320
where they're sort of launching all their drug applications into the market. So what did they

895
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:36,680
find during that raid? Oh, man. So they find, for example, we should talk a little bit about Sotret.

896
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:44,280
So Sotret is the generic version of Accutane, which is a drug that targets adolescent acne

897
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:52,680
largely. But it is such a dangerous drug, leads to miscarriages, suicidal ideation,

898
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:59,160
that the FDA gives it a black box warning. Rambaxi was the first to launch generic Accutane in the

899
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:05,080
US market, but they knew that the drug was completely defective, didn't dissolve properly,

900
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:11,320
the dissolution was messed up. They had an internal document that basically says,

901
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:18,920
we know this drug is failing, we're marketing it anyway. And the cover page on this document said

902
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:24,840
in big letters, do not share with FDA. Wasn't that the actual name of the document as well? Like

903
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:30,760
that was the file name or something like FDA agents. Okay. So just go into the search engine

904
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:37,560
and just search for keywords, do not share FDA, just see what comes up. So I mean, they get that

905
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:46,120
document, they get the SAR, the amount of documents they get is so huge and so incriminating.

906
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,880
And it's on the basis of that, that the investigation is fully launched. But again,

907
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:59,160
this is 2007. Right. Okay. As you alluded to, it will be many years before this story

908
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:07,320
comes to its natural, ugly, deadly, whatever ending. What is actually happening from 2007 to

909
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:14,680
2013 or whenever this thing finally resolves? Like what does an FDA investigation mean when you have

910
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:23,320
that much evidence? Like this isn't the way we invest crimes. Like this guy got a house full of

911
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:29,080
dead bodies. Well, I mean, okay. I understand the neighbors think it smells a little bit funky and

912
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:33,560
every time someone comes over for dinner, nobody ever leaves, blah, blah, blah, blah. But now you

913
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:38,680
went over to the house and you found the bodies. Right. So what are the next steps when you have

914
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:43,240
this much proof? And I'm sorry, does this involve the Department of Justice at this point? Yeah.

915
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:48,680
So the FDA, they can't subpoena anybody. They have no subpoena authority. They have no subpoena

916
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:54,680
authority. So for any case they want to make, they need a US attorney. So they involve the US

917
01:34:54,760 --> 01:35:01,800
attorney's office in Maryland. And basically the whole case just grinds down into slow motion.

918
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:07,480
They're trying to interview witnesses. Rambaxi moves people to India. So they're sort of out of.

919
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:12,840
So they're subpoena free. Right. So they're subpoena free. They're battling, the FDA

920
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:19,960
investigators are battling US attorneys about who to interview, what documents to pursue. They're

921
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:27,640
fighting with Rambaxi's lawyers. They are trying to sort of track the frauds and what they're

922
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:33,480
trying to figure out, what are we going to charge this company with? What do the frauds mean for

923
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:39,320
the quality of the drugs? I mean, have you spoken with anybody, the FDA, who could speak to what the

924
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:46,680
internal view was circa 2007? Because with the revisionist history, you could sort of say, look,

925
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:51,480
if you really want to put the boots to these guys, you say, hey guys, either you cooperate

926
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:56,520
immediately and fully with the investigation or we are suspending all of your sales in the United

927
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:02,840
States pending resolution of this. That's a huge hammer to drop on somebody. And you can't drop

928
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,480
that every time because if you're ever wrong, there's no telling what the magnitude of that

929
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:12,760
lawsuit would be in reverse. But one, it seems like in this situation, you had enough evidence that

930
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:17,640
you at least could have ethically made that threat. Clearly, they didn't have the legal

931
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:22,040
chops to make that threat or did they? If they're the FDA, don't they have the singular authority

932
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:28,840
to suspend a drug by a company? They didn't need the Department of Justice or Congress to say,

933
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:33,960
yep, you guys are cool telling these guys no more drugs sold in the United States or by the way,

934
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:38,680
through PEPFAR while we're at it, using taxpayer dollars until you fully comply with this and our

935
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:42,120
investigation is complete. Like I'm still struggling to understand the heel dragging.

936
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:49,960
Are they back in 2003 India where the naivete is this can't be nearly as bad as it looks?

937
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,680
Well, so first of all, in terms of what was going on inside the FDA,

938
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:01,160
FDA investigators were trying to figure out sort of each permutation of the fraud. So,

939
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:07,640
wow, they're doing all of their stability testing for six, nine, 18 months, all on the same day.

940
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:13,640
So that's one revelation. Wow, everybody in the company appears to be in on this. That's another

941
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:20,600
revelation. But as this is unfolding, the other side of the FDA, which is the sort of regulatory

942
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,720
approval side of the FDA keeps on approving the company's drugs. I see. So good point you're

943
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:32,920
making here, which is structurally, the FDA has enough silo in it that the people that are dealing

944
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:37,800
with this company from a drug approval standpoint are not the same people that are investigating

945
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:42,440
them. But there's presumably not a Chinese wall between them. Well, right. And you know, by the

946
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:49,480
end of this, there's like a Rambaxi enforcement team that's 30 people large. And then people start

947
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:55,240
saying to each other, why are we working so hard to keep this company in business? Why don't we

948
01:37:55,240 --> 01:38:00,920
shut it down? Why don't we take this application integrity policy, this tool that came from the

949
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:06,120
generic drug scandals of the 80s and use it to just take all these applications basically

950
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:11,560
offline, which would have the effect of shutting the company down? Why aren't we doing that? And

951
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:18,120
it's weird because I got the book is based on 20,000 internal FDA documents among many other

952
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:25,160
interviews. I was sifting I have all the email records from inside the FDA about this company.

953
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:30,520
Do these three new information act? Well, first of all, I mean, anybody who's reported on the FDA

954
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:36,120
will tell you you file a freedom of information request. And you can, if you're lucky, expect to

955
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:43,000
get a couple of documents two years later. So I filed 16 freedom of information requests for this

956
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,960
book. I even sued the FDA. I hired a lawyer to try to get some documents through the FOIA mechanism.

957
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,240
But the bulk of the documentation was coming through sources who were leaking documents.

958
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:59,640
Wow. Yeah, I didn't realize the FOIA would be that inefficient within the FDA.

959
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:05,000
It is not effective. It is. Let's put it this way. If you really want to get information, I mean,

960
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,480
almost none of the information that the book is based on, I would have ever gotten through FOIA.

961
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,320
I'll keep that in mind. So the next time I'm choosing between a root canal and something

962
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:23,000
equally painful, FOIA, the FDA, I had no idea actually. Okay. So I just want, I'm sorry to

963
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,520
interrupt you. Just keep going. This, this story tells itself. Yeah. So then it comes to this point

964
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:35,240
where Rambaxi had the first to file for the biggest generic drug launch in history,

965
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:41,800
which was generic Lipitor. And there you have the FDA bureaucrats sort of parsing

966
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:47,400
the details from their application and saying, well, is there a fraud in this application?

967
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:53,640
There's fraud in every other application, but do we know that there's fraud in this one?

968
01:39:53,720 --> 01:40:00,360
Ultimately, they didn't find direct evidence of fraud in that application.

969
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,880
But based on what? Did they inspect a single Indian plant?

970
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:09,560
So they send, so last minute, right? And Congress is writing them letters saying,

971
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:15,640
we need generic Lipitor now. We're going to be saving billions of dollars with generic Lipitor.

972
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:20,440
You can't delay this approval any longer. Wait, is Congress at this point aware of what

973
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:27,480
the FDA is investigating? Not fully, because the FDA does not disclose it. They do a raid on

974
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:33,880
Rambaxi and a congressional investigator calls over and asks the FDA, what are you investigating?

975
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:38,680
Are you investigating drug quality? And they say no. What are they investigating? Drug quality.

976
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:46,280
Culturally, why is the FDA hiding their good investigative work from Congress?

977
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Wouldn't it give them more breathing room? I mean, Congress is breathing down their back.

978
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,200
And look, if you put yourself in the shoes of Congress, they're doing the right thing.

979
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:59,560
They're trying to protect the American taxpayer. They don't have the window of visibility into

980
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,000
the safety issues. They are looking at this purely. They're naive enough to believe,

981
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:10,600
as we all are prior to your work, that a Torvastatin is Lipitor, except it costs a fraction of what

982
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:16,680
Lipitor costs. So every day this drug is not approved, the U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for

983
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:23,000
X more dollars. FDA, come on, guys, get it going. And the FDA is somehow doing good work,

984
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,200
but being sheepish about it. It's almost like if you didn't know better, you'd think there was a

985
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:33,560
second conspiracy theory here, which is that this is not incompetence, but rather political pressure,

986
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:37,960
for example, would be one thing that jumps to your mind. Right. I mean, this is in many ways,

987
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:43,080
the story of Rambaxi is a cultural damnation of India. If we're just going to be blunt and

988
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:47,080
create a whole bunch of enemies and everyone on Twitter is going to light you and me up for saying

989
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:51,880
that. But there's no way around it. This is a cultural damnation of an enormous nation.

990
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:59,560
And I will say the book launched about three weeks ago in India. And boy, has it. Yeah. I mean,

991
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:05,320
I have been under fire. And this is funny. All of my workings with people in India, which is,

992
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:08,360
there's only one time in my life I've really had a lot of interaction with people in India,

993
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,440
which is when I worked at a company, a global company called McKinsey and Company. And we had

994
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:17,640
a huge presence in India and we had a huge, especially from a technical sort of analytics

995
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:22,040
standpoint, we had so much of our horsepower in India. So in other words, I want to be careful

996
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:25,960
that I don't misrepresent that I know anything about India other than my own direct experience,

997
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:30,520
which is these people that were coming out of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology,

998
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:35,800
which is like, I don't know, they've got like an MIT in every state, basically these IITs.

999
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:42,360
These guys were unbelievable. Like I have nothing but great things to say about all of these people

1000
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:48,440
I worked with through McKinsey, who were again, by and large graduates of the IITs,

1001
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:53,400
mathematician, statisticians, computer scientists, primarily, I mean, they were exceptional people,

1002
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:59,640
which tells you that the problem is not the people per se, but something within the hierarchy

1003
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:06,520
of companies that somehow slowly can corrupt a subset of people. I mean, like, what do you think

1004
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:10,040
is actually at the root cause of this? I know I'm taking us a little bit off the story, but it's,

1005
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:14,440
we've sort of been dancing around this issue a little bit. And I don't know how to reconcile

1006
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:18,760
these two things, which is there's an amazing system of education in India that produces

1007
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:26,280
amazingly bright people who are incredibly hardworking. And yet there's a systemic problem,

1008
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:31,560
at least with respect to one industry, which then makes you wonder, well, is petroleum going

1009
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:36,680
to be any better? Is textile any better? If you go through all of the other industries,

1010
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:41,640
maybe the stakes aren't as high. I don't know, but what reason do we have to believe that this

1011
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:48,200
isn't a broader issue than one company? I had done a big magazine article on Ram Bakshi before

1012
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:55,800
I launched into the book and that ran in May of 2013. And we got all these comments in from

1013
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:02,200
readers. And I remember one of the comments was talking about a word I'd never heard before,

1014
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:13,000
which is Jugaad. I'm like, what is that? J-U-G-A-A-D. It's a Hindi word. So in some contexts,

1015
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:20,360
it has positive connotations, which is Jugaad is a sort of spirit of creativity that allows you

1016
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:28,760
to overcome obstacles. Okay. So that can be incredibly positive in India where average daily

1017
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:36,760
life is so difficult and the systems are so onerous. The legal systems, anything, getting a

1018
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:43,400
driver's license, navigating contracts, I mean, that's all extremely challenging. But Jugaad has

1019
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:51,800
a very dark connotation, which means it's basically eliminating all obstacles and getting to the desired

1020
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:59,880
goal by the shortest by any means necessary. And Jugaad, as I came to learn, is something that is

1021
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:08,680
really prized in Indian companies. And it's a kind of the rules don't matter, the regulations don't

1022
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:16,040
matter, what matters is the goal. And Ram Bakshi was a company that told its employees what matter,

1023
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:24,040
because they had posters hanging on the wall, which talked about this $15 billion goal for,

1024
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:33,160
I think, 2015. Basically, it was a financial goal that mattered. And that sort of began to explain

1025
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:41,880
why this company behaved the way it did. And frankly, as I began to report and expose that

1026
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:49,160
Ram Bakshi really was not an outlier in the Indian generic industry that in a number of companies,

1027
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:54,520
I don't know to the degree of Ram Bakshi, but this is how you did business. Now, again,

1028
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:59,560
before we get back to the story, I think this thread is worth pulling on a little bit more.

1029
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:06,360
We in the United States are not strangers to unbelievable fraud. And we think of WorldCom

1030
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:12,840
and Exxon and Theranos and all of these companies that are just complete and total frauds. And so

1031
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:18,280
one could argue it's no different. This just happens to be an example in an industry where

1032
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:23,960
the consequences were greater. The consequences of Enron's fraud were Californians got screwed

1033
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:29,560
out of some electricity and a bunch of shareholders lost money and both of those things suck, but it's

1034
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:36,760
not as viscerally upsetting as people taking bad drugs. So do you think that it is the case that

1035
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:42,760
there is just as much fraud here in the United States, but the denominator is so much larger

1036
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:48,920
that it's sort of dwarfed? Do you think it's that, well, culturally we're all the same and the

1037
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:55,880
difference is in the United States or in the West, the regulations simply do not permit. You couldn't

1038
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:02,360
get away with what they're doing. And this is not a condemnation of Indian people or Indian culture.

1039
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:07,640
It's a condemnation of a regulatory environment that, as you said, miners in the major and majors

1040
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:13,640
in the minor, which is to say it takes an act of Congress to get a driver's license, but any buffoon

1041
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:18,760
can make a drug. It should be the other way around. Not that a buffoon should get a driver's license,

1042
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:23,400
but it should be easier to do things that are easier there and harder to do things that are

1043
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,240
harder there. Like so I'm giving you the bookends of it. Where do you think it lies?

1044
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:34,040
First of all, whenever we have these exposés of companies that are corrupt to the core,

1045
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:41,640
it's always shocking. I mean, it's shocking to see such a big fraud. The Rannos, Enron, VW,

1046
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,880
the Volkswagen fraud with the emissions, it's always shocking. Interesting. The examples you

1047
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:53,240
give are exposed within. I don't know about VW, but Enron was exposed internally. Theranos exposed

1048
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:59,720
internally. You could argue that that is a cultural difference is even though it was ultimately

1049
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:04,760
exposed externally. You could argue it was much harder to expose Rambaxi internally. I mean, it

1050
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:11,080
ultimately was exposed internally, but the culture of dissent might be greater in the United States.

1051
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:18,680
Is that possible? First of all, people talk about a culture of compliance and companies have cultures

1052
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:26,040
and they sort of reflect these cultures to their and train their employees in these cultures.

1053
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:33,320
And employees from Western drug companies that I talk to, a lot of them talk about the training,

1054
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:39,160
the cultural training of compliance and what that's like. And part of the way that you develop

1055
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:43,800
a culture like that is you have to because you have regulators who are vigilant. You have

1056
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:49,720
regulators who are on the scene. So that's really not the case in India. They're not worried about

1057
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:54,600
their own regulators. They could buy off their own regulators or their regulators simply don't

1058
01:48:54,600 --> 01:49:01,240
show up. And so you don't have the same culture of compliance. It's not something that is sort of

1059
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:11,320
organic to a company. And you wonder if you took Pfizer, BMS, Novartis and moved them to India

1060
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:16,760
under the exact same regulatory environment, would it be a matter of years or generations,

1061
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:23,320
if at all that the internal culture of manufacturing excellence would vanish? I mean,

1062
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:27,240
it's a gedanken experiment, but has it been done? Is there any example of

1063
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:34,360
Western or European companies degrading or the reverse? Well, it's interesting you should mention

1064
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:39,880
this because Novartis has just found itself in the middle of quite a sizable scandal. So

1065
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:49,160
they just got approval for a drug called Solgensma, which is the most expensive drug ever approved.

1066
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:56,760
The treatment is $2.1 million. It's a gene therapy drug. One month after they got approval from the

1067
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:03,320
FDA, they disclosed to the FDA that there was data manipulation in some of the animal studies

1068
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:10,280
for that drug. And apparently they knew about it two months before they got approval. So right now,

1069
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:18,040
obviously, this book has stirred up a lot of emotions in India. And one of the accusations

1070
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:22,200
that has been laughed against me is, well, why don't you talk about fraud in Western companies,

1071
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:26,600
and they're not impervious. And it's a very complicated issue. I mean, there's certainly

1072
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:32,120
fraud in Western drug companies and in Western companies generally. But I think the difference,

1073
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:39,080
and the difference as it sort of filtered down to the FDA, is that here was a company that seemed

1074
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:46,280
completely lawless, where employees across the board were directed to violate regulations,

1075
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:52,840
and they did what they were told, which would be very, very hard to have as a situation in the US

1076
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:58,760
where you have anybody could go run to the FDA. Whistleblowers are legally protected here. There's

1077
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:04,360
financial rewards for them. Yeah, I mean, I think that's fundamentally the difference is systemic

1078
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:11,000
versus non-systemic corruption. And when you think of the most egregious examples in North America,

1079
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,200
they are systemic. They're fortunately not that many, but when they're there, so using Theranos as

1080
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:22,600
an example, Theranos had very few corrupt individuals, but because the corrupt individuals

1081
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:28,440
were at the very top of the pyramid, they could organize the exact nature of the silos to

1082
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:34,440
perpetuate the fraud until internally it was no longer sustainable. I don't know enough about Enron,

1083
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:40,760
but my recollection of the story is Andy Fastow was probably the architect of that, the CFO.

1084
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:48,600
My reading of history is that Ken Lay, the CEO, probably not, but he was sort of too uninvolved,

1085
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:54,920
and who knows what the truth is about Jeff Skilling. I suspect Skilling sort of sheepishly

1086
01:51:54,920 --> 01:52:00,120
encouraged Fastow and whatever, but the point is you had the two of the top three lieutenants in

1087
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:05,400
a company, and then who knows what the trickle down was, but again, eventually a senior person

1088
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:10,280
there basically said, well, I mean, it actually started through an analyst questioning things,

1089
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:16,040
but internally the house of cards fell down when internal people sort of came forward. So I don't

1090
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:22,600
know. I mean, this Rambaxi is so clearly an example of the most, that might be the single most

1091
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:27,800
systemic example of corruption because it went to the board and fully permeated the board. I mean,

1092
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:33,960
I would argue at least at Theranos, the board was just incompetent, but not outright complicit.

1093
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:39,080
Here you had something epic, and so again, I want to come back to the story because we're not even

1094
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:44,360
done yet, but do you have any sense of how prevalent this is? Because we're going to end this

1095
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:49,000
podcast with a practical discussion, which is what the hell do we do? I don't want the listener to

1096
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:55,160
think I haven't forgotten the question that is on everybody's mind, which is Peter, Catherine,

1097
01:52:55,160 --> 01:53:01,320
thanks for the soliloquy, but I've got a bunch of pills I'm taking tomorrow morning and my kid's

1098
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:07,880
got an ear infection. What do I do? So we're going to end there, I promise you, but I can't help but

1099
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:12,680
escape. To answer that question, you sort of also have to understand the prevalence of this problem.

1100
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:21,160
Right. So Rambaxi to me was like the jumping off point for the reporting quest, which is to figure

1101
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:28,440
out whether it was a total outlier or the tip of the iceberg. And my question was how does this

1102
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:38,840
industry really work? So my reporting ended up taking me deep into the FDA and to an inspector

1103
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:45,640
named Peter Baker. He's a young investigator, an analytical chemist, kind of a badass. He's like

1104
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:51,240
in a motorcycle group with tattoos. He's not what you would think of as a regulator with a pocket

1105
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:58,680
protector and a checklist. So when the FDA wants investigators to go and work in their India office,

1106
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:03,720
which is just chronically understaffed and nobody wants to go there. I can't understand why. Is it

1107
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:09,240
the water? The water, the food, the difficulty getting around, I mean, so many reasons, but he

1108
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:15,240
sticks up his hand. He's up for the adventure. And he's just an interesting character. He grew up in

1109
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:22,680
a family of Mennonites in a grass seed farm in Lebanon, Oregon, and they would often go on all

1110
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:31,080
kinds of missionary work anyway, but he winds up at the FDA's India office in 2012. And some of the

1111
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:39,560
FDA investigators are what are known as conference room investigators. So overseas, the FDA pre-announces

1112
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:47,560
inspections. It tells the companies they're coming. The FDA investigators are the guests of the company

1113
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:53,720
who arranged their local travel, arranged their hotels. They show up, they get-

1114
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,560
I don't see any conflict here. I'm not sure where you're going with this, Catherine. This seems

1115
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:03,640
completely reasonable to me. They get souvenirs. They get souvenirs. They may arrange for massages.

1116
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:10,440
What could possibly go wrong? They get like Gandhi snow globes and they get the welcome ceremony,

1117
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:16,360
the opening slideshow. So Peter Baker was like, I don't want any of that stuff. And how old was

1118
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:21,560
Peter at the time when he first stepped foot in there? He was 32. Wow. So the chutzpah of this guy

1119
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:27,000
to just show up and say, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's a new sheriff in town. When I read your book,

1120
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:34,040
by the way, I don't know why. Well, I read a summary of it first and I took him to be a gray

1121
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:39,160
beard. I don't know why. I just had it in my mind. This was the guy with the end of his career,

1122
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:47,640
the steely eyed, seen it all, done it all, been through the eighties, served in nom. Like that

1123
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:53,000
was the impression I had initially. Well, it's really funny if this book gets made into a movie,

1124
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,200
which it might Matt Damon could play him because he's a dead ringer. That's what he looks like.

1125
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:04,360
You heard it here first people. Matt, if you're listening or anyone who knows Matt's listening,

1126
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:09,720
this is the pitch for this role. So some of these investigators are sort of conference room

1127
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:13,720
investigators. They go in, they sit in the conference room, the PowerPoint. I'm going back

1128
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:19,480
to the hotel. That's right. Bring me the document. So he's like, Nope, he pioneers this new method of

1129
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:26,280
inspection. He goes to these manufacturing plants. They're like huge cities. They could be over

1130
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:32,280
dozens of acres. There's a lot of buildings. You're finding a needle in a haystack. If you think

1131
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:39,320
you're going to actually step foot and see a direct mistake, instead you are going to see something

1132
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:46,520
that is directionally smelling wrong. Right. So he decides he's going to start by going to what's

1133
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:53,000
called the quality control laboratories. So these are sort of these areas off of the manufacturing

1134
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:00,680
floor that audit the manufacturing. And basically if you are a law abiding pharmaceutical company,

1135
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:05,560
you're using the data that's coming in from the manufacturing floor to see if there's any problems.

1136
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:10,120
So are there any drugs that should be taken offline that are not meeting specifications?

1137
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:18,520
What are the test results? But if you're a corrupt drug company, you might be using the quality

1138
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:27,560
control laboratory to figure out how to manipulate the test results, how to kind of see what drugs

1139
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:34,680
don't meet specifications and figure out how to make failing drugs pass. So he goes into the

1140
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:41,720
computers. Instead of saying, print me out a document, he looks in the computers. And that's

1141
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:48,680
how he begins to track the metadata in these systems where they have deleted evidence.

1142
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:53,560
Not that I know anything about computers, but I'm not an idiot. If you showed me a bunch of computer

1143
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:59,240
files, like I wouldn't know anything about how to detect mass deletions. Did he have some training?

1144
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:05,480
He had no training, but he figured it out. He figured it out because he had worked in a

1145
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:13,000
quality control laboratory in the branded drug sector before he became an FDA investigator.

1146
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,560
He knew what the fingerprint or signature of this looked like. Every once in a while,

1147
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:22,840
we talk about all the bad things that happen, but sometimes it's worth contrasting it with just the

1148
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:28,280
dumb luck that sometimes just comes our way. And what if Peter hadn't been the guy to put up his

1149
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:34,280
hand and say, I'm going to take one for the team and go to India and get diarrhea for a few months.

1150
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:40,200
And by the way, I'm competent enough to do this job. Yeah, because in fact, I mean, what he found

1151
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:49,800
was incredibly dramatic. I mean, he inspected 86 drug plants in India and China over a course of

1152
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:57,240
five years. And he found some element of data fraud or manipulation in four-fifths of those.

1153
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:02,280
And what's nice about the way he's looking is you can give them all the warning they want.

1154
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:06,680
They can put all the window dressing they want in anticipation. Even if because I remember you

1155
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:11,960
wrote about how often the companies were tipped off. Sure. He'd show up on Tuesday, but the company

1156
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:17,720
had been tipped off earlier. But where he's looking, they're not going to necessarily fix unless the

1157
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:21,800
companies start talking to each other and say, oh, by the way, but presumably he's not disclosing

1158
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:26,840
where he's seeing their mistakes. Well, they did start talking to each other. So in fact, there was

1159
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:34,280
like an industry wide WhatsApp chat that they had where they were talking about him and his

1160
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:41,080
inspection methods because he became so he's like Lucifer to these people. He is Lucifer. He became

1161
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:47,880
so devastating to these companies. And just to give an example of what's at stake, the book opens

1162
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:54,120
with this scene. He goes in to inspect this plant run by this company, Walkheart, and he encounters

1163
01:59:54,120 --> 02:00:01,800
this employee who's trying to smuggle running down the hall to smuggle a garbage bag of documents

1164
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:06,680
out of the plant on his second day of the inspection. And it's a chase scene. So if you want to know

1165
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:12,920
what a chase scene in a sterile drug manufacturing plant looks like, I'm picturing Matt Damon just

1166
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:21,560
chasing some dude down a hall with a Jason Bourne swipe kick out at the end. But well, it's actually

1167
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:29,480
a low speed chase beneath these. It's a speed walk beneath these fluorescent lights. And the irony

1168
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:35,080
is that it is sterile drug manufacturing plant. The employees are, if they're trained properly,

1169
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:41,640
are trained to move slowly because you don't want to disrupt the airflow. It's like a unidirectional

1170
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:46,360
airflow. And so all the movements are supposed to be very controlled. So if you have a chase

1171
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:51,240
scene in that environment, it's a low speed chase, which is how the book opens. It's not a scene out

1172
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:55,880
of Austin Powers. Yeah, it's crazy because it's like the irony of it. It's like it's a chase,

1173
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:05,560
but it's really slow. And it's yeah. But he figures out where the bodies are buried in these plants.

1174
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:11,960
I mean, he used the torn documents in that garbage bag to reconstruct that there was a

1175
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:18,680
hidden area of this plant where they were manufacturing sterile injectable cardiac

1176
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:26,200
drug for the US. They were doing it on corroded equipment that left metallic particles in the drug.

1177
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:31,960
That's bad, right? That's actually not good. Yeah. What is Peter doing today? So Peter has left the

1178
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:41,080
FDA and he is a consultant for a auditing company that audits manufacturing plants. You said

1179
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:44,600
something a moment ago that I wanted you to finish what you were saying. So I didn't interrupt, but I

1180
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:51,160
think it's worth calling out 80 percent of the companies he audited. I want to go back to what

1181
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:58,680
you were saying had some irregularity. So that's option A. Option B were not quite at the standard

1182
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:07,240
of the finest Swiss, German and US plants. Option C were as bad as Rambaxi. I mean, like walk me

1183
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:12,600
through this. What is the implication of what Peter found? The implication of what Peter found

1184
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:19,960
is that fraud and particularly data fraud. So that is manipulation of quality data

1185
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:28,200
to make failing products sellable is endemic. Do we have a positive control for that? In other

1186
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:34,360
words, has someone done Peter's analytics on the best of the best and is the background number on

1187
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:39,400
that 30 percent? Because of course, at this point now, there's nobody listening to this who trusts

1188
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:43,400
anything that comes out of a drug company. And frankly, I don't think the brandids are viewed

1189
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:48,120
that much more favorably than the generics because I think we've made the case that they're just

1190
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:54,440
under more scrutiny and they have deeper pockets. So you could argue, well, they might not be doing

1191
02:02:54,440 --> 02:03:00,600
the egregious nonsense like putting glass particles into pellets or giving you sawdust or

1192
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:06,520
doing their work on rusted machines. But it certainly wouldn't be hard to make the case that

1193
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:11,320
there could be data fraud, which is exactly the stuff that Peter's autopsies and forensics

1194
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:16,280
uncovered. So do we have a sense of what that background number is? So I'm actually hopefully

1195
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:23,480
going to be publishing something relatively soon that will put some numbers to that. But I think

1196
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:30,520
you could say there is really endemic fraud in Indian and Chinese manufacturing plants. And that

1197
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:39,560
is not to say that fraud doesn't exist in the U.S. plants, but the kind of egregious shredding the

1198
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:46,200
documents, bringing in data fabrication teams, doing secret tests. What does your business card

1199
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:52,520
look like when that's your day job? Honey, please meet my husband, Bob. Bob, great to meet you, Bob.

1200
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:58,120
What do you do? Oh, I work in pharma. Oh, great. Are you a chemist? No, no, I'm more on the data

1201
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:06,360
side. Are you a data scientist? No, no, I'm in data fabrication. Oh, fantastic. Well, so this is one

1202
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:13,320
of the mind blowing things that I learned is that these companies, a number of them do have data

1203
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:22,200
fabrication teams. They bring in teams to fix these plants and fabricate documents before the FDA

1204
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:27,080
comes in. You have to connect with Carol Tabris because the extent of cognitive dissonance that

1205
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:35,080
must exist in a person who's stated explicit day job is data fabrication. I'm really curious about

1206
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:41,000
that psychology because it's basically white collar mob work. If you're a hit man in the mob, that's

1207
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:47,480
your job. You get paid and you got to whack people. But we just don't think of that being plausible in

1208
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:53,720
the white collar sort of upper echelon of pharmacology. How is this any different, right?

1209
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:58,440
Except it's more efficient at killing. At least the mob guy can only kill like one dude at a time,

1210
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:05,000
right? These people have the potential to kill tens of people, thousands of people at a time.

1211
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:09,480
They just don't get the blood on their hands. That's really the difference. There's this amazing

1212
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:14,200
quote. One thing I've been asked is, well, what shocked you most in reporting this? There's this

1213
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:21,160
anecdote in the book where this U.S. executive at Rambaxi becomes suspicious about the data because

1214
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:27,000
it's too perfect, which looks exactly like the brand data, right? She realizes that the AIDS

1215
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,760
drugs are really terrible. And on a conference call with like a dozen executives of the company,

1216
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:38,280
she raises this question about the quality of the AIDS drugs going to Africa. And the medical

1217
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:45,240
director of Rambaxi says to her, who cares? It's just blacks dying, which is like, what do you do

1218
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:51,480
again? Like what's the point of your job? You're working at a drug company. It's something. Yeah.

1219
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:55,880
It'd be hard to come up with just one thing that from your work that would have floored you because

1220
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:00,280
it's really it's sort of one with all due respect. I think that's part of what makes this book a

1221
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:07,720
little tough is it seems too impossible at times. It sort of seems like if you made this a movie

1222
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:13,320
and it was pure fiction, it would be rejected. Yes. Because it wouldn't have enough suspense.

1223
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:21,720
It wouldn't have enough irony. It would be too over the top. With that, let's bring it back to,

1224
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:25,080
I want to let you, I keep interrupting you. I apologize. I want to let you get back to the

1225
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:30,200
story of how does at least the tale of this company and Dinesh come to a close? Because

1226
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:34,440
there's another point we didn't mention here, which as all of this nonsense is going on,

1227
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:41,560
they're in play as an acquisition by a Japanese company. So, I mean, now we're perpetuating fraud

1228
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:47,880
on multiple levels. We are also perpetuating fraud in the context of due diligence for a

1229
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:55,320
mega acquisition. That acquisition by Daichi Senkyo, which was Japan's second largest drug company,

1230
02:06:55,320 --> 02:07:02,680
I sort of thought of it as almost like a reverse Godzilla movie where Daichi Senkyo is coming from

1231
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:12,760
this very formal polite culture, the Japanese, they come in to do their due diligence and Malvinder

1232
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:19,160
Singh, the Indian executive, just rolls them. This is not the guy with the Yahoo address.

1233
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:27,720
This is the real CEO. The FDA has already raided their company. They've got this smoking gun,

1234
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:35,240
SAR, PowerPoint. They suppress it from the Japanese through the whole due diligence thing.

1235
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:42,360
They give their employees a script of how to talk about what the legal troubles are. They create

1236
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:49,400
a false set of minutes from the meeting where the PowerPoint is disclosed. They hide any reference

1237
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:56,520
to it in the Justice Department documents they disclose. So, Daichi Senkyo ends up having no

1238
02:07:56,520 --> 02:08:01,480
clue, which I mean a lot of people are like, who were their lawyers? This is ridiculous.

1239
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:08,280
But they end up paying Malvinder Singh and his brother $2 billion for their shares in Rambaxi.

1240
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:14,280
And Malvinder Singh gets out of the burning house like just before the whole thing collapses.

1241
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:23,960
Daichi Senkyo slowly begins to realize that they have bought this company that is fraudulent to

1242
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:33,960
the core. And several years in, they realize they're on the hook for $500 million, which is

1243
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:40,920
the fine that Rambaxi ends up having to pay to the Justice Department to settle the case against them.

1244
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:45,240
Now, does ultimately that money get paid by Singh himself? Where does that money actually come from

1245
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:51,720
in restitution? No, Daichi Senkyo pays it out. So no one has ever gone directly after Singh?

1246
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:57,640
No. So then what happened is once the case settled and Daichi Senkyo was out of pocket

1247
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:05,400
$500 million to pay for Rambaxi's crimes, they end up, Daichi ends up taking Malvinder Singh to a

1248
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:11,640
court of arbitration in Singapore and get all of Rambaxi's lawyers, because now Daichi Senkyo is

1249
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:19,720
Rambaxi, to testify against Malvinder Singh in this arbitration hearing. And the court in a

1250
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:27,320
turnaround awards Daichi Senkyo $500 million that Malvinder Singh is now on the hook for.

1251
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:33,720
And so right now, I mean, his offices were just raided in India. Amazingly, he took this to an

1252
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:39,800
Indian court to say that the judgment is not enforceable in India. And amazingly, an Indian

1253
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:44,840
court ruled against him. Well, I mean, as a skeptic, I would say it's easier to turn on one man than

1254
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:50,760
one culture. Yeah. I mean, it's been very, very interesting to watch it play out. And Daichi has,

1255
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:57,080
of course, divested this entire bomb of crap. This little turd bag has now been purchased by Sun,

1256
02:09:57,080 --> 02:10:04,040
hasn't it? It has. It has. Rambaxi does not exist in the same way that it used to. So this once,

1257
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:11,480
you know, very proud Indian company no longer exists. In the end, at least financially, though

1258
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:17,720
I suspect not emotionally, Dinesh was made whole through the whistleblower. Yes. So he becomes a

1259
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:25,640
formal whistleblower under what's called the key Tam legal case. So his identity was secret. They

1260
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:30,600
reach a settlement. He gets a percentage of the settlement. So he ends up with $48 million,

1261
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:39,480
but his life really unraveled. He and his wife break up. He's had a very difficult road to hope.

1262
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:44,280
Is he in the US now? He goes back and forth between India and the US. And he feels safe in

1263
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:50,040
India? You know, it's quite extraordinary because whistleblowers are routinely killed in India. So

1264
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:56,680
when he was thinking about blowing the whistle on Rambaxi, that was a sort of central calculation,

1265
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:03,320
was the danger to himself. And he ended up really rolling the dice on that. And he's become an

1266
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:10,040
ongoing antagonist to the industry because he's now an activist and an advocate for safe drugs.

1267
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:19,240
And he has just decided that that's how he's going to live. But he has survived this ordeal. But

1268
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:24,360
emotionally, I think it's been very scarring. So it seems to me that perhaps the most compelling

1269
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:32,200
answer we have to the question that is probably at the top of everybody's mind, which is what is

1270
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:36,520
the prevalence of this problem? What is there or maybe another way? What's the penetration of this?

1271
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:44,200
You've done a case study of hopefully the worst of it. We don't know, but you've gone a few inches

1272
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:51,800
wide and several miles deep. But then Baker comes along and Peter's assessment is, well, I've cast

1273
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:57,800
it a much broader net. I haven't gone as far into each one, but I have found the fingerprints of

1274
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:06,360
fraud on 80 percent of what I viewed. By the way, that was 80 percent of non-U.S. generic manufacturers

1275
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:13,400
or all manufacturers inclusive of U.S. So these were 80 percent of the plants he inspected in

1276
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:17,560
India and China. And that's right. OK, so they were all in China. So 80 percent of what he inspected in

1277
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:22,840
India and China. And that again, that was a big number. So you could argue the law of large numbers

1278
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:29,880
starts to kick in. Right. And that is representative of your sample size. So are we to take away

1279
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:37,560
from this that if you go into CVS, Walgreens, pick your favorite pharmacy, you buy your drug

1280
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:43,000
and assuming you can even figure out what company sold it, which turns out not to be easy.

1281
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,920
We're going to talk about that. If it comes from a company that is Indian or Chinese,

1282
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:53,640
you wouldn't be overly paranoid to assume there's an 80 percent chance that there's some

1283
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:59,400
misinformation in what you're taking, which means again, that could mean it's still fine.

1284
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:04,360
That could mean it's not as potent as it says it is. It doesn't have the shelf life it says it is.

1285
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:09,480
I don't want to create mass hysteria. I want to walk through what really is implied by what you're

1286
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:16,680
saying. It is hard to know for certain and it's hard to put a number on it. But here are some sort

1287
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:25,240
of things that I can say. We know that because of the kinds of frauds exposed in the book,

1288
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:33,560
Americans have gotten drugs that in some cases are not bio equivalent, have foreign particulate

1289
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:41,800
matter in it or toxic impurities or are not as sort of represented. So we know that for certain.

1290
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:49,960
We know, for example, that millions of Americans were taking blood pressure medication,

1291
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:58,840
Valsartan, Losartan, Urbosartan. That was found to have the active ingredient contain carcinogens.

1292
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:07,080
These came from Chinese and Indian manufacturing plants and dozens of versions of those drugs have

1293
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:13,320
been recalled. And those carcinogens were in the drugs for maybe about six years. And I'll throw in

1294
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:23,080
my own personal story here. I have seen three examples of this in my practice, which prior to

1295
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:29,480
seeing your book were really infuriating because I thought I was crazy having these arguments.

1296
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:34,040
But sometimes you prescribe drugs for which they have a predictable measured response. There's

1297
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:41,080
nothing subjective about it. Oh, an antidepressant. I don't feel like this is helping me any. Maybe I

1298
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:46,120
have a placebo. Those are very difficult to figure out. Even the antibiotics, they're hard to figure

1299
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:51,720
out. Maybe it just took a while for the drug to kick in and now it kicked in sort of thing. But

1300
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:58,680
when you look at lipid lowering drugs, it's really clear what's supposed to happen. And when it's

1301
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:05,160
working or not working now, there's gradation. So we might be missing things that are underworking,

1302
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:13,560
but on three occasions over the past two years, I have prescribed a patient Crestor. And again,

1303
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:19,320
as a doctor, when you write Crestor, it means nothing. It means for the most part, the patient

1304
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:26,520
will be substituted resubastatin unless otherwise specified resubastatin being the generic equivalent

1305
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:34,120
of Crestor. And in these three particular examples, there was zero change in the LDL cholesterol. Now,

1306
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:40,120
when a patient is on 10 milligrams of Crestor for three months, and there is zero change in the LDL

1307
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:47,480
cholesterol, there are only two explanations that I can think of, theoretically three. But for

1308
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:54,920
argument's sake, the patient's not taking the drug or the drug doesn't work. I like to think that I

1309
02:15:54,920 --> 02:16:02,120
have a non-threatening tone with my patients. So I always assume it's the first. And I'm like,

1310
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:06,920
hey, any chance you ran out of your meds before a couple of weeks before the drug test? And by the

1311
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:11,400
way, the answer to that question is often yes. So a lot of times I will see these issues, or you give

1312
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:16,600
somebody allopurinol for uric acid. The uric acid doesn't go down or it's been down. And then all of

1313
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:20,680
a sudden it's back up. And a lot of times, yeah, the answer is, you know what? For the last two

1314
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:24,120
weeks I forgot I needed a refill. I was on the road, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But there

1315
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:29,080
are three occasions where that was clearly not the case. And this patient, and I just, I really,

1316
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:34,840
I have great confidence that the patients were in fact taking the medication, not a budge. And after

1317
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:40,840
the second one I said, I asked my staff to kind of dig in a little bit. And I said, is the patient

1318
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:46,440
actually getting Crestor or were they getting a generic equivalent? And one thing led to another.

1319
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:53,400
And basically in those situations, because it was too difficult to get the patient back unbranded,

1320
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:58,120
you just switched to a Torvostatin, which I now realize you're just rolling the dice going from one

1321
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:04,040
piece of BS to another piece of BS. But I've seen this issue. There's no question I've seen it. And

1322
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:11,480
I suspect I'm not seeing it to its full extent because I'm only seeing it for drugs in which

1323
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:17,240
the measured response is so clear and so objective. You think of, as you said, all the

1324
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:25,080
drugs that we would miss this on. So what I'm discussing as an example pales in comparison

1325
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:31,560
to the myriad problems that could exist. The contaminants, the partial efficacy, the time

1326
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:36,360
release drug that is not a time release drug and therefore is delivering too high a dose in a

1327
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:41,000
shorter period of time. And does that explain the GI upset? I mean, I'll give you another example.

1328
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,480
Tons of patients complain that generic extended release metformin, which is a drug I prescribe

1329
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:54,280
with some regularity, doesn't work as well as the true glucophage XR does. And metformin is a drug

1330
02:17:54,280 --> 02:18:01,480
that can produce a lot of GI side effects. So I'm kind of stuck. The book describes, for example,

1331
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:08,680
these two doctors at the Cleveland Clinic who began to piece together that some of their patients

1332
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:15,240
who, and these are cardiac drugs, were stabilized on the brand and then became unstable when they

1333
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:20,360
were switched to the generic. And in some cases, heart transplant patients were suffering

1334
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:27,800
organ rejection from a generic. Tacrolimus. Yeah, the tacrolimus. I think for doctors,

1335
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:33,080
once they become aware of this as a kind of category of thought as a possibility,

1336
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:39,240
some of them begin to diagnose the drug supply, not just their patients. Well, so we're in the

1337
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:45,240
process of doing something that's going to take a while. But after reading your book, I sent a long

1338
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:51,000
apologizing email to three people on my staff who were going to be the ones to take one for the team

1339
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:56,120
on this, which was, we're going to go through every drug we prescribe. And luckily, that's a very small

1340
02:18:56,120 --> 02:19:00,840
list for our practice because we don't have many patients and we really narrow the focus of the type

1341
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:04,200
of stuff we're working on. I mean, we're not the ones out there writing antibiotics and stuff

1342
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:11,320
routinely, but that's still a list of probably 30 drugs. For every one of those drugs, I need to know

1343
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:18,840
every single generic manufacturer. And then we need to do the full colonoscopy on everyone,

1344
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:24,200
according to publicly available information. Have there been any filings against these companies?

1345
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:29,800
Just do a quick Google search news or Google this name, FDA, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1346
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:34,680
Kind of go through that exercise. And I think this will take us three months to do. That's how

1347
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:41,720
miserable an exercise it's going to be. But what I hope emerges from this is a probabilistic heat map

1348
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:47,560
that basically says going forward, again, I don't think we can ever ensure with certainty, even with

1349
02:19:47,560 --> 02:19:52,360
the branded drugs. But the goal here is probabilistic. It's increased the odds in your favor

1350
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:59,720
that if you need resuvastatin, atorvastatin, pick your favorite generic anything, hydrochlorothiazide,

1351
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:06,280
which one are you absolutely not touching? Where do we preferentially do it? Anything else you

1352
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:12,520
would recommend that I do as a physician or a patient do as they navigate this?

1353
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:19,080
So on my website, because I mean, let me just say since the book came out, I have been flooded with

1354
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:23,800
emails from patients who want to know, are their drugs safe? Where were they manufactured?

1355
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:27,080
By the way, just the thought of that is to me personally, like,

1356
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:31,400
I can't imagine a bigger torture. I know when people listening to this know how much I hate

1357
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:36,200
email, I waste no opportunity to talk about how much I hate email. The only thing that I could

1358
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:43,160
hate more than email would be getting 1000 emails a day asking me to dig up the answer to a question

1359
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:48,520
like that. They're the only one sending you that email. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's impossible. I am

1360
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:54,840
inundated, but I also feel it's an obligation, but you need to use a system to solve this. You're

1361
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:58,920
not personally going to be the one that gives them the answer to their question.

1362
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:04,360
Right. So what I created on my website is a guide to investigating your own drugs,

1363
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:10,360
which is basically like, okay, what are patients going to do? Now we need new laws. I mean, you

1364
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:15,720
shouldn't have to be Sherlock Holmes for your own drugs, but basically it leads them step by step

1365
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:20,680
figure out who manufactured your drug. Is that readily available on the front of the bottle?

1366
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:25,960
It should because you don't often get the actual bottle from the manufacturer. You're almost

1367
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:32,760
always getting a bottle that's a plain, you know, whatever yellow or green bottle that has a sticker

1368
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:36,920
on it that the pharmacy puts on. Does that sticker usually contain the generic company's name?

1369
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:42,120
It varies from state to state. I mean, there are different disclosing requirements and it should,

1370
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:47,320
but I mean, if you're not getting that information on dispensing label, you need to ask your pharmacist

1371
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:52,680
who's the manufacturer. And when I go to a pharmacy or actually before I even go and pick

1372
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:59,080
up a prescription, I ask who's the manufacturer? Who else makes it? I mean, I switch all the time

1373
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:02,520
from one generic to another. Is the pharmacy willing to do this without your physician's

1374
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:08,360
intervention? Yes, because I go to an independent pharmacy, but I think, you know, if you're in

1375
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:14,920
express scripts, if you're CVS, I think it's harder. I think for the big chain pharmacies,

1376
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:20,040
it's harder. Yeah. The PBMs I contemplated in the last couple of days, whether I wanted to go down

1377
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:24,600
the PBM rabbit hole with you. And I hope you'll be okay with the fact that I have decided not to.

1378
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:30,840
That's fine. I think it's too big a topic. Do you want to say two sentences about it so people would

1379
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:37,160
understand why Caremark or CVS or express scripts are going to be harder to navigate in as much as

1380
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:42,040
it offers them any hope? I mean, is it worth, are we just opening up a can of worms? That's way too

1381
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:47,800
complicated. I mean, I can basically say that I think the optimal thing is to go to a brick and

1382
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:54,600
mortar pharmacy and have an exchange with a human being. I mean, that is ideal. I mean, pharmacists,

1383
02:22:55,320 --> 02:23:00,360
some don't really know about this issue, but some know a lot. I mean, I've gotten a lot of mail from

1384
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:06,120
pharmacists saying like, I've been hearing this for years from my patients, that this drug didn't

1385
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:11,080
work or that. I mean, you can have a dialogue with your pharmacist about it. Okay. Is GoodRX,

1386
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:15,800
the app on your site, do you let patients know about that? No, I don't even know about it. So

1387
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:21,720
GoodRX, a really, really brilliant app that allows you to at least price compare them. And that

1388
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:26,280
is a way that you can, if you decide you want to go down this route of being brick and mortar,

1389
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:29,800
you can basically price shop. And it's really interesting. Like if I didn't have my phone on

1390
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:34,280
airplane mode right now and wasn't worried about it buzzing nonstop, I'd turn it on and show you.

1391
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:39,320
Sitting right here right now, I would just type in a Torvastatin. It would say select your dose,

1392
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:44,920
10 milligrams, use current location, right? It's got the GPS. I can tell it the zip code.

1393
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:53,880
And it will in a radius of ascending order, tell me the price for 30, 10 milligram of Torvastatin's

1394
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:59,880
cash pay by pharmacy. And you'd like to think they're all the same, aren't they? Not even close.

1395
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:06,760
So that you couple that with your analysis and you at least can get into the situation where

1396
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:11,320
you walk in and you could know your maximum out of pocket. And by the way, there's still a good

1397
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:14,200
chance your insurance company will cover it because typically the insurance company is just

1398
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:18,040
differentiating between the generic and the branded. They're not going to, at least until

1399
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:21,960
you tell me different, I assume they're not going to fiddle between two different generics if you

1400
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:25,880
specify one versus the other, are they? Right. But the problem with the price

1401
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:35,240
is that often the drugstore chains will be dispensing the lowest cost generics, which may

1402
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:40,760
be the worst manufacturers in India. Do drugstores typically carry more than one generic?

1403
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:47,400
Well, they often can order one generic or another one from their wholesalers because they're ordering

1404
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:51,880
from, you know, Cardinal and Amerisource, Bergen and McKesson. I have a feeling I know how this

1405
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:57,160
is going to work for our patients. What I suspect we will end up doing is partnering with one brick

1406
02:24:57,160 --> 02:25:03,000
and mortar pharmacy and saying, we will make you our exclusive partner on this and in exchange for

1407
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:09,640
it, you will do exactly what the F we say, which means you are absolutely under no circumstance

1408
02:25:09,640 --> 02:25:15,160
selling us anything other than XYZ do do do do do do do do do do do do. And we will never think about

1409
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:20,760
this again. And all of our patients will mail order from that pharmacy directly to them. But

1410
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:28,120
that's I don't know that doctors will have the time to do that. Or I mean, I don't know. This is

1411
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:35,160
you hit the nail on the head, which is on some layer, the patients need to put pressure on the

1412
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:41,880
payers, which is both the insurance company indirectly through the PBM and Medicare. And

1413
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:47,720
because patients, I don't think individually or even frankly, collectively outside of this,

1414
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:54,760
have the ability to pressure the FDA and or the drug manufacturers. But the payers certainly can.

1415
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:59,080
I mean, if the payers decide we are not reimbursing you wholesale as a company

1416
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:03,720
until you get your act together. Well, that should be a sign to fix things, right?

1417
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:11,240
Well, let's take this one step further. Imagine if there was a pharmacy chain that said, you know

1418
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:17,480
what, we're going to test every drug that we dispense, not every pill, right, but do a random

1419
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:22,440
sampling, do a random sampling, which is what should be happening by the way, like could any

1420
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:25,640
of them afford to do this or would they do this unless there was a big enough error that

1421
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:29,880
and big enough issue that this could become a differentiating sales factor? Well, okay. So

1422
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:35,960
there's this small pharmacy called Vala sure. And that's what they do. That's their business model.

1423
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:40,680
Where are they based? So they're based in New Haven, Connecticut. And that is their business

1424
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:49,240
model, which is that they test every drug. How do you spell that? V A L I S U R E. And presumably

1425
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:52,760
they can sell across state lines. They're a mail order pharmacy. They're a mail order pharmacy.

1426
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:57,000
They're a mail order pharmacy. Yeah. Got it. So here's something very interesting, which is

1427
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:03,080
with the recall of these blood pressure medications that were found to have this carcinogen and

1428
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:09,880
N D M a, which is actually created in the production of liquid rocket fuel. And that is bad for you.

1429
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:14,360
Which makes you wonder what on earth were these doing? Anyway, I'm sure there's some reasonable

1430
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:18,920
reason why these things could have been in. Well, one of the questions that the FDA has been

1431
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:24,760
investigating is whether they were reusing solvents. Ah, yeah, that would make sense. Anyway,

1432
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:33,000
so the FDA detected three different carcinogens in these drugs. Vala sure through their testing

1433
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:39,000
identified a fourth. That is not very reassuring. I mean, it's great that they found one, but like,

1434
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:44,200
why didn't the FDA find this and why didn't the FDA find it? How does Vala sure afford to do this?

1435
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:48,680
Are they that large a mail order pharmacy? Well, right now they've got funding. I mean,

1436
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:52,760
they're a startup. Oh, I see. Okay. Got it. So this is all baked into the business model.

1437
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:57,000
The business plan. What's interesting about this, just to go take a small tangent,

1438
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:03,320
the FDA does these pre announced inspections overseas and their inspector went to one of

1439
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:13,720
these plants in China. This camera, it's Zhejiang Huahai plant. And the investigator found that the

1440
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:22,120
company was not investigating impurity spikes in its own drugs as required. So the inspector

1441
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:27,880
recommended that this plant be sanctioned as official action indicated like the most serious,

1442
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:33,480
which would have forced them to take action. Back in Maryland, FDA officials said, it's okay.

1443
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:39,560
Voluntary action indicated not such a big deal. One year later, this plant is in the middle of this

1444
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:46,840
worldwide recall of drugs because there are impurities in the drugs. So the FDA actually

1445
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:52,520
found this, did nothing about it. And now here we are. It's not a positive story.

1446
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:56,200
I'll go back to the question I posed a long time ago that I told you I'd come back to,

1447
02:28:56,200 --> 02:29:01,000
which I've been thinking about a lot only again, for the purpose of like, sometimes history just

1448
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:09,240
offers us insight. If it were the Hatch-Waxman-Eban Act of 1982 or whatever, and you have the advantage

1449
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:14,600
of being transported back in time, knowing everything you know today, how would you amend

1450
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:22,600
that act to reduce the probability of this? So the key thing would be to reform the first to file

1451
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:29,800
deal sweetener. And it has been reformed since then because now it's not which minute you file,

1452
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:35,880
but which day you file, which means a lot of these generic companies are all filing on the same day

1453
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:41,560
and sharing the exclusivity, which takes a little bit of heat out of the market, gets rid of that

1454
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:47,000
sort of Lord of the Flies environment in the parking lot that we talked about. But I think

1455
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:53,080
the biggest reform wouldn't necessarily be to the Hatch-Waxman Act. It would be to the FDA.

1456
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,360
In terms of authority?

1457
02:29:54,360 --> 02:30:00,520
First of all, overhauling their foreign inspection program. I mean, my God, a pre-announced

1458
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:06,360
inspection? Does that solve anything for anybody except for the drug companies? Why give a plan

1459
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:11,000
eight weeks advance notice that you're coming and then ask them to plan the trip for you?

1460
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:17,080
I mean, you could argue that Peter Baker found a way around it. In other words, it's probably less

1461
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:22,680
about the regs around the inspection and more about the chops of the inspectors. Although in

1462
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:25,000
an ideal world, you want both of those on your side.

1463
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,200
That's a huge part of it.

1464
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,440
How do you get more Peter Bakers at the FDA?

1465
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:34,360
Well, Peter Baker proposed that very thing. He said, let me run a training program and train

1466
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:40,600
all of the inspectors to do these kinds of inspections. And they sidelined him. I mean,

1467
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:48,680
he was basically taken off of inspections and he left. He left the FDA. He's no longer there.

1468
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:56,360
He was passionate about what he did. So there is, I mean, the book really exposes to some extent

1469
02:30:56,360 --> 02:31:00,680
that the FDA does not really want to know what's going on in these plants.

1470
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:07,400
This has the sad ending of a Michael Lewis story, you know, where you have some conclusion,

1471
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:13,320
but then there's a realization that you haven't really solved the problem. Like mortgage-backed

1472
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:17,720
securities still kind of suck and there are still a whole bunch of these sort of crappy

1473
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:23,160
credit default swaps out there. And oh, by the way, we haven't really reformed lending as much

1474
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:28,520
as we'd like to think we have. And oh, and by the way, nobody really got spanked for the

1475
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:33,720
egregious mistakes that, you know, got made. And I had a different idea, by the way, on that,

1476
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:40,600
on sort of a disruptive idea around the regulation of this. I think part of this could be addressed

1477
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:45,240
by doing something, a derivative of the following. So it wouldn't be this, because this is just the

1478
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:51,240
first dumb idea that I have. If you extended the protection for the primary drug maker,

1479
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:56,200
so the branded drug currently has whatever, it's 20 years and it's complicated because

1480
02:31:56,200 --> 02:32:00,760
that's from the first patent filing. There's different patents, but you basically say,

1481
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:06,280
look, you will have longer to sell this drug exclusively, but in exchange for that,

1482
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:13,000
you are now transferring all of the know-how to the generics. So we're basically, you could make

1483
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:18,280
it such that the NPV is the same to them. You will make the same amount of money on this drug.

1484
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:25,240
We will delay the time the generics can come in, but basically the generics now have nothing to do

1485
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:31,320
except assume full manufacturing and production capacity. In other words, the Act of 82 said you

1486
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:34,760
don't have to do clinical trials anymore. We're now basically saying you don't have to reverse

1487
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:42,040
engineer anymore. It's an interesting idea. So there is a kind of generic that is somewhat like

1488
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:47,560
that. It's called an authorized generic. So that's one of the things that's in my guide to investigating

1489
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:52,760
your own drugs, which is that brand companies, because they don't want to let go of all their

1490
02:32:52,760 --> 02:32:57,320
market share necessarily in all their profits, what they'll do is they'll partner with a generic

1491
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:04,520
company. They'll authorize that generic company to make the generic and they will transfer their

1492
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:11,000
recipe. And with that, does the FDA grant that other generic producer exclusivity for a period

1493
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:17,000
of time in exchange for that? No, not at all. So what is the advantage? Why is the main company

1494
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:21,560
transferring basically giving that one generic producer such a head start? They make money off.

1495
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:25,880
They can make money off of it. They still retain a piece of it basically through some sort of

1496
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:30,200
licensing agreement. Okay. So that's even a more elegant way than what I said. What I said, that's

1497
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:33,720
actually just a smarter way to make that happen. I mean, maybe that just becomes the way to do it.

1498
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:39,400
There are only basically authorized generics where the parent company still shares some of the rent

1499
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:45,000
and in exchange for that, they guarantee. And you know what? You want to go really draconian on those

1500
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:51,400
guys. By the way, you're on the hook to determine the authenticity of the product. So bring it all

1501
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:55,720
the way back to the parent company. So you're going to get paid more money, but now you have

1502
02:33:55,720 --> 02:34:03,080
more responsibility. If your authenticated generic producer goes rogue, you're paying for it. So don't

1503
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:09,000
have the FDA exclusively be the one that has to police them. Have them all policed from the parent.

1504
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:14,600
It's another way of saying, look, it would be great if we could catch every drunk driving

1505
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:19,480
teenager out there. And yeah, we could put more cops on the street and we could give them more

1506
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:24,360
tools and more breathalyzers, but wouldn't it be great if every parent was policing their own

1507
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:28,760
16 year old as well? It's a belt and suspenders approach. So maybe that's part of the answer.

1508
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:35,320
Interesting. That's possible. I mean, at the moment, who knows what is possible? I mean,

1509
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:42,600
we can't come to any agreement over drug pricing. Every seeming approach has failed.

1510
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:48,280
Brand name drug prices continue to rise. I mean, it's just our drug supply is really in a free

1511
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:54,120
fall. We've got drug shortages. There's no incentive for quality here. And a lot of these

1512
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:58,440
companies are really getting away with it. You know, FDA investigators are walking into these

1513
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:05,720
plants finding egregious conditions and the FDA is downgrading their findings. So it's hard to say

1514
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:12,360
what can practically be made to happen. But I do think Congress for whatever it's worth is

1515
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:18,600
looking into it. I mean, it is sad because so many problems, the people that have the means,

1516
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:23,640
both educational and financial will be OK. Like I'm not worried about me and my family or you

1517
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:29,400
because we have the knowledge. We can take the time to do it. And by the way, in a moment,

1518
02:35:29,400 --> 02:35:33,880
if we have to, we're willing to pay more and we have the disposable income to do that.

1519
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:38,280
There are a lot of people for whom that's not true. They simply don't have the time. They don't have

1520
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:43,640
the knowledge. They don't have the extra income to do that. And those people will disproportionately

1521
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:47,160
suffer here. And those are really if you really start to think about it, I mean, that's the

1522
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:53,320
four alarm fire for Congress. Congress exists first and foremost to make sure that it's that

1523
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:58,920
floor that doesn't fall any lower. We can sort of talk about the ceiling. And I didn't realize

1524
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:03,880
that you had put together sort of a tool on your site to make this easier because I do think that

1525
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:07,800
in the short run, the we can't wait for Congress to solve this. I mean, I think we're just going

1526
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:12,600
to individually have to take ownership over this to some extent. It's important for patients to

1527
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:18,120
realize most patients if they go to a pharmacy, they get dispensed drugs. They don't think about

1528
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:22,600
who makes it. They don't even think about it. I mean, they may be switched from a brand to generic,

1529
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:27,320
not realize it. They may be switched between generics. They don't realize it. I've never

1530
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:32,360
personally paid attention to this until a couple of years ago when I started noticing this funny

1531
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:37,000
business with the Rizuvastatin. And if I'm not paying attention to this, who is? How could I

1532
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,200
possibly expect anyone else to? Right. I mean, most people don't pay attention to it because

1533
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:47,400
the FDA has told us that it's all equivalent. There's nothing to pay attention to. They've got it.

1534
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:51,320
There's no difference between brand and generic, generic and generic. It's all the same.

1535
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:56,920
So the first step is for everybody to pay attention to who's making the drug and how it works.

1536
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:01,800
Well, Catherine, we're going to link really heavily to your work and your site, a number of

1537
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:10,840
other things. If you decide to release the beautiful 24 page self-assessment report document,

1538
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:17,160
the most innocuous title to a document in the history of corporate espionage, we would love

1539
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:21,640
to host it. Like I said, I think they're a great compendium to this interview. Is there anything

1540
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:25,400
I didn't ask you that you've wanted to talk about? We joked about this off Mike at the beginning.

1541
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:28,840
You know, I said to you when you walked in, I said, don't worry. This is not a 20 minute

1542
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:32,520
interview with sound bites and stuff. We can talk about this stuff in as much detail as you

1543
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:36,760
want. But I want to be sure we've talked about everything you want to talk about. And we didn't

1544
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:42,920
leave anything on the table. I think we've basically covered it, but just sort of my closing

1545
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:50,040
thought is that generics are supposed to be this great leveler. You know, it's like the democratization

1546
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:57,640
of drugs that like the rich and the poor alike can have access to these great cures. And to find out,

1547
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:06,440
I think that the companies sort of cashing in on that image are really selling that short in a very

1548
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:15,400
devious way is painful to realize. It's a real sort of great hope, public health hope that has a very

1549
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:24,440
dark underbelly. Well, I think I and the listeners now probably have a better sense of why even Sam

1550
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:31,400
Harris could become angry, which says that anger is not always a bad thing. And you've probably

1551
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:36,040
taken a lot of your own anger and rage and channeled it into something incredibly productive.

1552
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:41,320
I gather that you're still quite involved. I mean, based on what you've said, I mean,

1553
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:47,000
you're still involved in seeing that attention is brought to this topic specifically. Are you

1554
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:53,480
spending much time in D.C.? I have been talking to Congress and I think they are. I can't say that

1555
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:58,280
they're gearing up to get results, but they're gearing up to look into it. Catherine, where can

1556
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:04,360
people follow you on social media? Yep. So on Twitter where I'm pretty active, it's at Catherine

1557
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:12,280
Eban. My website is CatherineEban.com. LinkedIn, I think is Catherine Eban. So I see a theme here.

1558
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:19,320
I don't know what it is, but I see a pattern. And I will say that my 12 year old is my Instagram

1559
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:24,840
page manager. So you'll have to bear with me there. Hello, Kitty. By the way, that makes me want

1560
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:29,240
Olivia, my daughter to manage my Instagram page. Yeah, it's the way to go. I'm telling you. I would

1561
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:33,960
take so much time off my hand. Absolutely. Catherine, it's been an absolute pleasure.

1562
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:41,000
I thank you first for taking the time to come here. I can only imagine how mind numbing it must

1563
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:45,320
feel to talk about the same thing over and over again with yet another stupid person interviewing

1564
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:50,840
you. I hope this wasn't that painful, but more broadly, thank you for this incredible work you've

1565
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:55,560
done and the public good that I believe will come from it in the long run. Thank you so much. And

1566
02:39:55,560 --> 02:40:00,920
it was not at all tedious. It was super fun. Awesome. And you got to go through a few Topo
