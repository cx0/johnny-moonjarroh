00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,840
today's episode. Welcome back to another special episode of the Drive focusing on COVID-19. My

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,600
guest today is Dr. Michael Osterholm. You may have seen Michael on the Joe Rogan podcast a few

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
weeks ago. I saw him then and was immediately impressed, reached out to him and asked if he'd

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,600
like to come on our show, which he graciously agreed to. Michael is the director of the Center

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,320
for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. He's also the author of

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,880
a book that in many ways foreshadowed this. The book is called Deadliest Enemy, Our War Against

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,680
Deadly Germs. And in that book in particular, he foreshadows a lot of what we're going through

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,280
today. Mike and I in this discussion talk about everything from our best understanding of what's

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,520
happening in the United States with respect to the spread and the slowing of the virus,

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,440
what he's optimistic about, what he's pessimistic about, what he thinks the end state looks like,

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,320
and what you'd have to believe is true if that is to be altered. We also get into the weeds a little

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,480
bit on some technical things around supply chain limitations with respect to drugs, with respect to

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,320
masks, with respect to vaccines. There are a number of things we discuss. And again, I think just for

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,160
the purpose of simplicity, rather than get into a laundry list of everything we talk about, I think

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,280
if you're, if you've got this far, you're probably interested in hearing it. So without further delay,

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,000
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Michael Osterholm.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Mike, thank you so much for making time to sit down with us for some time today. And again,

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,400
I want to thank you because I just know that you are constantly being bombarded by requests. And

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,080
there's sort of a challenge you have to deal with, which is on the one hand, you want to be able to

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,240
do your job, but on the other hand, it's somewhat important for people like you doing your job to

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,000
be able to communicate with the rest of us what you're seeing and more importantly, what the

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,080
implications are and what can be done about it. Well, thank you very much, Peter. It's very good

31
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,040
to be with you. And I think that it's venues like yours that serve a very important role in getting

32
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,320
information out today. Far too much of what we deal with is in sound bites. It's in three minute

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:04,000
segments. And I think that's really hard to convey the complexities and the overall short term,

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,040
long term view of what's happening here. So I'm really pleased to be with you. Thank you.

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,760
Well, yeah, you're in the right spot. We're not fans of sound bites here. So we'll get right to

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,080
it and we'll get deep. So let's start with kind of the 30,000 foot view, which is when we sit here

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,080
today recording this on March 30th, it feels like an eternity ago that you were on Joe Rogan's

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,760
podcast doing what I thought was just an excellent job of giving Joe and Joe's audience an overview

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,080
of what we knew at the time, what we didn't know at the time, what the concerns were. What

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,200
do you feel more optimistic about relative to that time, which has probably been three weeks? What do

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,880
you feel less optimistic about? Well, first of all, I think that it's important to understand,

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,040
Lewis Carroll once said, if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. And I

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,280
think that one of the things that I've been very concerned about is we don't really know where we're

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,680
going. And that's not because the virus hasn't given us lots of clues. Just very briefly to take

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,120
a step back, just to remind everybody where we've been, we've been following this situation very

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,800
closely since the end of December last year. I have been very actively involved. I was involved

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,680
with the SARS investigation in 2003, very involved with MERS on the Moravian Peninsula, and have

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,960
obviously done a lot of work and influence the pandemic preparedness and planning. And so when

49
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,280
this first happened, and we saw these cases in Wuhan, it was really to us, oh my, here comes another

50
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,680
SARS or MERS-like experience, which actually, in retrospect, those were the easy ones because

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,240
patients were not becoming highly infectious till the fifth or sixth day of illness. You could

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,320
identify them quickly, get them into appropriate isolation so you didn't infect others. And we

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
could follow up in their context. But it became very clear to us by the second week of January,

54
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,680
what was happening in Wuhan was not SARS and MERS. This was acting much more like an influenza

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,320
virus in terms of transmission dynamic, lots of spread very quickly. And so on January 20th,

56
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
we actually put a document out saying that this was going to be a worldwide pandemic, almost two

57
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,160
months before the WHO did. We were convinced we would see spread. On February 3rd, we put out an

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,640
additional document that said it would probably take until the end of February or early March

59
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,240
before we would see cases around the world in any meaningful way, because it just, the transmission

60
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,600
of this virus was such that we had a sense, even then, probably had an incubation period of about

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,080
five days from infection until the onset of symptoms. And that if it had an R-naught or the

62
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,480
number of people that you transmit on an average basis to of about 2 to 2.4, you go from 1 to 2 to

63
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:54,720
4 to 8 to 16 to 32. And knowing that the cases in China were largely about 80% were not seeking

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
medical care. They were sick, but it wasn't sufficient. We said, you know, it'll probably be

65
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,200
the end of February. Well, sure enough, it was. We also put out a document in mid-February saying

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,120
that when it did start to show up, it probably hit hotspots, metropolitan areas, because of number one,

67
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,680
that's where most of the transportation, communication of people from China to the

68
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,400
rest of the world would be. Second of all, that's where the population density was high enough so

69
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,760
that you would actually see this amplification. Sure enough, as you know now, that's exactly what

70
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,960
we've seen. So having said that, it seems that we kind of know what's going on here. And I'll say

71
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,880
right now, we're done with that. I don't know where this virus is going to go next in terms of

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,160
how long it'll be around. You can make assumptions of what we see within influenza. I think some of

73
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,800
those are helpful, but I don't think that they're necessarily definitive. People talk about

74
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,920
seasonality. I remind people all the time that we don't see that with the other two coronaviruses.

75
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,920
SARS was not seasonality just because it ended in June. It was a new situation where we first

76
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,640
understood we had a problem in February. It took us literally several months to figure out this

77
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,640
infectivity period, get people isolated, stop transmission, get palm civets out of the markets

78
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,240
of the Guangdong province, and then it ended it. If you look at MERS, and I've been there standing

79
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,120
outside of a hospital in Abu Dhabi, it was 110 degrees, and transmission was going on just fine,

80
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,760
thank you. It was not at all being halted by the weather, and because of course,

81
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,880
camels are not going to be put down as such, it just continues to transmit in the Arabian

82
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
Peninsula year-round, and our primary means of dealing with it is just making sure that

83
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,880
people don't transfer in the hospital setting. So if you take that, but also take influenza,

84
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,320
because this is where people come back on the seasonality piece, and they say, well,

85
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,520
it's probably going to be like influenza. We forget that while influenza transmits seasonally

86
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,960
in the winter of each northern and southern hemispheres, it transmits year-round in the

87
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,960
tropics, never stops transmitting. If you look at the last 10 influenza pandemics over the last 250

88
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
years, two started in the winter, three started in the spring, two started in the summer, and three

89
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,040
started in the fall. And every one of them had their big peak six months after the original

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:17,360
cases showed up. In 2009, with H1N1, it showed up in mid to late March, and we had a big peak

91
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,840
mid-September to mid-October, North America was still warm. So I don't know what it's going to

92
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,000
do going forward, but that's where when you ask me, good news, bad news, I have every reason to

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,560
believe that it won't stop transmitting in any meaningful way until we get 50 or 60 or 70% of

94
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,440
the population infected, which means that the bad news is that we are going to have to deal with

95
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,880
those cases unless we can suppress them. And we can talk about what the implications that are.

96
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,800
If we suppress them, meaning that we do what Wuhan did, and the Chinese in Wuhan did, of basically

97
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,320
shutting down everything in the most draconian manner we've ever seen in modern quarantine

98
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,400
history, that means we're going to shut down our country. We'll shut down the economy in any

99
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,200
meaningful way, and not just about dollars and cents. Who's going to pick up the garbage?

100
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Who's going to basically be fire and police? Who's going to do all the things that we count on?

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm pessimistic about the fact that we don't have an easy way out. I like to say that right now we

102
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
either suppress this and have this implication we talked about in a hope that we can suppress it

103
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,680
long enough until we get a vaccine, which I don't think will be any sooner than 18 months, or we let

104
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,200
it go willy-nilly, and we will bring down healthcare systems. Many thousands to millions of people will

105
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,840
die, and our healthcare systems will collapse, or we try to thread the rope through the needle and

106
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,080
hit the middle. How do we find a way to have those people who are at lowest risk of having serious

107
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,320
disease, problems, who are at the highest risk of dying be in our workforce, be more public,

108
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,200
and handle the issues? So if we can do that, that's good news. If we can't, the rest of us

109
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,480
pretty bad news. Mike, the numbers you just rattled off as sort of potential projections,

110
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,920
is that worldwide, or was that a domestic figure? That's in the United States. I mean, if you look

111
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,440
at, you know, do the math, and just a little over 300 million people, if you're talking about 60%

112
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,000
of those infected, you're talking 170 to 175 million people. If you talk about 80% of those

113
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,920
having relatively milder illness, now you're talking 20% that are going to have some illness

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,360
that will likely require hospitalization. If you then take that down to even one or two percent

115
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,320
of those who might die, you can just do the simple math, and you realize we're talking about millions.

116
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,440
And that's what I don't think people understand yet, is that this virus is going to keep going. It

117
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,880
is very much like an influenza virus in that regard. It will go until it finds enough immune

118
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,680
people that shut it down, meaning they don't let transmission continue. And that's what I don't

119
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,440
think people are prepared to understand yet, is that they think that these waves are going to

120
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,920
happen over the next two to three weeks, and then we're done. Just remind people that right now in

121
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,640
China, here we are, the end of March, this clearly was present in China in mid to late November.

122
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,280
And we're still seeing transmission inside in China, even with these draconian measures to limit

123
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,000
transmission. There are people in the Wuhan area who've not been out of their house in 15 weeks,

124
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,360
and yet we still see cases occurring. So this is going to happen here, where it'll be months and

125
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,640
months potentially of transmission. And I hate to thought of the fact that one of the primary

126
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,200
ways that we limit that transmission is just enough people get infected and develop immunity.

127
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,560
I might add one good news piece on the immunity piece, this is an important one. I think we can

128
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,080
say with more certainty that there probably is durable immunity, at least for the short term.

129
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,200
And what I mean by that is there was a study completed and published last week using macaque

130
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,800
monkeys. And they infected a group of them with the virus. They all came down with kind of the

131
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,640
classic coronavirus-like illness. They then waited until they fully recovered. They re-challenged

132
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,200
them a month later, and all of them were protected against unrechallenged. None of them got infected

133
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,800
again. And just to make sure I know what the re-challenge implied, were they PCR-negative,

134
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,720
IgG-positive, IgM-negative? Yes, they were. I can't say they're IgM-negative. I'd have to go

135
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,040
back and look at that. But they were definitely IgG-positive and PCR-negative. Yep. And so we have

136
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,000
evidence clearly, and they didn't just do PCR, they did culture too. So they actually were actually

137
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,880
looking for the actual virus. In other words, they weren't just looking for surface protein.

138
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,840
No, no, exactly. And so I think this study really gave us more hope that there really is

139
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,080
durable immunity, at least in the short term. I can't say it's going to be years and years.

140
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,400
I know that if you have short term immunity, oftentimes that bodes well for a long term

141
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,920
immunity picture. So that's actually an important positive step that these are going to be people

142
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,800
who will be, as I call, kind of the human immunologic rods in the virus reaction. They

143
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,120
will slow it down. And today they could be the people that could be out there in the world,

144
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,640
not worried about getting infected, and also would not infect others.

145
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, I was having a discussion with one of the members of my team today, and anyone who's ever

146
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,640
worked with me knows I play this game called the What You Have To Believe game, which is sort of a

147
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:20,080
way to probe the limits of what biology could tell us. So we got a little deep in the weeds on this,

148
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,720
and I said, look, imagine for a moment two extreme scenarios. Scenario one is this particular

149
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,880
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a total nothing burger. It's just another respiratory virus.

150
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,280
It's getting a lot of attention right now, but the reality of it is when it all plays out and

151
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,480
everybody gets infected, it's going to have a mortality that's equal to or less than influenza,

152
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,320
et cetera, et cetera. If that is true, how would you explain the current data through that paradigm?

153
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,640
And we walk through it. But at the other end of the spectrum, I said, what if it's worse? What if

154
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,280
it's the virus that could wipe our civilization off the map? Again, I don't think either of these

155
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,480
extremes are correct, but it became a good illustration of what would have to be true.

156
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,560
What do you have to believe if SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 will eradicate our species? Well,

157
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,760
you'd have to believe the following. One, there is no long-term immunity. Two, each successive

158
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,840
infection is worse than the previous one. And three, no effective treatments will be developed.

159
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,680
If those three things are true, this would be the virus that eradicates our species.

160
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,000
Fortunately, I don't believe any of those are true. And you're making a very compelling case

161
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,400
for at least the first of those not being true. And by the way, they would all have to be true

162
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,640
for the scenario I just described. So I take that as some good news. I do want to ask, I mean,

163
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,040
it literally just came out, I think, 20 minutes ago. Did you happen to see that Lancet paper that

164
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,040
came out going over the revised numbers in China in terms of case fatality?

165
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,120
I have not seen that one. I have seen a similar one, but help me. Maybe it is the same one I've

166
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,720
seen. Well, so this one basically took the original case fatality rate of 1.38%, but followed it up

167
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,280
and added a whole bunch of more people to the denominator that were previously in the

168
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,680
unconfirmed bucket. So you took a bunch of people that were unconfirmed, you've now gone on to

169
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:20,960
confirm them. And the case fatality rate now looks to be 0.66%. Again, largely on the basis of not

170
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,480
subtracting mortality, but adding denominators. Does that surprise you? And what do you think the

171
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:37,120
CFR looks like if one could truly measure all the people that are in that category of having an

172
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
infection, but not being either clinically significant enough to warrant detention or

173
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,040
simply falling through the cracks due to socioeconomic factors, testing, limitations, et cetera?

174
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,120
Yeah. Let me take two pieces of information and go at that. First one is you're absolutely

175
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,520
correct. It's a numerator denominator issue. Now the challenge I think in adding to the denominator

176
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,080
is that you can add quite a bit to that and drive the overall case fatality rate or CFR down.

177
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,760
But what we're also missing is the number of people in the numerator. And our contacts in Wuhan

178
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,760
during that time period who were pretty reliable actually concluded in their assessment that

179
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,440
probably six to eight people were dying every day outside a hospital that were not being counted,

180
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,200
meaning that they were not being tested. And if you weren't tested, you weren't counted.

181
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,640
And so think about this. If you have a case fatality rate of 1%, 1 over 100, and you suddenly add

182
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,200
100 more people to that, you now have a case fatality rate of 0.5 per 100, okay, half of what it was.

183
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,440
On the other hand, if you have that same 200, you added 100 more, doubled it. But you also add 10

184
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,320
more people who died who weren't counted, only 10. Now you're looking at 11 over 200, and you're now

185
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,720
at 5% plus. So the numerator is actually more sensitive in terms of impacting the rate than

186
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,800
is the denominator. And so one of the challenges that we've had is what is that overall numerator

187
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,400
and how many cases were missed? These have been well written up, these cases. So I don't know what

188
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,320
it is, but let me tell you what I think is important now. We've known this, I think from early on in

189
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,840
China, that these comorbidities we talk about, this other underlying conditions play a very important

190
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,440
role. We've known about that with influenza for years, that comorbidities can affect you in several

191
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,440
ways. One, of course, is the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in the

192
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
cytokine storm picture. In some cases, there appears to be kind of a myocarditis type picture

193
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,800
that can occur. And of course, there's always secondary bacterial pneumonias, but I'm not even

194
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,760
going to count those in there because that in a sense is something we can often deal with with

195
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,480
antibiotics. But what happened in China was, is if you look at the overall case fatality rate by age,

196
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:13,280
we saw this exorbitant rate in those over age 65 who are male. Well, if you look closely in China,

197
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:21,520
almost 70% of men over age 65 smoke, and less than 2% of women over that same age group. So right

198
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,480
there, you could have an impact on that situation because smoking has always been associated with

199
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,880
worse outcome with these kind of viruses. And ironically, the other risk factors,

200
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,000
essential hypertension was also seen as a risk factor for bad outcome. But beyond that,

201
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,200
there wasn't much else. Obesity, which has been highly associated with bad outcomes,

202
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,720
is actually quite rare in the older population of China. It's primarily under age 30, where there

203
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,360
are starting to see a real epidemic there. Well, okay, let's fast forward to the United States.

204
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,120
We're now getting data out of New York. We're seeing an increased number of severe illnesses

205
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,880
and deaths in people between the ages of 25 and 50. And almost to a T, the risk factor appears to

206
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,160
be obesity. 45% of our population over age 50 is considered moderate to severely obese today.

207
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,520
Just that one risk factor. On top of that, renal disease has been shown in the past to be

208
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,200
associated with bad outcomes. 700,000 Americans are living alive today with in-stage renal disease.

209
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,840
And when you start adding up all these comorbidities that we uniquely have, in part because of lifestyle

210
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,920
or because we happen to have a healthcare system that's able to keep us alive and with the right

211
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,880
drugs and so forth. So we don't really know when you put this virus here, what it's going to do.

212
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,960
A good example of that is the difference between Korea and Italy. Korea right now has actually just

213
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,680
climbed over 1%. It had been below that. And part of that was a function is the big outbreak that

214
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,680
they initially had that they worked up extensively in the thousands of people within this religious

215
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,240
sector. The median age of that group was 43. So, you know, right there you had a younger population

216
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,760
that surely would have had a lower case fatality rate. You go to Italy and right now about 80% of

217
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,320
their cases are over age 80 with underlying health problems. And they have an 8% case fatality rate.

218
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,480
So I think that one of the things we're going to find with case fatality is going to be really

219
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,080
country by country dependent. It's going to matter where the virus is circulating and what age group.

220
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,640
And it's going to matter in a large part as to what the underlying health conditions are.

221
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,840
In China, there's almost nothing ever called a nursing home or long-term care facility. People

222
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,960
cared for in the home. In the United States right now, we're sitting in a powder keg long-term care

223
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,160
facility for which for years we've neglected them in terms of infection control. I can't tell you how

224
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,720
many long-term care facilities we have right here in Minnesota, they couldn't find one in a 95 in

225
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,280
their house that they needed to. Not one in 95. I think that we actually stand the risk over the

226
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,200
course of the next several months. I've seen it probably one of the highest case fatality rates

227
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,400
in the world right here. That's the first point of what I would say. The second part though,

228
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,640
you deal with this every day, every flu season you are constantly confronted with this increased

229
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:29,280
occurrence of illnesses, et cetera. And even during the 2009 H1N1 situation, even in a bad H3N2 year

230
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,800
in older people, nobody, nobody reports what's happening, what's happening now in places like

231
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:44,480
New York and Detroit and Atlanta and Seattle. And so I think that what's happening here actually

232
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,600
matches up with the severity that we believe it really is occurring. I've come to the point in my

233
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,400
old age that when something walks like a duck, looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I think

234
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,680
it's probably a duck. What would you put on the floor as the estimate for the CFR in a fully

235
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,440
diluted sample? Do you think that there's a scenario under which the CFR is 0.1%? Again,

236
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,520
fully diluted, meaning you actually know all the infected people, or do you think that that's

237
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,840
really just a pipe dream and the best case scenario is closer to 0.4, 0.5?

238
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:23,200
That's a pipe dream to me. And I think it's going to be in the one to 2.5 range. And I think that

239
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,040
it's going to be heavily influenced by those who are over age 65, 70. And I think it's going to be

240
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,680
influenced by the frequency of obesity in the younger age group in that regard.

241
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,160
Mike, I've never wanted someone to be wrong more than I want you to be wrong, because if the CFR

242
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:49,360
is 1% to 2% in the United States, and you're right about the spread of this virus, the implication

243
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,120
of that is more Americans will die from this infection in the next 12 months than will die

244
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,280
of all other causes combined. And I am absolutely on your side with this one. You will get no

245
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,120
argument for me. I hope I'm wrong. I would welcome that opportunity to be wrong. I just look at what's

246
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,480
happening right now. I look at indirect indicators. A good example right now, today, the New York

247
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,840
Police Department reported out over 900 police officers in New York are infected right now.

248
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,320
13% of the workforce is out. They just had their third death today in police officers.

249
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,760
And when you start looking at that, and this is just getting started, when you start looking at

250
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,720
that and compare that to a bad flu season, which you and I have to deal with far too often,

251
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,360
with a vaccine on top of it, by the way, and we know what happens, look at this one. This one

252
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,920
has that potential, I think, to be in the one to two. I don't think this at all is going to be like

253
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:54,240
1918 because that was so unique in how it took out 18 to 30-year-olds. This one's not doing that.

254
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,440
This is going to clearly be associated with age and underlying health issues. But in some ways,

255
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,040
we are a population that is highly vulnerable because of all the other lifestyle and health

256
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,920
conditions that occur in our group. So I think that that's where I'm very concerned about it

257
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,360
and would agree with you 100% of what you just said. And I'd just say, on a given week in New

258
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:26,480
York City, in the past, 100 people die a day in New York. Right now, we're averaging close to 150

259
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:34,240
a day just dying from COVID-19. Think about that. If we're going to play that what if game a moment

260
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:43,360
ago, what if this is something that is, quote unquote, only going to result in fewer than 100,000

261
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,480
lives lost in the United States, which again, still seems for most people struggling to

262
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,480
understand what non-linearity means. We're a little over 2,000 deaths today. So even to propose that

263
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,360
this could be capped at 100,000 seems very extreme. But I think you would agree that if only

264
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,400
100,000 Americans were to die before this thing was completely contained, you would consider that

265
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,040
a victory. Absolutely. What has to be true for that to happen? What are the things that have

266
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,360
to happen scientifically, policy-wise, in terms of personal behavior responsibility? What are the

267
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
suite of things that must be true if that number is to stay below 100,000 in the next year?

268
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,680
I think two things. One is we have to basically suppress transmission as much as we can,

269
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,880
which I don't think is doable. And I say that because it would mean a Wuhan-like shutdown.

270
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,880
And I just don't think as a country we can sustain that. I think even, and I don't want to equate

271
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,160
this in dollars and cents. I had an op-ed piece in the New York Times over the weekend, which I

272
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,520
said this is not a choice between saving lives and costing the economy. We have to look at it's a

273
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,560
combination of both. And we need people to carry on every day. I mean, I look at you. I mean, I

274
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,720
don't want anything to happen to you for a lot of reasons, but one of them is you're a very key

275
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,840
healthcare provider. You got to do your job. You can't shut down. We can't shut down. I mean,

276
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,320
when's the last time you saw anybody do remote work to pick up garbage? If you live in New York

277
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,720
City, guess what? Elevator operators, maintenance people are really important because if you can't

278
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,680
get up to the 40th floor, you shut down a part of the city that's really important. So I could go

279
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,240
through a laundry list of whether it's foods, people who provide our food, et cetera. So we've

280
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,520
got to preserve that part of it. But at the same time, I worry that what's going to happen is an

281
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,440
acceleration of deaths due to the failing of the healthcare system. Right now, keeping people alive

282
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,600
on ventilators, having intensive care medicine does make a difference. Not for every case,

283
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,280
but it makes a difference. But once you go off the edge of the cliff, where it's now no longer,

284
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,680
do you have a ventilator available? We have to wait for someone to go off a vent and you have to

285
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,320
make a choice to take them off. When you start running out of the critical supplies, one of the

286
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,920
things that we've been working on in our center for the last year and a half has been looking at

287
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,280
very acute critical drug shortages, meaning these are drugs that you need right now or in the next

288
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,680
several hours where people die. What's on the crash cart? What's in the intensive care unit? What's in

289
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,920
the ER? We came up with a list of 156 drugs, which we have vetted with all the major medical groups,

290
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:31,120
the intensivists, etc. Of these 156, all of them are generic. Of those, almost 85% are made outside

291
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,920
the United States. And of those, many of them are made in China. We are just beginning to feel

292
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,880
the severe supply chain collision that's going to occur here in the next several weeks with increased

293
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,120
number of cases of severe disease and these drugs that we need. Because in China, the supply chains,

294
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,960
which were still thin, were filled just before this outbreak started and there's about two to

295
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,640
three months worth of supply in the chain. But there was nothing that came in the backside of it.

296
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,720
So we're just about done. So if you add this on, Peter, this also then means now you've got to deal

297
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,960
with that situation on top of it. And if our healthcare system can't take care of these people

298
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,960
or we have acute shortages of what we need to provide the care we have been providing,

299
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,080
then the case fatality rate is going to go way up. It's going to go up. And that's, I think,

300
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,200
a real challenge. So just to be clear, you're not saying that we're going to run out of,

301
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,040
pick your favorite candidate drug that I want to eventually talk about with you,

302
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:39,760
you know, remdesivir versus hydroxychloroquine, etc. You're saying epinephrine, norepinephrine,

303
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,160
vasopressin, paralytics, the type of medicine we all take for granted that you need to run an ICU.

304
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,280
But even take something as simple as antibiotics. When you're sitting in an ICU for three and a half

305
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,120
weeks, the chance of developing a noscumular infection as a result of being there.

306
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,480
It's pretty much guaranteed.

307
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,360
It's almost guaranteed. So if you don't have the antibiotics anymore, guess what? 85% of all of our

308
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,880
key antibiotics right now are made outside the United States. Ironically, you know the two areas

309
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,120
that have the most production capability? China in the Lombardi region of Italy. Can you imagine?

310
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,400
You couldn't make that up.

311
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,320
You couldn't make it up, but you couldn't. And so, I mean, there's something we're looking at. So I

312
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,920
think that, you know, the question is relative. If we had ideal intensive care availability,

313
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,960
we could maintain the system. We could take that kind of that spigot of cases and regulate them

314
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,640
enough so that they didn't overflow the healthcare system. They just appeared. I like to say if we

315
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,640
have 100 cases of the disease today and they all hit the healthcare system, that's one outcome.

316
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,880
What if you have 100 and they hit the healthcare system 10 a week for 10 weeks? That's another

317
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,240
outcome. If we could do that, if we could thread that needle with our rope, then we'd be okay.

318
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,680
But I don't think we're going to be able to do that.

319
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,680
Do you think we have a pretty good handle on what it's going to take to protect healthcare workers?

320
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:07,040
Do we understand what amount of PPE is necessary first and foremost? And then secondly, of course,

321
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,000
can we meet that need? Can we meet the demand of that? Starting with the first question,

322
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,080
do we actually know what it takes to protect doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists,

323
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,840
and everybody who works in a hospital from the cafeteria to the parking garage?

324
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,880
Yeah, I think we know. I don't think we talk about it very well. And we have people who are

325
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,800
in denial about it. I've spent my career working on both coronaviruses and influenza. I can tell

326
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,840
you we have absolute certainty today, no question about it, that influenza virus is in part

327
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,800
transmitted by aerosols. These are the smaller particles of smaller than five millimeter

328
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,280
particles. And people assume when we talk about airborne transmission, we're talking about

329
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,240
something that's many, many yards away. And they actually forget that aerosols are produced

330
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,480
just where droplets are right in that first six feet area. And so if you're that close,

331
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
if you have a surgical mask on, you surely can do a lot to minimize the number of droplets you

332
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,760
come in contact with. But that doesn't take into account the aerosol. Where there's droplets,

333
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,440
there's aerosols. Where there's aerosols, there may not be droplets. But people have assumed

334
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,400
it's droplets or then it's aerosols somewhere else. And so I think from a respiratory protection

335
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,720
standpoint, one of the challenges we had in China was well close to 4,000 healthcare workers infected.

336
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,040
Right now in Italy, there's well over 5,600 healthcare workers who have been infected. Now,

337
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,720
some of them obviously got infected off the job, but many of them were on job. And respiratory

338
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:39,120
protection was a key factor in each one. And so I today feel incredibly incompetent, incapable,

339
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,120
and frankly, sad that there are going to be many healthcare workers who are going to risk their

340
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,640
lives to help with this, who will not have N95 respirator, which they need to have, because we

341
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,600
just don't have enough. We won't. And when I keep hearing about this additional production, the White

342
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,000
House continues to talk about that. They never give you the numbers of what we estimate we'll need

343
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,480
versus what's being produced. And it's so far short, it's not laughable, because that would imply

344
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,040
something funny. There's nothing funny about it. But the bottom line message is that we're going

345
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,000
to have a lot of healthcare workers who are going to be exposed and infected with this virus because

346
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,520
of that. What is the number, Mike? What would we need? I don't know. I think this is where, again,

347
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,440
we have a PPE challenger, particularly within N95s, that was even much more severe than they

348
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,760
had in China. Or to that extent, in Italy, they did several unique things, which I don't know if

349
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,760
we'll do here. You may have heard, but in several of the really high volume wards in Milan,

350
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,240
they had COVID-infected healthcare workers working. If they weren't that sick, they were working.

351
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,280
They went in without masks, et cetera, because they didn't have them. And so I don't know what

352
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,640
we'll do here, but I do believe we'll have a real challenge with this. Now, some will say, well, and

353
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,440
this is what I find very frustrating is we have to stick with the science. And what happened with CDC

354
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,040
to their credit, about two weeks ago, issued new guidelines for the use of PPE respiratory

355
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:16,320
protection. But what they said was, if you don't have N95s, then use masks. But a number of

356
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,120
administrators and some scientists have come forward and said, CDC changed their recommendation,

357
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,000
saying you don't have to use respirators, or you can use masks, meaning it's just droplet.

358
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,040
That's not what they said. And so I think that today for a healthcare worker, they just at least

359
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,840
have to know what they're getting into. I think many of them will still go to work. I mean, the

360
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,520
camaraderie, and you know what it's like to be in that kind of setting. These are some of the most

361
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,120
amazing heroes in the world. We don't send our soldiers into war without some kind of protective

362
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,880
equipment or without bullets in their guns. We send healthcare workers into this viral battle,

363
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,400
and we're going to be sending them in without bullets or without protective equipment. And

364
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,360
that to me is really sad, but that's what's going to have to take. That's going to be a big question

365
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,800
as to what happens there. So really, we have a problem on multiple fronts. We have a problem on

366
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,600
the supportive drug front. We have a problem on the treatment drug front, which I want to come

367
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,080
back to in a moment. We have a problem on the people who are going to administer care. We

368
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,400
potentially have a problem on the number of ventilators and actual beds, et cetera. So is

369
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,240
it a largely irrelevant academic exercise to understand which of those things becomes the

370
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,520
first failure? Because it varies so much, presumably by city hospital geography,

371
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,600
that it ought to be an all hands on deck for all of them. I mean, is there a model here where we

372
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,120
pick the 10 cities that are either in the throes of hell or we know are about to be,

373
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,840
and we start relocating healthcare workers to those areas if that's the thing that we believe

374
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,680
is going to be the bottleneck first? Of course, that would only make sense if you could provide

375
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,920
them with the necessary PPE. Otherwise, you're losing your soldiers in battle unnecessarily

376
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,880
without an appropriate risk to benefit trade off. How do we think about this? I mean, I haven't

377
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,160
spent a lot of time truly thinking about this at the full macro level of what the White House would

378
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,080
hopefully be thinking about this, but I mean, what is the model? What can we learn from the

379
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,600
successes and failures of any other pandemic? Well, first of all, let me just say you articulated

380
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,280
beautifully. You hit on every major piece. Let me just give some kind of relevant information.

381
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,360
It'll give you a sense. Right now, the largest manufacturer in the United States of N95s is 3M.

382
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:41,920
They can produce 35 million N95s a month. They're trying to wrap that up to get maybe 5 to 7% more

383
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,800
out of their machines. You just don't build these machines overnight. So even when you hear other

384
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
companies talk about how they're going to double or triple whatever production it is,

385
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:57,360
be very skeptical because these are machines that are really very, very sophisticated pieces of

386
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,560
equipment. I mean, for example, with an N95, most people don't realize that piece of white in front

387
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,400
of you is not paper. It's a matrix. It was actually poured and dried, and it has a unique

388
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
electrostatic charge on it, et cetera, so you can get air through it, not virus. It's a very

389
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,760
sophisticated thing. Well, they've produced 35 million a month. They've been doing it since

390
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,000
late January, and we met with them and said this is going to be a pandemic. There's one hospital

391
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,960
in New York alone, just one, that used 2 million N95s last month in that month, 2 million in their

392
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,080
institution. Now, you start to do the math where we have basically about 35 million of these

393
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,880
in the strategic national stockpile. That's it. You start looking at the volume we'd need of

394
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,960
400 million or more of these N95s just to get through the first couple of months, and you start

395
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,320
looking at the shortfall. That's where I have a problem is just let's just be honest. I'm not

396
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,360
trying to blame anybody. We're all to blame everybody. Why are we so ill prepared? But

397
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,080
healthcare workers have to know. A statement I made earlier about one of the former Defense

398
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,760
Secretary said when you go to war, you can't go to war with what you want. You have to go to war

399
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,760
with what you have. To understand how do we best protect healthcare workers, I think this is a key.

400
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,600
Let me give you an example. If we can't protect them because we don't have N95s, what are the

401
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:26,000
other things you can do? One is we should start forming wards, large wards, where basically we

402
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,360
have 18 or 20 patients on one ward, and you never leave the contaminated zone. At that point, rather

403
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:39,760
than doff and donning outside every room and having to throw that away, what do you do? Second

404
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,720
of all, what can you do to reuse these? We're publishing an article this week on our website

405
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,560
with 3M support, I mean not financial, but their intellectual support, of what are the techniques

406
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,400
we can actually use that will maintain the integrity of these N95s, but they can be reused

407
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,080
so that we can decontaminate. We're working on that right now. Next is what can we do to get

408
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,760
infected healthcare workers back? If I had to ask right now for one gift we could give healthcare

409
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,600
workers is serology. I'd like to test as many healthcare workers as I could for antibody and

410
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,240
having the discussion we just had on the ability to know that somebody's likely protected,

411
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,440
then I would know also that these are the people the safest to put back into harm's way.

412
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,080
If we did a lot of things like that, I think we could really mitigate the risk for healthcare

413
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,280
workers, but what we can't do is just administratively say, well the CDC has made this

414
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,760
recommendation, ignoring that there are things we must do and can do. You and I both know that

415
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,840
this is a numerator-denominator world we live in when it gets to rates, but it's a numerator world

416
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,960
when that person that dies is your colleague, when that person is somebody who worked for you,

417
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,520
when that person is somebody who day after day was there with you, bedside, holding hands, doing

418
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,880
the kind of skilled work, that is so tough on these people. We also have to understand the

419
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,640
mental health issues. If we neglect that, I already know healthcare workers who literally go home and

420
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,080
cry all the way home to work after they just finished another 14-hour shift. I think that's

421
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,880
another area that I've not heard anybody really talking about much, is this is just like battlefield

422
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,200
trauma. We've got to start helping them right now. If we're going to maintain three or four or five

423
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,080
months worth of activity here, we can't count on these people to do this day in and day out with

424
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,160
more help. Protect them first, support them second, and understand them and care about them third,

425
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,720
and they all have to be part of the picture. Mike, I want to go back to something you said

426
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,640
a second ago with respect to testing. Do we have a sense where we are now? I mean,

427
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,080
it seems that we've done probably in the neighborhood of 800,000 tests in the United

428
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,560
States in total. I don't know the breakdown of how many of those are PCR versus antibody,

429
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,720
but does that sound about right to you? It does, absolutely. Yes, it does. Yep.

430
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:04,480
Okay. Tell me the status of PCR. Is Roche providing the majority of these tests?

431
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,320
Yeah. I actually commented this also in my op-ed piece in the New York Times.

432
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,320
Again, if there's an operative set of words in this whole entire experience, it's supply chain,

433
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,680
supply chain, supply chains. Just like in real estate, it's location, location, location.

434
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,000
We have changed our world. In 2003, when SARS occurred, China was not a big player in

435
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,520
manufacturing the world. Supply chains weren't that critical to what happened in China.

436
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
Well, it turns out today, supply chains are everything, including for testing.

437
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,400
I'll add the perfect storm here. One, the world basically is on fire. Everybody wants these

438
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,840
reagents for whether it's PCR, whether it's antigen detection, whether it's serology.

439
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Number two, guess where a lot of the reagents were being made? China. Number three, now we bring

440
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,400
those two together and we're encouraging people to even do more testing. You know what? Within

441
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,800
a couple of weeks, we're going to actually see an implosion of testing. Right now in Minnesota,

442
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,880
we are so limited in our public health lab to test. If we don't have more reagents,

443
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,600
then tomorrow we're done. We can't test anymore. Commercial companies have been putting together

444
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,280
great packages to sell for testing, but what they haven't given you is how deep is their

445
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,960
inventory of resources for reagents. They're not. It used to be we filled the reagent pool

446
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,200
with a garden hose. Then we realized we needed a fire hose and now we need a damn water tunnel.

447
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,200
We're not going to have it. It's just at the time we need more testing.

448
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,480
I've seen these people get on talk shows and they sit there and say, oh, we'll just test

449
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,920
our way out of this. They don't have a clue about a supply chain issue. I think this is a

450
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,240
huge issue that you raise and is one that we're going to do less instead of more.

451
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,600
That seems counterintuitive, but it's what's going to happen.

452
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,480
Based on that, the idea that we should hope for the best scenario where everybody gets PCR to

453
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,960
detect and then antibody to follow, I mean, that's a pipe dream if we're going to be reagent limited.

454
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,360
Instead, it's going to be a bit of a pick your poison. And if you're lucky to get any test,

455
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,760
if that's the setting, which it sounds like based on the reagent shortfall, we're going to get to

456
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:26,000
that place. What other methods can be used? For example, could we rely on temperature changes?

457
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,440
Can we rely on any other sort of biometric as a way to take patients who are suspected positive,

458
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,040
but not yet confirmed and enact policy around that?

459
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,720
This is where we're going to get creative. And this is ironically where things like 1918 are

460
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,480
instructive. We're back to the future, you might say. First of all, we want to know when the virus

461
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,680
is in our communities and when it's doing harm. And we have a system in this country called

462
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,120
influenza-like illness surveillance or syndromic surveillance. We have set up in a whole series of

463
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,840
randomly chosen physicians offices around the country. And we survey it every week,

464
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,880
every several times a week during the flu season to give us an idea of, you know, if you have this

465
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,920
constellation of signs and symptoms, it's probably highly suggestive of flu and this is what's going

466
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:25,280
on. Well, it was very interesting. In New York City, flu had started to wind down by early February

467
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,040
to mid February and was actually coming down. All of a sudden in the end of February, boom,

468
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,720
up goes the number. And it goes and it goes and it goes. Long before anybody was test positive.

469
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,080
And guess what? It was COVID-19. We see the same thing here in Minneapolis. We just saw that thing

470
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,880
go up about two and a half weeks ago and it started going up again. So I feel confident

471
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,400
that we can monitor enough illness in the community this way and other means that we have

472
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,000
that we can tell people it's time to put the pedal to the metal. Okay. It's happening. We got

473
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,200
to shut it down the best we can. And so I think that's the kind of methods that public health is

474
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,560
going to be reverting to. But you raise a good point. What can I do for any one patient? And I

475
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,480
think the only thing we have going for us season wise right now is if they are sick with an

476
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,880
influenza-like illness, it's likely not influenza because we don't see it circulating right now.

477
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,000
And we can test for that and we haven't seen it. So I think you have to assume that there are COVID

478
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,040
infected patients and go with that. But it's going to create challenges. I mean, one of the things

479
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,360
we're concerned about right now is in Minnesota, our priority is testing first sick individuals

480
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,840
who are in the hospital. Are they really infected or not? The second thing is to test health care

481
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,280
workers who are sick, whether they're in the hospital or not, because we want them to work

482
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,920
or not. And the third thing is testing workers in long-term care. That's all we have the ability

483
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,520
to test for right now because we don't have any other real agents. And I said that we may run out

484
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,160
tomorrow. So we're all going to be finding ourselves, I think, in different scenarios. And

485
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,720
as much as we hear this good news about the new point of care test coming out from Abbott and

486
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,360
things like that, we welcome all the tests. Just make sure you have reagents to go with them.

487
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,000
And that's where the challenge is. Yeah. So your fear is that this Abbott test could be technically

488
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,360
a wonderful test, but it might only be able to do a million tests in total before the supply chain

489
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,320
falls apart. Exactly. You nailed it. That's exactly it. And we have been talking to the

490
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,800
companies at some length. And remember, when Abbott says a million, they could tell me 10 million.

491
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,480
It's over what time period? But it's over a whole world too. And that's the problem we have right

492
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,080
now. You could not buy a Roche PCR machine right now anywhere in the world. The Chinese went and

493
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,120
bought them all up 14 weeks ago. You can't buy one in the United States. As soon as they saw it

494
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,840
was happening, they bought every machine they could. And so we're in a global market for these

495
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,120
tests too. And it's not just the US. And that's another reason why this is such a unique event,

496
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:01,280
is because it is a global house on fire where everybody wants reagent water. And the truck can

497
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:08,240
only deliver so much. Yeah. I mean, gee, I hate saying such stupid glib things, but I really feel

498
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,600
like we're playing chess, not checkers. I say this all the time. I say, we got to stop playing

499
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,840
this. Like I play checkers with my 10 year old grandson, which I'm lucky if I beat him in one

500
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,920
move down the board. Yeah. Yeah. It just seems like I may have misset it, but I think you know

501
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,200
what I meant. Like, no, I don't. You were right. You were right. Yeah. We're playing checkers.

502
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,080
We're playing one move ahead. And the speed with which this is moving again to borrow from

503
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:37,360
Wayne Gretzky, right? We have to go where the puck is going, not where the puck is. And it seems like

504
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,680
every time, every step we take is going towards where the puck is. But in the case of a viral

505
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,240
pandemic, the puck moves faster than it moves in any other game. And you're really on your heels

506
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,920
when you're just going where the puck is, as opposed to anticipating where it's going.

507
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,720
And that's another really important point is, you know, we plan for catastrophes,

508
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:05,040
but we typically plan for a hurricane or an earthquake or a tsunami, one region, and then

509
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,040
we get into recovery right away. Not that it's not devastating, but you know, FEMA can't be in

510
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,560
all 50 states at once and do the magnificent job that we're seeing in New York. And frankly, many

511
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,200
of us fear that you don't want to be on the tail end of this outbreak where you are one of the

512
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,840
latter cities to break, because by that time, a lot of the resources are going to be used.

513
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,640
And even those that aren't going to be used up where they can be moved, like if additional

514
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,800
ventilators, if you can move them from place to place, it's still going to be a challenge,

515
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,560
because you will have used so many of the critical things like drugs and so forth.

516
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,520
And so where you place yourself in this outbreak right now, as bad as New York is,

517
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,320
they have the benefit of, at least now, like Seattle, they got more resources than most other

518
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,840
places will likely get. Mike, I've spoken to many people about the situation around vaccines,

519
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,720
including a number of people sort of off the record who work in biotech companies.

520
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,760
I've spoken with at least three CEOs of biotech companies off the record. Without exception,

521
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,600
no one has been able to give me a scenario under which a vaccine is available inside of 12 months.

522
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,640
Can you explain from your point of view why you think that that's likely and why you're saying,

523
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,520
look, we're not going to have a vaccine until 2021?

524
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,320
I always come back and clarify, I could make a vaccine tonight for this. I could, even with my

525
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,720
simplistic knowledge of this issue. But the question is, would it be safe and effective?

526
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,960
And that's what's key. So I think from an effectiveness standpoint, I do think we can

527
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,160
probably find something that will be effective even if temporarily, meaning it's not permanent

528
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,120
long-term protection, but something that might require boosters. We don't really know that yet.

529
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,240
The whole T cell, B cell combination of immunity with coronavirus is still a question.

530
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,400
I'm more optimistic about that. Where I think is going to hold us up a lot is safety. In the 2003

531
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,520
SARS vaccine work, there was some real challenges that developed with the animals with something

532
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,520
called antibody dependent enhancement, ADE, where if you made just a little bit of antibody,

533
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,120
that was bad because then when you got infected with the real thing, you had this antibody

534
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,920
dependent enhancement that was a shock like picture and was a real challenge. And that's exactly what

535
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,480
happened to the dinghy vaccine in the Philippines that got pulled two years ago, was that that

536
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,040
vaccine had an ADE component to it that nobody had appreciated. And because we have a history

537
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:44,880
with this vaccine with ADE, I think that no regulatory agency, at least in North America or

538
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,040
EU, is going to license that without substantial safety data. And if that occurs, let's just say

539
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,640
even one per 10 to one per hundred thousand population, think how many people you have to

540
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:03,440
study before you can actually know, is there an increased risk or not? And if this was a really

541
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,480
common side effect, three or four or five percent got it, that would be a much easier situation to

542
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,360
study. So I think that there will surely be pressure to get it evaluated and licensed and

543
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:21,040
made as soon as possible. But right now, I think the ADE thing is one that's going to hang over its

544
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,160
head and regulators are going to make certain that we have enough data to at least begin to address it.

545
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,320
What's the technical reason for that, Mike? Because that's not something that we see with

546
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,520
influenza, for example. No, we don't. In fact, it's more of a flavivirus type issue and the

547
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,720
coronaviruses we've seen it where basically this whole immune system set up. I mean, in a sense,

548
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,800
it's somewhat like dengue hemorrhagic fever, where you've been infected with one strain

549
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,600
and then you have the second strain infection that has enough cross protection but not sufficient to

550
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:55,120
fully protect you. And so it really is an immunologic phenomena. This is part of why

551
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,560
hep C vaccination has never really been successful as well. Isn't hep C also a flavivirus?

552
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,960
Yeah, I think that's also but exactly one of the reasons why it's been a problem. So I think that's

553
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,400
going to be a challenge. But let me just say there's one other challenge that I think people

554
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,320
haven't thought about yet. And that is, again, the supply chain thing where we just assume anybody

555
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:21,600
can do anything because we got something. Vaccines take manufacturing capacity. Right now, there is

556
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:28,320
no big manufacturing capacity sitting out there empty, waiting for some unknown virus to attack us

557
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:35,440
and then cause for a need for a major vaccine program. And so right now, the only players,

558
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,720
there's one single one player in this entire effort that even has the capacity to manufacture

559
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,960
these in any meaningful way. All the other ones are smaller startup companies that are bringing

560
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,920
some good science to the table, but they all are likely acquisition type issues where if they got

561
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,080
the product, they get bought by a big company and move on. And relatively speaking, the big companies

562
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,920
have not gotten involved. And I think that we have to also look at how do you make enough of this

563
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,280
vaccine for millions and millions and millions of people? And how long would that take? I remind

564
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,440
people that Ebola vaccine, which was heavily funded by the defense industry in both the United

565
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,840
States and Canada because of the concern about a bioweapon use. And so therefore, when it came into

566
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:29,440
the quote unquote Ebola battlefield in 2015, a lot of work had been done on it already. And it still

567
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,280
took almost four years to get that thing licensed with the data that it had and the ability to provide

568
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:42,480
the manufacturing dynamics, etc. So I think if we do everything we possibly can here and we can show

569
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,280
it's effective, a relative sense of safety, being able to find the manufacturing capacity. We're still

570
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,920
talking 18 months, I think, at the earliest. And that's not because people aren't going to be

571
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,840
working 26 hours a day. It's just that's what it takes. Yeah. I mean, I think another just point to

572
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,520
make that and drive it home is just looking at Shingrix. When we came out with a much improved

573
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,960
vaccine for Shingles, I don't know if you recall, but you couldn't get that vaccine for your patients

574
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,560
over 50. I'm one of the high risk people. I'm an old guy. I know that. Yeah. We had a really

575
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,360
hard time getting that vaccine for our patients. It took many of them needed to wait six months

576
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,960
to get it. And obviously it's a fraction of the demand. So it's just worth sort of contemplating

577
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,440
that. And I think the other thing that I want to go from this vaccine discussion into the sort of

578
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,160
the antivirals, I read a really interesting statistic the other day that I actually,

579
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,200
I guess I knew it was not great. I didn't know it was this bad, but it looked at sort of antiviral

580
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,440
drug development from about 1963 until present or thereabouts. It was a couple of years old.

581
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,920
A little over, oh, I don't know. I want to say in the neighborhood of 5,000 antiviral inhibitors

582
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,680
were proposed in the scientific literature, but only 90 of these, 9-0, were approved for final

583
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:07,680
use over about a 55 to 60 year period. And by the way, of those 90, about 40 were for HIV.

584
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:13,920
So again, I'm not minimizing. Yeah. So if you took HIV out of this, we're talking about maybe

585
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:21,760
50 drugs developed with any efficacy and safety to warrant approval in a 55, 60 year period of time.

586
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,880
What does that tell you? Well, I'll tell you what it tells me is I harken back to when I was in

587
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,160
medical school and I went to NIH to spend some time there and I was in an immunology lab. And I

588
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,040
just remember a lecture one day that left such an impression on me, which was, and this was

589
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:45,120
immunology through the lens of cancer. But the point was the T cell biology is so robust. T cells

590
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,640
are so amazing at what they do that they save us from all these viruses that otherwise we'd be

591
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:57,520
hosed from as evidenced by how few we have in terms of effective antiviral drugs. In other words,

592
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,880
if not for the fact that we had a competent immune system that could fight off most viruses,

593
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,480
we'd be doomed because our hit rate of developing drugs to stop viruses is actually

594
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,000
pathetic compared to our ability to stop bacteria. No, you're absolutely right. The good fortune,

595
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,840
I think, is we are today in a better place in part because of the research that HIV

596
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:24,880
led us into and gave us a better sense of how to do research. But I would absolutely agree with you.

597
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,120
Anybody thinks this is a slam dunk, it's not. And I worry about the fact that we've already made

598
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:37,520
judgments to a certain degree about what works and doesn't work. I happen to chair four different

599
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,920
major work groups for WHO on what they call the R&D roadmaps for epidemic diseases. We both allow

600
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:50,320
Sunnipa and Zika. Early on, Ebola vaccine was moving along fine. We were overseeing that,

601
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,680
but the therapeutics were still a question. And everybody had assumed ZMAP, a monoclonal

602
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,680
antibody, was the drug. If you didn't use ZMAP, it was almost unethical. Finally, in this most

603
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,920
recent outbreak in the DRC, a randomized control trial was set up, and ZMAP didn't even finish in

604
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:14,000
the top five drugs. And it was one of those ones where when you realize, wow, we've been using this

605
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,800
for years with the assumption thereof, I hope that we have very effective drugs in this current

606
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:27,360
regimen approach with the COVID-19 disease, but I don't know that we do. And I think, as you so well

607
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,720
know, we have two kinds of drugs. The Coroquine, for example, are immunologic modulators,

608
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,680
toll-like receptor modulators. Whereas if we have people dying from a myocarditis type picture,

609
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,080
well, that's a whole different situation. We may actually cause problems using Coroquine. So I think

610
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:52,400
that we just don't know yet. And I hope we have multiple fronts to deal with this, but the answers

611
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,520
are far from there yet. They're just far from being there. I want to come back to the antiviral

612
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,920
in a sec, but I want to pick up on a thread there, which is, isn't that the second time you've

613
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,840
mentioned it? Basically, we're so early in this and we're still back on our heels. I feel like a

614
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,320
boxer who's been punched in the head so hard. I'm having a hard time thinking about counterpunching.

615
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:18,080
All I'm thinking about doing is not getting hit again. We haven't really done the analysis on the

616
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:23,520
survivors yet. We don't understand how much lingering myocarditis is out there. We don't

617
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,880
understand how much lingering kidney disease is out there. We don't understand how much lingering

618
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,320
lung disease remains in terms of fibrosis or permanent destruction of a subset of the

619
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:42,400
pneumocytes. Is there anything that you've learned from SARS and MERS about the survivors that we can

620
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:49,440
take as a potential proxy for long-term view on the health of the survivors?

621
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,800
I can't say from a clinical standpoint, I know that. SARS was the one in and out. There surely

622
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:01,360
were over 7,000 some survivors and how much subsequent morbidity that they had with that,

623
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,560
I can't tell you. The one thing I can tell you, which I think is another observation, but hopefully

624
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,400
a positive observation, is that having done all the work in the Middle East on the Arabian Peninsula,

625
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,440
unlike with SARS, where once the palm service were taken out of the market, humans weren't

626
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,680
getting pinged anymore with the virus. They stopped it. With MERS, those camels keep transmitting and

627
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,720
transmitting. People who come from herds, where they're close to those animals, those are the same

628
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:36,640
animals that infected them if they go back to. It turns out that I'm not aware of anyone since 2012,

629
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:44,240
almost eight years, who have been infected going back into a relatively high infection rate in

630
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,600
their own animals, have ever gotten reinfected. Again, the assumption that I think we have to be

631
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:54,080
careful about, does that mean they're really protected or not, but we haven't seen that again.

632
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,520
That's probably the only takeaway I can come with, but it doesn't answer the very important question

633
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:05,280
you're asking, what is that residual? What's it all about? Even understanding for certain what

634
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,840
got us into this situation with underlying comorbidities, I'd like to understand more,

635
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,720
why do certain comorbidities actually predispose you to a bad outcome? What is it about that?

636
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,440
I was going to ask you, what do you think, for example, in type 2 diabetes makes a bit more sense,

637
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,120
but what about type 1 diabetes, where there still seems to be an increased risk, and that's

638
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,040
especially concerning for young people? Exactly, I don't know that. Of course,

639
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,320
that's going to be overlaid with obesity, so then you're going to have both issues operating at the

640
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:39,040
same time. How much of that is compromised lung capacity? How much of it is actually the diabetes?

641
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,000
That's what's really unclear. What about immune compromise? What do we know about immune-suppressed

642
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,120
patients? We've actually tried to get more information from the Chinese on that. We've

643
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,080
actually made formal requests for that information, and all we get back is saying is that they didn't

644
00:59:54,080 --> 01:00:00,000
see any big increase in immune-compromised people, whether they were surviving cancer patients who

645
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,560
may have been predisposed to a pneumococmic compromised condition, etc. No one has reported

646
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,440
out of the Chinese data. I've not seen it out of the data from Italy other than to say,

647
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,160
what do you mean by immune-compromised? You're over 80, what does that mean? But from a clinical

648
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,360
standpoint, not someone who would actually, we'd classify as immune-compromised. I've seen nothing

649
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,640
on HIV AIDS, for example. Nothing that suggests HIV status puts you at a higher risk at all.

650
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:33,920
Yeah, again, this is yet another point on the list of things that differentiates this from influenza.

651
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:41,360
If we're looking for ways to contrast this, again, it's hyperimmunity, immune paralysis versus not

652
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,560
especially immunogenic to the same extent. There's just so many things that make this different that

653
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,320
as more and more time goes on, the more and more I feel we do ourselves a disservice trying to

654
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:55,920
compare these two. It's understandable why we do, but it could potentially mislead us if we continue

655
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,200
to use influenza. Yeah, and you raised a very good point about I use influenza from a transmission

656
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,480
model, but I don't think clinically you can. And one of the areas we ran into that was with kids.

657
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,840
When you look at kids today, there is pretty compelling evidence now out of studies that

658
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,080
were done in China that the kids do get infected at the same rate that the adults do,

659
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,400
but they just don't show clinical signs and symptoms, which is just the opposite with

660
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,280
influenza. Kids become little viral reactors in school. They transmit to everybody, including

661
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,280
their parents and their older sibs, and they're sick. And so there is an example of a difference

662
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,320
right there where what's happening with influenza in kids is not the same thing that's happening

663
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:40,160
with the COVID-19 in kids. Mike, have you given any thought to the notion that you alluded to

664
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:46,640
at the outset that you estimated R0 was somewhere between 2 and 2.4? We tend to talk about R0 as

665
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,960
though it's a blended number between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic spreaders.

666
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,320
Is there any utility in trying to think of R0 as separate and potentially assuming that the

667
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,480
symptomatic people might have a higher R0, although that doesn't necessarily have to be the case?

668
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,720
Again, you're asking a great epidemiologic question because we're having that debate right

669
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:10,560
now in a sense. I've always said R0 really didn't apply to MERS and SARS because these

670
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,320
super spreaders were so important. You could have five patients, six patients, 10 patients,

671
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,120
didn't transmit to anybody even when people let their guard down and didn't do a good infection

672
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,160
control. Then somebody could come in and wow. I was involved with helping the follow-up

673
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,880
investigation at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul in 2015 when an individual came back from the

674
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:40,240
Middle East to Seoul and they actually were infected. They went to hospital A. Another

675
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,360
patient was in hospital A. That person infected that other patient who then upon discharge went

676
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,400
over to hospital B, i.e. Samsung Medical Center, and transmitted in one afternoon an

677
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,600
emergency room, 60 some people. I mean, that was dynamic. Just to be clear, this is a property of

678
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,920
the host, not the virus because it's the same virus. Exactly. You're right. Same virus.

679
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,800
To say that the R0 in a situation like that is kind of like saying your head's in the freezer,

680
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,200
your feet are in the oven, but on average your temperature is just right. That doesn't make sense.

681
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,440
I've always challenged the R0 because I think that it was way, way, way out on the curve. In some

682
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,720
cases we saw lots of transmission. Well, I think with this disease we have a hybrid. In fact,

683
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,680
there's a great article in today's LA Times, I urge you to go look at it, highlighting a major

684
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:36,080
event that happened at a choir in Seattle. I saw it. If I recall, 60 people in the choir showed up

685
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:43,520
to practice. Yes. 45 have gone on to test positive. Two have died. One was 80, one was 83.

686
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,280
Three are in the hospital. So yes, there was something strange about that. So, you know,

687
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,400
we had these events like that. And I think that we've had more of those than we care to realize.

688
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,040
But on the other hand, we also have, I think, the regular transmission. What was really fascinating

689
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:03,040
about the Kristin Drazin and his group in Munich have followed up on individuals there who were

690
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,920
part of this early outbreak associated with somebody who had flown from Wuhan, China to a car

691
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:14,240
manufacturing location in Germany, was supposedly mildly ill, asymptomatic, transmitted. Okay.

692
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,840
Well, they followed up on a group of these contacts and they said, okay, as soon as you

693
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:23,200
get the first symptom call us, which they did, and they have a series of patients that they literally

694
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:32,480
have blood, urine, feces, throat swabs, nasal swabs, etc. in the earliest hours. And these people

695
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,320
were just getting sick and they were getting progressively sick over time. But what they found

696
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:42,640
with the virus in the throat was fascinating. This is on culture now, not just PCR. The virus

697
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,440
level in the throats of these people were about a thousand times what they see with SARS at its

698
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,280
highest level. And this was right at the very first moments that they were just showing clinical

699
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,440
symptoms. And if you follow those cases, the virus level drops precipitously over each day,

700
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:05,520
day four or five, it's really much lower. Now, clearly before that, and their hypothesis is that

701
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,480
these virus levels may have been higher on day minus one, day minus two, but they weren't coughing

702
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,560
or they weren't sneezing. So you can say, well, they may not have been as infectious, but to see

703
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,760
that kind of virus level, just breathing, creating the aerosols. And people want to understand an

704
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,080
aerosol. I tell them there's two things to understand it by. Next time in your house and

705
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,200
sunlight is peering through a window and you see all that dust floating in there and you think, oh,

706
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,440
my house is dusty. Those are aerosols. That's just from us talking. That's from us breathing. That's

707
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,840
what goes on in your house. The second thing is next time you're at a shopping center, hopefully

708
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:40,640
they open up and you are in a department store, you're three aisles, four aisles away from the

709
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:46,240
perfume section, you can still smell it. It's an aerosol. So I think that breathing and just the

710
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:52,240
talking would put that out there. So I think that whether they call it asymptomatic, we kind of call

711
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,040
this pre-symptomatic, meaning that they're going to get sick, but they may be infectious beforehand.

712
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,240
And this is not a surprise. We see this with influenza all the time. Whether somebody is truly

713
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:09,120
asymptomatic, never showing discernible signs or symptoms, I think is a question that is the data

714
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,520
really come down harder and harder. In fact, I just reviewed a paper for a major journal from the

715
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,440
group in China that found a sizable number of people who are asymptomatic never had reported

716
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,360
symptoms where they had more than just PCR data. They actually had culture data and they were

717
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,920
pretty loaded too. So I think there is a role for these people. How much they're driving the

718
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,560
outbreak, I don't know, but I think we can't ignore that they have to be there. And I do

719
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:38,560
believe we have SARS-like super spreader events, just like one we just talked about with the

720
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:45,120
chorus. But there's a lot of us, it's just efficient transmission. Did we learn anything

721
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:50,400
about what characteristics those super spreaders had that made them super spreaders such that we

722
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,640
might be able to identify these people a priori and isolate them better? No, that is again a

723
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,800
million dollar question we have. And even with all the years of looking at what happens with MERS,

724
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:09,040
and part of the reason is with MERS, for example, it's not that the virus got less effective in

725
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:14,000
spreading, we just got more effective in early detection and getting these people isolated.

726
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,600
The first outbreaks, for example, in the Arabian Peninsula with MERS were largely in dialysis units

727
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:24,400
where people who were in sick, they were in there for a while, and then classic hospital

728
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,880
associated infections occurred where they transmitted to others. Once they figured that

729
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,680
out, and as you alluded to a moment ago, R0 is a relative term. It refers to in the natural state

730
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,400
unaltered, this is who you transmit to. But if you have somebody that's just hotter than the devil,

731
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,720
but you put them in an isolation room, they should transmit to nobody. Technically, there R0 should

732
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,760
drop to zero, even though if you had them out in the waiting room, there R0 might be dead.

733
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,960
I think that's one of the issues with MERS, we can't even tell you for sure, because we've just

734
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,600
gotten a lot better at making sure they don't transmit. And had these occurred otherwise,

735
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:04,960
like the one happened in Samsung Medical Center, I think we'd see more of these. I don't think we

736
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,840
know yet, but it's a very important point that we do need to understand much better than we do now.

737
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:16,720
How is anyone to be able to model this out, given all of these unknowns? On the one hand,

738
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,680
I think we would all agree forecasting could be helpful, because it would be great to know

739
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:28,400
some order of susceptible areas in the country, if not globally. We've talked about it now on a

740
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:33,680
couple of occasions here, we're going to have to allocate resources intelligently. We can't take

741
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,120
an approach that says it's going to be all hands on deck simultaneously everywhere, because one,

742
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,800
we don't have the resources to do it, and two, it doesn't mirror what's going to happen. So

743
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,680
it would really be helpful to know that while New York is right now the epicenter of this in the

744
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:53,760
United States, these five cities are next in line, and therefore we should at a national level be

745
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:59,040
ramping them up, such that at a local level, they're ready. But how do we do this? I mean,

746
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,480
I think my fear is, and we've internally been working on models, we continue to work on models,

747
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:09,120
we're collaborating with people, putting together models, and they're beautiful and they're elegant,

748
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,160
but ultimately they're wrong. I mean, they just have to be wrong, because we don't know the

749
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:21,520
simplest things that the models are very sensitive to, such as R0. And I mean, that's by far the most

750
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,600
important metric, which of course the problem is, it's a single number or a couple of numbers

751
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:34,000
in a model that as you point out is anything but a single number. The average, the example that is

752
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,440
often used, the average, you can drown in an average of three inches of water. So just as you

753
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,920
can have your feet in a freezer in your head in an oven and still be on average at the right

754
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,280
temperature, it's very complicated. And it's not just to say, we don't know what the distribution

755
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:53,760
looks like. We don't know what the probability distribution looks like of these things. So

756
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,720
as someone who has studied these things for such a long period of time, are you more or less

757
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,840
optimistic that this exercise of projection and modeling is a fool's errand? Or what do you think

758
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,800
we should be doing here? Well, first of all, let me just say I'm not a modeler. I've had a lot of

759
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,800
graduate hours, statistics classes, and I ascribe very much to the fact that all models are wrong.

760
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,960
Some just provide helpful information. And I've always said that. I've always been, I mean, I had

761
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:29,040
to live through the 2014, 15 Ebola situation where WHO came out and modeled it and said, we're going

762
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:34,240
to have 20,000 cases. And CDC said it could be as high as a million. And it scared the hell out of

763
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,040
everybody. And we had to explain the next year why we didn't have a million cases. It was close to

764
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,040
20,000. And just that error by itself created a lot of controversy because it made it look like

765
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,800
we're trying to really hype this. I think here, the points you're raising are exactly the ones

766
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,480
that we've been looking at carefully to say the variability around this feature is from zero to

767
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:03,440
one. I mean, it's from infinity. And so that one factor is kind of like A plus B plus C plus miracle

768
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,320
and you get an answer. And the miracle part just can't be there. Okay. And so I think that that is

769
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,080
a challenge. On the other hand, I would say you can theoretically say without knowing if it works

770
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,920
like this, this is what will happen. If you were able to suppress it in 85 or 90% of the transmission

771
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,760
events, you can have this happen. Or if you do this, you can have that happen. But it can't tell

772
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,560
you that's what it's going to be. It can just tell you within the framework of what might it look

773
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,160
like. I think you're exactly right. I have gone, my predictions, which I talked about earlier,

774
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:40,400
and I surely don't need to sit here and sound, well, look at me. But we were right on with this

775
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:45,680
thing all along, right to this point, even to pick in hotspots. And now we can't. I can't tell

776
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,680
you for certain what it's going to do because it's beyond the scope of our experience. And we were

777
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:54,560
just modeling the lot intellectually, not statistically on the flu transmission model,

778
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,200
because it looked like that a lot. I think you're asking exactly the right question. What

779
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:05,120
intelligence would give us the information so that we could plan this is the next front. Two weeks

780
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,600
from now, this is what we're going to need to be, this is how much we're going to need to have.

781
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:13,280
And we just don't have it, which is one of the other real shortcomings of our ability to respond.

782
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,320
Today, weather forecasters can tell you, you got 80% chance in this region right here of having

783
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,480
tornadoes today. I can tell you, I can paint the whole United States. We have 100% chance of

784
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,160
having a COVID-19 problem, but I can't tell you exactly much more than that right now.

785
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,280
Is there any evidence that this is a globally coordinated effort on intelligence now,

786
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,040
or is everybody still kind of acting like the guy who just got punched in the nose, who's

787
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,280
still stinging from the pain and trying to not get hit again to worry about the person

788
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,560
sitting in the front row and whether they're drinking a Diet Coke or a Diet Pepsi?

789
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:53,840
Many of us were incredibly disappointed, for lack of a better word, on the WHO in its response.

790
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,520
There was a sense that China's going to contain it, the whole world can contain it. And I give

791
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,600
great credit to China for what they did, but they didn't contain it. They slowed it down.

792
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:09,280
I surely give them that. But why did they close down all their movie theaters last week again?

793
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:16,640
Why did they remove all the outside reporters to China two weeks ago? I think many of us think

794
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,040
that they are in part experienced in some resurgence as they're opening up their economy

795
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,560
again, and they don't want anybody to know it. And I know that's a strong statement,

796
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,960
but I've talked to a number of people from Asia who would say they tell you the same thing.

797
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,760
So when you look at what WHO did, I think they set us back a great deal because they made

798
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,920
countries believe if just the few countries that were going to get this would just do the

799
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,640
containment work, we could stop it. And we couldn't. Trying to stop this kind of transmission,

800
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:48,480
like trying to stop the wind. And so we held back on a preparedness and gave people excuses not to

801
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:54,800
do it. Now, again, we don't have global leadership in terms of how do we coordinate this? How do the

802
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,440
low and middle income countries do with this versus the high income countries? Every country

803
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:08,080
is fighting for the same tools, the same tests, the same N95s. And we don't have a way to globally

804
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,760
allocate those in any kind of meaningful way. So the have and have nots are going to fight it out,

805
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,320
and the haves are going to get more, and the have nots are not. The only thing that ironically,

806
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,800
we have going for us, which is in a sense a sad commentary, there are a lot less at risk people

807
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,320
living in low income countries, because they already died. And they're not able to be around

808
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:33,600
80 with long term renal disease. They died a long time ago. And that's a sad commentary,

809
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,960
but in a sense may do better on case fatality rates overall than we do, because they're not

810
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,760
going to have that high risk. Yeah, when you, again, this is not a statement of low income

811
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,640
countries. So, but looking in Europe again, when you consider Italy, Spain looking very similar,

812
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,040
and then Germany looking different, do you think that the majority of that difference is explained

813
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:59,200
by the underlying health of the population? Do you think more of it is just stochastic bad luck,

814
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:05,440
where in Italy and Spain, the regions that got hit first happened to have a greater center of

815
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,120
older, more susceptible individuals? Do you think it is an artifact of testing? I mean,

816
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,200
how do you explain, what are your explanations for potentially those differences?

817
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:19,040
Yeah, I think it's totally artificial. And I think as demographics, if you look at what happened in

818
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:25,120
Italy, it started in the ski areas, but it quickly got into older populations. If you look at Germany,

819
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,080
a lot of that was introduced back in Germany from the Italian ski areas. And it was in a younger

820
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:36,160
crowd. If you look at where the illness is, I can tell you right now that it's starting to change.

821
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:41,120
And it's starting to see more transmission in Germany in older populations. And when that

822
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:46,080
happens, case fatality rates go up. It's just like in Korea, when Korea had this predominant

823
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:51,120
case mix of these younger individuals in this religious sect, case fatality rates were one

824
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,840
thing. Now look at what's happening in the older populations more involved, case fatality rates are

825
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:01,360
going up substantially in Korea. I hate to say this, but every week is like a snapshot. It's not

826
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,920
the whole movie. And if we could play the whole movie out for the next two to three years, I think

827
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:12,240
there'll be a lot more similar kinds of pictures that will over time bear that out. That where the

828
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:18,160
risk factors were for comorbidity, associated severe disease, we're going to see higher case

829
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:24,160
fatality rates. When you age adjust and when you adjust on risk factors, I don't think there's a

830
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:28,240
lot of difference here that we're going to see around the world. Mike, I want to be sensitive

831
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,160
to your time. And of course, I want to make sure that you'll agree to come back and talk with us

832
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,880
in a week, two weeks, something like that. Because as you said, the rate at which this is changing,

833
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,000
I mean, to talk again in two weeks would be like talking over two years outside of the time frame

834
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:48,960
of an epidemic. But the last question I want to ask you is, is there any of the sort of repurposed

835
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:55,840
drugs that are currently being thrown around in non RCT manners that you have any optimism around?

836
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,840
I mean, as you probably saw the study that was published out of France on Saturday,

837
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,520
looking at hydrochloro, I mean, again, I thought the study was impossible to interpret because

838
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,560
without randomization, it looked promising, but you could argue that all those patients would

839
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,840
have done just fine without the drug. I mean, without a control group, it's very difficult.

840
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,440
At the same time, I don't want to be critical of that, that we have to do something in terms of

841
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:23,440
studying this and using case control cohort. If that's the best we can do, so be it. But you gave

842
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:29,600
a great example with Ebola, which said, look, you can be really deceived by these non-randomized

843
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:35,600
trials. And when you put them to the gold standard, they can fail miserably. If you're lucky, they just

844
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:43,760
fail in futility, not harm. Based on that, how much of your energy are you spending looking at

845
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,840
the different types of repurposed antivirals, everything from remdesivir to camastat to

846
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,000
hydroxychloroquine? Are you looking at these closely enough to comment on your optimism or

847
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,960
pessimism? I'm not because I'm not in that part of it. I'm doing much more in the epidemiology

848
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,880
prevention side, but I think it's a critical question. I actually feel confident though,

849
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,840
that the systems are being set up to actually collect the data in a meaningful way so that we

850
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,920
can have answers. And I think you nailed it. I mean, I actually read that same study you're

851
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,960
talking about, and I had the exact same conclusions you did. So I think we just have to,

852
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,720
it's Godspeed, do these as fast as possible, but we have to keep an open mind and let the data

853
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,440
take us wherever it's going to and do them. So on that regard, hopefully I can come back in a couple

854
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,280
weeks and we can have more information. I do believe we're going to have much more information

855
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:37,360
on therapies much sooner than vaccines. And that could be a really important response.

856
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,960
So I know I said that was my last question. I guess I want to give you one last thing to say.

857
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,040
There's people that are going to be listening to this less than 24 hours after we've recorded it.

858
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,920
So consider it as current as possible. What's the message you want to deliver to people listening

859
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,000
to this who are afraid, who are not afraid? Just assume you're talking to a heterogeneous mix of

860
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,640
people. What do you want to communicate to them as far as what steps they should be taking to

861
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,960
protect themselves and the people they care about? Well, number one, we throw around a lot

862
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,840
of numbers and we have to never forget these are all people. They're our loved ones. This is real

863
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,280
and more people are going to know somebody in the next couple of weeks that are going to be seriously

864
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,160
or die. The second thing is I would just say that we're going to get through this. We are going to

865
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,720
get through it. The question is how do we do it? And that's where I think some of us are trying to

866
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,000
get the kinds of approaches in place that have a better chance of getting us through than not.

867
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,560
I appreciate it. You are wonderful. I would be happy to do this with you again. You're great at

868
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,480
it. You're really good at it. I appreciate that, Mike, and we'll get back to you soon. Thank you so

869
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,400
much. Bye for now. Bye. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're

870
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,120
interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that

871
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,240
allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our

872
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:57,360
goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end,

873
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:02,240
membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast

874
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:07,840
show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the

875
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,920
street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes,

876
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:19,280
hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear

877
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:25,280
everything without having to listen to spiel like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast,

878
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,600
typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the

879
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,320
best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great

880
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,360
way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

881
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:45,360
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

882
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,520
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you
