00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,420

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Hi everyone, welcome to episode four of the week of day spring.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,680
In this episode, we cover a lot of drugs.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,680
We talk about statins, we talk about cholesterol regulation, we talk about a zetimibe, also

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,120
known as Zettia, and we talk about the most recent class of drugs introduced to this field,

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,200
a drug, a class known as the PCSK9 inhibitors.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,000
There are two such drugs on the market today.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,440
We talk about fibrates and we also talk about the use of fish oil, niacin or niacin span,

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
which has fallen out of favor.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,720
This came up a little bit on the discussion I had with Ron Kraus several months ago and

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,480
we get re revisited here.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,080
Tom has a very different point of view on this from Ron.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,200
So you will be able to determine which of those views that you favor, which camp you're

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,720
going to be in on the niacin side.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,760
We talk about the role of cholesterol, statins and brain health.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,880
And another thing that I learned was about the futility of using CKs and LFTs to address

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,360
statin response or ill response.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,160
So again, another great example of how I'm doing these shows, but I'm learning along

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,440
the way and so I'm confident that any physician listening to this is going to learn something

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,720
and that hopefully this becomes kind of a part of your ongoing medical education.

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,720
So sit back and get ready for episode four.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,240
So while we're on that topic, let's go back and talk about the drugs.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,440
So we just finished with kind of one very niche story, but when it became pretty clear

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,800
that there was an association, a strong association, frankly, between cholesterol and heart disease,

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,060
you now had another target because as you said, if we went back in time 50, 60 years,

35
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,620
if you were astute enough, you would have your patients stop smoking.

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,780
You would manage their blood pressure.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,420
What was the first drug that was specifically brought to market to target cholesterol?

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,860
Well, niacin has been used that infinitum forever without a lot of data, but they knew

39
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,780
it changed certain metrics.

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,460
They were measuring total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol.

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,180
And the only form of niacin available back then was immediate release of pretty much

42
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,200
intolerable drug for most people, but you could find some people who could take the

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,140
massive doses needed for that.

44
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,260
So that was around, believe it or not, when I was coming up and total cholesterol was

45
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,220
the only measurable thing and they knew that if it was 400 or something, you were probably

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
in trouble.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,940
They gave neomycin to those people.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,940
Neomycin, the antibiotic.

49
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,940
Which interrupted the hepatobiliary circulation of cholesterol and it lowered cholesterol

50
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,820
anywhere, no outcome evidence with it.

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,140
But along came the bile acid sequestrants, which we hinted on will make you excrete bile

52
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,580
acids, which therefore you have to use up your endogenous cholesterol to make new bile

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,580
acids.

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,820
So you will lower your cholesterol metrics that you're looking at.

55
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,940
And in a crazy long outcome trial, it did seem to work.

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,740
They pudged a lot of statistics, I think, in retrospect on and didn't have the type

57
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,740
of statistics.

58
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
This is the LRC.

59
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
Yes.

60
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,380
So there was a little proof that not only what Framingham said is true, cholesterol

61
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,340
is a risk marker, a risk factor, depending on how you want to label it, but lowering

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,380
it does reduce clinical events.

63
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:09,580
To me, the tragedy of that is for the next 20 to 30 years, the only thing that the pharmacological

64
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,100
industry focused on was cholesterol as their metric of, that's all we got to do.

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,180
We got to find stuff that lowers cholesterol metrics or improves cholesterol metrics in

66
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,300
one or the other direction.

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,900
And by the way, questions do raise HDL cholesterol in milligram or two milligrams per cent, which

68
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,500
turns out to have some statistical significance.

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,060
Potentially without any physiologic significance.

70
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Correct.

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,220
And it's a minuscule thing, so who knows.

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,420
So that led to just investigation of everything else.

73
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,260
And all of a sudden, this guy discovers a fungus that has got a property that lowers

74
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,940
really potently cholesterol.

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:56,500
And that was the statin group, Akira Uendo, a mycologist over there in Japan, who unbelievably

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,460
has not gotten a Nobel Prize yet.

77
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,060
And there'd be no statins without him bringing it to the table and stuff.

78
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,500
We wound statins, lower LDL cholesterol dramatically, pretty low doses.

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,340
They seem to be safe.

80
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,500
After LRC, the FDA needed it was if you got a product that didn't harm anybody and it's

81
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,420
lowering LDL cholesterol, welcome aboard.

82
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,340
So several statins got approved starting in 1987 with the lowest statin, Mevacor being

83
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,060
the first and came on the market.

84
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,700
Mevacor's like me who are well into believing, yes, lowering LDL cholesterol, though the

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,580
only metric we have now, and that's good, people seem to do better, became very aggressive

86
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,820
statin people.

87
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,620
And that story told early where we used to see MIs like crazy in our heyday, we stopped

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
seeing them anymore.

89
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,740
So we had at least anecdotal belief that these things were working.

90
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,940
And lo and behold, pharma knew ultimately they were going to have to do serious outcome

91
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,820
trials.

92
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,020
And the first group of people they studied were Swedish guys who survived an MI and had

93
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,660
an LDL cholesterol of 190.

94
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
So these patients had FH?

95
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,540
In retrospect, they're FH patients, who's got an LDL cholesterol, one of the definitions

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,940
of FH.

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,420
And giving them a dose of Simvastatin got your 25% reduction in clinical events.

98
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,460
So outcome data, bingo, great drug.

99
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,340
And right behind them was Bristol-Myers Squibb, who had the much weaker statin, Pravastatin,

100
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,700
sold originally as the branded Pravacol.

101
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:44,140
Let's study Irishmen who have not had a clinical event, but also their LDL cholesterol is 180,

102
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,100
190, some more FH Irishmen.

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,860
So you're going from secondary prevention FH, basically to primary prevention FH.

104
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:59,840
And lo and behold, reduced virtually every atheros

105
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:59,660
to

106
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:27,500
takes

107
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:33,660
super cholesterol rich. The liver can pull cholesterol back effluxate so to speak from

108
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,820
the bile back into the liver. Why? Because what is also expressive to hepatobiliary surface,

109
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,580
the neem and pixi one like protein. So, azetomibe has two areas where it acts. It blocks the intestine

110
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,100
from internalizing cholesterol, but it prevents the liver from internalizing cholesterol from a

111
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:00,060
biliary source. Put them both together, you're depleting the liver of more cholesterol and the

112
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,660
liver needs cholesterol. There's a sterile sensor, the sterile regulatory element binding protein,

113
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,860
a nuclear transcription factor that turns on your genes that make LDL receptors.

114
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,140
So this is interesting, Tom. I mean, the beauty of doing these podcasts is I'm also learning as

115
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,900
we're doing them, right? And this is an enormous insight to me that I now remember you once telling

116
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,500
me about this, but it was just one of those things where I was like drinking from a fire hose and

117
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,900
clearly this detail left me. I'm generally not a huge Zetia fan, Zetia or zetomibe. I just generally

118
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,140
think it's kind of too impotent for real curiosity and sort of reserve it for situations where

119
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,060
patients can't really tolerate statins much and can't afford PCS, can't end inhibitors and all these

120
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:46,300
things. Historically, the way I've decided on who's a great Zetia candidate or not is looking at

121
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,700
phytosterols or looking at other proxies of absorption. And I've argued, by the way,

122
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,740
that the trials that suggested Zetia were not that valuable in monotherapy. It's never been shown to

123
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,460
reduce. No, they never did a monotherapy clinical trial. But they didn't even do a monotherapy.

124
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,900
It would work if you picked the right person. Well, that was always my argument, which was

125
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,580
it might have been a mistake in patient selection. You didn't select hyper absorbers. But what you're

126
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,980
saying would suggest that that would dilute my argument. Because if it only worked at the

127
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,940
Neiman-Pixie one-like-one transporter, the argument would be target your hyper absorbers.

128
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,540
But if it also works at biliary cholesterol, that shouldn't matter that much. No, but yeah,

129
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,980
no, that's part of hyper absorption. Because remember, if you're pulling it back into the

130
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,100
liver, you're depleting the cholesterol of a pool of cholesterol. But is the liver also then going

131
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,660
to be a dominant source of where we'll see cytosterol, campaignsterol, et cetera?

132
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:51,660
The final body preservation way, God forbid, phytosterols make it into your column microns

133
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,380
or your HDLs. And I can make the case that if they ever get into a cell, they're going to

134
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:03,020
injure that cell. But most of the column microns are going to deliver to the liver first before

135
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,060
it goes out in a VODL. So the liver will, if you're over absorbing phytosterols, a lot of them

136
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:16,700
do make their ways back to the liver. And the liver recognize them instantly is using your analogy,

137
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:24,300
that stupid bouncer in the intestine let you in. That Neiman-Pek in the ABC let you in.

138
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,860
We're getting ready. We're the backup police.

139
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,020
So you're the VIP lounge bouncer.

140
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,180
Yeah, right. So boom, out you go again. Now I realize those dopes may let you in again,

141
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,620
but you're going to come right back here and I'm getting you out again. So great analogy here,

142
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:50,300
the VIP bouncer. So who's to say? Zetomime is taken out or reducing the functioning of the Neiman,

143
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,460
and I think it's in both areas. Merck knows this. Merck didn't want to, that's too much education to

144
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,540
give. Let's just tell them it blocks cholesterol absorption. The gut would make sense to most

145
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,340
people. Most people, including lipidologists, don't even know the liver's involved in the process.

146
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,940
So it was like advanced lipid study and stuff. We don't have to confuse people with that. I've

147
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,900
written a number of articles on it. Zetom, Peter Toth and I think did one of our oral class articles

148
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,820
on the mechanisms of it and stuff. Yeah, what year was that? We just got to make sure we linked to

149
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:26,860
that one. I've come back with my years, but it's probably, I don't know, 2010, 2008,

150
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,580
but it's really with great diagrams, of course, showing you and explaining where Neiman Pick is.

151
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:39,660
And that's Toth, T-O-T-H. Yeah, Peter is one of the key and certainly mentors in my life. And

152
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,740
of course, Peter and my Deversons had me write the chapter in the book, Therapeutic Lipidology

153
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,340
on Phytosterolimia. And Davidson's at Northwestern, right? He's at University of Chicago. And look,

154
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,860
very early on, probably because I was just such a good educator on lipids, lipoproteins, and statin

155
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,700
mechanosuction, I was in very early in Merck's investigation of cholesterol absorption and

156
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:11,660
became a very effective educator on that too. And therefore, I had great contact with a lot of the

157
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:18,620
Merck scientists, the Swedes who all invented all these absorption markers and stuff and really

158
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:25,900
became subspecialties in lipidology and sterols as one of them. Why do you think that the Zetia

159
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,940
combination, synvastatin trials, so the main trial with Zetia was with and without synvastatin,

160
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,780
correct? No. Or sort of synvastatin with and without synvastatin. The reason why Zetia,

161
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:43,020
my mistake in so many damn hits is Merck's poor thinking of the type of trials that let's bring

162
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,980
to market to show that this is a great drug. And instead of just doing the damn outcome,

163
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,140
daddy, even doing a solid outcome trial in the right person, primary prevention, as well as,

164
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,380
of course, do your secondary prevention trials, even do that first if you want to. And if that

165
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,500
fails, you're not going to do anything with it. But let's, they wanted to just get so much to

166
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:11,980
market. What's the easiest thing to do? IMT. So let's take people with a lot of lipid abnormalities,

167
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,220
carotid intimal thickening, which is an ultrasound measurement of the thickness of your carotid

168
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,020
artery, which has some correlation with subclinical atherosclerosis and clinical events.

169
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,420
And that's unarguable. And therefore they're at risk. They have lipid abnormalities. Let's give

170
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,060
them as they're, you know, they're on a statin because we have to give them statins if they're

171
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,260
LDL is that a metric? Is that a whack? Let's give them one half of the group is that a mibe

172
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,700
in the other half placebo is that a mibe and let's follow their IMTs. We only have to do that for a

173
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,340
year or two and we'll see IMT progression in one arm and no IMT progression in the other.

174
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,500
Only did that virtually every lipid parameter, including APO big got better. Every inflammatory

175
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,900
mark has got better. Any IMT didn't change whatsoever. Meaning Simvastatin had the same

176
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,980
IMT as Simvastatin plus a satin. In a short time. And of course we now know that what happens to

177
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,380
IMT with any drug has virtually no relationship to clinical outcomes. So that's not a tool you should

178
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,260
be using to follow up and saying, look at it's like the coronary calcium score. It's not the

179
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,820
tool you should be using to demonstrate the efficacy. They should have looked at, but look

180
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,780
at this APO B reduction beyond what Simvastatin can do. Look at the triglyceride reduction. Look

181
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,300
at the CRP reduction beyond what Simvastatin can do. Or ox LDL or any of these things. At least say

182
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,060
that doesn't mean anything, but they had already polluted the minds that IMT was the best way to

183
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,460
check the drugs. Obviously nothing trumps a hard outcome. If you can reduce MACE, that's the way

184
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,500
to go. Sorry, major adverse cardiac event. But they picked the wrong shortcut is basically what

185
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,740
it comes down to. There were better shortcuts you could take. And who did that turn off big time?

186
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,660
The images of the world, the cardiologist who instantly dismissed the Zetimib as the world's

187
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,420
most useless drug. Most cardiologists don't even know what APO B is. And nevermind that. Look at

188
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,620
this as a potent thing. I hinted to you, I was very much involved with the Reloxifin, the first

189
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,740
CERN that came to the market. As good an APO B lowering drug as Zetimib is, which might have

190
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,180
portended great cardiovascular benefit to the CERN-Reloxin, which I believe it still has. In fact,

191
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,700
we have some. They did a big cardiovascular outcome trial where it was no, didn't hurt anybody,

192
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,580
but it didn't reduce events. But if you looked at the primary prevention people in that trial,

193
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:40,780
it did lower events. Now post-Hawk hypothesis generating data, but an 8%, a 5% lowering of

194
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,780
APO B mattered. And I think the right trial done with Zetimib and outcomes, it would matter.

195
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,420
But we're never going to know, and this gets to a really interesting point when it comes to

196
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,980
pharma's challenge of studying atherosclerosis today. The industry is now going to always be a

197
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,900
victim of the success of statins. It is unethical to take high risk patients and take them off

198
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,420
statins, despite what the internet wants to tell you that statins are evil and all that nonsense,

199
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,500
which I don't want to get into. But if you actually have any modest understanding of how these drugs

200
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,860
work, they absolutely save lives, especially when directed at the right patients at the right

201
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,060
times. What that means is you want to study another drug, you're adding it to a statin.

202
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:30,620
You are not doing it in mono. You don't get to do the study of Zetia versus placebo. It's not

203
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,900
ethical. No, but if you've picked the right patient. You think of a reason it would be ethical to do

204
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,260
such a trial. Yes. You take a bunch of highly, highly statin intolerant patients. So that would

205
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,980
be one which they're never going to do for a variety of reasons. But here's another, and

206
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,500
Merck did two big outcome trials where they could use. You didn't necessarily have to give a patient

207
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,700
a statin. They took people with significant aortic stenosis and of the belief, because

208
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,860
calcium and there's cholesterol in those aortic valves that if we could lower cholesterol and

209
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,580
people with aortic stenosis, we'd reduce morbidity related to that. And we don't have to give them a

210
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,220
statin because statins failed to reduce outcomes in people with aortics. Those trials were already

211
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:24,700
done. So they took the C's trial, aortic stenosis, zetimibe, and lowered it. And guess what? Did

212
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,420
nothing to end points related to, because they're enrolling people who need surgery for God's sake.

213
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,860
Yeah. I mean, again, that just, I mean, that kind of stuff just, it breaks my heart. It doesn't

214
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,100
anger me. It breaks my heart. But again, post hoc analysis, they did reduce the

215
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,580
ischemic events in that trial with zetimibe. So MI's went down and JYNA went down, but that's post

216
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,900
hoc analysis. And they got lucky. They didn't power for that. No. They may or may not be legit.

217
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,420
Correct. So you'd have to do another whole trial to do it again. And so, but they were hoping to

218
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,460
sneak by without doing. And the next thing they did was statins had failed to reduce clinical

219
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:06,060
events in people with chronic renal failure. Statins didn't work. So let's give them a statin

220
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:15,820
plus zetimibe. So you had the sharp trial renal, they had pretty bad GFRs. So everybody, two groups

221
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,540
got a statin, but the one group got a statin and zetimibe and the statin zetimibe group reduced

222
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:27,980
events. Whereas it's statin zetimibe works. So, and then of course they really had to wait for

223
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,020
the acute coronary syndrome, entirely improve it trial to really convince the cardiologist that,

224
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:40,540
yes, a little bit of extra B lowering, at least in that type of horrendously risky people matters.

225
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,540
And we now have had that replicated with the PCSK9 in it. And a great point you made up lately.

226
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:53,660
I mean, cost them God knows how long the money to do that, improve it trial. And they really had

227
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,420
extended a couple of extra years to reach statistical significance, which turns somebody's

228
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,860
loud mouse on the internet dismiss it because of that now. But it's a miracle and people that are

229
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:10,700
aggressively treated with statin, that you've reduced their LDLC to way, way down that just

230
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,620
by lowering it a little bit more, you can get extra event reduction. And I would never downplay that.

231
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,660
I think it's miraculous that it worked. And I think it's why it's miraculous PCSK9 inhibitors

232
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,620
work in trials where they're enrolling you where your LDLC is 70 for God's sakes, because you're on

233
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,420
a statin or statin-a-zetimibe. So that to me is one of the single most impressive things. And again,

234
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,820
we don't know if this is going to be true in 10 years. Again, all facts have a half life,

235
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,620
but from the moment we are sitting here today having this discussion, the fact that the Fourier

236
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:48,540
trial could take patients who had an average LDLC of 92 milligrams per deciliter on statins,

237
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,660
that means they are at the 10th percentile of the Framingham population on a statin. You are

238
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,860
going to add either a placebo or a PCSK9 inhibitor. In that case, it was Rapatha. You're going to

239
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:05,340
study them for less than two and a half years and you're going to even have the nerve to suggest

240
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,580
that might reduce an event and oh, it did. And if it doesn't, you've just wasted billions of dollars

241
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,980
of our money. What bean counter allowed that trial to proceed? I had been following this story even

242
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:24,220
before I became interested in lipids just out of interest in the novelty of you see a natural

243
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:31,980
experiment, which is PCSK9 hyperfunctionings, PCSK9 hypofunctionings, MR drug. It just became a

244
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,940
beautiful, elegant model. And then I remember-

245
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,420
The problem with real life takes decades to express itself.

246
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,340
That's right. And this all took a decade. And I remember thinking, especially once I got

247
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,420
interested in lipids, on the one hand being excited and the other hand thinking, there's

248
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,620
no goddamn way this trial can work. You could not reduce events in 2.2 years. And they did. And of

249
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,260
course, this is how naive I am. And this is why whenever people ask me for advice, friends will

250
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,740
say, Hey, should I invest in this company or that company? My advice to them is don't listen to a

251
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,020
single thing I say because you're asking a question, will the market value something which I have no

252
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,860
input on? I can provide you plenty of input on whether it makes scientific sense, but you have

253
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,460
to talk to somebody with a different skillset to understand if that's an investible thesis.

254
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,540
And so I remember Amgen kind of got hammered when the trial came out because people thought,

255
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:28,060
that wasn't enough of an improvement, which I thought it's amazing. And in reality, in fairness

256
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,980
to the market, I think what the market was basically saying is if you did the math based

257
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,540
on that trial under those circumstances, it would be a million dollars or more to save a life.

258
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,660
Well, that's a fair question for the market to assess. But if you look at it from a scientific

259
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,460
standpoint, that you could take that patient population and achieve that outcome, I think

260
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,420
it's one of the most remarkable things in cardiovascular medicine. And to your point,

261
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,940
it doesn't even speak to the patients that I have on PCSK9 inhibitors. My patients who take PCSK9

262
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:05,020
inhibitors are patients whom prior to this drug, we were flailing with what? Maybe some niacin,

263
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,860
maybe some monotherapy, Zettia, maybe the smallest dose of Livoloe that a human could tolerate and

264
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:16,380
getting woefully inadequate coverage. As you know, you're doing that off FDA label because they would

265
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,700
want to try. And they're paying out of pocket for it. So people who can afford it, but it's certainly

266
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:29,180
the genetic model tells them you're doing smart there. And what are your option is to, and I would

267
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,300
say, as you know, there are certain nutritional therapies that can send your LDL particle count

268
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,380
off the roof. And people are dismissing that as a meaningless biomarker now, because if you do this

269
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:47,420
biomarkers X, Y, and Z, and maybe even your waistline looks better, but APOB, LDL-P, doesn't matter in

270
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:53,580
them. Every single thing that's ever been done genetically or properly done clinical trial shows,

271
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:00,700
it does matter. And an individual, can I say, yes, it matters in you, it does not know. But if I want

272
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:07,980
to follow the bulk of the data, it matters over time. So maybe if I send your LDL-P off the chart

273
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,260
for two years, it doesn't matter. But do I want to do this for the next 15 years? If you're a young

274
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,940
person on a type of nutritional program that sends that through the roof, is that wise? How are you

275
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:24,060
going to be mad at me in 20 years or 15 years? Because I put you in the CCU. I don't know.

276
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:30,140
Yeah. How many Nobel prizes have been awarded within the field of lipid science? At least three,

277
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:37,020
right? Well, certainly you got the LDL receptor and you got two for cholesterol. And I'm guaranteed

278
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,260
on other lipid things or might be a Nobel historian. No, but it's interesting, right? I

279
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,660
mean, I think this is one of the things that, I guess there are a handful of discussions I have

280
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,500
with patients that I find frustrating. Some of them are frustrating because I have the same

281
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,140
discussion over and over again, and I've written about the topic and the patient just won't read

282
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,900
what I've at least written or at least take the time to read or listen to a lecture to then come

283
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,140
back and ask a question. So that's sort of frustrating for a different reason. But few things

284
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,260
frustrate me more than having to discuss things where the patient's baseline of knowledge is the

285
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,940
internet, which obviously you have all the signal can be found there, but the noise of course is so

286
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,700
great that you just don't know. But it's these discussions around cholesterol and statins that

287
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:32,060
I find most disturbing because in some ways it's partly the fault of the pharma industry, I think.

288
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,580
They have to take some responsibility for this, which is in an effort to get these drugs into the

289
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,500
majority of people who need them, there's been a need to simplify the message. And when you simplify

290
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,620
things, especially things as complicated as this field, you will undoubtedly make mistakes. You will

291
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,700
undoubtedly create confusion. And so now we have a system where most physicians don't understand

292
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,660
enough to actually explain to their patients why they are putting them on statins and which patients

293
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,020
may or may not even be good statin candidates, something I want to come back to because you

294
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,860
brought it up and I think it's worthy of its own sort of thread that will go down, which is this

295
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,860
whole brain issue. It's a totally separate issue, but it's this idea of failing to educate patients

296
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:22,620
and physicians has allowed basically a, I don't know, call it a militia of internet

297
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,100
noise that is just completely ungrounded in science. I mean, it's just completely ungrounded,

298
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,620
it's completely disconnected. And you already mentioned one example,

299
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,100
there's several others where a drug has come to market and then some harm would develop it. So

300
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:43,100
therefore you castigate every drug that's ever been invented as aha. Even though we just,

301
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,220
even though we just illustrated, right, you can take two drugs that inhibit two enzymes

302
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,620
and get different results and get completely different results. Same result, same result,

303
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,260
biomarker, but different outcomes. And so I always try to tell patients, although I don't know,

304
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,140
that probably falls on deaf ears, but you got to think of every drug like you think of a tool,

305
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:09,900
right? If you had a general contractor and he had a hammer, a screwdriver, a drill, a level,

306
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,820
a nail, a screw, et cetera, you would want to have the most tools in the tool belt. That's the first

307
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,860
condition. And the second condition is you'd want to know when to use each tool and what its

308
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:28,140
limitation was. And in that sense, the one view, which is statins should be in the drinking water,

309
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,260
and then the other view, which is statins cause everything from diabetes, Alzheimer's disease,

310
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,260
to global warming. Both of those views are so idiotic that I just, it's very difficult for

311
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,420
me to process that. And I've basically stopped engaging on Twitter with any of that discussion.

312
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,740
You can't either extreme. You got to get rid of those people very quickly, or you just get annoyed

313
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,940
all day long. And this is why it ultimately comes down to, and it's the way you practice.

314
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,700
So you got to individualize everything. So anybody who says statins belong in the drinking water,

315
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,900
that's no public health solution to anything, or nobody should ever take that's absurd.

316
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,500
Statins have tons of proof that you got to pick and choose your patients properly. And this is why

317
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,300
in the latter part of my career, I've developed so much more into biomarkers and other

318
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,420
risk assessment tools, because the better we can define an individual's

319
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:29,580
risk to any disease that he might be prone to, we can attack that disease through many mechanisms.

320
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:35,340
Part of an atherosclerosis is you got to attack APOB. If you don't, good luck. But the more you

321
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,220
understand, and that's where biomarkers and really not understanding the only understanding is

322
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,820
pathogen, he talked about a lot more clinical chemistry. The average clinician has no clue how

323
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,820
a laboratory reports a given concentration of anything to him. I'd like to go into triglycerides

324
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,940
because everybody thinks the whole world... People have no clue how laboratories assay triglycerides,

325
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,980
and maybe later we can talk about that. Well, one of the things that I've been pleased with

326
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:06,700
is once I got back into medicine, I realized I didn't know that stuff. And I have been really

327
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,940
fortunate every lab I have reached out to, to come and actually come to the lab and see how it works,

328
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,500
including THD. They've all opened the doors and said, come on in, Peter.

329
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,940
Oder, what the happier?

330
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,220
And they overdo it. I love it. They literally will walk me from every station to every... This is

331
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,260
where the specimen arrives. So you can see where the FedEx box dumps off the specimen. This is how

332
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,740
we take it out. This is how it's handled. This is boom, boom, boom, all the way to here are the

333
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,980
magnets where we're doing the NMR. And I've got precision analytics has also been great. I went

334
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,820
up and spent two days with them a few years ago. And I agree. I mean, again, not every physician,

335
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,540
I think has the luxury of time because they're clinically so much busier than I am. So I

336
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,420
certainly don't fault physicians for not doing that. But I do wish there was a way to make that

337
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,980
sort of experience more available to physicians because the more you understand how these tests

338
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,940
are done, the more you understand what your blind spots can be.

339
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,100
Yeah. And I was doing that for a while when I had more of a net presence with full lectures,

340
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,980
which I don't do anymore or they're not available on the net anymore. But just one other thing,

341
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,180
like I told you, most people are clueless that labs don't measure triglycerides. They measure

342
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,780
glycerol in your blood and they calculate that into triglycerides. But when you get an LDL

343
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,860
cholesterol or a total, let's talk about LDL cholesterol. The assay that's analyzing the

344
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,980
sterol in that particle has no difference. Does it know whether it's cytostral,

345
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,220
campestral, desmostral, cholesterol? No. All it knows is it's a sterol.

346
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,740
So it just knows it's not a stanol.

347
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:42,060
When you get LDL, it'll measure a stanol too, but they would likely be a small part of it.

348
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,420
So LDL cholesterol is really LDL cholesterol plus LDL cytostrul plus LDL-

349
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,460
Plus LDL desmostral.

350
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:54,140
And the other 48, then a little bit of whatever, stanols may have made their way into your body

351
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:59,180
too. So they don't know that. So in a person with phytosterolemia, a large part of that

352
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,180
LDL cholesterol value is a-

353
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,980
Is the phytosterol.

354
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,420
Yeah. But they don't realize. So they don't even know,

355
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,060
could a zetimibe have a better- If phytosterols are injurious, and I can make that case,

356
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,340
if I did a one hour lecture to using proper slides, you would be pretty convinced,

357
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:21,020
I want phytosterols not in my body. Zetimibe is the only way to keep them out there.

358
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,140
And wherever you're going next, my final word on a zetimibe would be,

359
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,540
if you're a big believer in this reverse cholesterol transport process,

360
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,620
which I've certainly expounded on now, what is the number one pharmacologic agent

361
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,220
that increases the amount of cholesterol that's winding up in your toilet bowl,

362
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,340
because it's in your stool?

363
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,660
That would be the best reverse cholesterol transport,

364
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,260
because the final common pathway to reverse cholesterol transport is,

365
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,620
it's out of the body. Zetimibe by far.

366
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,100
So I can make the case that if I wanted a lipid lowering drug,

367
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,580
and the drinking water is first line, it would be a zetimibe, not a statin.

368
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,380
So very interesting.

369
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,900
And very controversial.

370
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,100
Yeah. And the FDA would put me in a lunatic asylum,

371
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,220
and so would these so-called evidence-based guys.

372
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:20,940
But if you're analyzing this from cholesterol homeostatic pathways, it's a great drug.

373
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,820
Yeah. Well, we'll come back to all drugs.

374
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,460
I guess the next place-

375
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,420
Most of the time, we do have to lower APOB a lot more than a zetimibe could ever do by itself.

376
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,460
So the one that we've left out before we get,

377
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,260
I want to come back to niacin from a trials perspective,

378
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,420
but let's take a break right now, and then we'll come back and we'll pick it up with,

379
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,060
I want to talk about the fibrates, and then obviously I want to talk about niacin through

380
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,420
a clinical trial standpoint, and then we'll get into the PCSK9.

381
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,540
So we'll take a break right now, and we will come back.

382
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,020
Okay, guys. So we are now back.

383
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:01,100
We're going to slice this beginning into where we finished off.

384
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:07,020
So we had sort of more or less finished talking about zetimibe, also known as Zetia.

385
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,060
So we use this as an opportunity to go into the next drug.

386
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:18,300
So, all right. So Tom, that was pretty insightful stuff on Zetia, also known as zetimibe.

387
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,540
Let's move to another class of drugs that doesn't get a lot of use.

388
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,020
I can probably count on two hands the number of times I've prescribed it,

389
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,020
which is phenofibrate, or more broadly, it's class of fibrates.

390
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,820
What the heck are these drugs? How do they work, and when should we use them?

391
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,060
Well, if you practice in the United States, you do have two choices.

392
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,500
You have phenofibrate, and you have gemfibrazole, and they're both out there.

393
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,260
They're both can be attained generically nowadays.

394
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,300
So probably phenofibrate still comes in branded form.

395
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,020
That's the trilimbrics.

396
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,700
But you don't have to, that's one of them.

397
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,500
There are other branded forms available out there.

398
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,780
Gemfibrazole is a pro-drug. It has to be converted into the active fibric acid,

399
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,340
whereas phenofibrate is the active form right away.

400
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,180
So it's a little bit more bioavailable than it.

401
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,660
It's kind of interesting for the purists of the world.

402
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:17,020
Gemfibrazole has a monotherapy outcome trial given to veterans with coronary artery disease

403
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,580
who had low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides,

404
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,700
and it reduced events as much as the statin did in any trial.

405
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,700
So there's outcome evidence.

406
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,780
Was it independent of triglyceride level?

407
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,980
Yeah, it was independent, although they enrolled people.

408
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:37,500
But many of the men, the triglyceride levels were certainly not at super high levels or so.

409
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,940
But it was mostly low HDL cholesterol,

410
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,340
and virtually all of those people have some degree of triglyceride elevation.

411
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,340
But they tried to recruit people with what at the time was considered a normal LDL cholesterol also.

412
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,380
Which trial was this?

413
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,540
It's called the Veterans Affairs High Density Lipoprotein trial.

414
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,180
VA hit.

415
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't realize that was VA hit.

416
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,460
Yeah, and that was Gemfibrazole.

417
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,780
And remember, Gemfibrazole already had outcome data from the Helsinki Heart trial too.

418
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,300
So this would be the second trial.

419
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,780
Now, phenofibrate did come along with a couple of big trials,

420
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,620
but it missed the primary outcome but hit some secondary outcomes

421
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:20,460
for a whole lot of reasons, enrolling the wrong people, heavy concomitant use of statins.

422
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,460
Nobody in any Gemfibrazole trial was ever polluted by people sneaking in statins with it at the same

423
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,020
time. And clearly, whatever fibrates do, they do it differently than statins.

424
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,460
And the question is, can it contribute to a statin?

425
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,540
But those trials weren't designed to do that, but they were so polluted by statin use.

426
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,900
And I just want to clarify what you mean.

427
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,900
I know what you mean, but I want the listener to understand.

428
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,540
When you say polluted by, what we're talking about is statins are so potent

429
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:53,260
that when you include them in trials, you are making it much harder for a new drug or compound

430
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,380
that's being investigated to show its effect because you've effectively raised the bar

431
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,220
much higher for what needs to be done.

432
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,460
Sure. You've taken out one path. You're trying to prove with a certain class of drug that

433
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,660
via these mechanisms, very different works. And then all of a sudden, you're getting rid of all

434
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,740
the ApoB particles via the statins. And the statin is not given in a randomized fashion here.

435
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,180
Somebody takes it, somebody don't. Some doctors, you take this, don't take it.

436
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,500
Yeah. So that's the bigger problem scientifically. Of course, the counter-argument is, look,

437
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,180
ethically, we don't want someone getting randomized to no medication. And then the second issue is,

438
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,260
if the statin is the standard of care and therefore in the community, quote unquote,

439
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,300
that's the way these drugs are going to be used is with or without statins,

440
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,740
that's the way they should be tested. So it's all of these are fair points.

441
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,260
But when you ask a true efficacy question versus an effectiveness question,

442
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,700
the cleaner you can ask that question, the better. And there's no cleaner way to ask it

443
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,460
than to not have another drug involved. Sure. And by the way, when those trials were done,

444
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,020
it was not standard of care that you had to be on a statin.

445
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,500
No.

446
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,380
So they were legitimate trials that were ethical.

447
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,700
Whereas with the PCSK9 trials, it was statin.

448
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,420
You couldn't do it.

449
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,220
You couldn't have a no statin arm in those trials.

450
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:12,620
Right. That being said, these are all factors that go into the post-hoc, at least interpretation of

451
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,980
some of these trials. But anyway, so gemfribrazole worked. And it's kind of interesting. You couldn't

452
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,140
explain the benefit of gemfribrazole in the VA HIT trial. But even though it did raise HDL cholesterol,

453
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:30,780
it was like a milligram and a half increase and it lowered triglycerides, but not to a significant

454
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:38,780
extent. So why did it work? Or were there other pleiotrophic type effects of fibrates or doing

455
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,660
something that we weren't measuring with any biomarker or so on? I mean, some of that is

456
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,620
probably true. But then they did at least in a cohort of it, they did a post-hoc analysis

457
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:57,980
using NMR. And this was Jim Ockfos who did this. And he found out that the benefit of the gemfribrazole

458
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,220
in the VA HIT trial could be easily explained by what it did to LDL particle count, which

459
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:11,900
fibrates do lower in certain patients, depending on the causator. And it raised the HDL particles,

460
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,660
which had a statistically significant tie-in to the clinical endpoint. And that was the first

461
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:24,140
trial showing anything that raising an HDL metric in a clinical trial. Maybe if you want to do an

462
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,900
HDL metric, it's HDL particle count. So can we make sense of that in light of what we spoke about,

463
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,820
I don't know, 20, 30 minutes ago, which was raising HDL cholesterol without paying any attention to

464
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:42,220
particle number or particle size is so noisy and at least as likely to be counterproductive as it is

465
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,380
productive. Here you had two pieces of information, of the three at least, which is you had more

466
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:54,780
particles, you didn't change the cholesterol content in total, so you could make some inference,

467
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,820
again, not necessarily correct, but you could at least have a better guess that you could make

468
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,620
about the clearance of cholesterol through HDL. But of course, then you have to make an

469
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:10,460
assumption about the size of the particle, correct? Yeah, but very interesting in that NMR analysis,

470
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:16,460
whereas HDL particle went up, it was almost all small HDL particles. And for years, people have

471
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,100
been running around saying the small HDLs are bad and the big HDLs are good and there was

472
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:28,860
serious evidence that boy, what BS that is. So, fibrates help to dilipidate HDL particles. So,

473
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,340
if you're in the old school of, hey, you're increasing reverse cholesterol transport because

474
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,780
the fibrates upregulate the scavenger receptor B1, which would dilipinate your HDL. So of course,

475
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:44,380
your HDLs would become smaller and then the small HDLs could theoretically traverse back into the

476
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,900
arterial wall, pull cholesterol out of your sterile laden foam cells, the histopathologic

477
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:56,860
mark or the plaque atherogenesis. And by the way, and aside from that, when we talked about the

478
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:03,660
complexities of the reverse cholesterol transport process, one pathway I didn't mention, it's a sub

479
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:09,420
sub pathway, something called Dan Rader coined this term years ago, macrophage reverse cholesterol

480
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,020
transport. And he used to make the case, the only aspect of the RCT that matters as far as

481
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:21,820
atherosclerotic clinical outcomes is dilipidating the foam cells in your artery wall of cholesterol.

482
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,740
And that's really the job of an HDL. It can get into the artery wall very easily.

483
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,460
There's another ABC that facilitates that.

484
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:34,460
There's a couple of them. There's ABCA1, which will lipidate small lipid poor HDL particles,

485
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:41,340
but there's ABCG1, which will lipidate big mature HDL particles. So you have two ABC

486
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,940
sterile efflux transporters in the surface of macrophages that can pull cholesterol,

487
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,220
efflux cholesterol out of the macrophage into a big or a small HDL, which can then return to the

488
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:58,700
plasma and the small one to sturifies it becomes a mature one and gives it to LDL, which returns it

489
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:08,620
to the liver. So macrophage RCT, which is certainly an incredibly functional aspect of what HDL does

490
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:15,260
has absolutely no relationships to the serum HDL cholesterol level. So again, how do I know?

491
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,340
I can't use HDL C as a metric to tell me I'm dilipidating plaque in your artery wall,

492
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:27,500
but I can have some confidence that if I'm using a fiber, that's one of the things I'm doing. If

493
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,860
you do have plaque in your artery wall, and who doesn't? Now, so why do you think the fibrates

494
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,140
work best in patients with a higher triglyceride level? Because their main mechanism of that,

495
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,860
yeah, look, so they modulate HDL particles, but triglycerides and there's a lot to do with HDL

496
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:53,500
remodeling too, but fibrates mostly stop the synthesis of VLDL particles, triglyceride rich

497
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:59,100
LDL particles in the liver by depleting triglyceride pools in the liver. Remember

498
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:06,460
what determines the lipidation of ApoB in your liver. All humans make two tons more of ApoB than

499
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,740
they ever have a prayer of lipidating and changing into an ApoB particle. The vast majority of your

500
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:17,500
ApoB gets catabolized because it's unused. So people always, Oh, what produces increase ApoB?

501
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,940
Nothing. You, your liver makes way more ApoB than any human can ever use. Why do we think that is?

502
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,660
I don't know. People just assume, Hey, if you're making too much of something, you got to be

503
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:33,180
increasing the components. Except the one component we make too much of and never use is ApoB.

504
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,460
Yeah. I just, I wonder why that teleologically would be the case that we would make orders of

505
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:44,380
magnitude more ApoB than we could ever want to export. Well, remember, A beta-lipoproteinemia is

506
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:50,940
death. So you have to make ApoB particles. They transport energy. They transport phospholipids.

507
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,340
They transport fat soluble vitamins, the big particles. So you can't not have

508
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,460
ApoB particles in your glass. So you think it's just a margin of safety that is so big. It's not

509
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:05,660
even. Well, yeah, they just make far more than we ever use. So, and it's very easily catabolized.

510
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:13,340
So you have a lot of it, but what determines the creation of the VLDL particle in the liver? It's

511
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:20,780
the lipid pools, how much lipid is available to attach to ApoB and create a circular spherical

512
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:27,020
particle that's going to be ejected by the liver. And that comes down to the cholesterol pool and

513
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:32,700
the triglyceride pool that's in that triglyceride. It's the stored energy in your liver and

514
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,780
cholesterol esters, the stored cholesterol in your liver. Cholesterol, I think I mentioned before,

515
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,900
binds to the cholesterol ester binds to the, or free cholesterol binds to the ApoB first.

516
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,220
Some of the cholesterol will be esterified even in the circulation. Some in the liver via that

517
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:58,460
ACAT enzyme. And so then once you get the little primordial spherical VLDL, then triglycerides

518
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:04,460
are transferred in using MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. And now you

519
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:11,260
got a real VLDL ready to be shipped out. Other, as it passes through something called the space

520
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:19,340
of this, which is a little space between hepatocytes and the plasma, other Apo proteins join there.

521
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,540
But believe it or not, many of them, as soon as that nascent VLDL or whatever you want to call it,

522
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:30,140
enters plasma, a ton of the Apo proteins just leave your HDL particles. One of the functions of

523
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:36,060
HDLs, remember I told you to transport proteins, they transport a ton of these proteins that are

524
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:44,780
involved with lipoprotein catabolism. So C2 jumps off of HDLs, E jumps off of HDLs and goes right

525
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:50,780
onto the surface of a VLDL if it was not put there as it passed through the space of this. So

526
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:58,220
and they all determine the catabolic fate of that VLDL particle. So fibrates through several

527
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:03,500
mechanisms. One you get is an enzyme involved with the synthesis of triglycerides. You know,

528
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:09,740
it's adding fatty acids to glycerol. Fibrates are a potent inhibitor of that. So you just stop

529
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:15,500
triglyceride production with fibrates. Omega 3 fatty acids work in a similar way. So they

530
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:22,140
deplete the hepatic pool of triglycerides and you're going to make less VLDL particles. Remember,

531
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,620
a fiber is not going to blow away your LDL P like a statin does, but it's going to blow

532
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:34,940
a 10, 15% reduction in part, depending on the triglyceride richness, not the serum triglyceride

533
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:41,580
level, but the triglyceride richness of the core. So that's one of the. Now where's the backup of

534
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,940
free fatty acids? Because at some point, if you're not synthesizing as much triglyceride,

535
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,460
but you still have enough fatty acid, you're absorbing fatty acid, you're adipocyte storm.

536
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:59,820
But is there a hepatic backup of fatty acids? Or de novo synthesis. So in other words,

537
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:05,100
this would not decrease naphyl D if you had a patient, because at first blush, you'd think,

538
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,860
well, a fibrate should be able to reduce fatty acid to reduce fatty liver.

539
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:15,100
It was thought that for years, but it's just never been proven in a trial that that alone would do

540
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:20,940
it. Whereas actually, a Zetimibe has more data on reducing fatty liver than a fibrate still.

541
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,620
And most people all blame fatty liver on triglycerides. It's a

542
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:33,180
sterols that really cause a large part of the lipotoxicity that results in injury to the cells

543
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:39,100
in your liver. And there's a lot of animal data on the Zetimibe eradicating fatty liver because

544
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:45,340
they deplete the cholesterol pool in the liver. So it's not all fatty acids and triglycerides

545
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:51,580
that are causing fatty liver sounds like it is, but it's a toxic disease to the list, a lipotoxic

546
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:56,620
disease, and it's not all fatty acids. Although the fatty acids must play a significant role when

547
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,740
you look at, I shouldn't say must, but would suggest it because when you look at some of

548
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:07,820
the preliminary data now that's coming out with fructose elimination, meaning without restricting

549
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:13,340
any other macro or micro, it doesn't matter about, it seems that glucose is not that relevant,

550
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:18,380
even fatty acid composition, not that relevant if you completely restrict fructose.

551
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:23,340
Well, fructose is a major stimulus for synthesis of the triglyceride.

552
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,420
The triglyceride, but not to my knowledge. I don't know where it would fit into the

553
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,020
cholesterol synthetic pathway, right?

554
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:34,540
But look, it's a lipotoxic disease, but one of the major lipids that's causing

555
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,420
hepatocellular toxicity is cholesterol. It's just not all fatty acids. I don't know,

556
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,100
not implying or no role of fatty acids or fatty acid synthesis, triglyceride synthesis related

557
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:52,460
to fructose, but it's not all just somehow ignore cholesterol and you're going to get rid of fatty

558
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,460
liver. And you can't even separate the two because if you have a lot of triglyceride,

559
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,940
you're going to have a lot of ApoB particles that are part of the cause of that sterile toxicity.

560
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,220
Yeah, that's probably the bigger issue. It's very difficult to disaggregate them once

561
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:10,140
triglycerides are elevated. So really the ideal candidate for phenofibrate is going to be someone

562
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,380
with an elevated ApoB and an elevated triglyceride.

563
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:18,860
So if you look at, even if you take the two positive gemfibers all trials and the failure

564
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:23,500
of phenofibrate in a couple of trials, easily explained if you look at things,

565
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,500
but if you do look in the, and basically they enroll people that didn't have insulin resistance

566
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,220
or triglyceride rich lipoproteins and gave them a fibrate. So they designed a clinical trial where

567
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:39,580
nobody in their right mind would ever give that person a fibrate for a bunch of reasons. Hey,

568
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:48,620
but they were diabetic, but that was their field trial is 100% diabetics. And so they figured it's

569
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:54,460
a no brainer fibrates because of so many things that they do will improve outcomes. And then

570
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:00,380
maybe they would have, but the field trial was so polluted by statin, unauthorized use of statins,

571
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,140
inappropriate use of statins. Remember you're in a clinical trial. You've got the trialists watching

572
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:08,940
you, but you're going to your own private doctor. He can, and they were nervous at the time because

573
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:14,380
the statin data was coming in and it was almost, it was getting to the point where you're a bad

574
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,620
doctor if you don't give a statin to somebody with a lipid disorder. So they said, I know you're in

575
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,580
a trial. We don't know what you're getting, but I'm sorry. I'm not happy with your LDL cholesterol.

576
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:31,660
Take a statin. So it can Tammany, you know, we can always guess if we could have kept it as a pure

577
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:38,540
trial of fiber, but it worked in diabetics, but you know, that's just opinion. They didn't work,

578
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:45,500
but it did work in everybody who had an increase in triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol. It worked

579
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:52,060
in, that's where the outcome reduction was very interesting, which no other lipid drug has ever

580
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:58,540
done. It reduced several microvascular endpoints in those trials to retinopathy, amputations,

581
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:05,660
peripheral neuropathy, renal disease, even though phenofibrate can raise creatinine a little bit,

582
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:13,500
GFR improved and renal outcomes improved. So what other drug you got, you can give a person that

583
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:20,220
relessons his chance of a diabetic retinopathy if he's a diabetic, nothing. Now it's post-hoc,

584
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:24,780
it's secondary. Well, that wasn't put, that was secondary outcomes. So the trials weren't designed

585
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,420
to prove that. So they were hypothesis. You'd have to theoretically go back and do that before

586
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,780
the FDA would ever give you approval, but kind of interesting data. So, you know, I always made

587
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:42,380
the case, what? Fibrates reduce amputations, neuropathic ulcers, improve renal disease,

588
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:49,740
save your eyes. Why the hell are you not on a fibrate if you're a diabetic? You know? So again,

589
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:55,420
using that type of data and people use drugs for far less data than that. These are big, huge trials

590
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:02,140
and all of those endpoints have published their analysis of those secondary endpoints and everything.

591
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,340
What are the main side effects of Phenofibrate? Not a heck of a lot. You know, it's a pretty

592
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:13,500
well tolerated drug. Anybody can get any number of any side effects with it or so. People used to be

593
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,460
afraid of the increasing creatinine until in the field trial, there and a large number of patients

594
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,500
were doing creatinine clearance and that didn't go. So there was a muscular buildup of creatinine

595
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:29,820
had nothing to do with GFR or renal clearance of it. But there's nothing much. There are some drug

596
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,700
drug interactions. I mean, the Phenofibrate, Zetimide, I mean, they're both very well tolerated,

597
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,340
certainly more tolerated than statins. They really are. And you can make the case, at least in a

598
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:43,580
diabetic, which is probably going to be, especially with what we know now, the patient who's going to

599
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:50,300
wind up on a fibroid. Now most lipidologists wouldn't use it until you statinize somebody or

600
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,740
statinize them and zetimize them, got their ApoB as good as you can get. It's still not there.

601
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:00,860
Or triglycerides, which is what they're looking at too bad in my mind, but they look at that and

602
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:07,820
it's still high. That is the persons that were helped as at least in post hoc analysis of every

603
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:13,500
single fibroid trial, including the VA hit there and all the Phenofibrate trials. So that's pretty

604
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:19,580
much where it's reserved to people with these identified by hyper triglyceridemia patients or

605
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:25,900
so. And we're not talking about people with triglycerides of 400 or 4,000 where pancreatitis

606
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:31,660
comes into play. We'd probably all use a fibrate and a lot of other stuff there like Omega 3s there

607
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:39,260
on hopefulness that it would reduce the incidence of pancreatitis, not proven yet, but you would

608
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:45,660
attack that degree of hyper triglyceridemia. But the real world is people with triglycerides

609
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:54,220
between 130 and 300 that insulin resistant world, which we've already clearly defined as an ApoB

610
01:00:54,220 --> 01:01:00,220
disorder. So that's why your statinizetimibe is your first line drugs there. But if you didn't

611
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,900
normalize that with your statinizetimibe or indeed triglycerides were still high. So you're

612
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:11,020
presuming there still are triglyceride rich lipoproteins, whatever they may be, they might be

613
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:16,300
remnants. They could be LDLs that are triglyceride rich, especially in the lipidology community who

614
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:23,100
are way more familiar with fibrates. Although it's sadly a disappearing drug that even younger

615
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,580
lipidologists come on board have never been taught anything about middle go back and Rudy. So it's

616
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:33,580
the older guys like me who grew up through all those trials have lectured on have written on them

617
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:37,900
really have a better understanding of it than a younger lipidologist. And that's unfortunate

618
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:42,300
because we're going to have a potentially effective drug for a certain amount of people

619
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:48,300
is just not going to be used anymore. They're apt to use a fish oil instead, which because it lowers

620
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:53,180
triglycerides and it's so easy to tell somebody to take a fish oil, they're not going to go home

621
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:57,420
and read potentially scary stuff on the internet where they might with a fibrate or so.

622
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,380
They're going to still read it.

623
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:04,700
I guess on everything you're going to read some crazy stuff on the internet. So tragically to me,

624
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,540
because I don't believe there's when you say fish oil, is it more the EPA that's having the

625
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:14,620
effect on triglyceride or EPA would have more an effect on Apo B, but DHA is the triglyceride.

626
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:22,220
These are some recent brand new data published on that. Because DHA is just more potent on C3 than

627
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:28,220
is EPA. So I personally think you ought to give both if the primary reason you're going to throw

628
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:34,860
a fish oil, a prescription fish oil product at somebody is I need extra Apo B lowering.

629
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:41,420
Yeah. Then I would give high dose EPA, but I monitor omega three levels in everybody. So

630
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:47,260
not everybody can convert EPA to DHA. DHA is just as crucial for a lot of reasons. Your brain

631
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:52,780
sure wants it. So I will measure, Oh my God, I'm giving you a lot of EPA, but you're one of the

632
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:59,100
people who can't convert it to DHA. So then I would give you some DHA or you take the high

633
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:05,180
strength EPA and you throw in a lesser strength EPA, DHA combo tablet, which is how you get it.

634
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:11,500
As far as I know, there's no DHA only tablet. Where is EPA only tablets, certainly in the

635
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:17,260
prescription realm. So, you know, fine. If you want to lower Apo B, you can stick with your

636
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:22,860
Apo B, but I don't have, where's my evidence that if I use whatever fish oil therapy you

637
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:28,940
want to use, I'm happy. I'm improving microvascular disease. I have pretty serious evidence that I'm

638
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,580
doing that at least with phenofibrate. And the other thing, although they're both available

639
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:39,660
generically, sometimes these old drug companies, they'll force Genfibrasol on you. The real reason

640
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:45,660
when you ask me, are there any side effects about fibrates? And I did say the word drug

641
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:50,460
interactions. Phenofibrate has a serious drug interaction with Coumadin. So you have to lessen

642
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,380
the Coumadin dose there. We're using a lot less Coumadin. We're using much more eloquence these days.

643
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:59,260
Yeah. So that's becoming less of a big worry, but God forbid somebody's on Coumadin and you didn't

644
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:03,660
know that you threw big dose phenofibrate out on them. They caught you up with a lot of bruises

645
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:10,140
because you know, you potentiate the anticoagulant effect. Genfibrasol though, has her

646
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:17,820
raises statin levels through the roof. So there's much more incidence of myositis and rhabdomyolysis

647
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:22,860
when you use Genfibrasol with a statin and there's none of it with phenofibrate.

648
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:28,540
So if you want to use a fibrate, I strongly encourage you because it is generic nowadays

649
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:33,900
to use phenofibrate because you're going to be using it with a statin in the vast majority of

650
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:40,460
cases. So you don't have that worry, the muscular worry or so. So those are the two big things you

651
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:45,660
better know about fibrates you don't. And so most of the lipidologists released were somewhat

652
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:52,460
schooled on fibrates are going to use it in people where the triglyceride parameter is still high

653
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:58,140
because they're assuming, I think if we had better metrics of triglyceride rich lipoproteins,

654
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:05,340
maybe VLDL remnants or people who have high LDL triglyceride levels and they would likely be

655
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:13,500
people who have ApoC3 on their LDLs, we have some other evidence that I want to fibrate on board you

656
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,140
or so. So that's where that's going to get used, but that's not your average person who walks into

657
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,900
and if he walks into the average doctor, doc's going to be chasing LDL cholesterol or non-HL

658
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,540
cholesterol if they're a little more astute and they're going to stop there.

659
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:33,660
I want to come back to, I made a note here to come back to VLDL remnants. So I got another

660
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,940
question on that, but I do want to finish our tour of drugs. So the next drug to then get into,

661
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,460
we've already kind of talked about a little bit, but I want to come back to it because I know you

662
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,780
have a strong point of view on it and I got to be honest, I'm a little bit ambivalent. I don't know

663
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:51,340
the last time I prescribed this drug, but just from an intellectual standpoint, I'm always

664
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:57,340
interested in these drugs for people who can't go down a mainstream route and that drug of course

665
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:02,700
is niacin. So I don't think there's anybody out there that says, Hey, niacin is first line. I don't

666
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:08,220
think anybody would argue that. I think the question is you take a statin intolerant patient

667
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:15,180
who's got normal triglycerides, who maybe doesn't respond particularly well to monotherapy Zetia,

668
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:20,060
who can't afford a PCSK9 inhibitor and doesn't meet the regs for approval.

669
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:25,020
Are these patients who should be on niacin? So I'll go back to where we were earlier.

670
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,540
Niacin exists in an immediate release in a time release form.

671
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,620
Oh, two types of time release forms.

672
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,740
Oh, I didn't even realize that.

673
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,220
Intermediate release and sustained release.

674
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,300
So Niacin span, the Abbott version is.

675
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,820
That's intermediate release.

676
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,420
That's a prescription only product, which you're not going to get covered by any.

677
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,780
No, no, no, no. I learned that the hard way because I had a patient that was on it a few

678
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:48,860
years ago and he got a bill for like they wanted $3,000.

679
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,660
I didn't know what's that high.

680
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:52,140
It's ridiculous.

681
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:56,940
But if you want to, you somehow believe in niacin and want to give it a trial,

682
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:02,140
immediate release and you got to give it three or four times a day at massive doses,

683
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,660
you'll flush your brains out. Most people you're going to make the case you're not

684
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:09,580
flushing nice and isn't working in you. So let's talk about what the sustained

685
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:12,460
release is cheap. You can get sustained release.

686
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:17,100
But the biggest problem was in clinical trials, niacin being the toxic drug it is,

687
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:21,660
there's way more hepatotoxicity with sustained release niacin than there is with the short

688
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:26,060
release or the extended release where there's no hepatotoxicity.

689
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:29,260
So first of all, niacin became interesting as you talked about because it's known,

690
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,300
it's been known for a long period of time. It lowers cholesterol, lowered LDL cholesterol.

691
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:39,180
Yeah. And better yet, raise HDL cholesterol. That's what everybody always focus on.

692
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:44,620
Everybody since low HDL cholesterol is a risk factor. We now know April B related,

693
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:49,660
but whatever. Therefore, if low HDL cholesterol is bad, raising HDL cholesterol has to be good.

694
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:56,700
And niacin is the best product you had at the time. And then so trials were done with niacin.

695
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,100
And it's kind of funny because I listened to the podcast you and Ron Kraus did. And it was kind of

696
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:06,620
cool because you made the case a little bit for niacin, Ron Dick. But at the end, as you just said,

697
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:10,780
you're ambivalent to it. And even Ron says, I don't use it much anymore. And then you maybe

698
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,620
wind up, okay, it's a fourth line drug if everything else has failed. All right. I'm not

699
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,820
going to smack you around too much if you say that. And you can't prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor

700
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:24,060
because of cost. All right. But I think at the end of your go back and listen to you,

701
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,020
you both said, you don't use the darn drug anymore.

702
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,500
I think the difference is, and this is where I'd love to hear your take. I think Ron's point of

703
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:39,260
view was the niacin trials may have failed for the same reason that we would see the discussions

704
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:43,100
we talked about earlier, which was overly statinized patients. Now you kind of had a different point

705
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:48,700
of view on that, right? No, because there was never, they weren't statinized in any, certainly

706
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:54,380
the big, niacin has one trial designed to use niacin as a monotherapy. It was that big

707
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:01,180
coronary drug project, which was a multi-prong therapeutic trial where they randomized people

708
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:07,180
to a bunch of drugs. One group was given solely thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone lowers LDL

709
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:11,580
cholesterol. And all they did was kill people by with coronary disease, you give them thyroid

710
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:17,260
hormone. They're not, you make them hyperthyroid, not exactly good if you have coronary. So that

711
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:23,980
drug failed. They used a primitive fibrate, clofibrate. And there was some question of a

712
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:30,220
mortality adversity there. So that was hit number one on the whole foot. Nobody in America uses

713
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,420
clofibrate anymore. It's probably still available in Europe. I don't think anybody uses it.

714
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:43,660
So fibrate arm of that trial failed and they used estrogen given to men because, hey, women don't

715
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:49,340
get heart disease because they have high estrogen levels. If we just gave estrogen to men, they

716
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,900
wouldn't get heart attacks and they had immediately stopped the trial by precipitating heart attacks

717
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:59,020
in men by prescribing estrogen. So, uh, the only thing that would make that funnier was please

718
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:08,140
tell me they gave it orally. They did. Oh, yeah. That's the only form they had anyway. So yes.

719
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:16,380
And then they had a niacin immediate release niacin arm. And now you know, in a clinical trial

720
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:21,340
world, if you go down to the FDA and you just put a drug through a clinical trial, you better be

721
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:26,220
empowered or better not have been much toxicity and you better come in and have hit your primary

722
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:32,060
end point. Cause what will the FDA never ever allow you to discuss a secondary end point? If

723
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:37,580
you fail the primary end point, you've ever failed drug. All you've done by improving some secondary

724
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:43,500
end point is generated a new hypothesis. Let's go back and do a trial on those people. So what was

725
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,940
the primary end point in the coronary drug project? Favorite end point that people today love,

726
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:55,820
mortality and guess what? Niacin did to mortality. It worsened it not statistically, but it,

727
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,140
you could say it was no, but it was certainly going in the wrong direction.

728
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:06,620
So did I care when they did the secondary analysis that, but wait a minute, myocardial infarctions

729
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:11,660
were down. It was like me telling you in that aortic stenosis trial, but Hey, Zetia reduced

730
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:17,500
myocardial infarctions, but it didn't reduce the order. But in fairness, was the trial powered

731
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:24,380
for mortality or was it powered for, um, no, it was powered mortality was the end. The only end

732
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,780
point and all the arms that are trials, that's what they were looking back at. Then all cause

733
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:33,340
mortality or coronary mortality? No, it was all cause mortality. I don't know if it's kind of

734
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,820
amazing because I mean, that's very unusual. You're talking about a trial in the 1960s, you know,

735
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:43,420
early trials, you know what, how they picked end points and stuff, but niacin. So don't come

736
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:47,660
and preach to me that it hit secondary end points. Wait a second. Wait a second. Why is it that

737
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:51,980
niacin failed this trial in the sixties? And it was only three or four years ago that the,

738
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:57,020
basically the payer said we're no longer paying for it. Well, because we've had a lot of other

739
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:02,300
trial data that's come down since then where other types of niacin and probably better designed

740
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:08,700
trials also failed to reduce any end points. So the evidence became overwhelming. Show me a damn

741
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:14,060
trial where it works and then maybe we'll give you a, we'll pay for it. At least the FDA would

742
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:19,740
never give it an indication without primary end point that or so. Then the other thing they did

743
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:26,380
with that coronary drug project is they published like a 10, 12 years later, the most ridiculous

744
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:31,500
post-hoc analysis done on questionnaire sent to people who they could round up, who they

745
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:39,100
discovered you were in the original trial, small number and low and behold mortality was improved

746
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:45,900
in that group of people, coronary mortality. So there we have evidence that niacin improves

747
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:52,620
coronary mortality. But it's still, it's still a worst. It wouldn't even be published today. It

748
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:57,820
would be laughed at if you ever submitted it to a journal. The, the coronary drug project might,

749
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:03,100
I don't think a drug company would even send the coronary drug project to a journal nowadays. I

750
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:08,620
mean, they almost have to nowadays. No trials. They tried to hide them in the end, but you know,

751
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:13,260
that population, thank God it did. So we learned a lot about a lot of drugs in that trial. So there

752
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,740
was no evidence in a trial designed to prove niacin reduces coronary heart disease, at least the

753
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:24,780
level one evidence. Then of course guys said, well, angiography got introduced and it could

754
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:29,740
start doing regular angiograms. It's uncor quantitative angiogram where you're basically

755
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:34,700
looking at the lumen of an artery and seeing how much plaque may be extruding into the lumen.

756
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:40,620
You're doing nothing to what plaque made existing in the coronary artery walls. And in that trial,

757
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:47,740
using quantitative angiography, they did see a statistically significant improvement in the

758
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:54,940
lumen of arteries in people with coronary heart disease who took niacin. That's the Hatch trial.

759
01:13:54,940 --> 01:14:02,220
It's a small, well under a hundred people given niacin, no statins or anything. And

760
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:09,020
they come to this inclusion was a 90% event reduction. Not only did we see a fraction of

761
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:14,300
a millimeter increase in the lumen, and by the way, at that rate, it would have taken you 200

762
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:20,540
years to open up the artery seriously to hemodynamic blood flow. But in this small

763
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:25,020
cohort and a trial absolutely not empowered to look at clinical outcomes, there were less

764
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:29,660
coronary events in this trial. And that got extrapolated through a lot of disingenuous

765
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:35,100
marketing of people saying, oh, look at this. Nothing ever gives you that type of outcome

766
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,740
reduction in niacin, 90% event reduction. And there are a bunch of-

767
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:42,860
I'm sorry, just to make sure I understand that. I'm actually not even familiar with the Hatch trial.

768
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:49,020
So this had a hundred subjects in it? Yeah. So it's a 50 in each arm. It was a one-to-one

769
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,740
randomization? No, I think they just did the angiograms of people and they put them on niacin

770
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,940
and they did a repeat angiogram. Also a hundred people with a crossover. Basically you were your

771
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:02,780
own control. Yeah. Your baseline arteriogram was in your follow-up. Right. So I don't want to get

772
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:08,940
into a lecture on shitty science, but I can't help myself. To be clear, there's no placebo group here.

773
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:13,980
Right. In other words, you've completely eliminated the-

774
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,380
You're looking at angiographic changes from a drug.

775
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:21,420
No, understood. But there's a performance bias here. Every patient in that trial knows that

776
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,700
they are being given a compound that is supposed to make them better.

777
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,860
Yeah. And they're given other advice too. But-

778
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:31,260
But the point is you have no idea of knowing if they've changed any other behavior that may or

779
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,740
may not contribute to an improvement. Notwithstanding the bigger issue I would have with that trial,

780
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:41,500
which is that the millimeter change of an angiogram doesn't actually tell us anything-

781
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,260
We now know it's meaningless. Yeah.

782
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,820
About the vulnerability of plaque or true events.

783
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:52,060
No. And you certainly can't use that type of numbers of people to generate outcome data. They

784
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:56,860
did it. It was disingenuous for them to do it. It's absurd for anybody to ever talk about it,

785
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:03,180
but they did it. Because look, we were in our infancy on these drugs. We're learning as we go

786
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:08,300
along. It's easy for us to say that now and everything. And there were three or four other

787
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:14,380
nice and angiographic trials that sort of indicate, boy, the images look better when we follow up on

788
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:21,020
these people. And HDL cholesterol is going up, so what else could it be? And that HDL, that

789
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:28,060
HATCH trial was so impressive to people that they said, the only way we really can prove this is to

790
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:37,340
do a giant randomized perspective blinded trial where we give niacin, add it to whatever else,

791
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:44,140
get this HDL raising on top of we're already given drugs that lower LDL cholesterol.

792
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:44,940
Was this aim high?

793
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:50,860
So aim high was the first. So there'd been no aim high if there wasn't this HATCH angiographic

794
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:57,580
trial. First, that was the whole premise to let's spend money on the aim high trial because now we

795
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,780
are in the statin era where you do have to give everybody a statin. So we'll make everybody's LDL

796
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:07,580
cholesterol perfect. And by the way, if a statin doesn't do it, we'll add a zetimide to it also.

797
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:14,460
So we will get LDL C perfect, but HLC is still going to be low. So we're now going to add niacin.

798
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,460
And this, I think, is Ron's real point, which is when you look at that trial,

799
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:26,540
which was really then using niacin to increase HDL C in an already optimized LDL patient,

800
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,340
you missed an opportunity to actually add.

801
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:35,580
You didn't miss it because here's what happened in that trial. Niacin made the APO B go lower

802
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:41,100
than statin and zetimide did by themselves. So you got additional serious APO B lowering

803
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,020
and no outcome reduction.

804
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,220
So how much lower did it get?

805
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:51,980
Another 10, 15%. So here is a drug that is drastically further lowering APO B,

806
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:57,260
atherogenic particles. It's raising that, as I know, called a stupid metric, HDL cholesterol,

807
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:02,940
but it's not working. Well, I just told you, Reloxifen, I believe, works because it lowers APO B.

808
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:08,380
Why didn't niacin? Because it's got to be doing something bad that's aggravating your arteries.

809
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:13,820
And you give me a drug that causes acanthosis nigricans in human beings,

810
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:19,340
pathognomonic of insulin resistance. Why would I ever give that drug to a human being?

811
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:24,780
So niacin causes worsens. And the only person who you're probably going to wind up giving

812
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:30,060
niacin to is probably insulin resistant, identified by triglyceride HDL abnormalities.

813
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,180
You're giving niacin.

814
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,300
And it makes them worse.

815
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,140
I could read off 15 other well-known side effects with niacin.

816
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,300
Well, I don't think anybody would dispute that.

817
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:44,140
And so why did it fail, even though it lowered APO B, beyond what a statin is that a margin?

818
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,340
That's a very interesting point, right? And I guess the only, if I could wave a magic one,

819
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:50,700
the only other question I'd have, which is purely intellectual, again, I don't really

820
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:56,620
think niacin has a place anymore, is could the wash on mortality, despite the reduction in APO B,

821
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,700
be explained by the worsening of insulin resistance?

822
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,700
Can you explain by something?

823
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,540
Yeah. No, but I'm saying like that would actually be an interesting thing to try to quantify.

824
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:10,540
It could be explained by GI bleeding above an acute niacin, well-known to do that.

825
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:16,220
It could be explained by all sorts of hematologic parameters, disruption, platelet reactivity with

826
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:21,420
niacin, well-known, and a bunch of other things that niacin has been implicated in.

827
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:27,580
So to me, every time you use a drug, you're using trial data benefits versus risk.

828
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:33,100
And I see some benefits to niacin. I don't think the A-chill is a benefit, but lowering APO B,

829
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:38,220
I'm going to always consider that a good benefit. But if it's nothing is happening,

830
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,100
there's something adverse going on, which I don't understand.

831
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:45,980
Look, they took that extended release product off the market in Europe based on this trial.

832
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,500
In the United States, it's still here, but you just made it unaffordable.

833
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,500
So they don't want you using it. Immediate release niacin is you're basically

834
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,820
prescribing a vitamin at a mega dose. One other little aside, because I noticed people who take

835
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:05,580
niacin, remember these trials were done with massive pharmacological doses of niacin.

836
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:12,060
They didn't tell, take a multivitamin with niacin in it, which has nothing to lipids or lipoproteins.

837
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,980
So if you want to be a niacin player, will you in the coronary drug project,

838
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:21,260
immediate release niacin was four grams a day. Try that. Sustain release niacin.

839
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,980
Wait, so those patients took one gram four times a day.

840
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:28,620
Yeah. Oh, they worked their way up to it. You know, so because many can just,

841
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:33,260
hey, if this is as much it can take, that's what you, but they got them in pretty high doses.

842
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:37,980
I will say, you know, stay is kudos to the docs in those trials and everything.

843
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,860
Extra number of people.

844
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,620
Kudos to the patients for tolerating it.

845
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:47,660
Yeah. Listen, if you get not only flushing, but massive paritis can occur when you use

846
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:52,860
immediate release. It's a scary phenomenon to a layman who experiences that, who hasn't been

847
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:58,940
worn. I remember a call I got early in my practice, like at two in the morning, the guy thought he was

848
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:05,340
going to die. He had dialed 911 because he just had an extensive, periodic reaction and he felt

849
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:09,740
his whole body was on fire. If he'd had a swimming pool, he would have jumped into it. But he called,

850
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:14,060
cause he just thought his body was burning up. And I just said, you're going to think I'm crazy.

851
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:20,860
Chew two aspirins and just call me back in an hour. It'll be gone. And I forget whether he

852
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:26,380
did wind up in the ER or not. Now that's an extreme reaction, but it occurs. So, and look,

853
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:31,420
I took an eyes in a couple of years on myself on some of the beliefs before we knew a lot of this

854
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:37,020
because I could not tolerate a statin or statin is that a mime and I had an APO B issue and I

855
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:42,220
hadn't learned about intermittent fasting or follow the low carb diet at that time. So

856
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:47,820
unfortunately, nice and didn't even lower the APO B and me did nothing, but I tolerated it

857
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:52,780
for whatever reason, but did nothing. And who knows what it did to my insulin resistance,

858
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:59,740
you know, for me, nice and sort of grew out of favor with patients even before the final trial.

859
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:05,420
I think just the exacerbation of insulin resistance became sort of problematic. And by the way,

860
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:09,820
the last trial, they did another trial cause it was a branded product. They took that extended

861
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:16,380
release nice and, but they combined it with an anti itch compound and aha. So everybody's

862
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:21,900
can tolerate nice and now, and they added it to a statin. That was the heart protection study thrive.

863
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:28,300
And it was basically a duplication of the aim high trial, nice increase in HDL cholesterol,

864
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:34,540
further reduction in APO B and zero outcome change. And a lot of toxicity,

865
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:41,420
much of the toxicity is glucose extubations. You're going to aggravate glucose. So Europe decided

866
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:45,820
that's it. So they took that combo pill off the market. I'm sure you can still get immediate

867
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:51,740
release nice in Europe if you want it, you know, it's a vitamin for God's sakes, a mega dose. So I

868
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:57,900
just don't like people out there who want to extol nice and fine, but don't start telling nice and

869
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:03,820
has a lot of data. It's got zero data. And these are the same people who bash vibrates, who do have

870
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:10,700
two large randomized, destructive trials, Helsinki and VA hit with vibrates. And yet

871
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:15,580
they never consider a vibrate. They always tell you nice and it's the better drug. And at least

872
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:21,740
in the field trial, nice or phenofibrate had all these microvascular. There's no prayer, nice and

873
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:27,420
reduces diabetic and retinopathy, amputations, kidney disease. But yet there was that battle.

874
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:32,700
People bashed vibrates, hold them to the high standard of you got to hit your primary end point

875
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:37,340
and they never held nice. And, and to be honest with you, the same, that's what Ron Krauss did in

876
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:41,580
that study. So I understand what he's talking about. There is some data if you want to extol it,

877
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:47,260
but it's not the type of data you and I use anymore. So we'll go from the step child to the

878
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:53,340
poster child, which we've already kind of alluded to, which are Rapatha and Praluent, these two

879
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:59,020
PCSK9 inhibitors. And I'll just give a little bit of background, obviously. What's the name of the

880
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:04,940
fellow up in Toronto who actually discovered this? Oh, I thought it was in Texas. Hobbs,

881
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:11,020
Helen Hobbs was the first person who discovered the PCSK9 expression.

882
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:14,780
No, I mean the actual family of PCS, the PCS family.

883
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:19,500
Yeah. Look, there's at least 10 members in the family. They've been around forever.

884
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,780
Yeah. And I think it's, I don't know who discovered number nine.

885
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:26,620
I think because I grew up in Toronto, I have a fondness for remembering anything that anyone

886
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,900
from Toronto did, but we'll figure it out in the show notes. I could be making all this up.

887
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:34,060
But I do think there was, there's a guy in Toronto who actually discovered this family

888
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:40,060
of proteins, but you're right. Then the genetic evaluation, genetics, gain of function,

889
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:44,460
loss of function, explains how the gain of functions were discovered first. Correct?

890
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:51,740
Yeah. So I'll explain this really quickly and briefly. You can expand upon it. PCSK9

891
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:59,340
degrades LDL receptors. So if you have a gain of function, you are more rapidly degrading LDL

892
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:04,940
receptors on the liver. You're going to have a decrease in your clearance of LDL. You will have

893
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:10,140
a higher LDL. These patients had very high events. In fact, these patients are makeup, what, five to

894
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:14,140
10% of what we would diffusely refer to as familial hypercholesterolemia. That's correct.

895
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:19,740
It's one of the many, and I think in one of your podcasts, people don't understand FH could be a

896
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:24,060
thousand different disorders. FH is a phenotype in my GFR. And they're not all autosomal dominant.

897
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:31,420
Some are heterozygous disorders of various genes, but the phenotype is an LDL cholesterol above 190.

898
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:37,100
And then you fast forward to about 2004, 2005, maybe it was 2006, but even I remember this.

899
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:42,300
And again, this was before I became kind of a lipid wannabe, but I would still read the New

900
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,700
England Journal of Medicine just because it's sort of interesting. And there was the discovery of the

901
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:52,540
hypo-functioning PCSK9 folks. And I really do remember this, and I'm surprised I remember it.

902
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:57,100
Actually, I discovered an African-Americans first. I believe in a Jackson trial down there.

903
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:01,900
That's exactly right. Yeah. And these were folks that were walking around with an LDL cholesterol

904
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:09,260
between 10 and 30 milligrams per deciliter, and they were completely event-free. And of course,

905
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,460
the first 100%, but significant reductions. Dramatic reduction. And the reductions,

906
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:19,020
I believe we actually went back and did a calculation to see if their reductions,

907
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:24,380
how congruent they were with some of the more recent Mendelian randomizations.

908
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,540
And they're very similar. And it's not surprising because that's effectively how you would model

909
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:34,300
a reduction, a lifetime exposure reduction. The thing that interested me, because I remember at

910
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:39,420
the time, like many people, I'm sure, I sort of had this concern, which is, well, God, if

911
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:44,140
cholesterol levels, I mean, I now realize I was being naive. But my concern was, God,

912
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:48,860
if your LDL is low, that must mean you can't make hormones. It must mean that you're going to

913
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,940
get some other awful disease. And so the interesting thing to me was those people

914
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:58,140
didn't have any of these other phenotypes. They didn't seem to have deficiencies or deficits as

915
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:03,740
a result of that. And of course, I think that trial is what was the catalyst for Amgen,

916
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:07,820
Sanofi, and these other companies to start working on these drugs.

917
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:12,540
Yeah. So by the way, they've since studied in these people where they've blown away LDL

918
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:17,020
cholesterol at 10 and 15, there's been zero effect on reproductive hormones or

919
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:21,420
adrenal cortical hormones. It goes back to what I just told you. Those glands synthesize all the

920
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:27,420
cholesterol they need. They get it from HDL. So none of them are waiting for an LDL to show up with

921
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:32,620
cholesterol to keep them functioning. So it's all the nonsense you get when you go to a health food

922
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:39,420
store or a gym where the guy tells you, you got to raise your HDL cholesterol or something. You're

923
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,740
helping your testosterone level in the blood. It has nothing to do with it. Or if you deplete

924
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:48,140
testosterone, because God forbid you're actually taking a stat and you're screwing up your

925
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:51,420
testicular function, you're not having nothing to do with it.

926
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,500
Yeah. Yeah. There doesn't seem to be any evidence of that.

927
01:27:54,060 --> 01:28:01,260
So that put into perspective, yes. But so the genetic model is if you got an LDL cholesterol

928
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:06,940
of 10 and 20, nothing's going to be wrong with you. And you're certainly going to have far less

929
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:12,780
coronary heart disease. And when we talk about loss of function, that means your LDL receptor

930
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:18,700
half-life is much longer. We didn't get into it before. We told you the liver makes LDL receptors.

931
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:23,820
Theoretically, any cell could. If your liver expresses an LDL receptor, how long does it stay

932
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:31,180
there for? Two, three days. And it grabs your ApoB particle. It brings it into an endosome.

933
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:36,780
But then the LDL receptor travels back to the surface, grabs another one. I used to, those of

934
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:42,060
you old enough to use to watch the Addams family on TV, it's like things hand coming out of a box.

935
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:46,460
It's the LDL receptor, grabs something, pulls it in, but things arm comes right back out again.

936
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:53,180
But if in some people that LDL receptor might be catabolized in the lysosome endosome, then it

937
01:28:53,180 --> 01:29:00,300
can't go back to the surface. And PCSK9 is a major determinant of how quickly you recycle your LDL

938
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:07,900
receptor. You do not recycle it. So by putzing with the expression of that enzyme, we can give

939
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:14,220
you much further expression of your LDL receptor and as you said, enhance clearance of your ApoB

940
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:21,180
particles, including not only your LDLs, which are 90 to 95%, but you're clearing remnants also.

941
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:27,180
So for those who believe, oh, remnants are the bad guys. That's not a reason not to use the PCSK9,

942
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:32,700
but I'll get rid of them also. Now, we're going to come back to this because I want to talk a

943
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:36,780
little bit about the brain and you alluded to it earlier, but I don't want to derail us now. So I'm

944
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:45,180
saying this just as much to remind me is to remind you. You can come up with multiple ways to lower

945
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:51,020
LDL. When I say LDL, I'm talking the actual particle number. You can inhibit the synthesis of

946
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:57,020
cholesterol, which in turn also activates the clearance, or you can just go directly after the

947
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:01,260
clearance. So the former would be how a statin works. The latter would be how a PCSK9 would have

948
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,260
better work. You can also make the evidence that if you're depleting the cholesterol pool in the

949
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:11,900
liver, you'll make a few less either LDL particles or VLDL precursors, which would contribute to a

950
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:16,300
lowering of ApoB. And that is a small part of both the zetimides and the statins. In fact,

951
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:22,300
most of it is clearance, but you are producing less particles too. But this is an area where I

952
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:30,220
do probably have a slightly different view from the mainstream lipid world, which is certainly

953
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:35,020
there's a favorable hypothesis that's the zero LDL hypothesis, this idea that-

954
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:36,140
Well, you can't make LDL.

955
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:41,340
Well, not only can you. I think let me rephrase that. What they're basically arguing is the lower

956
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:47,260
you drive LDL, the better. And I do take a little bit of issue with that because I think it depends

957
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:52,860
how you lower it. And it also depends on what you define as better or worse. If you're talking

958
01:30:52,860 --> 01:31:00,220
about lowering LDL reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, I think that's pretty clear. But

959
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:07,660
at some point, my concern has always been if you lower LDL through cholesterol synthesis inhibition

960
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:12,780
a lot, do you impact other organs, namely the brain?

961
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:18,780
Well, you don't know. Remember when you're measuring whatever LDL metric, it's what's

962
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:23,980
floating around your plasma. The only place I'll make that's irrelevant. You're not measuring

963
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:30,220
cellular cholesterol based on an LDL cholesterol. So you tell me what your LDL cholesterol level is.

964
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:37,420
I have really no clue are your cells synthesizing or not synthesizing, exporting, effluxing or

965
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:45,580
whatever to particles that carry cholesterol. But as I think we indicated earlier in our talk today,

966
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:50,860
look, it is integral. Cells do have to make cholesterol. So you certainly wouldn't want to

967
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:56,380
stop cholesterol synthesis in probably any cell on your body because the cell membranes, if nothing

968
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:01,980
else requires it. And we talked about the brain certainly, it's the only way it has cholesterol

969
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:07,740
as it makes it. So if we did know we were inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the brain,

970
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:14,380
would you be really that comfortable with that? And if you were, is there certain limits where,

971
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:19,420
I wouldn't mind reducing it a little bit, but how much? Because that brain really needs it.

972
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:25,260
And the brain has no other source of cholesterol. Now, nowadays, with the exception of patients who

973
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:30,700
have been on a statin for a long, long period of time, when it comes to patients that are relatively

974
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:35,900
new to statins, they're really only a handful we're really looking at today, right? Lipitor

975
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:41,500
and Crestor are doing the lion's share of the work. For some patients who are very sensitive,

976
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:47,100
we'll use Livoloe or we'll use Pravastatin, but we're not really doing much in the way of

977
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:53,020
Simvastatin or any of these older drugs, correct? No, if you're following guidelines, what you're

978
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:59,020
doing is prescribing high potency statins or at least moderate intensity statins. So if you want

979
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:05,420
to follow the guidelines, the only choices you have are Resuvastatin or a Torvastatin,

980
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:12,380
Lipitor or Crestor at a 40 milligram or above dose for a Torv or a 20 milligram or above dose for

981
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:19,420
Resuva. If you're stuck, they would allow you to sneak Simva 40 milligrams into there, but that's

982
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:24,860
at best a moderate dose statin. 80 milligrams of Simva has been taken off the market.

983
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:27,260
Yeah, the side effects are quite high with Simva.

984
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:33,100
Well, Simva, because of a variety of pharmacokinetic reasons, has a ton of drug-drug

985
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:39,740
interactions and we're in a polypharmacy world, whereas there's far less with a Torv and infinitely

986
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:45,820
less with Resuvastatin and the Pravastatin you mentioned, Livoloe or so. But I would make the

987
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:49,980
case that if you want the statin has the most data that you're going to do good, it would be

988
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:56,220
Pravastatin. And Pravastatin, very cheap, it's almost free if you go to a drug store for it.

989
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,780
It's just not that potent, right? Even at 80 milligrams.

990
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:03,420
You know, but if you use the outcome trials, they got the exact same 25% reduction as any

991
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:10,700
a Torv or Resuva trial ever did. So again, Bristol used to explain that to magical mystery

992
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:15,820
pleiotropic effects of Pravastatin. But I would make the case that, all right, if APOB, LELP is your goal.

993
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:20,460
I would also argue though patients are sicker today. I think patients are more metabolically

994
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:25,820
ill today than they were, meaning I think the Crestor trials have a higher bar to cross than

995
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:28,220
the Pravastar trials. But that again, that's just my bullshit speculation.

996
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:33,660
Oh, I think the lipid level enrollments with the West of Scotland were twice as horrific as any

997
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:34,620
Resuvastatin trials.

998
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:37,820
Yeah, they were, but they had FH. So these are patients who weren't necessarily

999
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:39,020
metabolically ill.

1000
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:43,820
Yeah, I understand what you're saying. So the end of this discussion comes, I got a lower APOB.

1001
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:50,460
So yeah, unless somebody is incredibly statin sensitive and there are ways of predicting

1002
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:56,860
statin the responsiveness or hypo responsiveness, if you want to just routinely pick for a Resuvastatin

1003
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,460
and go down that path, I'm all free.

1004
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,860
So what do we know about CNS penetration of these statins?

1005
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:05,100
Well, we're good today. And look, I jumped on Resuvastatin bandwagon, because of being a giant

1006
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:12,300
Pravastatin guy, because it's one of the, what I would call hepatoselective statins. It's

1007
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:17,180
hydrophilic. It goes right into the liver. It doesn't need transporters. So you don't need much

1008
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:21,980
of a drug to get in the liver and hit the cholesterol synthesis and upregulate LDL receptors.

1009
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:26,700
So Resuvastatin, five milligrams is all out of people. You don't need 40. They want you to use

1010
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,700
40 because in a trial, that's the dose they use where they got heart attack reduction. But

1011
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:36,140
since it all comes back to APOB reduction, use whatever it takes to get your APOB down. In my

1012
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:41,260
mind, you know, that's not how the guidelines exactly figure out how to do it. They like to

1013
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:46,860
give level one star rated evidence or so. Mine would be a lesser degree of evidence.

1014
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:54,940
So you pick, so they get in the other drugs are not as hydrophilic. So the only way they get into

1015
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:59,180
the liver is various receptors, pull them in. There's a whole variety of transporters that pull

1016
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:04,140
molecules into the liver, but they're subject to interference with a ton of other drugs that may be

1017
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:08,860
in your system or other molecules. So you don't have the clean pharmacokinetics like you do with

1018
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:16,140
Pravastatin or Resuvastatin. That being said, we you're talking, you want to introduce the brain

1019
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:21,980
into the discussion. Now, all statins can get into the brain. They can cross the blood-brain barrier,

1020
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:27,660
but the statins that cross it much easily are the lipophilic statins because they have to pass a

1021
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:35,820
lipid membrane, a blood-brain barrier. So atorvastatin, simvastatin get into the brain more easily than

1022
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:42,220
do lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin. Wait, say that again. The most lipophilic one.

1023
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:46,620
The lipophilic statin's easier to cross the blood-brain barrier. Yeah, which is atorvastatin and simvastatin

1024
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:53,260
are the two biggest. And lovastatin would probably be the worst. Whereas Pravastatin would be far

1025
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:58,700
less, Edward would Resuvastatin. You have that fluvastatin, sort of a water-solubastatin is probably

1026
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:03,420
more in the class of Resuvin travels. And what about Livolo? So Livolo would be the same. It's a

1027
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:10,300
non-lipophilic statin. So if you're worried about statins getting into the brain, you might want

1028
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:17,100
to choose the hydrophilic ones or so. But the only concern I might have is, well, if those statins

1029
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,940
are getting into the brain, it's great to read those cholesterol synthesis in a liver. I'm going

1030
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:25,740
to upregulate LDL receptors. I don't know that I want to do it in every cell in the body, but I'm

1031
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:33,100
probably not. I know I'm not with any of them. Totally inhibiting cellular synthesis cholesterol.

1032
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:38,300
But the brain, it's way more dependent on cholesterol. And then we have studies of people

1033
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:42,780
with Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive, their brains need to be depleted of cholesterol

1034
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:47,340
to variable degrees. Now, Tom, I'm just going to stop you right here, because if I had a dollar

1035
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:54,220
for every time I had a brutal argument with a cardiologist about this point, because up until

1036
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:59,660
this point in the discussion, if you're a card-carrying lipidologist or a cardiologist who really

1037
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:05,260
understands lipids, you're kind of on board. You're in the camp of let's lower LDL. But I do get

1038
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:11,020
patients from time to time who are more than at their LDL goal, meaning their LDL cholesterol is

1039
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:16,620
40 milligrams per deciliter. Their LDL particle number is 500 nanomole per liter. These are people

1040
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,780
in primary prevention, but let's assume they have a calcium score of 800 or something. I mean,

1041
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:25,020
they're very high risk. But I look at that and I say, well, gosh, their desmosterol level is

1042
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:30,140
unmeasurable. Well, you're advancing the discussion here. So let me continue down this pathway.

1043
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:36,860
So if cholesterol synthesis is so crucial for the brain, man, I need a biomarker of brain

1044
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:44,220
cholesterol synthesis. Now, very interesting. We talked about two pathways of cholesterol synthesis.

1045
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:50,060
One is the desmosterol, a block pathway, and the other is the leftosterol, the Candage-Russell

1046
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:56,700
pathway. Well, it turns out the block pathway predominates in the brain. So would,

1047
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:02,700
should I do spinal taps and measure CSF desmosterol in these people?

1048
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:03,580
I'm going to go with no.

1049
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:09,180
Yeah, be a tough, by the way, don't leave. I'm going to come back and just do a quick

1050
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,700
spinal tap on you today.

1051
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,900
Hang on, just wait there in the waiting room.

1052
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:17,900
I imagine even trying to do a clinical trial where that was what you're trying to prove

1053
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:24,380
and enrolling people into that. And also it's going to happen. But so people know we can measure

1054
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:28,460
desmosterol in the blood and there's lots of articles correlating that with cholesterol

1055
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:34,700
synthesis as there is with the leftosterol. And you can make the case in peripheral cells,

1056
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:39,660
maybe even the leftosterol is a more dominant pathway. They're probably both at play, but also

1057
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:44,860
the desmosterol pathway is much more important in younger newborns and youth rather than older

1058
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:46,220
people. So.

1059
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:46,940
I didn't know that.

1060
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:52,700
Yeah. So maybe that's a critical patient if you for whatever reason want to give a statin to

1061
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:56,940
a really young FH, a homozygous FH patient.

1062
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:58,620
I've been involved in one of those cases.

1063
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:07,180
So my desmosterol be money. So here's what we know. So when people with these cognitive

1064
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:12,140
myocardial impairment or various dementias have low cholesterol when you wind up autopsy in their

1065
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:18,700
brains, they do have low desmosterol in their cerebral spinal fluid, suggesting that they do

1066
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:23,340
part of their impairment or cholesterol depletion in the brain is their, their brains aren't

1067
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:31,180
synthesizing as much cholesterol and nice trial where they done this, they car, they did do spinal

1068
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:37,500
taps on the people in the trial measured CSF desmosterol and they measured serum desmosterol.

1069
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,460
What was the correlation?

1070
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:45,580
Identical. The R that is very high in there. So now all of a sudden a serum

1071
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:55,420
desmosterol level becomes a biomarker of brain synthesis of cholesterol. And there are what is

1072
01:40:55,420 --> 01:41:01,660
by far, it's not even close. The biggest reason that a brain has suppressed as most

1073
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:06,540
of cholesterol synthesis, it's statin use. Yeah. So I would make the case.

1074
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:10,220
So I'm going to pause here because I know what you're going to say and I agree,

1075
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:15,500
but I'm going to give you the counterpoint before you even start. So you can color your commentary.

1076
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:22,860
The heterogeneous population based data say statins reduce Alzheimer's disease.

1077
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:27,340
Nothing serious against that. I mean, yeah, you want to start looking at crazy,

1078
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:31,500
which is not to say that the trials are using that as an outcome. It's just that we're not

1079
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,140
seeing an increase in Alzheimer's disease in the statin trial.

1080
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:39,260
Dementia is a multifactorial disease. A lot of things that contribute to dementia. So in general,

1081
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:46,140
the vast majority of people take statins, wind up demented. No, absolutely not. There's not any

1082
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:51,420
evidence that is shown at least from the cumulative statin trials or so. But are there certain

1083
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:57,580
individuals where that is? And by the way, in these trials where they measured low, both serum

1084
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:03,580
and CSF desmosterol, guess what? There was a significantly increased incidence of Alzheimer's

1085
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:10,780
disease and mild cognitive impairment. So yes, this is all at the hypothesis level. It's looking

1086
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:17,260
at a biomarker, not clinical endpoint trials, but that's enough evidence to me to say,

1087
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:23,980
if I'm going to give you a statin, I'm going to push it to, for a variety of reasons, much rather

1088
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:29,980
give you a baby statin plus a zetimibe. And by the way, baby statin plus a zetimibe gives you

1089
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:35,740
the exact same ApoB reduction as does the gorilla statin, the mega dose of it. But I think with a

1090
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:40,460
lot of other additional benefits a zetimibe brings and certainly less potential side effects and

1091
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:47,020
certainly less cholesterol synthesis suppression, including the brain. So if I were giving you

1092
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:54,540
massive doses of your favorite gorilla statin per guidelines, and I simply measured serum desmosterol

1093
01:42:54,540 --> 01:43:01,980
on your next visit, and it was low, that tells me I've over, I've stopped the synthesis of

1094
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:07,900
cholesterol too much. So Tom, you are the only other person in this space who will entertain

1095
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:13,420
this discussion with me. I mean, I just can't tell you how many times I get into debates with

1096
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:19,580
other lipid folks who say that is complete and utter nonsense. And they point to the absence of

1097
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:25,420
a huge upsurge in Alzheimer's disease in the statin trials. Now, to which I say the following,

1098
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:30,700
one, I am sympathetic to what you were saying, because I realize that all of the anti-statin

1099
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:36,060
rhetoric out there is so illogical and they throw everything in the sink, right? Like,

1100
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:39,820
but, you know, oh my God, it causes, you know, diabetes, does it? Well, yeah. And a small,

1101
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:43,580
small subset of the population, we're going to see a slight uptick in the risk of diabetes,

1102
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:48,940
especially with a torvostatin. Does that mean statins cause diabetes and it needs to be avoided

1103
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:54,540
as a result of that? No. Does it, you know, do a subset of patients end up getting, you know,

1104
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:58,300
muscular pain? Of course, it's probably five to 10%. It might be even a bit higher depending on

1105
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:03,260
the nature of the trial. But what I think is really going on here, this is my hypothesis.

1106
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:09,660
Alzheimer's disease, as you said a second ago, is multiple diseases. It is not a disease, right?

1107
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,420
I'm talking cognitive impairment.

1108
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,860
Yeah. But even if you talk about Alzheimer's disease, even if there is a final common pathway

1109
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:19,660
or a set of pathognomonic features that define the disease, I think there are several ways to

1110
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:25,900
get there. There is a metabolic way that people get there that is probably explained by the

1111
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:30,700
increased incidence we see in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in patients with diabetes

1112
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:36,060
and insulin resistance. But there's also a vascular component that I don't think gets nearly enough

1113
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:40,380
attention. There's a guy named Jack Delator who I, you know, it's funny, I reached out to him

1114
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:46,620
recently to interview him for my book and he's on a research sabbatical in Spain for two years. So

1115
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:50,220
I'll probably interview him by telephone, but I would like to eventually have him on the podcast.

1116
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:55,260
But he's done some of the most impressive work on looking at this sort of vascular hypothesis of

1117
01:44:55,340 --> 01:45:02,300
Alzheimer's disease. My hypothesis is this. On average, you take a group of patients with

1118
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:07,420
terrible dyslipidemia, you give them a stat and you improve their vascular complications,

1119
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,660
which include atherosclerosis, and you're probably actually reducing Alzheimer's disease

1120
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:15,260
in those patients. In other words, all things coming, are you better at being at the 90th

1121
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:19,900
percentile or the 10th percentile of ApoB with respect to Alzheimer's disease? You're better off

1122
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:25,100
being at the 10th percentile. However, I think to your point, there's going to be a subset of

1123
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:29,660
patients in which you go too far. These are patients who don't synthesize a boatload of

1124
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:35,900
cholesterol. They're probably hypo synthesizers to begin with. And you statinize the hell out of them

1125
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:41,020
and you are increasing their susceptibility. Now, again, that's the problem with everything I just

1126
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:46,860
said is it takes more than a tweet. And for anybody who throws it in your face, there's no evidence of

1127
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:52,300
that in any statin trial. Say, oh my God, I've read the FDA package in sort of every single statin

1128
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,620
that's on the market and cognitive impairment is listed as a potential side effect of every

1129
01:45:56,620 --> 01:46:01,820
single statin. Did the FDA just make that up? No, it's been seen in clinical trials.

1130
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:06,620
Now, did the FDA make this link? Because I'm talking about papers. There are actually papers

1131
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:11,180
that show, and we will absolutely link to this because I think this is one of the better papers.

1132
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:19,340
It's about six years old, but it looks at desmostrol as a continuous variable. So in the same way that

1133
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:24,700
you might look at PSA as a continuous variable, it can be anything and try to decide the question,

1134
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:30,860
at what cutoff does having a high PSA suggest that you have a high enough risk of prostate cancer?

1135
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:35,900
But using desmostrol as a continuous variable and using a statistical technique called receiver

1136
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:44,940
operating characteristic curve production, they showed that once desmostrol fell below 0.5,

1137
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:51,340
the AUC, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic, was somewhere between

1138
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:57,100
0.8 and 0.87, depending on the study and depending on gender. And again, maybe it's more detailed than

1139
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:03,580
people want, but the higher that number, which varies basically between 0.5 and 1, one is a

1140
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:09,020
perfect study. One, there's no such thing as a diagnostic test with a one. Five is a coin toss.

1141
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:16,700
When you get into the 0.8 territory, that's a very powerful predictor. Correct. So I think it's

1142
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:20,700
careless to dismiss that as a potential player. We've given you a lot of the plausibility and

1143
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:26,700
there's even more. If you tell me you are a doctor who has prescribed a lot of statins and

1144
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:33,180
look, I was in practice 37 years, 20 of which I was writing as much statins as anybody. If you tell

1145
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:39,020
me you've never seen cognitive impairment in a patient, you start on a statin, you're a liar or

1146
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:43,340
you're a fool, or you're not questioning your patients when they come back because it does occur.

1147
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,860
I don't know what a lot of reasons it could occur. And look, who doesn't have a day where you wake up

1148
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:55,580
thinking I'm a little foggy today for sun and it's nothing to do, but it happens. So we've now got a

1149
01:47:55,580 --> 01:48:01,100
plausible explanation why it happens. If the real reason you're prescribing a statin is APOB

1150
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:07,820
reductions, I got a lot of ways of getting your APOB to go without maximizing a statin. So in my

1151
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:14,220
mind, if desmostrol is below a certain population percentile cut point, I've inhibited cholesterol

1152
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:21,660
synthesis. I probably get no bang for the buck on further LDL or particle lowering, APOB lowering,

1153
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:28,540
by having you continue to take that. I can clear APOB furthers by stopping cholesterol absorption

1154
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:33,420
back into the liver and the intestine with a zetimide that does nothing to cholesterol synthesis,

1155
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:41,180
a PCSK9 inhibitor. So with most people, baby statin and a zetimide will give you the exact same APOB

1156
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:47,500
reduction of your gorilla statin. And we have outcome evidence in the improve it trial that

1157
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:53,740
is zetimide and statin for the guys, I got to see outcome data, you got it. So therefore I use it as

1158
01:48:53,740 --> 01:49:00,620
a tool to monitor statin therapy. Most people and they also these people would argue you I will bet

1159
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:05,900
as much money as I have in my bank account days never. They couldn't even tell you what desmostrol

1160
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:10,780
is. They've never read anything about the cholesterol synthetic pathway and they don't know what they're

1161
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:17,020
talking about. Yeah, I mean, look, in the end, I think this is such a contentious topic because

1162
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:23,580
we're getting so nuanced on something now and the world has lost its appetite for nuance. People want

1163
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:28,380
to know statins are good or statins are bad. And everything we've just said says it depends.

1164
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:35,100
It depends on how you use them. You can give too much of these things. That doesn't mean they're

1165
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:39,500
bad because what we've also done, I realize, and I've been very deliberate about this because I

1166
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:44,300
think it's important to show both sides of this. We've also given the statin deniers and the statin,

1167
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:49,340
you know, the statin conspiracy theorists a great ammo, which is aha. If Dayspring and Attia are

1168
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:53,500
sitting there bashing statins and talking about mild cognitive impairment and they take that to

1169
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:58,060
discussion out of context, they're going to say, well, statins should be outlawed. Yeah. But of

1170
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:04,140
course, any reasonable doctor, if a patient came in complaining of statin or a cognitive impairment,

1171
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:08,860
they'd pretty much stop all drugs because that's the first explanation a drug is causing it. So

1172
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:13,260
it's not like I'd continue to force you to take this statin if you were cognitively there. I mean,

1173
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:17,580
if the listener is sort of saying, what the hell is the takeaway from this? I think it's a couple

1174
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:24,300
things. One is statins are not bad. Statins are still the mainstay backbone of anti lipid therapy.

1175
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:31,260
Be thoughtful about which ones you use. You know, Tom, I have moved more to Crestor over Lipitor,

1176
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:36,460
though I still use Lipitor quite a bit. And in many ways, I'm sort of slowly migrating patients

1177
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:42,940
who seem to have no difficulty from Lipitor to Crestor. Two, I'm actually going back and using

1178
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:47,500
Prevostatin much more than I used to. I'm surprised at how much I find myself reaching

1179
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:52,780
for Prevostatin in a patient who doesn't tolerate, who has a slight CK bump, even if they're not

1180
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:57,500
complaining of pain, if they're getting a CK bump that, you know, their CK goes from a baseline of

1181
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:02,380
50 to 300, even if they're asymptomatic, I don't like it. So I'm going to switch that. By the way,

1182
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:08,220
I would chip in at CK elevation has nothing to do with statin toxicity or stansosis, silly

1183
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:13,980
biomarker. Totally. And evidence with total. Well, I know it doesn't correlate that well with my

1184
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:18,620
site. First of all, before you ever do that, make sure you have a baseline. Yes, of course. A lot

1185
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:24,060
of people working out. Not even working out. They just have high CK levels, African-Americans. So,

1186
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:29,340
but I didn't realize that. And you know, when you should stop a statin when it's like a 10,000 fold

1187
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:35,260
elevation of CK, then you might start to worry. So CK, there's any number of guidelines issued on

1188
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:41,420
it's not a biomarker that is of any use to you. And all you do by doing CK is when somebody goes

1189
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:47,020
from 50 to 300, they get the bejesus scared out of them and they stop their statin when there's no

1190
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:52,220
reason. The reason you should stop a statin is if they're having myopathic symptoms, aches or

1191
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:58,860
weakness, then I don't care what their CK. I did not realize that. I'll get some info to you on that.

1192
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:05,660
So stop monitoring CK. And if they come in and tell you, hey, Peter, I'm feeling pain or you

1193
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:09,740
somehow are doing some muscular strength testing, or they tell you, I don't get out of the chair as

1194
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:15,100
much proximal muscle weakness, stop the darn statin. Yeah, well, those are the easy cases.

1195
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:23,500
But don't use CKs to dictate your statin therapy. I think the point here is I can't imagine giving

1196
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:29,900
any lipid lowering therapy without being able to measure phytosterols, stanols, and desmostrol.

1197
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:34,700
Some with you there, most lipidologists would not be, but they just have not studied the data like

1198
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:41,340
they should. And even if what we're just talking about is pure hypothesis, what harm would you be

1199
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:45,820
doing by lessening the dose of a statin and substituting a little azetimibe, or if they

1200
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:51,740
could afford it? You can make the case if it was free as Pravastatin, let's just use PCSK9 inhibitors

1201
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:57,740
for God's sakes. Because, you know, whatever other minor side effects of statins, I don't

1202
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:02,140
think we've seen much with PCSK9. No, I mean, of course, more time to go. I was just about to say

1203
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:06,540
that the skeptic will counter that Tom and say, but we only have three and a half years of data

1204
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:10,780
with these drugs. So right now, we're not going to use that except for people who can afford it or

1205
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:16,220
our nightmare patients where a third party will finally pay further. So, so it's not like docs

1206
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:21,180
are going to run out tomorrow and start injecting everybody with a PCSK9 inhibitor. They're not

1207
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:25,980
because there's handcuffs on them, but there's no handcuffs on you using generic azetimibe to a

1208
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:34,380
baby statin. As you have to buy onto, LDLC is not your best surrogate of atherogenic lipoproteins,

1209
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:40,780
ApoB or LDL particle count is. And if that's your real goal of therapy, then you got a lot of options

1210
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:47,500
available to you. Now, the one thing I used to use the combo lowest dose statin possible coupled

1211
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:53,740
with is that a my if there was some evidence of even mild elevation of phytosterol and stanel,

1212
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:58,060
one thing I've noticed and I can I've just been a little delinquent. I don't think I've gone back

1213
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:03,260
and looked at the trials. Did the trials show an increase in transaminases with that combo?

1214
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:08,540
No. And I think the only trial it would show you'd have to look back at sees where

1215
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:13,980
improve where they use the Simba statin and is that a my improve it? Yeah. And there was nothing

1216
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:19,100
more than I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I keep seeing these. And again,

1217
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:23,260
I will tell you there's not a package insert in the world that tells you you should even be

1218
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:29,340
following aminase to judge statin or anything going on in the liver as a result of a statin.

1219
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:33,980
There's no correlation whatsoever. So I'm repeating them and all the time because maybe

1220
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:39,100
it's a biomarker of fatty liver or something else, but not a statin toxicity. It's not.

1221
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:45,500
You know, so don't ever let a patient stop because they've doubled their AST,

1222
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:52,380
whatever aminase you're measuring level on the statin, not related to anything. You've got great

1223
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:56,300
medical legal safety because that's what the guidelines are telling you to do. There's not

1224
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:00,860
a statin in the world that they're all out of the package insert that you should be following liver

1225
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:04,860
function tests. Yeah. Again, I think part of the problem is like you, I'm going to follow liver

1226
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:09,020
function tests regardless. I have a very different view of how these things should be.

1227
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:13,740
I mean, yeah, so they have other use and who's not going to do it's part of your chemistry

1228
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:17,740
profile that you're probably doing on every patient every time. So you're going to see them,

1229
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:21,660
but you don't necessarily have, but be prepared when the patient calls you up in a panic. That's

1230
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:27,100
not in your differential diagnosis of why the aminases are changing. Yeah. I don't know, Tom.

1231
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:33,900
I still, I'm going to go back and look at this entire documents where they've analyzed all the

1232
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:39,100
data in the world on aminase and statin therapy, it's in consequential. But I mean, I'll give you

1233
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:44,940
a silly example, which is I have seen the following at least four times. You take a patient, you make

1234
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:49,260
they're on a statin, there's no other change. And the only thing you do is you add Zetia.

1235
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:55,420
And then their next blood test, their transaminases have doubled. And then the only thing you do is

1236
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:59,980
stop the Zetia and it returns to baseline. All right. So something is happening, but is it

1237
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:05,660
doubling of a transaminase of that etiology of any concern to you? So fine. If you want to stop

1238
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:09,980
it and see, go ahead. And if that's going to occasionally limit how much Zetimibe you're

1239
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:16,300
going to use in a patient, okay, figure out how else to lower EBOB. So fine. I understand there

1240
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:21,500
are things that'll come into play in an individual patient where the data doesn't support it, but

1241
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:25,180
you're making an individual decision. Sure. That's my point. Of course. That's my point.

1242
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:29,900
You've got to be able to make an individual decision, which is what we're saying with the

1243
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:34,780
dysmosterol level. Again, I think most patients, again, if someone's listening to this and they're

1244
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:38,060
freaking out because they're like, what the hell are these guys talking about? We are not saying

1245
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:41,980
that statins are causing dementia. What we're saying is, at least what I'm saying, I'll let Tom

1246
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:46,140
clarify for himself. There are going to be a subset of patients whose risk of dementia does

1247
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:50,780
go up with a statin. And it's our job if we're prescribing those drugs to know exactly who those

1248
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:56,540
patients are. And to the best of my reading of the literature, plus understanding the nature

1249
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:02,380
of the biology, it's probably the patients in whom we overly suppress synthesis for whom they

1250
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:07,100
don't make that much to begin with. Suppress cellular synthesis, which has nothing to do with

1251
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:13,100
the amount of cholesterol you measure in the blood. Great point. And cholesterol synthesis is not

1252
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:20,540
affected per se by PCSK9 inhibitors. Isetimibe is interesting. If you go with isetimibe monotherapy,

1253
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:25,580
you'll actually get a little reflex increase in cholesterol synthesis. Yes. And vice versa.

1254
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:29,420
So if you go with statin monotherapy, a hyperabsorbed statin. So there's a little bit of

1255
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:35,180
physiologic homeostasis going on. And this is like that's not changing levels to these toxic levels.

1256
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:39,100
And that, believe it or not, has become one of the times when I like using Zetia,

1257
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:43,820
is if I've got a patient who really needs a statin because when you just look at their

1258
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:48,540
numbers, you get the sense that this is an LDL clearance deficiency. But you want to boost their

1259
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:53,580
synthesis a little bit. You do it concomitant with the Zetia and you'll sometimes get that reflex.

1260
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:59,340
And I argue with clinicians too, who they are doing sterile testing. So I identify my

1261
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:04,540
hyperabsorbers and I surely make sure isetimibe is on board my APOB lowering therapy in that patient.

1262
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:11,340
But I'll make the case for you. Even if you do those markers and you're a normal absorber of

1263
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:17,420
cholesterol, but you have an APOB problem, even by taking a normal absorber of cholesterol and

1264
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:22,060
making them a hypo absorber, the genetic model is they live longer if they have genetic

1265
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:28,700
loss of function of anemone pixi when they're protein. So even in a patient who's not

1266
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:33,340
hyperabsorbing cholesterol, you do get additional APOB lowering, maybe not at the same magnitude,

1267
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:38,140
but you get it. And you're changing them into the genetic model of longevity, maybe,

1268
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:41,020
you're certainly keeping phytosterols out of them.
