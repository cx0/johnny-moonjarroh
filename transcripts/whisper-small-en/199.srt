00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,760
Hey, Ryan. Looking very forward to having this discussion with you today. I've been a fan of

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,480
yours for a long time, actually. And running is kind of like, I don't know, it's sort of like F1.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,520
It's not really that popular in the United States, although it's becoming more so. I mean,

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,360
obviously, Netflix's Drive to Survive series has made F1 very popular. And I think also people

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,920
are starting to become a little bit more aware of runners after. Well, I don't really know what it

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,040
is, but I think Kip Chogi's two hour sub effort kind of got a lot of people in this country excited

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,360
about it. But anyway, I think for me, the interest in running started because I used to swim with

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:55,880
Alan Webb. So back in the early 2000s, when he was this phenom who sets the high school record for

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,320
the mile, and I'm swimming next to this guy in the next lane and just became kind of interested in

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,160
his journey and then obviously learned about you and the other runners of that generation. So anyway,

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,120
your transformation has been remarkable. I almost don't know where to begin. But let's just start

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,840
with because some people won't know a lot about you. So you grew up in Big Bear, right?

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,520
Yeah, correct. Southern California.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,100
Yeah, but it's at altitude. So it's not like beach Southern California. People think so,

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,320
Cal, they think Orange County or San Diego, right?

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,400
Yeah, I mean, Big Bear is a really cool place to grow up. I mean, we're like two hours from the

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,720
beach. So it's one of the few places you can both surf and snowboard or ski in the same day. So,

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,600
yeah, we grew up with snow. I lived a mile away from Snow Summit. And it was just like,

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,920
honestly, it's like the perfect place to grow up as a distance runner. When you look at the best

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,440
guys in the world, they're oftentimes coming from Ethiopia and Kenya, places that are at

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,880
7,000 feet altitude. And that's exactly what I was at. And so kind of just found myself in like the

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,680
perfect scenario for a distance runner and even in the sense of being able to live high and train

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,920
low. So when I was growing up in high school, my dad was my coach, started a cross country and track

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,600
team just so I could run. There wasn't even one available at Big Bear High School. And we would

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,880
drop down like twice a week, drive an hour down to sea level, get on a track at sea level, run some

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,320
super hard interval sessions, and then pop back up to altitude. So it was, you know, we're kind of

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,400
before our time in a lot of ways, you know, like the research and studies are showing how beneficial

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,480
that kind of training is, but we were just doing it because it just made sense. It was the environment

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,040
in which I found myself and pretty crazy to look back on it now and see how things like that really

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,120
do kind of contribute to the trajectory of the path that you're on.

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,000
And I suspect there's something to being in that environment when you're young during the formative

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,160
years of your cardiovascular system. I look at like my daughter who's 13. And she loves volleyball and

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,600
basketball, but doesn't like cross country or track. And I, I'm trying not to be a psycho about it. But

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm also sort of telling her like you have this really narrow window in which your cardiovascular

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,720
system is quite malleable. And like I'm very fortunate that because I was involved in boxing,

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,600
I had to do so much cardio, both aerobic and anaerobic training during those formative years.

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,640
And even though I'm a fraction of that level of fitness today, I can still ride on, you know,

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,360
what I had then, but I feel like if you don't push that system hard in your teenage years,

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,320
it's very hard to develop it later. I don't know if that's true, but that has been my impression.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,280
And then to take that one step further, which is what someone like you has been able to do,

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,200
to have that altitude arbitrage is I think just unbelievable.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh yeah. I mean, I, the effects of cardio at a young age definitely play on later in life.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,720
Like now, for example, like I really don't do much cardio at all. Like last year I had nine

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,720
months where just focus on strength training, just trying to get as big and strong as I can.

46
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,880
My weight went up from 167 to 192 over nine months. And I was literally doing zero running,

47
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,680
none, like no other cardio, no biking, no swimming, nothing. I hopped on a treadmill

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,440
at the end of that period when I was at my heaviest, just to see like, let me see where

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,480
my miles acts. I was going to train for this challenge that I tried this 500 pound deadlift

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,680
into a sub five minute mile. So I was like, let me see where I'm at. Just starting wise,

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,280
hopped on a treadmill after my weight session, 518 for the mile with zero, zero training.

52
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,520
And I think that goes to kind of like what you're talking about. Like when you develop that early

53
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,080
on and like you just need little touches here and there, I take pretty short rest between a lot of

54
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,280
my lifts and that's like enough to keep me in 518 mile shape without even trying, you know? But

55
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,560
yeah, I mean, there's a ton of interesting things. Like they talk about kids who are born at altitude

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,600
and how they have greater potential for cardio development over time. But it's kind of interesting

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,160
like looking at my family, I'm in the middle of five kids, my youngest brother Chad, he's super

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,680
into endurance stuff. And he was born at altitude where I was born in Seattle, Washington.

59
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,000
So how old were you when you got to Big Bear? I was five years old, so pretty young. So I spent

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,480
most of my time at altitude, but he was born in altitude, but we didn't really see a whole

61
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,400
drastic effect. I mean, he was a really good runner. He won the national championships in

62
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,280
high school, cross country. So a stud runner went to Oregon on scholarship and all that stuff. But

63
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,800
between him and I, there's not like a huge difference in what we've seen in terms of

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,400
our top end potential for cardio. Well, the other thing that you alluded to that I wanted to talk

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,120
about later, but we might as well just talk about it now because you brought it up. And I think

66
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,240
it's an important thing that I became pretty interested in many years later when I was

67
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:59,080
swimming and trying to look for ways to improve was basically the matrix of living high,

68
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,640
living low, training high, training low, and coming up with what was the optimal scenario.

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,560
And it turned out, as you pointed out, this is something for which we have a very clear answer

70
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,920
today. The answer wasn't clear 20 years ago. Today, the answer is crystal clear, which is the best

71
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,520
results are attained from living high, training low when it comes to intensity. So you can live

72
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,200
high, train high for low end aerobic efficiency, but you have to train that anaerobic peak at sea

73
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,800
level. And so I remember swimming up in Colorado Springs at the Olympic Training Center when I

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,680
would go up there for some swim camps and stuff, and being a guy who lived at sea level who would

75
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,640
then go to try to push it hard in Colorado. I mean, it was a total waste of time. I mean,

76
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:50,680
it was a complete waste of time to try to do any top end anaerobic stuff when I hadn't had any

77
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,200
ability to do that. In fact, it was the exact opposite you'd want to do. And so I had friends

78
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,800
who lived at sea level, but they would have oxygen deprivation tents that they would sleep

79
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,560
in at sea level to functionally replicate the living high so then they could train at sea level.

80
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,880
What you described growing up is really the kind of perfect way to be able to do that.

81
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,000
You made it sound like that was just sort of accidentally discovered though. You guys just

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,440
sort of empirically stumbled upon the efficacy of that training?

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Yeah, yeah. It was just kind of like it just felt good. You know, anytime I'd pop down to sea level

84
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,640
to do track workout, it's kind of like you're saying Peter, it's like I try that stuff at

85
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,120
altitude and like running 400 meter repeats on short rests or like longer aerobic efforts where

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,440
you're trying to do like mile reps at super fast. You just, you've got to do it. You have to structure

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,800
it different at altitude. Whereas you go down to sea level and you can, you can spend a lot of time

88
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,120
at race pace, you know, working on that turnover, which you just can't do it out the two without

89
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,200
breaking it up more. And so that's what we do a lot of when we're up high, staying up high for

90
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,360
intervals is we'll just break things up where you're doing a bunch of 200s on really short rest.

91
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,040
But yeah, we just enjoyed popping down to sea level for those sessions just felt good. And it

92
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,720
was working right? Like the results like were very obvious. But yeah, the whole altitude thing is

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,200
really interesting because my wife, Sarah, who's a professional marathon runner, she's run 220 for

94
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,880
the marathon, which is the second fastest ever by an American. And it took her she grew up at sea

95
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,360
level in Santa Rosa, California. So when you're talking Peter about going up to Colorado and

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,480
doing the swimming stuff, there's also this effect of like how many years have you spent in

97
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,680
altitude? So like, for example, I am super good at altitude in terms of running, you know, like I can

98
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,080
run pretty close to my sea level times at 7000 feet altitude. What does it do at any distance?

99
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,760
So particular, I'm thinking about like marathon training. So like, what's most important marathon

100
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,440
trains or thresholds? So 15 mile thresholds, we just run 15 miles at that kind of marathon

101
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,840
intensity. And I could run 1215 miles at 448 per mile, which is about marathon pace at 7000 feet.

102
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,440
And if I pop down to sea level, maybe I'm running like 442 pace 440 pace, but I didn't get a huge

103
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,320
conversion from altitude to sea level. Whereas someone like my wife, Sarah, who wasn't as a

104
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,880
custom altitude, she'll get sometimes like 20 seconds a mile where she's running that much

105
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,320
slower at altitude that much faster at sea level. But she's also gotten better the more time she's

106
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,600
spinning altitude. So she first we moved to Mammoth Lakes out of college after we graduated

107
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,960
from Stanford in 2005. And she was hating living in Mammoth at 8000 feet for such a long time.

108
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,680
But gradually over time, like she's gotten much, much better at altitude, probably still not as

109
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,680
good as like I was when I was in my prime. But now we have to even go up to higher altitudes to get

110
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,080
similar effects to what we were getting before. So we have a place in Crested Butte, Colorado,

111
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,560
where we're sleeping at 9400 feet. And every time she goes up there, we see a massive jump in her

112
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,520
fitness, just from doing like a month stand up there. So you have to keep like kind of playing

113
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,720
with it because you realize like the science is there and your experiences are true. But also your

114
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,320
body's dynamic, it's always changing, right? So you got to like, you just can't repeat the same

115
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,400
thing over and over and over again. Like you have to realize like my whole body is always changing,

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,960
always adapting. So I got to be throwing new things at it. And that's like a big thing I've

117
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,280
learned in the lifting space as well. It's like if I'm just doing the same lifting all the time and

118
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,560
not like trying new mechanisms to add weight to the bar or different tactics, like I'm just not

119
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,840
going to see growth, right? So it's just it that's the fun thing about running, training, lifting,

120
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,640
it's all just an experiment of one. And it's just all just a giant experiment, right? And there's

121
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,320
always like tweaking little variables. And that's what I love about fitness, running, all of that

122
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,600
stuff is I love seeing growth. I love just like the frustration of not seeing growth, getting

123
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,480
plateaus and be like, what is going on right now? And like, my mind's just like chewing on this over

124
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,720
and over again for like months and months. And then I'm just making little tweaks, little tweaks

125
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,200
till I find it, then you find it and bang, it clicks, you know, and whether it's in the weight

126
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,960
room or running all of a sudden, like you're doing what you couldn't do before. And you're like,

127
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,200
Oh, I just love I love learning and growing in that way. You know,

128
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,520
well, you really touched on a lot of things there. But one of them is this concept of progressive

129
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,720
overload. And I think that that is one of the hardest things to really do when you're training

130
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,520
yourself as most of us are, right? Most of us, you know, we're just kind of weekend warriors and

131
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:36,200
we're sort of our own coaches. And it is very easy to get kind of comfortable. And again, it's true

132
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,400
in the weight room. It's true on the bike. It's true if you're running or whatever it is you're

133
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:46,040
doing. But therein lies the challenge of being able to progressively overload, which doesn't always

134
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,080
mean weight. It can mean sets. It can mean reps. It can mean reduction in rest time. There's so

135
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,680
many ways that one can progressively overload. Lately I've become pretty obsessed with blood

136
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,320
flow restriction and weight training. So that becomes another way to progressively overload

137
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,280
using a fraction of the weight that you would normally use. So I've been doing some of that too.

138
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Oh, you have. I love that. Especially for runners because like runners, like I got hurt. I was

139
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,040
training for the Beijing Olympics. I was at the Olympic training in Chula Vista working with the

140
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,520
strength coach. He had me on one of those vibrating platforms to warm up for squatting.

141
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,840
And it worked great. Like I was able to like warm up and get into a much deeper squat than I never

142
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,080
got into before. But like as a runner, like most runners are super tight and like the ankle

143
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,960
mobility isn't there. Like shouldn't be down in a butt to the ground squat. It's just not beneficial

144
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,000
for distance runners. It's not specific for distance runners. Right. And so anyways, long story

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,920
short, I ended up tweaking like the connection to my patella and that bothered me all the way

146
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,520
up to Beijing in Beijing. I was kicking myself so much for getting hurt lifting, you know?

147
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,960
And so things like that. You had a pretty good run in Beijing though. I mean, you finished 10th,

148
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,440
if I recall. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was 10th there, but it just to me, like it wasn't about what place

149
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,240
I finished. It was this, the sensation of clicking. Yeah. You didn't click. So you went out a little

150
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,160
slow in that race, if I recall. You were very tentative, like the first 15K. And then you

151
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,360
actually kind of came back. You basically, I don't know if you negative split by time,

152
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,960
but it seemed by effort you certainly did. Yeah. I mean, we could, I wrote a book about like

153
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,520
that whole experience, you know, like so much went into that. But I also wasn't clicking in training.

154
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,760
You know how you can tell when like in training, it's like, oh, I just feel like before I ran the

155
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,360
Houston half, like I'll, I went for a run in Big Bear a couple of days before that race. And it was

156
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,560
snowing like crazy. Like those big old snow, like snowflakes are come down super slow and

157
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,040
it's just stacking up. I was literally running like a foot of snow on the roads. They hadn't

158
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,920
even been plowed yet. And I felt like Tigger, like I just felt like I was just bouncing along.

159
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,440
It's effortless. Like when things are clicking and training, then it's like, whoo, this is going

160
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,600
to be fun. You know, you're kind of licking your chops kind of feel going into Beijing.

161
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,320
I didn't take a big break after running 206 at the London marathon in April. I didn't take my

162
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,760
customary two week break where I put on 10 pounds and don't run at all. I didn't do that. And so then

163
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,080
I was just kind of flat, like the whole buildup for Beijing. So I wasn't, I wasn't right going

164
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,120
into the race. But then there's also this thing of you're talking to the scientists and we're

165
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,560
doing like all this stuff at the Olympic training center where they're prepping us for the race,

166
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,280
talking about how hot and humid it's going to be. And it was one of those big life learning

167
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,640
experiences for me where, um, the, the storyline is it's going to be so hot and humid. It's going

168
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,240
to be slow. It's going to be one in like two 12, two 11, right? And so we're just buying this story

169
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,440
and we're just hearing the story over and over again. And I didn't do what I learned to do after

170
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,160
that, which is like, you got to be like the samurai. It's like, you got to be ready for any situation

171
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,880
that's going to come, you know, and not expect anything. So like the same is like expect nothing,

172
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,120
be ready for anything. And I wasn't in that state of mind. I was like, all right, it's going to be

173
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,400
chill the first mile or and, and right from the gun, Sammy's just like gone. The guy who ended up

174
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,240
winning the gold medal just took it out super hard, right? And it was like a mentally, I got

175
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,240
hit in the chin with an uppercut, like right on out of the gate, you know, cause I wasn't,

176
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,360
I wasn't ready for that scenario at all. So then you get back and you're in like 60th place and

177
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,600
you're trying to win a medal and you're like, you don't win a medal from 60th place. I mean,

178
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,240
you can, but you have to really like coach yourself through some tough spots because

179
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,160
you don't have momentum on your side. And a lot of like competing well in anything is getting

180
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,920
excited while you're out there, right? Like you got to be just building this like snowball of

181
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,320
excitement as the race is playing out. And I was having the opposite experience of that where I was

182
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,200
like, I'm not where I want to be. I'm too far back. Can't even see the leaders. The helicopter is like

183
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,080
way off in the distance, you know? And and so I had to kind of coach myself through that. And

184
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,480
actually how I did that was by encouraging other guys around me, which isn't a normal tactic that

185
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,160
you do, but as I kind of like encouraged other people, it encouraged me that like, I was like,

186
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,880
able to hold a conversation with people. And I just felt better from just like trying to actually

187
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,080
help other people out. And it shifted what was happening inside my mind, inside my heart. And

188
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,720
I was able to kind of find my own rhythm and start to work my way up in that race and finish 10th,

189
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,440
which I wasn't stoked on at the time. Like I was trying to get a medal, but it's funny,

190
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,800
the further removed you get from these things and the older you get, you appreciate it more.

191
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,360
So I look back on it now proud of the performance. Was Meb also, I mean, Meb's got a silver,

192
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,400
if I recall, in Athens in 04, right? Yeah. And then he, was he there in 08? He wasn't. No. So

193
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,720
we were training together up in Mammoth Lakes and he was dealing with a lot of injury issues

194
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,280
going into it. So he, I think he DNF'd at the trials that year in 2007. He had some gnarly

195
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,920
kind of hip stuff going on. And that was actually really cool to see Meb in that situation where

196
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,680
he went through so many injuries, so many down times, and like, even like mentally struggling

197
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,400
with how to handle that and see him pop out the other end of that when New York, when Boston

198
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,320
was just incredible. So he's, we were neighbors in, in Mammoth when we were training, we lived like

199
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,880
400 meters apart. And he's always been kind of like a big brother to me. So I'm such a good dude.

200
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,240
And yeah, I was, you know, in that race when he won Boston, and that was such a special experience.

201
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,280
I remember I was, I was having a bad day. It was a horrible day for you though. Yeah.

202
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,800
Yeah. Yeah. I was running terrible. Yeah. But I just remember coming up over heartbreak Hill

203
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,880
and you know, we don't know what's happening out there. I knew Meb was away and I knew that like,

204
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,120
our group was pretty far back and I knew he had a chance of winning it, but you don't know

205
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,720
what's happening. So I, I was coming up over heartbreak Hill and I remember just yelling at

206
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,880
the spectators on the side. I was like, how is Meb doing when he came past here? And they're like,

207
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,240
he was winning when he came past. And I knew if he got over heartbreak Hill and the lead,

208
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,680
he was going to win that thing. So it's funny. It's special. It is hard to believe that that was

209
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,240
2014 because that's just one of those races that is seared in my mind. I remember it so well,

210
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,440
because I used to, I don't want to say I trained with Meb, but we trained at the same place in San

211
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,160
Diego. So there's this place called Fiesta Island. It's, it's perfectly flat. So that's where all the

212
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:28,120
time trial races are. So three or four days a week, I would do my training on Fiesta Island.

213
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,280
It's seven kilometers and it's perfectly flat. And, and Meb would do his tempo runs there.

214
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,680
And early on a Tuesday or Thursday morning, we'd be the only two guys out there,

215
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,200
me on my bike, him running. And, you know, I think it's actually worth pointing out to

216
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,000
people listening to this who aren't familiar with some of these times, just how fast you guys run.

217
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,280
So you threw around some numbers earlier, like, you know, marathon pace, 442 to 448. I mean,

218
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:03,560
these are such insanely fast speeds that I think the, the likelihood that a person could run that

219
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,600
speed for half a mile is virtually zero, right? Like I know right now I could not go out and run

220
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,120
800 meters, half a mile at that pace. There's simply no way. Yeah, which is funny because I

221
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,680
can't either. I know, but it's just, it's so fast. And I used to have a sign in my office that said

222
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:30,040
442. So it was a pace clock and it said 442. And it actually came from, I remember getting this idea

223
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,000
off something one of your sponsors did for one of your races many, many years ago, they had

224
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,040
a treadmill set up to that pace. And the idea was they just had random people show up and they're

225
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,520
like, how long can you hold the pace that he holds for a little over two hours? And so they'd put a

226
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,560
harness around a person's waist and they'd make them run at 442. And these people were getting

227
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,640
shot off the back of this treadmill after 30 seconds, 40 seconds. One person made it a minute,

228
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:07,240
right? And the reason I had that sign up in my office was I was very circumspect slash put off

229
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,600
by the notion that people would say, hey man, we're training for a marathon, not a sprint.

230
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,640
This is a marathon, not a sprint. And I tried to make the point to people that,

231
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,960
okay, but if you want to win a marathon, it feels like sprinting. So let's be clear. It's one thing

232
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,320
to go out and run a marathon and take six hours to do it. It's another thing to go out and win a

233
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,520
marathon. So if you're trying to win a marathon, you have to understand the pain that these guys

234
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,360
are in. You have to understand what 442 means. It is insanity. And yes, for you,

235
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,840
it is below your threshold, but your threshold is so high. So looking at,

236
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:54,280
Meb win that race and having seen him in the months leading up to that, and I'm on my bike

237
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,720
and I'm seeing how fast he's running, doing his tempo repeats and stuff. It's just,

238
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,840
it is really amazing. And I do think it's one of those things where I wish everybody could try to

239
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,640
run at that pace and do the exercise that was done on that treadmill or something like that.

240
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,280
Because otherwise I think a lot of what we're going to talk about today is very hard to understand

241
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,920
from a physiological standpoint. Yeah. I mean, if like people just go out to the track and just

242
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,600
try and run 200 meters at a, yeah, like my, my half marathon pace is 433 per mile. Right. So

243
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,880
that's 34 seconds per 200. So if you just go out to the track and try and run a 34,

244
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,200
it's pretty crazy. Cause yeah, like, you know, guys, when they're racing, they make it look so

245
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,320
effortless like Kip Chokey when he's running sub two, like it looks so slow. So, and it's 34 seconds

246
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,400
per 200 is what he's running. And that is very fast, like 200. But yeah, I mean, what you're

247
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,040
talking about, Peter is super important. Like distance runners are not slow, like, like world

248
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,600
class marathoners. Like I want the guy now I'm coaching, you know, I want the guy who can run

249
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,360
49 seconds for 400. Like that's the kind of speed you have to have. Now you don't have to have that

250
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,680
speed while you're doing marathon training, but you need to have had that speed before that. Like

251
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,240
as a kid growing up, that's why I like with kids, I'm like, get as fast as you can. Because if you

252
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,640
want to be a world-class marathoner, I need 49 seconds speed, right? Like that's the kind of speed

253
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,760
that Kip Chokey has. And then that carries you on to be able to run a great mile to be able to run a

254
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,480
great 5k. Like it's all built off speed. Like that's what we work on with training. It's like,

255
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,520
let me develop your 5k speed, your mile speed first, which is directly correlated to your sprint

256
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,840
speed. Let me develop all that. And then we'll grow that into 10 K speed. Then we'll grow that

257
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,960
into half marathon speed. And then we'll grow that into marathon speed. But marathoners are,

258
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,400
they have wheels and we would have to train in training. I'm doing 50 meter sprints twice a week

259
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,560
in the middle of marathon training, 50 meters sprints, like little hill sprints. We're in the

260
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,760
weight room. Like you got, it's a power to weight ratio. Like, so you gotta have power. And that's,

261
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,160
that's an area I've grown a ton in since I've retired from running. And as I look back at my,

262
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,320
the weights I was doing, I just kind of like scratch my head. I'm like, Oh, I wish I could

263
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,920
go back and do things a little bit differently in the weight room. Cause I don't think I was using

264
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:18,200
my time effectively there, but yeah, it's power is so important for, for distance runners of all.

265
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,880
I mean, last, maybe if you're doing like super ultra stuff, maybe it's not quite as important,

266
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,880
but the marathon, I think it matters everywhere. And I think I know that Meb was doing deadlifts

267
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,840
as he was preparing for 2014. I mean, um, one of the, I talked to a guy who had, had, had overseen

268
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,680
part of his strength training program. And one of the things he was really fixated on was

269
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,080
his strength to weight ratio is measured by a deadlift. Yeah. Hex bar deadlift, right? That's

270
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:52,680
right. Hex bar deadlift with a, um, high eccentric, pardon me, high concentric and a dropped eccentric.

271
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,920
So no, so you pick it up, drop it, pick it up, drop it. Right. So the reason for that being the

272
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,840
eccentric tears, the muscle fibers was you're tearing muscle fibers. That's what's creating

273
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,400
hypertrophy. We didn't want any hypertrophy. We just wanted the strength. So it was pick it up,

274
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,680
drop it, pick it up, drop it. When Meb first started, if I recall, his strength to body weight

275
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,320
ratio for a single rep max was 1.3. So pretty pathetic, right? If we can be honest, right?

276
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,320
He could only deadlift 1.3 times his body weight. Um, I believe going into Boston,

277
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,040
he was able to get to three to one, maybe it was 2.7, but it was in that vicinity.

278
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:39,080
And the logic for this was really just physics. When you run, you have to hit the ground with a

279
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,360
toe, you know, whether you're, let's assume you're toe striking, not heel striking, but your foot

280
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,840
has to hit the ground. The harder you hit the ground, the harder the ground hits you, the

281
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,480
harder the ground hits you, the higher you go, the higher you go, the further your stride.

282
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,920
And so, um, they basically had calculated that for Meb to run the pace he wanted to run in Boston

283
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:05,800
that year, he needed to add four inches to his stride. And to do that basically required

284
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,160
taking his maximal force per unit body weight from something like 1.3 to 2.7. That was going

285
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,760
to translate to four more inches of stride. So he didn't increase his stride rate. He just increased

286
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,440
stride length and that was done through strength. And I think I suspect that that's becoming more

287
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,560
understood in running now, right? Because, you know, there was a day when I suspect runners were

288
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,760
told, don't lift weights, right? You want to be as skinny as possible. Uh, it's not about that type

289
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,280
of strength. And I'm guessing that that's not at all how you coach your runners. No. Yeah. We're,

290
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,000
we're super into strength, right? And kind of like you're saying, like your, my understanding even has

291
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,040
changed so much throughout the years where like I used to always think of like, think about your foot

292
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,040
action hitting the ground. I always thought it was being like a tiger paw and you're like pulling

293
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,280
the ground when really that's not what you're going for. You're going for like you're saying

294
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,600
you're stomping the ground. You're putting force into the ground. That's going to shoot you up and

295
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,240
out. Right? So like, and I never thought about that way. I was always just trying to like paw

296
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,080
the ground. And so that's where you want to use your glutes too, right? Your glutes are your

297
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,360
strongest, biggest muscle. And yet like so many runners, myself included as a pro runner, I had

298
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,160
very underdeveloped glutes. I would have been way faster, way better if my glute strength was,

299
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,880
and your hamstrings were probably quite weak and probably incredibly tight. And right. Yeah.

300
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,600
And now those insights came from sprinters, right? So if I believe Usain Bolt has the

301
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,160
greatest, uh, force per unit mass ever measured on a, um, force plate treadmill. So these are,

302
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,760
you've probably seen these, these treadmills where what you run on the treadmill and it

303
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,240
tells you how much force you're putting into the ground. And I believe Usain Bolt is able to put

304
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,080
six times his body weight into the ground with each strike, with each foot strike. I mean,

305
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,360
it's just, it's crazy to think how strong that is. Yeah. Yeah. It's unreal. But yeah,

306
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,800
I think for people who are listening, if you're a runner, like try that next time you go out,

307
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,880
try like pushing through the ground rather than trying to paw the ground and like how you contact

308
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,040
the ground. So important. So a lot of people are rolling through the ground. It's very difficult to

309
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,480
utilize those glutes and to really put force into the ground when you're rolling from your

310
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,760
heel to your toe, right? So you've got to like contact the ground like midfoot and just be like

311
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,880
stomping the ground. But yeah, the weight training helps tremendously with that. So,

312
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,080
so, so important for sprinters for, yeah. And the hex bar deadlift, that's my favorite lift. Like if

313
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,880
I was advising runners or when I am coaching runners, that's the first lift that they do on

314
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,640
the day. It's the most important one. And the one that we're always trying to increase the amount of

315
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,600
load they're able to handle with that. Have you used this device called a G flight? So it's these

316
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,720
two little red boxes that shine a laser beam between them and they measure how high you can

317
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,680
jump and your ground contact time. Hmm. No, no, that sounds interesting. So it's super interesting.

318
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,080
So it's become a part of my training now. And so the way it works is it's shining a little laser

319
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,040
across the floor. So you lay these things down on the floor. And if you stand between them static

320
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,600
and you jump and come down, it will tell you with incredible precision how high you've jumped,

321
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:21,320
because it measures how long you're off the ground. And it's a simple way and it's a simple

322
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,360
physics formula to figure out how high you went. So that's really interesting. So one, you can use

323
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,880
it for static vertical jump. But I think where you would find it more interesting for your runners

324
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,360
is when you do depth jumps. So now you put it in front of a box and you have the athlete jump off

325
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,520
the box, hit the ground and jump up. Now it gives you two pieces of information. It tells you how

326
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,640
long you were in contact with the ground and how high you went. And the marker of a great runner

327
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,920
or a person who is very good at generating force is you should have a higher vertical jump when you

328
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:06,600
jump off a box and land and go up than just static. Most people don't. Most people will jump higher

329
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,360
static off the ground than off the box. And the reason is their ground contact time is way too

330
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:19,560
long and they dissipate way too much force. I forget the metrics that I believe you want to be

331
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:26,280
beneath 0.28 seconds of ground contact time. I think that's the number. I struggle with this. So

332
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:33,240
I'm still jumping higher from a static than off a box. And my ground contact time is always north

333
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,240
of 0.3 seconds. So this is one of the things I've been working on, not because I'm remotely

334
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,320
interested in running fast, but because I'm interested in my feet becoming very good at

335
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,240
load dissipation and load transfer and force transfer. So I think that's just a very important

336
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,160
skill as you age, whether you're walking down a flight of stairs, whether you're hiking.

337
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,040
But for a runner, I would suspect if you could get people down into a ground contact time of like

338
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,640
0.2 to 0.25, that's going to translate to exactly what you're saying. Because the way you describe

339
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,200
it, the sort of rolling foot on the ground, you're never going to get forced that way. You could be

340
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,880
spending 0.6 seconds on the ground when you're rolling your foot across it. Instead, you want

341
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,000
to be hitting it super quickly and getting up. Yeah. You know what blows my mind about that,

342
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,760
though, as we're talking about this? I'm just thinking, I'm sure you're familiar with Jim Ryan.

343
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah. So I'm just thinking about him and somehow he was a heel striker. And I know of like,

344
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,000
I think Dathan Ritzenheim is a heel striker. Obdy, I just saw him the other day up in Flagstaff.

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,600
He's also a heel striker. And like, how are these guys running so fast from heel striking? Like,

346
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,560
is it a thing where like they could be much faster if they weren't heel striking? Or like,

347
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:56,040
is there some kind of advantageousness to that that we're not aware of or seen? I don't know.

348
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm super curious about that. I would put it in what you said earlier. It might be that a

349
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,400
combination of A, there are just some people who really adapt to a certain way of doing things.

350
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,360
And it might be that they run really well despite that. But everything I've read on this subject

351
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:20,280
matter and all the experts I've spoken to suggest that forefoot to toe striking is the way we were

352
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:26,440
meant to run. If you go back and look at kind of how our ancestors ran and you look at really how

353
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,280
force transfer would be most efficient, you don't want to be striking on the heel.

354
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah. I mean, that makes sense to me. But yeah, it's interesting to see people getting away with

355
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,960
it. But I'm with you. I'm always interested in like, not like, what can you get away with,

356
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,560
but what is optimal, right? Because I think it's easy to do that when you look at like,

357
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,560
how the Africans train, like we've spent a lot of time training in Kenya and Ethiopia.

358
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,520
And like, they don't even go cool down. And these are the best runners in the world on the planet,

359
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,760
and they don't go cool down. And I'm like, we learned to cool down in like middle school,

360
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,480
cross country and the importance of that. And you find yourself being like, well, maybe they

361
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,400
got it right. Maybe we shouldn't be cooling down. But I always remind myself like, well,

362
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,480
what is optimal? Like that's really what I'm after, not like, what can you get away with?

363
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,600
Yeah. So I've gotten so off track. I want it to kind of go through a bunch of other things,

364
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,600
but like, I just want to now geek out on all this other stuff. But I think just for folks to have a

365
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,080
bit of a sense of your trajectory, because we've touched on so many things. I mean, we very quickly

366
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,720
just in passing throughout there, the Houston marathon where you became the first American to

367
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,560
break an hour and you still hold the American record for that, a record that may stand for some

368
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:39,480
time. But let's go back. You're growing up in Big Bear, your dad, an amazing baseball player.

369
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,400
And you were typical baseball, basketball, et cetera. Didn't pick up running if I recall till

370
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,600
you were like 13 or something? Yeah, correct. Yeah, you did your homework.

371
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,280
Yeah, man. Well, I remember and you did like your first run, you just decided that I want to run

372
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,680
around the lake. That's a 15 mile run. How much did that hurt? Oh, it was the pain train the whole

373
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:07,400
time. Yeah. Like there was no like magic to that run, right? It was like just suffering the whole

374
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,560
time. I was in basketball shoes. I had no idea what I was doing. My legs just felt like they

375
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,680
just got pounded into a million little pieces like halfway through it. So I mean, we had to stop

376
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,840
multiple times. We stopped at a liquor store and got like a sobe, like a drink or whatever,

377
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,240
and stopped and ice my legs. And really like my dad wasn't there. I probably wouldn't have made

378
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,440
it around the lake, but that was such a learning experience for me now as a dad of for myself,

379
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,080
being like, how do we respond to our kids and their crazy ideas? You know, like this was just

380
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,160
some like crazy thing that I decided to do when I was 13. And yet look what it did. Like it totally

381
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,240
changed the trajectory of my entire life, like completely different now. And just some crazy

382
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,080
idea. It'd been very easy for my dad to be like, you know what? Let's just start with like a two

383
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,800
mile run instead of starting with a 15 mile run, you know? But that wouldn't have captured me in

384
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,800
the same way. Like I needed a hook that was just going to be like, I'm forever changed. Like the

385
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,280
trajectory of my life is never going to be the same. Like I needed something big like that.

386
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,360
And I'm so glad that he didn't like try and gun down my ideas. Just like, all right,

387
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,000
that's what you want to do. Let's go do it. I can't imagine that pain actually, because I had

388
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,960
a very similar experience at a far smaller distance when I was maybe 12. And I just woke up one day

389
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,240
and I was like, I want to go run five miles. I want to see how fast I can run five miles. And so

390
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:38,760
I put on my crappy shoes and I went out and I ran five miles and it hurt so much. It hurt so much.

391
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,240
And the next day I was like, I'm going to do it again. And I went out and I did it again and it

392
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:49,000
hurt so much. And I went out and I did it the third day and it hurt so much. And then something

393
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,040
on the fourth day changed. And on the fourth day I felt awesome. And then I just never stopped.

394
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,720
You know, I just started adding more distance from there. But when you think about how non-linear

395
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:08,200
running is, like if I was feeling that pain at five miles, five miles is a quarter of 13

396
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:15,560
in terms of effort. So I'm not just like what was going through your mind at the five mile mark,

397
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,480
at the eight mile mark, you know, what were you actually, were you, were you thinking,

398
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,360
I love this pain. I love proving to myself that I can do this. Or was the part of you thinking,

399
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,920
why am I doing this? Yeah. And I mean, there were so many thoughts. That's the thing about distance

400
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,120
running. It's really like what's going on in your head is hugely important. Right. And so like now,

401
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,040
like when I'm training athletes on the mental aspect of it, I tell them like you gotta have

402
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,440
whole bunch of different like arrows essentially that you can pull out and use. Because it's like

403
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,360
sometimes you use one thing, it doesn't work. You got to go to something else and it doesn't work.

404
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,400
So I have all these different tactics and managing pain and discomfort. But like honestly,

405
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,640
like one of the biggest ones that is most helpful for me is simply turning the mind off. You just

406
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,520
turn the mind off and you just like keep putting one foot in front of the other. Like it sounds

407
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,120
so simple and so basic, but like I can tell you like the last 5k of the Boston marathon when I'm

408
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,200
in a world of pain and just trying to get to the finish line as fast as I can. There's no like

409
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,080
profound thoughts going in through here. It's just like put one foot in front of the other as fast

410
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,920
as you can. Like it's that simple. Right. And it's so in those moments, like oftentimes I'm just like

411
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,320
turn the brain off and just keep moving. Like just keep moving. And a lot of it's just like

412
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,520
too like refusing to believe that you can't take one more step. Like you get yourself, at least I

413
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,480
get myself in trouble when I start thinking too far down the road. I'm like, oh I still have so

414
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,960
far to go. There's no way I could possibly do this. Like you get overwhelmed by the scope of the

415
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,360
challenge sometimes, especially when you're trying to do something you've never done. And that's

416
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,880
worse than the actual discomfort you're feeling. Right. It's that being overwhelmed thing is just

417
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,600
not a good feeling at all. And that's that's what makes people give up and give in. So if you can

418
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,560
bring yourself back to the present to what you're doing right now, what I found is there's always

419
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,520
enough to get me through this moment. There's not always enough to get me through like what's coming

420
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,920
all down the line. If I try to just like I'm going to handle all of it right now. It's like, no, just

421
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,120
just do what's right in front of you. Just handle what's this mile that you're in right now, which

422
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,280
is why I wrote my book entitled Run the Mile You're In. Because it's just like you just got to bring

423
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,600
yourself back to being present in this moment. And there's always enough to get you through this

424
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,360
moment. One of the things about running that strikes me as difficult in that regard is you can't

425
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:39,400
dissociate yourself from the visual cues of how much lies ahead. I used to swim long distances

426
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,160
and there was a there were a couple of really dogmatic rules that we had in in ultra distance

427
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,360
swimming. And one of them was never look up towards shore. You only know you're coming to land

428
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,760
when you start to see the bottom of the ocean. You typically don't get that until you're like

429
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,320
half a mile from shore. But this idea that you would ever lift your head up to look forward is

430
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,680
a total disaster. And I got a really bad taste of that on a swim that I was doing. It was a training

431
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,840
swim across Lake Tahoe. So this was not supposed to be a very difficult swim. This was a 12 mile

432
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:23,800
swim. And that should have taken a little under six hours. But I didn't do my homework. I didn't

433
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,520
hire a good boat captain and he didn't understand the navigation. So to make a very long story short,

434
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:40,440
we didn't go across the lake. We zig zagged across the lake. And when we hit this five hour mark in

435
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:46,840
my head, I'm thinking I should only be two miles from shore. So I look up at him and I say,

436
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,680
how much further do we have? And he says about two miles. And I say, or maybe four miles or

437
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,200
something. I forget what the number was, but it made sense. Whatever he said made sense. And then

438
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,680
I stupidly looked towards the shore and had a mental image of what it looked like. I couldn't

439
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,240
see the trees or anything like that. You could, it couldn't make out detail. So I just put my head

440
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,320
down and hammered for two more hours, for one more hour thinking, okay, but in an hour I should

441
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,200
see the bottom of Lake Tahoe coming up at me. And I didn't, it looked exactly the same. And I lifted

442
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,000
my head up and it looked exactly the same. But meaning we were much further than he told me we

443
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,760
were. And that is the closest I've ever come to like quitting a swim. I was mentally destroyed.

444
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,160
And then I said, how far are we? And he said, I don't know, I think like four miles. And I was

445
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:41,160
like, come on. Like, what are you talking about? Like you can't mess with a swimmer like, I mean,

446
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,000
I was so pissed off. But again, what did, why was I pissed off? I was pissed off because I had an

447
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,200
idea in my mind that was so far ahead. I wasn't in the, in the mile, right? I wasn't in that moment.

448
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,960
And I think for runners, like you don't have the luxury that a swimmer does to literally,

449
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,080
you, I could swim with my eyes closed. I can really drown out all of that other stuff.

450
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:10,280
And you gave that example of being in Beijing and it's not just that you know you're in 60th,

451
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,120
it's that you see the helicopter that's over the leaders and they're a quarter mile up the road.

452
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,080
That requires an extra level of mental fortitude in my mind to be able to run your race at that

453
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,360
point. Yeah. Yeah. And like I said, it all comes back to getting excited, right? If you're going to

454
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,280
perform well, you got to be excited about how you're doing. So it's like, how can you get

455
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,720
excited? Not just like make it through that moment, but find something to get excited about

456
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,800
in that moment, you know? So there's so much, I talk a lot about like reframing things in your mind.

457
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,160
And that to me is like one of the most helpful things that I use all the time, right? So like,

458
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,040
for example, I was just doing this crazy challenge. It's called Chopwood carry water, where I split a

459
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,160
cord of wood at my house and flagstaff and then drove to the grand canyon, ran down to the bottom

460
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,920
of the grand canyon holding these seven gallon blocks. Yeah, these are the big blue ones, right?

461
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,680
I saw this on Instagram. Yeah, they weigh like 62 pounds each when they're full. So I was running

462
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,680
down there. It's a 10K run, 6.3 mile run down to the bottom of the grand canyon, you drop 5,000

463
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,120
feet and then got to the Colorado river, fill them up and then farmer carry them out of the grand

464
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,480
canyon. And I remember being down at the bottom and filling up those jugs and just being like

465
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,800
looking up and having just run all down that. And I was like, what did I get myself into? Like the

466
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,160
sun was already getting down super low. And that was the hardest part of the whole challenge for me

467
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,440
was like just starting it out, right? Because I knew it was waiting for me. I knew how far I had

468
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:50,040
to go. But again, I just... So just to be clear, you carried 63 pounds in each hand of water up

469
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:56,440
6.3 miles at basically a grade of, I don't know, seven or 8% I'm guessing, right?

470
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,480
Yeah, yeah. I think it's like 7% grade. Yeah. How long did that take you?

471
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,560
Six hours. And help me understand what your hands were doing. Were you using grip? Did you have like

472
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:17,400
wraps around your hands or something? No, no, just hand in it. I have good calluses on my hands from

473
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,440
all the lifting I've been doing. But yeah, I mean, my hands took a beating. But actually interesting...

474
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,640
Did you ever have to like put the... Did you ever have to stop and put them down?

475
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,600
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can only carry them like 50 meters at a time. So it was a lot of carries.

476
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:40,520
Yeah. That is actually more insane than your deadlift 500 pounds run a five minute mile attempt,

477
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:48,120
which also was super impressive. But this farmer's carry thing is ridiculous, actually.

478
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,760
It was such a crazy experience. But I was talking about reframing and I had to reframe a lot in that

479
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,480
because I thought, I think it'll take me like four hours to carry these out. And our goal was to try

480
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,800
to beat the sun. But like I said, the sun was already like... It was like three, four o'clock

481
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,080
when we got down to the bottom. So I was just like, found myself wanting to get frustrated about how

482
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,680
this was going, how long this is going to take. I'm never going to get out of here. All those

483
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,440
thoughts are going through my mind, you know? And I just had to like reframe it and come to peace

484
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,200
with like what was happening out there and just accept it and then get excited about it. You know,

485
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,160
like I was looking at the moon is coming up is so epic. Like it was dark. All my buddies are there

486
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,720
cheering for me, giving me food and water and stuff. And it was just such a beautiful experience,

487
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,320
but I had to reframe it to be able to see it that way because how I was seeing it at the bottom of

488
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,560
the canyon was like, oh man, this is going to suck. What I get myself into. I don't know if I can get

489
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,040
out of here. Like all those negative thoughts. But then as I was able to accept it and then

490
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,080
reframe it, then I was able to embrace this really beautiful experience and one that was

491
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,080
life changing for me that, you know, I'll never forget getting to the top of that canyon and

492
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,480
putting those jugs down and how good it felt to like finish that thing, you know? But I had to

493
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,440
change how I was thinking about the whole situation, which is what you have to do

494
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,200
when you're in a race and it's not unfolding how you want it to unfold.

495
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,320
Well, I can relate to that on a number of my swims where things didn't go well, but you're right.

496
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,720
There's something about saying I'm not going to quit. I'm going to put my head down and I'm going

497
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,680
to do this. When you get to the other end, it's pretty remarkable. And I've had the ability to be,

498
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,280
you know, coaching people when they do swims. And in swimming, once you touch the boat or anything,

499
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,920
you're disqualified. So it's a very, you can have zero assistance out there. And

500
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,800
one of the things that I learned from watching other coaches and then I would do it with people

501
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,440
is whenever a swimmer says they want to quit, I wouldn't let them do it, right? I would say,

502
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,640
no, no, no, I'm not going to let you do this. You got to give me another 10 minutes and then we'll

503
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,520
talk again. And if they still want to quit, I say, I need another 10 minutes and then we talk.

504
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,440
And then I make them do this three times. And part of it is just to show them that they can

505
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,320
swim another 30 minutes. So if you can swim another 30 minutes, you could probably swim

506
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,960
another four hours or whatever the amount is. But also you realize like, and this sounds so cruel,

507
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,400
but you also tell them, like you make sure they understand that what they're doing is you want to

508
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,200
quit right now. Just to be clear, you're saying you want to quit doing this thing right now.

509
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Is that right? Yes. Okay. Well, if you know, after 30 minutes, then fine, you can come on out.

510
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,840
But I guess there's just no substitute for that feeling of when you finish. Although that

511
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,520
literally strikes me as the hardest physical thing I could ever imagine doing. Because it's,

512
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,400
say more about what the cardio struggle of that was like. Like what, you know,

513
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,360
are you kind of in a slow jog trot? Like what kind of pace were you moving at?

514
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,240
Yeah. So like basically a fast walk, you know, you, you want to make your legs and heart do as

515
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,880
much of the work as possible. Cause just holding that much weight in your hand becomes an issue,

516
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,120
you know? But really the reason why I'd say is even harder than running a marathon is when you're

517
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:13,000
running a marathon, like my heart rate's usually around 167. I have a really low heart rate.

518
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,360
What's your maximum heart rate? I don't know what it would be. Now at that time though,

519
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:26,200
I couldn't get it over 200. It was probably like 195, 197. Like I had a resting heart rate of 27

520
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,520
when I was at my fittest. Like it was, I've always just had a really low heart rate,

521
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,800
but it gets super low. Now it's nowhere near that. But all that to say, like usually the first 20

522
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,840
miles of marathon or maybe the first 17 miles, like feels pretty good. You're conversational.

523
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,000
You're floating along. Like it's just fun, you know, you're enjoying the ride. And then of course,

524
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
like it gets really hard and you got to get down and bear it. Whereas this was just like,

525
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,360
it was like I was doing interval training because I was right. Like I'm going like 30 second carry,

526
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,400
set it down, take as minimal rest as possible. What would a typical rest be when you did that?

527
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,000
30 seconds on. Yeah. Like 30 seconds off kind of thing. I would just go till I caught my breath

528
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,480
and go again. And so it was like, I'm breathing super hard when I set it down, catch my breath

529
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,200
just to where I'm breathing normally again and then go again. So just like I was breathing. If

530
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,960
you listen to the video, which we're going to have a whole video coming out here pretty soon,

531
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,760
like you'll hear me just breathing super hard, like a truck, like the whole time. And it's like

532
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,800
six hours straight of doing that was the most intense thing I've ever done before. Like I'm

533
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,680
not used to breathing that hard the whole time. So how much did you drink? Do you have a sense of

534
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,840
what volume you consumed of water and whatever? The amount of water and calories I was taking

535
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,880
it was insane. I had a, my buddy was helping me. I had a lot of buddies helping me, but one guy was

536
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,560
just in charge of doing my food and water after every third carry, I'm taking in water and then

537
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,760
I'm taking in sugar. Like I was eating gummy worms, like a maniac. I probably took in like,

538
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,560
like 3000 calories coming up from the canyon because I was just burning so much because

539
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:09,960
I'm like 183 pounds plus carrying 124 pounds of water weight and you're going up 5,000 feet. So

540
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:16,280
my body was just like, my metabolism was unreal. But that was a big part about being,

541
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,640
and why I wanted to do this. So check this out. Like the biggest to me, the most important part

542
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,760
of training, whether it's run training or weightlifting training is consistency. And it blows my

543
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,720
mind what my body's capable of doing in my athletes are capable of doing when you're just consistent.

544
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,000
So when I was training for this, I never did longer. Well, twice I did longer, but for the most

545
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,560
part I did 20 minute carries every other day. So that was all the training I did 20 minutes,

546
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,040
20 minutes with basically the same weight, 60, call it 65 pounds in each hand. And you would do

547
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,120
the same thing, 30 seconds on 30 seconds off, 30 seconds on 30 seconds off for 20 minutes.

548
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,000
Yep. And then off of that, I was able to do a six hour carry out of the canyon.

549
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,840
And did you do that at elevation? I'm sorry, at grade as well, not on flats.

550
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:07,240
No, just flat, which, you know, like I could have trained for it better, but like I'm a full-time

551
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,960
dad. I got my lifting that I'm into. I coach my wife, I have online training business,

552
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,880
run free training. So I have a ton of stuff going on. I don't have time to go do like our water

553
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,680
carries, but plus it's easy to be consistent when it's 20 minutes, right? Like I can't find an

554
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,000
excuse and be like, Oh, I don't have 20 minutes. Like I would get home late at night and put on

555
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,480
the headlamp. And if I hadn't done my carry, go do my carry because 20 minutes is nothing, right?

556
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,080
I can be consistent with that. Whereas if I'm trying to be like, okay, every other day I'm going

557
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,080
to do an hour. Nope. I'm not going to be able to stick to that. You know? So I think a big part

558
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,920
about being successful in running fitness is like, just make the bar low, make it easy to be

559
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,640
consistent, right? So yeah, I did all of that off 20 minute carries, but I knew what is super

560
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,600
important in doing any kind of ultra stuff is fueling, right? So I knew I was like, if I take

561
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,720
in enough calories and I stay hydrated, I'm going to be okay. I can get through anything, right?

562
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,640
But how much did you need to experiment with that? Because that was something I experimented with

563
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:12,120
a lot in my own very, very, very modest forms of endurance training was learning the fuel and

564
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:20,680
making dumb mistakes sometimes. Like I did this one training swim many years ago, and it was like

565
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,480
kind of your penultimate, like it was the longest training swim I would do before the actual swim.

566
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:33,320
So it was like a 24 mile swim. So I did an 18 mile was the last training swim. And someone had told

567
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,720
me, Hey, a really good way to avoid getting the runs is to take like, I forget what it is. Like,

568
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,560
what's the anti diet? Imodium. Yeah, exactly. It was Imodium. And I was like, well, you know,

569
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,520
it's funny. I've never had the runs when swimming, but I'd hate to get it. I should try. I just see

570
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,480
what happens if I take Imodium before this swim. So sure enough. And of course, like an idiot,

571
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,920
I don't just take the recommended dose. I take two X the recommended dose. And so I'm out there.

572
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:07,720
And in, in, I think at that time, my regimen was 200 ml of fluid every 20 minutes. So 600 ml an

573
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:15,800
hour of fluid multiplied by I think that turned into a seven, maybe an eight hour swim. And the

574
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:25,720
last four miles, I was about, I thought it was going to die. Like I was so bloated and it didn't

575
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,160
really occur to me why, cause it was like, you know, eight hours earlier that I had taken the

576
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,960
Imodium, right? Like I had never put two and two together, but this was the problem. So we finally,

577
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,720
we started in La Jolla, swam up to like, I don't know, Solana beach, and then swam back down. And

578
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,400
when, when we get back to shore and my friend who is guiding me pulls the kayak on the beach,

579
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,240
and I pick up the kayak to carry it with him. So I'm in the front of the kayak. He's in the back.

580
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,640
We're carrying it on the beach. It's like this beautiful day in La Jolla. Families are playing

581
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:00,440
everywhere. This kid had dug a big hole in the ground next to his sandcastle. And as we walk

582
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:08,680
by it, I just went, and I just puked like literally, it looked like eight liters of whatever it was.

583
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,560
I was drinking like hammer strength, something or other like into this hole. And I was like,

584
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:20,680
all right, note to self, man, Imodium, not for swims. But that's a dumb example. But like,

585
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,720
you know, you mentioned like the amount of sugar you're consuming, but I know some athletes who

586
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:32,280
just cannot put sugar in, they get really sick. They have to use more complex carbohydrates. So

587
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,440
how did you, how empirical were you both, let's go back to your marathon training when it was like,

588
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,320
everything's on the line. This is your, this is your job. How deliberate were you in figuring out

589
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,280
what was the right ratio of goo versus rice versus potato versus, you know, all of it in liquid?

590
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,000
How did you figure all that out? Yeah, we were, I mean, we were super specific with it when I was

591
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,520
running professionally. And I think, you know, the running professionally, my experiences,

592
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,120
they're carried over into this challenge, right? So from my experience, and a lot of our athletes

593
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,520
experience, like you can train your gut to take in stuff. It's when you throw new stuff at it,

594
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,880
that's not used to when you have, you know, adverse reactions like you're having. So like,

595
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,800
for us, number one, I'm loading for two days before the marathon. So and that was taken from like a

596
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,320
nutritionist that I was working with, he's like, Hey, listen, like spread this load out, like,

597
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,200
you don't want to blow it up and like be feeling terrible the day before this race, like load for

598
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,000
two days leading up to it. So what that would look like is I'd eat 400 calories of carbohydrate,

599
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,400
additional to what I'd normally eat when I'm training hard, right? So I wouldn't be like,

600
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,160
Oh, I'm not running that much the last couple of days. So I'm going to cut down how much I'm

601
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,240
eating. I would still eat like I was training and the 400 extra calories of carb. And I keep

602
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,360
those carbs like super simple. Um, cause you know, like a lot's going on with nerves and jitters

603
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,920
leading up to your race. And you just want to make it as easy on your system. Like there's a time and

604
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,720
place for complex carbs and high fiber diet and all that stuff. Like usually that's like how we're

605
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,040
eating, but the days before race was keeping it super, super simple. So for you, that was what?

606
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,000
Rice and potatoes.

607
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:14,040
Yeah. Like white rice. I was big on like the white rice, pasta, um, sourdough bread. I really

608
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:20,680
liked because it's lower glycemic index. Um, but it digests really easy. Um, maltodextrin is a carb

609
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:26,840
that I really like to take in and you gotta be careful. I've had some bad experiences with other

610
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,280
branded stuff. It's like, it's supposed to like, like, I forget what it's called, like glucose aid

611
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,800
or one of those things. I tried that before race and how my athletes try it. And they had a

612
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,280
terrible time with their stomach. So you never want to try something new leading up to your race.

613
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,280
You haven't tried before. So always try it in training. That's just like a given, you know,

614
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,040
but, um, I love maltodextrin cause it's a liquid calorie. So if I'm not hungry and it's, it's, uh,

615
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,720
tasteless, I can mix it up with the protein powder, shake it up, shoot it down. That is,

616
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:58,600
that's actually what my pre-race meal was, was a liquid meal because I'd wake up from all this

617
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,000
carb loading I'm doing the day before and I'd wake up really full and then I'd eat anyways.

618
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,200
So like three hours before the race, take my shake with the protein powder, maltodextrin,

619
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,920
a little bit of olive oil in there as a healthy fat to help slow things down a little bit more.

620
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,720
And then I was taking a gel right on the starting line, sipping all water the whole time.

621
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,880
And then we're, we would actually how I did my bottles and we get, so we get bottles every 5k.

622
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,720
So we get to put them out on a table. You can put whatever you want in it. You could strap a gel to

623
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:34,040
it if you want. But how I always did things is we would make them not very concentrated the first

624
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,880
bottle and then they'd get increasingly concentrated as the race was going on.

625
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,640
And then they get decreasingly concentrated lady later in the race. And the reason for that was

626
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,920
like, it's easier to absorb things when you're not as tired, right? So you kind of want to make sure

627
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,560
you're front loading your carb intake during the marathon because your body can just process it a

628
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,440
lot easier. I mean, when you get to 40k of marathon, like you don't feel like taking in carbs at all.

629
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:04,360
So oftentimes we grab that bottle, we take a swig of it and then like it tricks your body to think

630
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,520
it's getting carbs, right? And then we just spit it out. We wouldn't even drink it, but your body

631
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,520
thinks, oh, carbs are on the way. Like, and it responds like as if it's going to get carbs,

632
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,760
but it doesn't get anything. So that would give you a little jolt of energy just with 2k to go

633
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,960
there. But typically, yeah, the bottles would be not as concentrated, more concentrated. We put

634
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:29,720
a gel at 10k, a gel at 20k and that, no, no, sorry, a gel at 15k and a gel at 30k. And that gel at 30k

635
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,280
would be a caffeinated gel. Again, just to get a little bit more of a hit of caffeine. We time our

636
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:41,320
caffeine intake to where we're taking it also like 75 minutes prior to race start. Yeah. And caffeine

637
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,600
is a really interesting thing to talk about. I'm like intrigued by that one because that was one of

638
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,680
the things that when it came on board, it was like, oh, there's no going back. Like I couldn't

639
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,720
imagine doing a race without caffeine. And yet like people have such different experiences with

640
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,440
it. And you know, I've learned from like science recently how it does like increase your core

641
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,840
temperature, which is kind of detrimental to endurance activities. But the thing that's

642
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:11,080
interesting is like that, I understand the science behind that, but that just hasn't been my experience

643
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,200
at all. Like I am a hundred percent faster with caffeine on board than without caffeine on board.

644
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,640
And I've tried both ways. Did you ever experiment with Tylenol?

645
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,840
No, no, I never did. So there's some really interesting research. And I was actually talking

646
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,120
about this like a couple of weeks ago with Lance Armstrong. I don't know how it came up,

647
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,040
but we were talking about and same thing. Like he had never used Tylenol on the tour.

648
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,440
It's a pretty remarkable performance enhancing drug, right? So perfectly legal, right? Wada has

649
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,360
not banned Tylenol to my knowledge. But we're talking about like a one to 2% performance boost.

650
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,800
It's not entirely clear if it comes through the temperature reduction or the pain reduction,

651
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:59,240
but it was absolutely part of my stack during time trials, right? So, you know,

652
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:06,200
a time trial is like basically an hour of threshold, right? It's super painful. And I

653
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:12,920
feel like I was getting like a one, two, maybe even at times a 3% performance gain from Tylenol.

654
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,920
And I would take like a thousand milligrams, you know, an hour before the race.

655
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,840
So I'm curious if other athletes have tried that.

656
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,560
Yeah, I know. I'm not familiar with other athletes trying it, but I'm definitely going to try that

657
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,400
with my athletes now. Yeah, I would give it a try. And again, we don't even really know how

658
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,120
Tylenol works. So it's for such a common medication, we don't actually understand its mechanism of

659
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:39,080
action, but it is a very good medication at keeping temperature down, which is obviously its

660
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,800
first indication is to lower it, you know, for fever, but it also reduces pain and it does it

661
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,800
in a way that's different from NSAIDs. And, you know, outside of being needing to be careful on

662
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:55,320
the dose, because obviously it is a, it's a very liver toxic drug at high doses, but within normal

663
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:01,640
amounts like, you know, a thousand milligrams, you know, it's an incredibly safe drug. And it would

664
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,320
be curious to know how much of a benefit your athletes would get on that and how much you would

665
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,680
get from it. Yeah, I'll try that. Is there any application to lifting? If it's keeping your core

666
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,720
temperature down, it seemed that'd be helpful for lifting as well. I don't know. I haven't seen the

667
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,000
literature on lifting. You know where I did see literature on lifting, and this is freaking

668
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,720
hilarious. This was probably like eight years ago. I saw some papers that looked at how Viagra

669
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:33,160
improved lifting performance. So of course I went out and got a ton of Viagra. And in the end,

670
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,360
I couldn't do it, not for the reasons that most people would imagine. The reason I couldn't do

671
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,000
it is just the symptoms. I was getting so lightheaded from it because it's a vasodilator in part.

672
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:52,200
And so maybe my blood pressure is not that high. It's actually kind of low. And so maybe I just

673
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,640
couldn't tolerate the sort of lightheadedness that came from it. But the research was actually

674
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:04,840
pretty compelling. 25 to 50 milligrams of Viagra, boosting strength performance. And not just

675
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,360
strength. Actually, if I recall, it was more of muscular endurance, not strength actually.

676
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,960
And I didn't find the difference because of the symptoms that I had because of the side effects.

677
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:24,040
But that might be another thing worth experimenting with is kind of that 25 to 50 milligrams of Viagra

678
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:32,680
to see what does that do as far as not a mean maximal effort, but a submaximal effort repeatedly.

679
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,800
So probably you'd see more of that on your best 10 rep deadlift as opposed to your max deadlift.

680
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,760
Okay. That's interesting. So speaking at core temperature, have you played it all with

681
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,280
Palmer cooling? No.

682
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,560
Are you familiar with that at all? No. I mean, I used to check my core temp before and after

683
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:56,600
long swims because we had the opposite problem. You're swimming in cold water. And so sometimes

684
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:02,120
I'd actually swim with a rectal probe just to see how low. And usually your temp would drop like

685
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:10,600
four, five degrees. So you'd start at 98 or 99 and I'd come out of the water at 93, 94.

686
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:17,080
So you were getting a performance detriment when your temperature went too low. So really,

687
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:21,960
we really operate in this pretty narrow band of temperature, right? Too much and too little is

688
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:27,640
pretty bad. Right. Yeah. It's interesting. Like I've been a Dr. Huberman out of Stanford,

689
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,720
neuroscientist, he talks about Palmer cooling. So we've been playing with that a little bit.

690
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,240
Like there's some pretty remarkable research coming out of Stanford about the effects of that,

691
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,080
both in strength training and in the endurance space. It's a little hard. So how does it work?

692
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,800
So the best way is to dump heat core temp through your body is through your face,

693
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,600
your upper face where there's no hair. And then also through your hands and the bottom of your

694
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,560
feet. So they developed like this glove and they've had this for years. Like this was there at

695
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:00,840
Stanford when we were coming out. You put your hands in this glove and you dump heat. And the

696
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,920
thing is you don't want it too cold, right? So you don't want it like icy cold, just cool.

697
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,920
So that doesn't dilate your violation of dilation. Or constrict. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. And so then

698
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,720
you're dumping all your heat out, brings your core temp down and then you're good to go after

699
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,360
that. So we've been playing a little bit with that with like holding cold packs in your hands and

700
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:25,400
in between lifts, like holding cold things or putting your hands in cool water, dumping your

701
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,120
temp. And that's, that's kind of like one thing that we're playing with a little bit more,

702
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,160
but it makes a lot of sense to me. It's like why humans can do these persistence hunts, you know,

703
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,240
where they go and chase down animals. It's because the animal like overheats, it's not as good at

704
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,320
dumping temperature, whereas like humans are better at regulating temperature. So if you can

705
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,960
keep your temperature in that kind of optimal range, in theory, it should like increase your

706
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,240
endurance as well. So yeah, there's always like, I love like exploring this stuff and trying new

707
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,240
tactics out like that. So when you mentioned this now, I do recall, I have experimented with this,

708
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:02,840
what's called a cooling helmet. So I had this helmet that you, it had inserts into it that you

709
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,080
would put in the freezer. So like gel packs that you would freeze and you would put this thing on

710
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:14,120
your head. So I would ride on my trainer with this cooling helmet and it definitely made a difference,

711
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:19,560
but I never, for some reason I could never bring myself to do it like in a race or something like

712
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:25,080
that. But the other thing I've noticed on that effect was just this summer. So this was my first

713
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,280
summer living in Austin and obviously it gets super hot in Austin in the summer, hotter than

714
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:38,760
I'm used to in Southern California. And when I drive a race car, I've never used any form of

715
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,480
cooling device before. So I've always just drive like, you know, you got a fire suit on, so you

716
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:49,320
have no max suit on, you got a race suit on. And especially when you drive a closed cockpit car,

717
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,520
so not a formula car, you're not getting the wind as you're driving. And of course, these cars are

718
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,160
hot as hell because, you know, these are race cars, there's no air conditioning and you're just,

719
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,560
you've got all this engine heat coming at you. So you really get hot. And I've always just sort

720
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,840
of suffered through this, even though so many people I know say invest in a cooling vest. So

721
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:13,960
you have these vests that run ice water around your torso. And I was like, I don't need that.

722
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,840
I don't need that. I don't need that. I got this. I got this. I got this. And then finally,

723
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:25,400
one day my friend was like, dude, just try it. I mean, game changer, total game changer to drive

724
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:31,960
a racing car with a cooling vest on under hot conditions. So tell me more about this cooling

725
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,440
vest because we play with these things as well. I have kind of like the archaic ones that it's

726
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,000
like you put it, you fill it up, it turns into gel and then you freeze it. And it's just like,

727
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,760
it's slowly like gets back to temperature, but do these, do you actually like plug them in?

728
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:51,160
Yeah, this would not be great for a runner because it would be too heavy. But so it's a shirt

729
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:59,480
actually. And it has really, really fine, whatever little cables running up and down it.

730
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:06,440
And it has a little box that runs cold water through you, up and down, up and down, up and

731
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,120
down. And in the car, it's easy. You have a power unit, you're running it out of the car.

732
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:17,880
So it did occur to me, like is there a way, like if let's say the thing weighs an extra

733
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,520
six pounds, like what would be the cost trade off if you were on a bike with one of these things?

734
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:27,240
Like could one of these things be engineered to only add like maybe four or five pounds,

735
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:32,040
which would of course be detrimental on the bike, but would it offset by the performance gain you'd

736
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:38,120
have? But obviously in a car, it's an enormous performance booster, especially in close cockpit

737
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,120
cars. In formula cars, it's not as big a deal because you don't get as hot. You're getting

738
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:49,640
so much air blown on you. But yeah, it blew my mind what a difference that the temperature

739
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,720
would make in terms of performance and everything. Even like that night when you're done, the

740
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,640
difference between the day you use it and the day you don't is the difference between feeling like

741
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,400
you're going to die and feeling like, yeah, I'm tired, but I'm okay.

742
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,480
Yeah. And I bet you're like mentally in a lot better place too, right? It's like when you're

743
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:13,240
all super hot or super cold, like it's so easy to go mental really quick. So I bet it helps a ton

744
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:19,480
for you, like your focus. For sure. And even little silly things like you're perspiring less.

745
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,680
And even though you wear like a headstock of balaclava, like anytime sweat is getting in your

746
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:31,880
eyes, it's super annoying. You want to keep your hands on the steering wheel. So it's anything that

747
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:38,040
can get around that. So how do you implement that in a runner then? Like obviously I can see how in

748
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:44,040
strength training you can use that, but if you're training a guy to run a marathon, how can you

749
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:49,880
incorporate any of these cooling things into the actual race? Yeah. So I think part of it is like,

750
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,400
especially for guys who train in hot and humid places is just having it available beforehand.

751
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,840
Right? So at least like after you do your warm up, you do your drills and strides,

752
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,680
you're getting your core temperature back down by doing some heat dumping with your hands, you know?

753
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,240
And then if you're doing training, such as interval training, you know, you can get it in

754
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:12,760
between sets. So I'll have like a bucket of cold water at the track and just between sets, go put

755
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:18,200
your hands in there, dump a bunch of heat, and then back out it. And it definitely like, I feel

756
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,720
like it makes a big difference. You know, I feel like it's super helpful, but in terms of like

757
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,640
applying it while you're actually running, that's where you got to get more creative. So we've done

758
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:30,360
things with like these packs that you break, you know, those instant cold packs, break those open

759
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,640
and just hold them and you don't have to do it for like, I think like two minutes is kind of ideal

760
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,160
to hold them for that long, which is kind of a long time. That's kind of a hindrance, but if it's

761
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,320
worth the trade and you're getting the performance benefit from it, then it's, you know, maybe worth

762
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:48,760
it. But yeah, like I'm curious, I haven't tried the gloves that they have at Stanford that they

763
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,960
use on the football team and a lot of the athletic programs. But again, like you can't like, you know,

764
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,920
stop your run in the middle of a race and put your hands in some cold glove. But who knows like

765
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,480
what the application could be. It just, it just requires somebody to get creative with it, you

766
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,080
know, and figure out a way to make it more applicable to running. Like when you're mentioning

767
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:11,080
like the biking, I was like, Oh, it'd be cool if they could make like somehow the handles

768
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,880
be colder, you know, put some kind of technology in there. So then you're getting palmer cooling

769
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,440
while your hands are on the handles, like things like that. They find a way to do it in a lightweight

770
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,920
way. It could be like really powerful, you know. Yeah. That's actually a great idea if it could be

771
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:32,840
done again, really light because these days most bikes are, most bikes are coming in at below the

772
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:38,760
UCI limit of whatever it is now 14.9 pounds. So most cyclists actually have to add ballast to

773
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,440
their bikes, you know, in the Tour de France, like most cyclists are actually adding weight to their

774
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:48,040
bikes to get them up to legal weight. So yeah, there's definitely a bit of room to play with

775
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,280
there. I don't know how much, but that would be, that would be pretty cool. So speaking of Stanford,

776
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:58,760
that's where you go to college, right? I assume you were recruited very heavily to every, you know,

777
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:04,200
top running powerhouse program there was, right? Yeah. Yeah. Which was cool. Because I was in the

778
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,680
middle of five kids growing up and my dad was a teacher, my mom's a stay-at-home mom. So we're

779
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:13,080
always like, you know, pinch and pennies. So I knew like part of running for me is like, if I'm going

780
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,920
to go to a good college, like I'm going to have to earn my way there kind of thing, you know?

781
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,320
So yeah, it was pretty cool to like be getting recruited all over the place. And it's funny

782
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,600
because Stanford was the one place I was like, I'm definitely not going to Stanford because,

783
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:30,280
you know, I wasn't heavily focused on academics in high school. I knew the academics, like they

784
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:35,160
don't, they don't cut slack to athletes there. Like we're in it just like everyone else, you know,

785
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,880
like there's not a lot of special assistants going on. So I knew it'd be like academically a super

786
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:44,120
big challenge for me as well as like the athletic part. And I was like, I don't know. I just don't

787
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:49,640
want to put myself in that kind of a challenging space. And it was, it was super challenging. Like

788
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:55,480
it was three years of really big struggle. And then, you know, I hit one cross country season

789
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:01,640
really well, was a part of a NCAA winning team, two years there in cross country. And then my,

790
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,280
my fourth year at Stanford, things just clicked. And that's the thing I love about running and

791
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:12,280
fitness in general, it's like everything can be going so wrong for so long. And then yet, like when,

792
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,280
when things start to click, it's such a good feeling when you push through and you get to that

793
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,480
point where it's just coming, you know, the weight's coming off the ground easy. And it's such a cool

794
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,880
feeling. That was the sensation I had during that fourth year, me and my teammate, Ian Dobson went

795
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:32,280
one, two in track. And at that point, like I was, I was having a very lackluster career at Stanford.

796
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:37,480
I'd never even been to NCAA championships in track, but again, in running, it doesn't matter,

797
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,480
right? It's just you and the clock and the other guys out there and everything was clicking. We

798
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:46,280
went one, two in C's and all of a sudden it was like deals are coming in and I had the opportunity

799
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:51,400
to run professionally. And I'm saying for my wife, Sarah, and we, we, I was planning on coming back

800
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,400
for a fifth year, but because things clicked so well that year, I'd seen some of my other

801
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,200
teammates come through Stanford, have a really good fourth year and then not do well their fifth

802
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,640
year and then have no contract. Right. Did you venture your first year? Yeah, I retried my freshman

803
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,160
year. I was, like I said, I was on the struggle bus. I was hurt. I was injured. I was sick. I'd

804
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,600
get poison Oak every winter. Like it was like the perfect combination of everything going wrong. I

805
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,800
was struggling academically. I struggled with depression. Actually left Stanford for a quarter

806
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,000
my sophomore year. I wasn't sure if I was going to go back. And, you know, I thought in that

807
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:31,800
situation that I could change what was going on inside of my head and heart by changing my

808
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,440
location. So I was like, I'm gonna go back home. The last place everything was clicking for me and

809
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,920
everything was working. I was sick of the struggle, you know, and I went back home and got even more

810
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,360
depressed. And I was like, well, that, that was stupid. Like go back to, to where I knew I was

811
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,000
supposed to be and that was Stanford. So I went back there and then things gradually started to

812
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,720
get better. And, um, but yeah, I had my struggles at Stanford, you know, like it was a beautiful

813
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,520
place to go to school, love the people, the environment. I still like to go back and visit

814
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:06,600
there, but it was for the most part, like a big, big struggle in, in all areas, athletically,

815
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:12,920
academically. And, uh, so yeah, but again, I hit it that fourth year and then the doors came open

816
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,600
to thrown professionally and, uh, left the farm after that. What do you, what do you think changed

817
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,120
and clicked? Like what, what do you think you were struggling with from a running perspective? Um,

818
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:29,000
because I think in high school you ran a four Oh two mile, which I know you wanted to break that

819
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,680
four minute barrier, uh, which is pretty rarefied air. Isn't Jim Ryan and Alan Webb,

820
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,840
the only two to do that or has someone else now broken four minutes, uh, for the mile in high

821
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:44,760
school? Yeah. At the time when I was running, there was only four guys who had done it. Um,

822
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,240
so yeah, Jim Ryan, two other guys blanking on their name, then Alan. And, uh, you know,

823
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,920
I was the same year you mentioned swimming with Alan. I love Alan, like good friends with him,

824
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,760
such a good dude. Um, but yeah, I remember watching him run three 53 at pre and it was just

825
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,720
like, my head exploded. It was like, I can't believe I just saw that. That was just like,

826
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,000
that was unbelievable. Right. Like that. Yeah. And then he went to Michigan and struggled, right?

827
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,800
I mean, it wasn't, yeah. Yeah. He struggled his sophomore year. Yeah. Him and I like have a lot

828
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:20,600
of parallels, even like the year that we both hit it big 2007. Um, he set the AR in the, in the mile.

829
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,320
I set the AR in the half. And, um, we were like crossing paths all the time too. Like I was this

830
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,840
roommate over in Europe in 2006 when we were over there racing that summer, we were both struggling,

831
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:38,120
for various reasons, you know, but, um, we, we both like have very high highs and very low lows.

832
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:43,000
Alan and I are pretty similar that way, you know, but he's definitely like one of the most talented

833
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,080
runners I've ever seen. Like the amount of talent that guy has, he just, he, he has such a good work

834
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:53,640
ethic that sometimes it comes back to bite them. Like we'd be on the track in Europe and he goes,

835
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,600
does his run and then he's doing like hurdle drills and plios and all this stuff for like hours

836
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,480
afterwards. And we're all like have left and we're showered up and eating and he's like still out

837
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:09,400
there grinding, right? So he just like would be so intensely focused that, um, you know, when it was

838
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:13,880
clicking, it was great, but I think sometimes he kind of overcooked himself a little bit, but,

839
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:19,000
uh, man, it's such an immense talent and it was so cool to get to see him have his moment, you know,

840
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,760
run three 46 for the mile was he was just, he was insane that year. He was just on fire. He's just

841
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,680
untouchable. If, if the Olympics would have been that year, he'd been a gold medalist, like without

842
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:34,920
a doubt. Do you remember his Olympic trials in 04 in Sacramento when he just ran away from the field?

843
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,760
Like I, you know, that's again, just one of those moments I remember. Cause that, that was actually

844
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:46,120
the summer that I think 03 and 04 were the summers that I saw him the most at the pool. And like you

845
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:50,120
wouldn't believe that that was a 1500 in terms of the margin of victory he had over those guys,

846
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,640
right? Like that looked like a 5,000 or a 10 K in terms of how far ahead he was of everybody else.

847
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:01,400
Yeah. I mean, he was so dominant when he was on, like people weren't beating him. He was,

848
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,240
she was impossible to beat. So he was fun to watch in his, in his prime.

849
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,880
So what do you think changed in your senior year? Oh yeah. Yeah. We were talking about that.

850
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,440
I know. I keep distracting you. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm doing a horrible job here today. I keep taking

851
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,600
us on these tangents and I just, yeah, this is more of a dinner conversation than a podcast.

852
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:26,280
Yeah. No, I like it. I like it. Um, so funny thing is I'm always very concerned with the nuts and

853
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,560
bolts of training, what I'm doing, right? That's always my focus as an athlete. And yet what I've

854
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,920
kind of the lesson that I've had to learn from the time I've gotten into sports since a kid until now

855
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:42,840
at 39 is like, it's way more important how I do what I'm doing, meaning like my heart condition,

856
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,600
what's going on in my head, then what I'm actually doing. So like, for example, like my tendency is

857
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,160
to try to prove myself in training to myself. Like I'm not really trying to prove myself to anyone

858
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:57,480
else. I just want to know I'm fit. I'm ready to go. Right? So oftentimes I'll come to these workouts

859
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,000
and I'm racing them. It's like, I'm going head down, like all out, like everything I have inside

860
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,280
me. Oftentimes I'm going harder in training than I'm going in racing. Right. And yet like that is

861
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:13,320
not the best way for my body to absorb the work. Like I need to be making deposits, not making

862
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:18,600
withdrawals when I'm training. So if I, if I go into these workouts confident in who I am,

863
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:24,120
knowing the purpose of the workout, then I'm in a much better place. I'm absorbing the training a

864
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:30,520
lot better. So, um, what happened to answer your question was my identity was all wrapped up in my

865
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,680
performances. Right? So, and that's why I struggle with depression is I look in the mirror in the

866
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,240
morning. I was struggling with my running. I was hurt. I was frustrated with how things were going.

867
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:45,400
I wasn't getting better. And so I just saw myself as a failure, you know, and, um, is very difficult

868
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:50,440
to have that happen every single morning. Get up, look in the mirror, failure, failure, failure,

869
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,320
failure, you know? And so when I went back home, like my faith has always been a huge part of my

870
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:02,280
life. And, uh, I started to realize like, I need to see myself how God sees me and how God sees me

871
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,200
has nothing to do with my performance. Right? It's like, think about like your kids, right? Like,

872
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,520
you don't really care how good they are at a certain sport, right? Like you love, right?

873
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:16,200
It's unconditional who they are. Yeah. And so like, can I love myself that same way, right?

874
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,440
Oftentimes like we're able to love other people and treat other people a lot better than we actually

875
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:24,680
treat ourself in our mind, you know? And so I started to kind of get to the bottom of that and

876
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,080
be like, you know what? Like God loves me regardless of how I do. So I'm going to choose

877
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,920
on a daily basis. It wasn't a one-time thing. It's still something I have to cultivate to this day.

878
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,560
Like I'm going to choose to love myself regardless of how I'm performing, right? Like what really

879
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:44,040
makes me special has nothing to do with how fast I am or how much weight I can lift or any of those

880
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:50,920
things. And as that began to sink in, it took all the pressure off myself. Like I was just carrying

881
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,720
around this like heavy burden to every single workout, every single race. Because if I wasn't

882
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:01,640
proving to myself that I was important by running fast, I was hating myself, right? And so as I took

883
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:06,120
these weights off and be like, no, actually I'm cool with who I am. Like actually I love myself,

884
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,440
whether I have a great workout or a bad workout, that just took the weights off. And it also made

885
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:15,480
me fearless too. It's like, okay, now I can go out and just air it out and I'm going to fail a bunch

886
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:20,680
of times and I can live with that. I'm okay with that, right? So there's something powerful about

887
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:25,560
coming to peace with the worst case scenario. And it might sound like a place you shouldn't go,

888
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,280
before a race, but oftentimes I do like to go there. I'm like, okay, like I could go out with

889
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,760
all these African guys, go out under 62 minutes for the half marathon in route to a marathon at

890
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:43,320
Boston. I might blow up, might not work out. Like, but hey, I know I can handle that. I know I'm okay.

891
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:49,160
I'm cool with myself if that happens and I'm gonna give myself a shot. And I think that's what we're

892
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:54,440
kind of lacking for a lot of American distance runners is the willingness to put yourself out

893
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,000
there to take a big risk. And that's what the Africans, their mentality is just like, no, you

894
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,120
just go with the lead group. And if you blow up, don't take it personally, get up and go again the

895
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:08,920
next time, right? Like they don't take their failures personally. Whereas like Americans, myself,

896
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,640
like I take it super personally, right? If I fail, that means I'm a failure. For them, it's like they

897
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,640
fail, like that's just a part of the process. Who cares? Like just go again, you know? So as those

898
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:25,240
weights were able to come off me, my approach to workouts, to races changed, things started to

899
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:30,680
click a lot better. A big thing is I learned also too, like I didn't have to beat my work, my teammates

900
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,840
in training anymore. Like I could just work with them. I didn't have to try to drop them. Even if

901
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,520
I could drop them, I was like, I don't need to, like I'm secure in who I am, you know? So that was

902
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:45,480
a huge shift. But again, it wasn't like all of a sudden, and bam, the results came. It was like

903
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:52,520
years and years and then it turned into something. So that was really the most freeing thing I think

904
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,360
I've experienced in my career in terms of what's going on internally that freed me up to enter into

905
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,760
my full potential in running. And despite how much of just this kind of very friendly person you are,

906
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,800
I would imagine that you kind of alienated a lot of teammates when you came in with that mode of

907
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:17,080
every workout is hammer time. Yes. A hundred percent. Like I would go home over the summer

908
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,080
and usually it's supposed to be kind of like chill base building training, right? And I would just

909
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:26,600
train my brains out and I would come back and I would just be blasting everyone all the time.

910
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,600
Yeah. I remember talking to now like one of my good friends and teammates, Ian Dobson,

911
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:35,080
and he's a big reason why I did so well coming out of Stanford in my first years as a pro runner.

912
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,640
He's like, dude, yeah, we used to like not be a fan. Like you're just always trying to like,

913
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:45,400
like you'd always come back in super good shape and you're always taking it to us. And, and that

914
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,240
changed like as I was able to work with guys, I got along a lot better with them. And I just learned

915
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,480
like just communicate with people, right? Like if I tell these guys, like I'm working out with my

916
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,440
teammates, hey guys, like I'm feeling really good. I'm just gonna go a little bit quicker if that's

917
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,640
cool. Like that's a lot different than just like taking off without saying anything. So like for

918
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,880
people who are working out in like group environments, like it's crazy just how that

919
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,760
little communication within the group can really shift things, the dynamics of the group and make

920
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,600
it to where like everyone's cool with what's happening and you're not just like throwing

921
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:20,120
in random surges. And there's a lot of that that goes on and running, you know, within groups,

922
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:25,160
like there's races and different characters and people who can't work out in groups. And

923
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:29,640
it gets, it gets a little bit intense at times, but if, if the communication is there, like guys

924
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,440
can work together and actually make each other better. So when you turn pro, is that what? Oh,

925
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:42,120
five. Yeah. Um, and I think your lead sponsor is a six at the time, right? Yep. Correct. So had it

926
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:47,880
entered your mind yet that you would find your sweet spot in this half marathon to marathon

927
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,480
world, or were you still thinking, you know, I'm going to be a 5k, 10k guy. Like what were you

928
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:57,400
thinking in Oh, five was going to be, uh, the place where you would make your mark? Yeah. So I never

929
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,440
thought I'd run a marathon. Right. So I grew up like loving the movie pre Fontaine and you know,

930
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,160
that scene where he's like, no one's going to tell me I'm not fast enough. You know, but like the

931
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:12,600
truth is like I wasn't fast enough. I wanted to be a miler, right? And kind of like what we're

932
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:18,920
chatting about earlier, the importance of speed. It's like only having, I ran 50 for 400, um, in

933
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:24,360
high school, but only having that kind of speed limited my upper end potential. I mean, in the

934
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:30,680
5,000 meters, guys are closing in 52. So if your top end speed is 50, like you're gonna have a hard

935
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:39,160
time closing in 52, right? So your best 5k is like 13, 16, 16. Yeah. And put that in perspective.

936
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:46,200
What's the American record in the 5k? Good question. Where's it at now? It's around 1250, give or take.

937
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:52,360
Yeah. So at the time, like that was one of the faster times coming out of college, you know,

938
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:57,480
things are definitely shifting a lot with, uh, you know, the new shoe technology and stuff in

939
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:03,640
terms of times. Um, but yeah, at the time, like that was a pretty solid run. So, and, and that's

940
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:10,360
why like coming off the wake of that, I spent a year professionally just focusing on the 5k,

941
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:16,600
didn't improve it all over the 5k. My 5k stayed roughly the same. I think I ran like 1320 something

942
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:22,680
1322 the next year and the Beijing Olympics were kind of on the horizon. The trials was coming up

943
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,520
the following year. And it's kind of one of those things where I was like, I got to figure out

944
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,920
like my vision for my running was always to run with the best guys in the world. And what event

945
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:36,040
not am I going to be most competitive in here? And you know, I'm 23 years old. I got to figure

946
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:41,880
this out. And so I, there was all of a sudden an openness to longer distances. Um, whereas before

947
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,800
I'd always been, like I said, very close minded, just being like, I'm just want to be a world-class

948
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:51,560
miler like Alan was, you know, uh, so how many half marathons had you run before Houston in 07?

949
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:58,120
Zero. That was your first half marathon. Yeah, that was my first. I had run a couple 20k's,

950
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:02,920
which is essentially the same thing. It's like a, a K less. Right. So, um, but yeah,

951
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,280
I got worked on the track that first year and I'll never forget. I was in London,

952
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:11,320
I was racing against, um, Bekayle, which is the world record holder at the time over 5,000 meters.

953
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,320
And, uh, I remember I was coming down the back stretch of the track and I was watching on the

954
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:21,800
jumbotron, Bekayle and Craig Machram, an Australian guy finishing in this kicking dual. And I was like

955
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,240
nowhere even close to him. Right. And it was kind of like one of those moments of being like,

956
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,760
yeah, this isn't, this isn't my best event, like a moment of realization. So then that openness

957
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:35,080
allowed me to start experimenting with longer stuff. So I went home that summer, started

958
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:40,280
training for some longer distance stuff, did the world 20k championships, the US national 20k

959
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,960
champs, and it was clicking pretty well. And then I got into marathon training over the winter,

960
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:51,960
over the late fall slash winter. And Houston was just supposed to be like a check-in along the way.

961
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:57,800
Let's see how this marathon training is going. I was planning on debuting at the Los Angeles marathon,

962
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,600
because there weren't like a lot of offers out on the table, having not really run a lot of longer

963
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,760
distance races. So take me back to this race in Houston. Cause I don't, I don't think, I think I

964
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,160
missed somewhere in there that that was actually your first half marathon because obviously the

965
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:17,080
result of that race is so out of this world that it's, it's easy to miss that little detail. So it's,

966
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:22,440
it's the beginning of 2007 year before, you know, a year and a half before the Olympics,

967
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:27,080
you're sort of trying to figure out where you, where you belong in this running world. You show

968
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:34,440
up to Houston. It's, and at the time the American record for a half marathon is an hour and 55

969
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:39,880
seconds. So tell me what you're thinking at the start line. What are your expectations? What are

970
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,920
you there to prove to yourself? So I had written down on my hands, this was like before the days of

971
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:50,040
like a GPS watch that isn't overly cumbersome, you know, like they're the big old brick ones,

972
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:54,600
but not like little nice ones. So I was just using a Timex watch, right? And so I had written down on

973
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:59,880
my hand, like three different categories of times that I was going for. So like one, if I was having

974
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,520
an A day and that was like just under American record pace, one, if I was having a B day, which

975
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:11,480
was like 61 30 or something and one for like a C day, like 62 flat, right? And and like I said,

976
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:16,920
training was just going phenomenal. Like where I was blowing my own mind, but more like it's the

977
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:23,160
feeling like that's what I love the most about athletics and about running and about that day.

978
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:29,800
Like I described Houston as being like heaven and hell at the same time. It was heaven because like

979
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:36,120
I was floating the whole time. It felt easy the entire way. It was insane. Like the coolest

980
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,400
sensation, one of the coolest bodily sensations I've ever experienced in my life. And if I could

981
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:46,120
go to heaven and experience that feeling of running like that every single day, I would like it was

982
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:51,800
unreal. But the reason why it was also hell and it kind of haunted me is especially all throughout

983
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:57,400
my running careers, I can never get back there. So it is my best half marathon by far. I never

984
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:03,400
broke 61 again, and I can never figure out how to go back to that place. And you went 59,

985
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:12,200
59 43. So you obliterate the American record. Like that's over a minute off the American record.

986
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,600
Right. And so I was running going back to the story of the race, like the first mile,

987
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:21,000
I was just going out and you know, now we have so much science and technology and heart rate we can

988
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,960
go off of. And we're looking at our watch a million times, but again, I'm just looking at like my

989
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:31,640
normal time X watch. And so I am what's happening in my mind in that first mile is I'm literally

990
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:36,200
like going into my mind's eye, picturing myself back on green church road in mammoth where we

991
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:41,480
trained and being like, if I was running a 13 mile threshold, could I maintain this effort that I'm

992
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:46,440
currently at? And the answer was yes. So I was just rolling with it, right? Came through the first

993
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:52,120
miles like 535. I was like, that felt too easy. Like I wasn't supposed to be running this fast,

994
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:56,680
but that just felt too easy. So let me just like notch it down a little bit more. And it

995
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:01,320
effort that I know again, going back in my mind's eye, I know I can hold this effort to the finish

996
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:07,880
and next mile is like 5432. And then the next mile was like 428. And I was just like starting

997
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:13,240
to scare myself a little bit. I was like, okay, like let's not screw this thing up. Like obviously

998
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:17,560
you're going to have a heck of a day today. No one else is around like mebs in the race and all those

999
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:22,840
guys like from the very first miles, just me and the roads, right? But it didn't matter. Like I was

1000
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:29,160
so mentally clicked in and like everything was just firing is just like all how it's supposed to

1001
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:36,760
be, right? Like the most magical sensation like I've ever had. And so I just kept pushing and just

1002
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:42,280
again, like it's waiting for it to get hard almost. And it never, never did. Like I had one issue out

1003
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,840
there around mile nine where my stomach got a little bit turny because over half marathon,

1004
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,160
we're not taking in any fluids if the weather's right, the cool conditions and it was a nice,

1005
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:55,880
cool, perfect day to run in Houston that day, flat course. And so I wasn't taking in anything

1006
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:01,240
around mile nine. My stomach got a little bit upset and that passed a couple minutes later,

1007
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:09,800
but literally like it was easy the entire way. Like I'm still super curious if I had pacemakers

1008
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:15,000
and if that was a full marathon, what I could have run that day. Cause I got myself back in

1009
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,360
really good shape, but never that kind of shape over half marathon again. And, and looking back

1010
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:25,320
on it, that's why I like, I'm such a big proponent of speed now, right? It's like I had spent not just

1011
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,120
the last year focused on 5k development. I had spent my entire running career from the time I was

1012
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:36,280
13 for 10 years until I was 23 working on speed, working on five. And then all of a sudden I piled

1013
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,680
on marathon training where I'm hitting longer thresholds, higher volume than I've ever done

1014
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:46,760
before and bang, there it is. Right. And so that's why that 5k speed, like I can't emphasize it enough

1015
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:51,800
with my athletes. I'm coaching now. Like you just, you have the further away I got from that 5k

1016
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:57,720
fitness, the harder the half felt the harder the marathon felt. But that day in Houston, it was

1017
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:04,680
just like a warm knife through butter all day long. When you crossed that finish line, did you feel

1018
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:10,520
like, you know, I actually could have gone a little bit harder. Yeah, that's interesting, right?

1019
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:16,040
Because I'm talking about how easy it felt yet. Like I wasn't like leaving anything in the tank

1020
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:22,120
necessarily, you know? So I felt like I was running as hard as I ran practice. But I mean, if you watch,

1021
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:26,360
go back and watch like YouTube video, I mean, like I didn't, and that's why like when people do like

1022
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:31,160
kip chogi breaking too, like he didn't look crazy tired after that, right? But there's also, you get

1023
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:36,040
this huge hit of adrenaline when you come across the line, do something like that. Like breaking

1024
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:42,040
60 was kind of a lifetime goal for me. And then to go and do it, my first marathon and like period

1025
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:47,160
was crazy too. Like, so my parents were on the lead vehicle. My wife was on the lead vehicle,

1026
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:52,920
my agent, my coach, they're all on the lead vehicle. So I'm literally staring at them the entire race

1027
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,960
and they're not allowed to cheer or anything. But you know, like any athletic performance that I've

1028
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:04,600
done, like I was just a piece of the puzzle, right? Like it wasn't all me, like my mom, like

1029
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:10,680
she provided the safe place for me, my refuge. Every time I would come back all rattled because

1030
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:14,600
I had a bad workout, I got hurt or whatever. Like she was like, she provided that home that provided

1031
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:20,760
that refuge. My dad was my coach. My wife was there for me through the depression at Stanford and all

1032
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,960
the times, all the good, all the bad, you know? And so staring at the people who are your team,

1033
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:31,400
the entire race was like hugely emotionally empowering for me as well, you know? So I'll

1034
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,200
never forget. I was actually, they get to the finish line, the lead car, they kind of zip up

1035
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:42,760
the road a little bit. They drop my parents and Sarah, my wife, like 200 meters before the finish

1036
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:47,480
line. And they have to like, they're like running back to try to get to the finish before I get

1037
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:53,240
there. So I'm coming down the finishing stretch and I see my mom just like booking it, like trying

1038
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:57,960
to make it to the finish line before I get there. And I actually passed her. She didn't make it. So

1039
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:01,560
like, if you look closely in some of the, they might've blurred her out in some of the pictures,

1040
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:06,600
but like she's in the back like sprinting behind me. But yeah, I'll never forget like coming across

1041
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,400
the finish line, giving my parents a big hug, giving my wife big hug, my coach. And it was kind

1042
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:16,360
of this, the sensation of like, we did this, you know? Like it wasn't so special because I felt

1043
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:22,760
like I had done anything incredible, but it was like, we all did this thing together. And it was

1044
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:27,000
just an amazing lifetime, you know, moment that I'll never forget.

1045
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,520
Now from a professional standpoint, how much did your life change in that moment? Because that

1046
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:36,840
really puts you on the map as America's great hope for the marathon in 2008, right?

1047
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:42,120
Yeah. I mean, it was huge. I went from, you know, like a guy who was decent on the track,

1048
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:46,760
NCAA champs. I had a little bit of credentials behind me that put me inside of the top 10

1049
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:51,400
all-time performers over half marathon. So it was kind of like all of a sudden this moment of

1050
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:56,280
realization of like, oh dang, like I have a chance at this. Like I have a chance at meddling

1051
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:01,000
in Beijing. Like I, you know, there was just the excitement of like, I found it. Like I felt like

1052
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,360
I'd been hitting my head against a wall for so long with the shorter distance stuff. Just wasn't

1053
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:12,440
quite clicking, right? Like it just wasn't quite me. And that day in Houston is like,

1054
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,160
this is what I was created to do, right? And I think it's, we all have this kind of experience

1055
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:23,160
in life where we're kind of searching out like, what am I here for? Like, why was I created? Like,

1056
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:29,480
what is my giftedness? When you find like that area where like, this is why I'm here. This is

1057
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:35,640
how I was made to, this is what I was made to do, right? It's kind of that moment of like, whoa,

1058
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:41,240
like this is, this is it. This is my thing, you know? And it did like create a little bit more of

1059
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:46,920
heighten my own expectations, you know? Like after that, like I never showed up in another race

1060
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:53,320
thinking I couldn't win or not having high expectations for the race, you know? So that

1061
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:58,440
was maybe a little bit of a harder thing for me to manage. But it was just more than anything,

1062
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:03,800
just a cool moment of like realizing like now I'm in the club, you know, with the best guys in the

1063
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,000
world. I think you said it really well, right? Which is this was heaven, this was hell. And

1064
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:14,360
the hell part of that is something that I've always observed great athletes with just a

1065
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:21,800
tincture of sadness too, because the stage on which you compete is the most brutal stage,

1066
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:28,600
because it's the one for which you have the shortest half-life, right? So, you know, when you

1067
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:34,120
say like, this is what I was meant to do, on the one hand, most of us can not even relate to what

1068
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:38,600
you're talking about, right? Like I can't relate to being the best in the world at anything.

1069
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:44,520
Anything. I couldn't relate to being the best, the best, the thousandth best person in the world at

1070
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:50,760
anything. Anything, right? Physical, not physical, doesn't matter. But now when you take that thing

1071
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:58,200
that is your gift and you acknowledge that, well, actually it's something that is very fleeting,

1072
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:03,400
right? Like there's a very narrow window in your life in which you get to be really good at this.

1073
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:08,280
And by the way, as a runner, technically it's a day, right? Like you're going to have a single

1074
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:12,920
best run and you don't necessarily know when it's going to be. You might be very good for a

1075
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,680
decade, but there's really going to be a time when you look back and say, that was the best I could

1076
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:22,360
ever do. Obviously for the half marathon, we know when that day was. Four years later, it would be

1077
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:31,320
your best marathon of all time. But I think for some people, I would imagine at least that makes

1078
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:37,720
being a retired athlete or an athlete who's passed his or her prime a very difficult process.

1079
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,480
Do you talk with your athletes about that? Even though they're on the upswing, right? They're in

1080
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:49,240
the part of the, hey, I want to get better. I want to get better. But do you spend any time with them

1081
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:55,000
talking about, hey, first of all, enjoy this like crazy because it's going to be gone and it's going

1082
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,240
to be gone probably by the time you're 30 and you have the rest of your life to not be the best at

1083
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:07,560
this thing. And secondly, here's how you can prepare for that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I talk a lot

1084
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:12,920
with my wife about that because she's 38 turning 39 in April and she's actually running the best

1085
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:17,800
stuff she's ever run still, which is incredible. And I think speaks to like why women age better

1086
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:23,080
than men in a lot of ways. But what was really impactful for me at the end of my career

1087
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:27,960
was this moment I was in an airplane. I was looking out over everything and just trying

1088
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,280
to get clarity about what was going on. So I just been through four years of massive struggle,

1089
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:36,280
right? And what I felt like was just kind of like having a little prayer sesh with God. And

1090
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:43,000
what I felt like was sensing is just this reminder that it's not meant to last forever.

1091
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,080
Because I think like you're saying Peter, it's like when you're in it, you feel like it is going

1092
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:52,040
to last forever and it is supposed to last forever. But that's actually the like what makes

1093
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:58,120
life so beautiful, right? Is that like nothing lasts forever, right? It's like what makes the

1094
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:03,080
sunset so beautiful. It doesn't just stay in the sky forever. So what makes life so special because

1095
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:09,720
it's not just going to go on forever, right? So having that moment of realization that this,

1096
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:16,600
it's okay for it to not last forever. It's okay that like that was my day. And I did, I savored it

1097
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:21,000
for everything is worth, right? And that's absolutely what I tell my athletes as well, like

1098
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:27,080
savor every second of it, right? But life is going to change. You're going to enter into new seasons.

1099
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:32,520
And life is beautiful every single day all around you, right? So like having this perspective of

1100
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:38,840
yes, this is very important. This is what we're going after. But like true beauty is around us

1101
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:43,880
all the time. If we have the eyes to see it and the ears to hear it. And so like removing ourselves

1102
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:48,520
from performance some ways can be super, super helpful. Not only as we transition out of sport,

1103
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,080
but even when we're in sport and just being like, this is something that is adding to my life. It

1104
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:58,280
is not my life, right? And like I can have this day in Houston, have this very beautiful experience,

1105
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:04,200
this very magical day, but I can actually just go for a walk outside my house and look at the trees

1106
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:09,880
and look at the sun and the stars and be outside in the moon and get the same kind of like gratitude

1107
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:16,840
for life just by simply entering into nature and being fully present in it. So I've definitely

1108
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:21,640
like my perspective has changed as for a long time, just all wrapped into this performance,

1109
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:27,960
performance, performance, performance, you know? And it's easy to be that way. And I do enjoy going

1110
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:32,520
after performances. I love like seeing growth, seeing change in the body, seeing adaptation,

1111
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:38,680
going after big goals. Like I love that's still very much who I am. And I think that's something

1112
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:43,560
that helps people transition out of the sport. A lot of people talk about having a sense of identity

1113
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:48,200
loss when they stop doing whatever their sport is. But for me, like I had to figure out how do

1114
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:54,680
I stay true to who I am? Because running was just an expression of who I was, right? And it was

1115
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:00,520
like my painting, right? But now like I have to find another mechanism to express who I am. So

1116
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:05,080
I'm doing that like in the lifting space and these crazy challenges that I'm doing, I'm still like

1117
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:10,120
finding a way to express myself. And I think that's what as humans like we want to have that

1118
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:15,400
experience, right? Like we're here for a reason and we want to express ourselves on our canvas,

1119
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:20,920
whatever it might be. And when you lose that ability to be able to express yourself,

1120
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:25,400
that's when things can get dark pretty quick, right? So like for people, for my athletes who

1121
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,720
are transitioning out of the sports being like, okay, like how do you stay true to who you are?

1122
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:34,360
Like I love physical challenge. I love seeing growth. And so I'm going to express it now through

1123
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:37,960
lifting. And that's going to come to an end at some point. And then I'm going to find another

1124
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:43,080
way to express it. But I think as long as we're continually finding ways to be ourself and to

1125
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:48,840
express ourself, we're going to be happy individuals. In some ways, your experience

1126
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:54,920
post this amazing breakthrough in the half marathon is kind of paralleled in a way with

1127
01:39:54,920 --> 01:40:00,920
what happened in 2011, right? So you go into Beijing in 08, in some ways with the expectation

1128
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:04,920
of the running world on your shoulders, like you're going to medal in the marathon. Your

1129
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:11,080
trajectory has been unbelievable. We talked about that race, 10th place finish still very impressive,

1130
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:15,560
especially the way in which you did it where you went out a little tentative and then had to kind

1131
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:22,920
of try to reel people back and go from 60th to 10th. Now let's fast forward. It's 2011.

1132
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,360
How were you feeling going into the Boston marathon that year? What was it about your

1133
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:32,200
training that led you into that race so poised to do so well?

1134
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:39,400
Yeah, so I had a big transition. So I was trained up in Mammoth and in 2010,

1135
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:45,000
I left the Mammoth Track Club. And again, a big part was my faith was inspiring that decision.

1136
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,040
I've always just been a super spiritual person and have a ton of respect from people of every

1137
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:55,160
faith, tradition, and background. But for my own journey, I just love that part of life,

1138
01:40:55,160 --> 01:41:01,560
that spiritual dimension. And I was just really desperate to experience God in some way, right?

1139
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:06,360
So I decided to leave the Mammoth Track Club and essentially have God as my coach. But really,

1140
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:11,960
that just looked like me spending a lot of time in prayer, trying to connect with God. And again,

1141
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:17,160
that's where I got this kind of revelation. It's not about what I do. It's about how I do what I

1142
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:21,400
do. That came from that season. So I kind of went through the season and then I was kind of

1143
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:27,160
experimenting with some new styles of training that I'd never done before. And again, new stimulus

1144
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:30,680
always is helpful for the body, right? So I'd been kind of in the same routine,

1145
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,360
the same doing the same structured training. And there's little variations.

1146
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:38,920
Tell me a little bit about that. Because one of the things my wife actually insisted on today,

1147
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,080
and I'm not doing a good job of it, though I promise I will, is she, my wife's a runner,

1148
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:48,520
and she really wants to know every detail about your training. And so maybe we can talk a little

1149
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:55,000
bit about it here in the pre-transition, so i.e. in the 2010 Mammoth Days, kind of what's your

1150
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,160
volume? How did you warm up? How much body work were you doing? What kind of stretching? All that

1151
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:03,640
sort of stuff. Like what were the tempo runs like? And then I'm curious to hear what that looked like

1152
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:08,200
when you basically became self-coached, right? Post, post that departure.

1153
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:13,560
Yeah, so it's pretty simple, you know? It's like just to lay out like a quick sample week. Like

1154
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:18,120
every Tuesday I'm doing interval sessions where you're working on that kind of like 5k specific

1155
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:25,560
kind of speed. Things like 6xmile, 10xk, 800 meter repeats, 400 meter repeats. I've kind of

1156
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:30,840
since gravitated more towards shorter distance repeats, 400s, 200s, things like that. I think

1157
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:36,120
that's way more important for marathoners because you kind of want a lot of differential between

1158
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:41,160
how fast those Tuesday intervals are compared to your like Thursday or Friday threshold.

1159
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:45,480
Prior to your departure when they were one mile repeats and 1k repeats,

1160
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:52,200
let's say the main set was 10 by a kilometer or 6xmile. That's the main set. What's the warm-up?

1161
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:56,200
How do you go from like when you arrive at the track, what's the first thing you do?

1162
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:02,760
So we do like 20-minute easy jog and then we'd come back, do some like dynamic flexibility or

1163
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:07,880
maybe some static stuff but not a lot of static stretching going on. Stretching has not been a huge

1164
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:13,160
part of like my running. You actually want some tension in your legs. Think about it like your

1165
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:18,200
muscles being springs. Like if there's some tension, a tightly wound spring is going to respond to the

1166
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:22,600
ground quicker, right? Compared to like a slinky that's super slow. So you actually want a certain

1167
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:26,360
amount of tension, healthy tension. You want full range of motion. But so we're doing a lot

1168
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:31,080
so like mobility work to get that full range but keeping some tension in the legs. So not a lot of

1169
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:36,680
static. That 20-minute jog for you is what pace? That's like eight minute mile. I mean, how slow?

1170
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:41,320
Yeah, yep. Kind of like that eight minute mile pace kind of range. Kind of just like let your

1171
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:44,920
body do what it wants to do but no effort, right? You're not breathing hard. You're conversational

1172
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:50,040
the whole time. Get back, you do that dynamic flexibility and stuff. Go into some drills and

1173
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:54,520
strides. And I have videos of all this on my YouTube channel, Run Free Training YouTube channel.

1174
01:43:54,520 --> 01:44:00,520
People are curious to check it out. But drills and strides before maybe like it takes like

1175
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:05,400
five, 10 minutes to do that. The strides are maybe like six times a hundred meters,

1176
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:10,440
something like that. And then change shoes into your racing shoes and then straight into the workout.

1177
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:15,320
And then you would do, let's say it's a six by a mile. How fast would you run that mile? So if your

1178
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:23,400
your half marathon pace would be a 432-ish, your marathon pace would be a 442 to 445.

1179
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:28,280
How much faster do you need to run that mile? So yeah, if we're doing it up at altitude,

1180
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:34,360
I would typically be running right around that kind of 430 pace at 7,000 feet. So if you're down

1181
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:40,600
at sea level, that's kind of equivalent to like 420-ish, maybe a tad bit under. So that the six

1182
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:46,280
by a mile and the K's, that's more of like 10K specific workout. But again, I would kind of

1183
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:51,400
gravitate more towards like 5K specific stuff. How much rest in between each set?

1184
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:57,960
So with the miles, we'd keep it fairly tight, like 90 seconds to two minutes. Again,

1185
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,720
kind of depends. It's like when you're at altitude, you take a little bit more rest,

1186
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:08,360
but it's crazy. As you get fit, you recover super fast. And the intensity, it's like we're not

1187
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:12,840
doing like max sprints where those guys got to take like 10 minutes between sprints. Right.

1188
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:17,080
Like we're very much like when you're doing that 10K range, ideally you're running an effort,

1189
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:21,480
you should be able to hold for 10K and you're stopping at a mile. So you're not like killing

1190
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:25,560
it, you know? So anywhere between 90 seconds and two minutes on the rest. Walking during the

1191
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:31,080
90 second recovery or standing still? Yeah, you're walking. Kind of sometimes we're like walk jogging,

1192
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:35,560
just like slow walk jog. Kind of depends. Like I like doing in and out kind of intervals too.

1193
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:39,880
That was like one of Prefontaine's workouts where he'd do like 200 meters fast, 200 meters kind of

1194
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:45,960
moderate. So the moderate part would be at like eight minute pace or even faster, like seven minute

1195
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:52,520
pace. And then the fast part is like goal 5K pace or slightly slower than mile pace even. So there's

1196
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:57,560
a lot of different ways, variations that we take on those workouts. And what would be the cool down

1197
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:03,560
at the end of that main set? And then a 20 minute cool down. And then the whole day, you know,

1198
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:10,040
we're just spent like resting, doing some mobility work, eating, ice bath thing, which,

1199
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:14,200
you know, it's funny, like the science on the ice bath has changed quite a bit. Like we would go

1200
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:19,080
from these workouts in long run straight to the creek, straight into cold water. Whereas, you know,

1201
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:23,720
the science is now showing you want your body to respond to the inflammation first. So that's more

1202
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:29,080
what we do now where we would do an ice bath. I don't, we don't do a ton of ice baths in general,

1203
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:33,800
but there's a whole bunch of other good positive effects of ice bath thing like dopamine going up

1204
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:39,160
10 fold and all this stuff. Right. That's enough. Some antidepressant effects. Right. And would you

1205
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:44,120
be doing two workouts on that day or one? So yeah. So then we'll come back in the afternoon,

1206
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:49,800
just like a 30, 35 minute easy run, and then go straight to the weight room and then do our leg

1207
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:54,920
lifting. So that's, that's a mistake. I see a lot of runners make is you want all your leg stressors

1208
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:58,840
to be on the same day. And it's not what you feel like doing. Like you don't feel like doing

1209
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:03,560
weights after doing a hard run. You do the hard run first, and then ideally you come back in the

1210
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:07,240
afternoon. You could do it right after the hard run, but you probably won't get quite as much out

1211
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,160
of it. Cause you're bringing fatigue into the lifting. If you space it out a little bit more,

1212
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:16,360
you usually feel better during the lifting. So yeah, we do our hard leg session in the afternoon

1213
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:22,440
and then, and then head home, eat early to bed. I always describe my life was more of a professional

1214
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:27,240
sleeper than a professional running. Like honestly, I was just sleeping all the time. I

1215
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:33,560
would book out every single day from one to 3 PM would be my business meeting. And so no calls,

1216
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:38,040
nothing scheduled during that time. And those were just two hour naps every single day. So

1217
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:42,200
the sleep and that's the thing. So what were you sleeping like 10 hours a day between the nap and

1218
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:47,080
night? Yeah, yeah, probably right around there. I'm like, I'm probably in bed for nine to 10 hours

1219
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:52,200
every night, but there's also be some restlessness from the hard training and, and honestly,

1220
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:56,920
maybe even from sleeping too much, you know, I wasn't very sleep deprived. So sometimes I'd

1221
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:02,360
wake up in the middle of the night, be starving, go get some a snack, get back in bed, lay there

1222
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:07,080
and awake for an hour or two, then fall back asleep. But just you want, it's like, like the

1223
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:11,960
Kenyans, the Ethiopians, they spend a ton of time off their feet as well. Right? So it's like when

1224
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:18,360
you're not training, you're trying to not be doing anything. So we're like runners, pro runners are

1225
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:24,600
very lazy people like from day to day, like don't go for walks or hikes or do anything. It's just

1226
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:30,360
train, eat, sleep, stay off your feet. Like, and you're always aware of that energy expenditure.

1227
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:34,680
You're trying to save as much as you can for your training. I remember in high school, I grew up in

1228
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:39,560
Canada and so we had a lot of really amazing Jamaican runners. Of course they were sprinters

1229
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:44,680
and they used to just tease each other so much because they'd be like, they'd be like, look,

1230
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:50,680
we are the laziest people you will ever meet. And if you want to make us run faster, just put a

1231
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:55,240
couch at the finish line. Like whoever can get to the finish line first gets to lay on that couch.

1232
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:01,880
But it was really work hard, play hard, right? It was really like super intense workouts these guys

1233
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:09,640
would do. And then as much nothing as possible to really conserve energy. Now, as you probably know,

1234
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:16,760
cyclists have to work very hard deliberately to calorie restrict and often they show up

1235
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:21,560
to major tour events, right? So not the one day classic stuff, but when you're thinking about

1236
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:27,400
the Tour de France, the Giro, the Vuelta, these sort of huge stage races, they're very depleted,

1237
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:33,560
right? They're showing up, like they're trying to be as light as possible. Everything comes down to

1238
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:38,440
this one single metric that I think running doesn't quite have, but in cycling you have this thing

1239
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:43,880
called Watts per kilo. Everything is Watts per kilo. If you lined up all the cyclists at the

1240
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:49,960
beginning of the Tour de France, and you could know what everybody's threshold was in Watts per kilo,

1241
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:55,720
that would predict the order they would finish barring a strategic mishap or an injury or an

1242
01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:03,000
accident. How deliberately were you watching your weight during this period of time? Or were you

1243
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,760
basically just saying, I could eat as much as I wanted and my weight would basically float to a

1244
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:14,200
level that I was happy with? Yeah, no. I mean, I was very specific with it. And preface all this

1245
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:18,840
with just saying, it's not the most healthy lifestyle, right? Doing what I was doing,

1246
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:23,960
training the level I was doing wasn't optimal for my health. My testosterone was clinically low

1247
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:29,320
every single time I tested it, right? How low? In the hundreds, like 150, something like that.

1248
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:35,160
So you had the testosterone of a woman. Yeah, which is really interesting. How do you run so

1249
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:40,440
fast with such low testosterone? I don't understand that. Yeah. When I finished residency,

1250
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:46,200
my testosterone was in the two twenties. So it was probably in the low 200s throughout all of

1251
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:50,200
residency, and not because of training, just because of sleep deprivation and a whole bunch

1252
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:59,000
of other factors. But wow, that's 100s is staggeringly low. Yeah. And it would kind of come back up

1253
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,320
when I take these two week breaks, right? So going back to the weight thing, I would take,

1254
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:09,880
I would get down to, ideally I raced my best at 137. I got, I'm five foot 10. I got down as low

1255
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:17,560
as 127, but I wasn't, if I was less than 137, I was getting worse, which is really interesting.

1256
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:22,280
Cause I was on Lance's podcast and we were chatting about this and he said he didn't ever

1257
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:27,240
feel like he could get too light. Whereas I was much the opposite. If I was under 137, it was,

1258
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:34,280
it was not good for me at all. Lance was a really big cyclist for his type of racing. I mean,

1259
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:43,160
Lance's race weight was like 160 to 165, which for a guy who's five foot nine, five foot 10,

1260
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:51,640
that's quite a lot of weight for a guy who was such a good climber. And I think today we see

1261
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:57,640
guys being quite a bit lighter in the, in the, in that group. Like I think a GC contender today

1262
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:06,280
is God, probably like 140 pounds, you know, five, five nine 140 would be a great cyclist build.

1263
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:12,760
So for you to be, so if you're, if you're optimal, which by the way, 137, that still

1264
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:18,840
strikes me as crazy light, but if you're 137, were you managing up to that weight or down to that

1265
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,960
weight? Down to that weight. So, so yeah, I take these two week breaks where I wouldn't run at all

1266
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:29,720
and literally it was like donut eating competition for two weeks. So I would, I'd literally put on

1267
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:36,120
like over 10 pounds in that two week period. And I hated myself for doing that. Like it wasn't good

1268
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:41,640
for me emotionally or mentally, but it worked every single time for my buildup. So again,

1269
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:47,240
I'm not saying like athletes should do this, right? But my problem was I was getting so lean and so

1270
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:51,880
like I, I should have taken a more healthy approach to putting on weight, to being good to

1271
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:57,400
my body, shifting my macros around during that time off and doing a healthy way, not with a bunch of

1272
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:04,680
crap like I was doing. But I'd put on those 10 pounds, 12 pounds, get up to like 150 ish. And

1273
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:10,920
then it'd be like a six month gradual reduction in body weight to where I'd get to that 137,

1274
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:16,600
just like a couple of weeks before my competition. And then I was, I was good to go. But also too,

1275
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:21,240
like I think it's highly specific for athletes. So like I said, I'm in the middle of five kids,

1276
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:28,600
my brothers who aren't athletic, like walk around at like 165 to 170. So that's probably where my

1277
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,880
natural body weight should be somewhere right in that range. And so I was trying to get down to

1278
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:39,000
weights that were pretty far from my normal, right? So, and that's why it was like pretty unhealthy

1279
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,920
for me to be and why I couldn't stay down in those 137s, 140s for very long. Cause I would

1280
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:49,640
just get super, super rundown. My motivation would go down. My training would go to crap.

1281
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:55,880
So, you know, I was again, if someone is more naturally made to be a marathon or smaller frame

1282
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:01,240
sits already, like their normal body weight would be like my wife, Sarah, like she sits around like

1283
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:05,800
110 ish year round. But even if she wasn't running, she'd probably be about the same weight, right?

1284
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:10,440
So she can sit at that weight year round, no problem. Whereas for me, like it's not healthy

1285
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:15,080
for me to be down at 137. So I have to come back out of it. So that's where it's really important

1286
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:19,000
for people to just know their body and where it should naturally be. And then realizing, okay,

1287
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,160
if you're going to manipulate it down to a range where you're the fastest and the lightest at,

1288
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:27,160
you got to come back out of that as well. Yeah. My wife's the same way. Sure. Her walk

1289
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:35,240
around weight is 110, 111, and she has to work to maintain that weight as opposed to do anything

1290
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:40,440
else. And I think that's probably why she's just a good runner is it's just, she's naturally so

1291
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:48,040
light that it comes to her easily in that regard. So tell me what volume, what was your weekly

1292
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:53,480
mileage when you were still training with Mammoth? So it was probably, you know, again, this was like

1293
01:54:53,480 --> 01:55:00,280
pre-garmin days, it's probably around like 110 or so. I thought it was more than that, but then we

1294
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:04,040
got garments and started measuring a lot of the loops we were doing for our easy running. We're

1295
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:07,960
like, oh, these aren't nearly, they're like a mile shorter than we thought. So it's probably a

1296
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:12,120
little bit less than I thought, but those easy days are just chill. And then I think this is the

1297
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:16,360
other mistake that a lot of runners make is they're just kind of running the same all the time.

1298
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:21,000
And that will get you to a certain level, right? Like there's a place for that. But if you really

1299
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,400
want to see how good you can get, you got to like have your hard days super hard and your easy days

1300
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:30,920
super chill. So like oftentimes, like, you know, like I said, I'm running 12 miles under five minute

1301
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:36,520
pace. And then the next day I'm coming back and running like 830 pace for an easy run, just super,

1302
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:41,960
super chill and slow. So having that kind of variance between pacing, I think is super important.

1303
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:45,880
I mean, it's not really rocket science, right? It's like you stress the body, you rest the body,

1304
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:51,880
it adapts, and then you keep repeating the cycle over and over. It's not rocket science, but I mean,

1305
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:55,960
if there's one thing that I spend a lot of time talking about with my patients when it comes to

1306
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:01,720
this particular aspect of training, it's, and again, this isn't to train them for to become

1307
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:05,880
competitive athletes, but it's important from a physiologic standpoint, as we think about

1308
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:14,360
longevity, it's most people are training in this garbage zone, where it's too high an intensity

1309
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:22,360
to build a true aerobic foundation and too low an intensity to truly stress the body glycolytically.

1310
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:27,960
So, you know, we talk about it in zones, right? So there, we think zone two is how we describe it.

1311
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:34,520
And this is, we define it by lactate metabolism. So zone two is that all day pace. Lactate has to

1312
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:40,120
be below two millimolar. You have to be able, this is a pace you should be able to hold all day from a

1313
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:45,720
metabolic standpoint. You probably can't hold it all day from a muscular and structural standpoint,

1314
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:51,560
but metabolically, you should be able to hold this pace all day. And that's easier than, you know,

1315
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:56,920
people are used to training. And then at the other end of the spectrum, there's like gotta be

1316
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:03,160
this real push pace, kind of your four by four pace, right? Four on, all out, four off. And most

1317
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:08,840
people aren't used to that level of discomfort. So they're kind of in this no man's land. So they're

1318
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:13,880
suffering two problems. One, they're in a physiologic no man's land and two, there's no variability to

1319
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:19,400
it anyway. So even though you say it's obvious, I think it's important for people to hear this

1320
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:24,440
discussion because I don't think enough people understand both for performance and also longevity

1321
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:30,760
why you have to be at the more extremes of kind of zone two, zone five is where the progress comes.

1322
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:37,160
And one kind of like easy way to help manipulate this system a little bit is if you're a coffee

1323
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:41,320
drinker and you talked a little bit about caffeine, but like we'd only have caffeine before our hard

1324
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:46,600
days. And then so the easy day, like you feel like death, like you're tired from the workout,

1325
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:50,680
but also cause you don't have caffeine on board and you you're just kind of forced to take it

1326
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:55,320
really slow. Like you don't feel like you could run fast if your life depended on it. So if you

1327
01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:01,000
try into like a lot of the clients we're working with run free, it's like not reasonable for them

1328
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,960
to not have any caffeine on the day, but we're like, let's at least manipulate it. So you're

1329
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:09,480
having it more so before the hard workouts and then a lot less on the easy day. And there are

1330
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:13,480
some athletes I'm sure you've seen that don't really get a benefit from caffeine. Like I never

1331
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:19,560
got a benefit from caffeine. And to this day, like I can drink coffee at any time of day,

1332
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:25,960
has no bearing on my sleep. So I get no up from it. I get no down from it. I just, I could drink

1333
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:31,320
three coffees a day for a month and then stop experience, no headaches, no withdrawal,

1334
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:37,800
not even notice it. And there are different genes that are responsible for caffeine metabolism. So

1335
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:43,960
people do sort of vary in that, but I've always been incredibly envious of the people who are

1336
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:50,280
very sensitive to caffeine because it's an awesome tool to have in your toolkit for just this purpose,

1337
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:54,120
but also just for wakefulness and overcoming jet lag and travel and stuff like that.

1338
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:59,320
Yeah. Yeah. When used correctly, it can be super helpful. Of course, like when abused and if you're

1339
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:03,240
sensitive to it and you're drinking it later in the day and it screws up your sleep, then it's,

1340
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:07,160
you know, stops being helpful. But yeah, yeah, it's interesting. It's like, like I was saying,

1341
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:11,240
everyone's an experiment of one, right? So that's why you got to just play with stuff till you find

1342
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:15,960
what works for you. So once you became self coached, did you, how did the workouts change?

1343
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:21,160
What did you do leading up to 2011 Boston in terms of volume, intensity and everything else?

1344
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:26,280
So one of the big adjustments I made, I started spacing things out. So I don't think I finished

1345
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:31,240
the week. So we had the intervals on Tuesday, you know, and then like a long threshold on Friday.

1346
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:34,920
So you get two easy days before that. So you're feeling a little bit better for that threshold.

1347
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:40,520
And tell me about the threshold threshold is a constant. It's like a simulated slightly higher

1348
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:47,080
than race pace, shorter distance. Yeah. Yeah. And it gets more towards race pace as it gets longer.

1349
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:52,040
So we grow those out. You're starting out at maybe like five or six miles and then you get to

1350
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:56,760
where you're doing 15 miles straight without stopping. And I would do three of those every

1351
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,480
single 12 week buildup for a marathon, which that would be a very typical buildup for marathon,

1352
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:06,040
about 12 weeks. I make sure I get three of those long thresholds in. And those were my

1353
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:10,600
biggest indicator workouts. It's kind of like whatever I knew I could hold for 15 miles in

1354
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:15,960
training in the context of hard training, right? So it's not like you don't fully taper for this

1355
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:19,640
workout and just bang the heck out of it and be like, Oh, I can run this for a marathon. It's like,

1356
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:23,560
no, your legs like need to be a little bit fatigued. You need to be in the middle of hard training.

1357
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:27,160
But then generally speaking, whatever you can run for that 15 mile threshold,

1358
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:31,400
you can hold for a marathon, which is also kind of like mind blowing and hard for first time

1359
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:36,120
marathoners to believe that. Cause you're like, how do I go 11 more miles at this pace? But that's

1360
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:40,920
the magic of tapering the energy out on the course, the carb loading, all that stuff. Like

1361
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:46,120
your body finds a way to be able to hold that through. So that, that 15 mile threshold or

1362
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:50,440
that threshold of varying distances on Friday and then Sunday coming back with a long run.

1363
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:54,360
So again, you're doing that long run with a little bit of fatigue in your, in your legs.

1364
02:00:54,360 --> 02:01:00,600
That'd be anywhere from an hour 45 to two and a half hours. But during that time work,

1365
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:05,400
and we would go off time, not distance, but we're covering, sometimes I'd be running over

1366
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:10,520
the marathon distance for two and a half hours. Right? So those are, those are high quality

1367
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:16,360
efforts. Oftentimes it's kind of like medium pace. So say maybe six minute pace for the first half of

1368
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:19,880
that. And then the second half of that we're doing like fart like style running where you're

1369
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:25,160
practicing changing gears on tired legs and just hitting that aerobic end a little bit harder

1370
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:30,760
towards the end of it. But a lot of it is just like mentally learning, like how do I turn my legs

1371
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:37,560
on when I feel really dead, when I'm 25 miles into this race? How do I, what cues can I go to,

1372
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:42,440
to turn things on and to change gears here? Cause it's, it doesn't matter if you're running

1373
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:47,320
six minute pace or eight minute pace, when you get 20 miles into your run, you feel tired. Right?

1374
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:52,520
And so you got to just learn like, okay, what mental cues can I pull on here to turn everything

1375
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:59,000
on? Okay. So, but everything you just described was how you were doing it before 2011. So then,

1376
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,720
and then how did you tweak that formula? So I started spacing things out a little bit more.

1377
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:10,200
Started just taking two easy days between every session. So I was, I was focusing on like a nine,

1378
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:16,840
10 day cycle, but then I was making those workouts higher quality bigger. So like one workout that I

1379
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:21,560
implemented instead of saying like those Tuesday short sessions, which just might have been a

1380
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:27,320
little bit again, I think I got too far away from 5k fitness. I should have spent more time developing

1381
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:34,040
that, but, but this workout I absolutely love for marathoning where I do 20 by a thousand meters

1382
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:40,920
with a 200 meter easy jog between each thousand meter. And that was done faster than marathon

1383
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:45,240
pace. So the goal is to like drive your threshold down. So you spend all this time doing threshold

1384
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:49,240
running at a certain pace, and then you're going just a tad bit quicker than that for

1385
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:55,160
these broken up thresholds. And so how much quicker, so your, if your marathon target pace

1386
02:02:55,160 --> 02:03:00,520
for a K is what is two, just under three minutes or just over three minutes? Yeah.

1387
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:07,960
Three minutes is a 206 and change 206 30 marathon. So yeah. So like maybe I'll be shooting for like

1388
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:16,120
two 55s, like five seconds, okay. Quicker kind of feel. How many days would, let's just assume

1389
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:21,320
we're talking about it as a week, even though it's a nine day cycle, how many weeks would you succeed

1390
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:28,280
on that day where you would actually go to 55 or better for each of the 20 K versus

1391
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:35,560
fail somewhere along the way? You know, actually I think I was pretty successful most days, right?

1392
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,920
But I think a lot of that is because I wasn't trying to bite off more than I can chew, right?

1393
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:43,560
Like I wasn't trying to hit home runs and workouts. Like they were workouts where I was kind of set

1394
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:51,160
up to see success and often to like my thresholds would just get better every time I would attempt

1395
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:56,360
it, right? As the build up is going, I'm getting stronger, I'm getting in better shape. I'm also

1396
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:01,000
getting lighter, which is making things a little bit easier. And so usually I've seen pretty good

1397
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:08,520
progress from that 12 12 week buildup where I'm getting pretty almost what would happen though,

1398
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:13,400
more likely than not in almost every single buildup I have is you get little niggles, right?

1399
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:18,760
Where you get little like foot pain, little knee pain, just little things that pop up. So if I

1400
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:23,720
missed a workout is usually more for that reason. And then that's when you got to like go to the

1401
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:29,960
cross training, which is an area I've also like learned in and grown so much in and utilize a lot

1402
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:33,560
more now as a coach than when I was running. But when I was a runner, I was just kind of like the

1403
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:39,160
old school, like, like run or die kind of mentality, which is not not a helpful mentality to have.

1404
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:43,880
So what did you expect to happen on that April day in 2011?

1405
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:51,320
So I was coming off a terrible half marathon. So a month before that race, I ran, I don't even,

1406
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:55,400
I can even tell you my time. I don't think I ever looked it up. It was like 66 minutes or something

1407
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:59,880
for a half marathon, which is, you know, seven minutes off my personal best and training and

1408
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:03,480
being going super well. Things have been clicking well. I thought it was in really good shapes.

1409
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:07,480
Kind of one of those scenarios where you go to the start with this really high expectation,

1410
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:11,960
but then it's easy to have that like shattered, you know? And so things just weren't clicking in

1411
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:17,800
the race, created negative mindset, negative snowball excitement gone. And then you're just

1412
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,360
trying to get to the finish line, you know? So not a good run at all. Super been out of shape

1413
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:27,000
afterwards because I didn't know why. How long was that before the Boston marathon?

1414
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,800
A month, a month out. Yeah. And so, you know, that's one that you want to go well to create

1415
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:37,480
confidence, right? And, and again, I had no reason to describe, I didn't know why it went so bad.

1416
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:41,560
Nothing I could put my finger on. So those are the hardest ones to manage mentally, right?

1417
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:45,800
So, uh, but, you know, I got back up and just started training again. And

1418
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:50,600
I found this over and over again, not just with myself, but with athletes like coach,

1419
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:54,840
oftentimes like these races when you're in heavy marathon training won't go well,

1420
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:58,840
but then they'll turn something on inside of you. It's like neurologically, all of a sudden you're

1421
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:04,920
like firing. And so I came out of that race and just started feeling phenomenal, like, like similar

1422
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:10,040
to how I felt before Houston. And it was a very like quick change. It was like the next week, all

1423
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:14,200
of a sudden I was like, like I said, training had been going well before, but it got taken even to

1424
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:18,440
the next level. And there's all these different factors going into why that might have been. I

1425
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:23,160
think the race helped. Also we headed back to Stanford to train at sea level. And so that,

1426
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:28,920
it was very much how we'd utilize altitude pre-kids. We have kids now, so we can't do this, but we had

1427
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,960
been like two months up at altitude, dropped down to sea level for a month, go back up, drop back

1428
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:39,000
down. And that was taken from Jack Daniels, who's done a ton, a ton of research in the running space.

1429
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,320
I think probably one of the most brilliant minds in running, in my opinion, especially from a

1430
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:48,280
scientific perspective. And I was asking him, corresponding to him and like, Hey, what's the

1431
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:52,040
best way to utilize altitude? And that's what he recommended. It's like go up to altitude,

1432
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:56,360
shoot back down. Because what you see is you see a big dramatic increase in your hermatic rate

1433
02:06:56,360 --> 02:07:00,840
hemoglobin early on in those first three weeks, and then it just starts to taper off. Right?

1434
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:05,240
And so then you, then you head back down to sea level and it's going to go back down. But then you

1435
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:10,440
see when you come back up to altitude, again, another big dramatic shift. So you just always

1436
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:15,480
want that shifting up. Right? So that's what we're doing. We headed back down to sea level.

1437
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:20,200
And again, there's positives to training at sea level. Like I'm sleeping way better when I'm at

1438
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:27,400
sea level, I'm running faster, able to do workouts I can't do at altitude. And so things just started

1439
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:34,040
clicking like crazy. I was doing, again, I also started having caffeine every single day. And that

1440
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:39,400
was the first time my career I started doing this. And and so I started running my easy runs a lot

1441
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:44,360
quicker. And I have no idea if this like was something that was obviously it worked, but I

1442
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:50,200
don't know if it was be in despite of this or because of this, you know? But I was running a

1443
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:56,360
lot of my easy runs at like 530, 520 pace and just like floating through it, just feeling even like

1444
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:01,240
the day before the race, do an easy 30 minute run plus like six by a hundred meter strides. That's

1445
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:06,280
kind of a custom run for us before the marathon. Like I'm so glad Sarah wasn't there. My wife,

1446
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:09,960
cause she would have killed me for running as fast as I did. I was by myself and I was just

1447
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:14,280
hammering. I was around like 530 pace, but it was just easy. I was just floating. Wasn't even

1448
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:17,400
breathing. What was it? What would be the difference in your hematocrit? How much would

1449
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:22,360
your hematocrit vary between sea level and elevation? That's a good question. You know,

1450
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:27,640
I don't remember off the top of my head. We weren't super great about doing bloodwork. I wish we'd

1451
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:32,120
done more of that. Like we would do it just kind of like, it seemed like random times, you know,

1452
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:37,160
we'd pop down the Olympic training center, get some blood work done and see where it was at. But

1453
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:43,560
to be honest, I can't remember the differences, but it would, it would come up pretty significantly

1454
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:49,000
in those first three weeks for sure. So yeah, just feeling like a million bucks heading into

1455
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,000
that race. But I did have this like kind of thing hovering over me of like, you just tanked a half

1456
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:59,720
marathon kind of thing. But then the day before the race, I remember talking to the race, one of

1457
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:03,080
the race organizers, and she's telling me like, you know, like we're supposed to get a really good

1458
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:08,600
tailwind tomorrow, right? And I was just, when I heard that, I just lit up inside because I get

1459
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:13,320
excited about running fast. Like I'd rather break a world record than win a gold medal. Like that's

1460
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:19,880
just how I am, you know? And I remember talking to Bill Rogers, who won the Boston Marathon four

1461
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:23,480
times, won New York four times. And he was telling me, he's like, he's like, you know, about once

1462
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:28,280
every 10 years, you get a wicked tailwind in Boston and then you can really roll. So he had a

1463
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:33,080
year when he got a tailwind, he stopped four times in the race to like tie his shoe to walk,

1464
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:41,320
to get water. And he still ran 209. And so his words like were in my head and standing on the

1465
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:47,000
starting line in Hopkinton that morning, and I'm looking at the flag and it's just going the exact

1466
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,560
direction we're going to run. I was like, I'm never, never going to get a day like this again,

1467
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:55,000
like I'm going to make the most of it. And I always like to go to the front and lead, like that was

1468
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,120
kind of my signature, but I didn't, I didn't let one moment go by in that race where I wasn't

1469
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:04,600
pressing. I was like, I'm going to get everything I can out of every single mile. And so we were

1470
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:09,480
rolling. We were like a lot of our miles in the four thirties during that race. We came through

1471
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:17,320
the half in 6152, I believe was our split. And the race, the race organizer was on a motorcycle in

1472
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:21,960
front of us and he saw our split at halfway saw the clock and he's like, he radioed his clock guys.

1473
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:26,440
Like, Hey, you guys messed up the clocks. It says 61 50. And they're like, yeah, that's right.

1474
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:32,280
And so we were, I mean, at the time the world record, I believe was like low two Oh four.

1475
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:36,760
And so we're under world record pace. And again, like the first half of the Boston marathon is

1476
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:42,120
slightly down. So, and we had the wind at the very end as well. Yeah. You have heartbreak

1477
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:47,720
Hill like all through 17 and a half miles till 20 it's like up and down Hills. So it's, it's

1478
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:52,440
typically known as a challenging slow course. But again, if you get the right wind and you make

1479
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:56,920
the most of it, cause these aren't pace races either. Like most fast races, you have pacemakers

1480
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:02,360
in there and they're in charge of pace. Guys are just tucked in for most first 20 miles at least.

1481
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:06,280
And then they're off and running the last 10 K. Well, in this race, it was just me at the front,

1482
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:11,800
just hammering and all of Africa sitting on my back behind me enjoying the ride. But I didn't

1483
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:16,760
care. I was like, I'm gonna make the most of today. I remember one, one memory from that race was one

1484
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:20,520
of the guys on the side of the road. Like some of the spots, like especially early on in Hopkins

1485
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:23,560
and you're just going through neighborhoods and stuff, people out in their lawn chairs.

1486
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:27,320
And one of the guys yelled at me and he's like, Hey, Ryan, don't let them steal your tailwind.

1487
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,960
And I was thinking about that for a while. I was like, is that possible? Like, I don't think so,

1488
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:37,880
but, uh, lots of kind of funny, funny memories from that. And, uh, it was just cool to like be with

1489
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:43,640
those guys, be in the lead group and, and also to get to push them along to something that would

1490
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:49,480
have, it was a super historic day, you know, like the top two guys went on to run two Oh three low,

1491
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:54,920
like two Oh three Oh four or something like that, which was well, like almost a minute under the

1492
02:11:54,920 --> 02:12:00,760
world record at the time. And, uh, you know, I finished fourth and ran two Oh four 58, but I'll

1493
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:05,560
never forget, uh, another memorable part of the race was coming through with a mile to go and, uh,

1494
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:11,000
seeing they have a clock at a mile to go and it was right at two hours. Right. But I'm in the like

1495
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:16,360
serious pain cave, right? It went out super fast, super late in the race. No one's around me. And

1496
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:22,600
I'm just like holding on for dear life. And I was like, I saw two hours flat. I was like, okay,

1497
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:27,720
like if I break five minutes for this last mile, like I'm gonna be under two Oh five. My PR at the

1498
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:32,600
time was two Oh six 17. So I was already, again, I was gonna run a big PR no matter what I was like

1499
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:37,080
two Oh five. That's insane. That sounds pretty good. You know, there's a part of me that is like,

1500
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:43,080
just enjoy this last mile run like five 30. Just soak it all in and just enjoy it. But then there

1501
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:46,680
is a part of me is like, you know what, you might never be here again. Like why don't you just put

1502
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:51,720
your head down, grit your teeth and bear it, try to break five and get under two Oh five. And so

1503
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:57,080
that's what I did. And it was a world of pain. That last mile is a blur. Um, the crowds in Boston

1504
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:01,320
are just insane though. Like I'll never forget running down Boylston street and just the crowd's

1505
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:06,200
just going crazy. And you know, I was in fourth place, but I didn't even care because like to me,

1506
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:12,600
performance shifted away from like beating other people to me maximizing my own potential. And

1507
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:16,600
that's what I get most excited about. And it's like that with my lifting too. It's like, there's

1508
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:21,800
guys deadlifting well over half a double what I'm able to do. Right. But to me, like that's not

1509
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:27,720
important. It's about like me optimizing what I've been given my gift and also just seeing the,

1510
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:32,040
the fun part of the scene, the growth and the improvement. Right. So coming across the finish

1511
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,840
line, I just like put my hands out and just soaked it all in, yelled super loud. My wife

1512
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:42,120
was there at the finish to give me a big hug. And, uh, it was super special. I felt like I'd won

1513
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:46,600
the race, even though I hadn't. Um, but one of those, those moments where it's like, this is

1514
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:51,480
again, like Houston, like one of those magical days that, you know, you may never get again.

1515
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:57,480
So just soak it all in and enjoy it. But yeah, special day. So, I mean, to me, the most amazing

1516
02:13:57,560 --> 02:14:03,320
part of your journey is not the successes. It's the, it's, it's the way in which you've been able

1517
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:08,440
to kind of carry yourself through the failures. Right. And I think, you know, you got this

1518
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:15,480
parallel between 07 and 08, right? Where, and then we see it again now here in 11 and 12. So

1519
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:21,320
how are you feeling going into London? Again, I think the expectations early in that season are

1520
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:26,440
very high, right? When out of a two Oh four, I was, you know, I was like, I'm going to take a

1521
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:29,880
shot at winning this race, even though, you know, I'd just been beaten by a minute by those guys.

1522
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:35,960
So I knew, I knew it wasn't, you know, like I was expected to necessarily win, but I knew I had a

1523
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:40,360
shot. Like, you know, if you run two Oh four for the marathon in those days, like you have a chance

1524
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:46,840
to win a gold medal. So, um, yeah. Uh, and again, I, this was a theme going back to Beijing talking

1525
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:52,280
about not putting on the weight after I ran London leading up to the buildup for Beijing and how that

1526
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:57,640
made my training flat. I did the same thing. Um, and this is one of those things where it's like,

1527
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:02,600
okay, like having a coach is a helpful thing. Cause if a coach, if I would have told a coach

1528
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:06,040
what I was going to do, he'd have been like, that's a really bad idea. Let's just stick with

1529
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:10,600
what we know works for you in this situation. And that's putting on 10 pounds. But instead of doing

1530
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:14,760
that, again, my heart was good. My intentions were good. I was like, okay, like, again, like faith's

1531
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:20,200
a big part of who I am. I really want to hear God in a way that people use across all traditions

1532
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:26,200
to do this is through fasting. Right. So I, instead of putting on 10 pounds, I did a one week

1533
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:33,480
fast where all do close to the Olympics. So let's see, Boston was April 15th and the Olympics were

1534
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:38,680
August. So, you know, it was enough time till we're asking to get a full buildup for the,

1535
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:42,840
for the game. So I had plenty of time to like put on weight and do my usual thing.

1536
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:48,200
But again, I just wanted, I wanted clarity on how to train for this thing. And so instead of my

1537
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:57,480
weight going from 137 to 150 during that two week period, it went from 137 to like 130 flat. And

1538
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:03,080
that was just, I started the training in a really depleted state. My body wasn't in a good state. I

1539
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:08,280
was mentally and spiritually, I was in the best spot I'd ever been, but my body wasn't ready to

1540
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:14,280
go at all. It was, it was needing a break after that, you know, but I began my training and came

1541
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:19,000
back and I was running pretty well initially. And then it just kind of went downhill from there. And

1542
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:24,040
it actually kind of became a miracle that I even made it to the starting line, considering how

1543
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:29,320
poorly my training was going, just nothing was working. And this is what I tell myself in the

1544
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:36,120
weight room now all the time, wherein I'm getting stale and training and not seeing growth. If I'm

1545
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:40,120
not eating enough food, if I'm not taking enough calories, it doesn't matter how I'm training,

1546
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:44,280
it's not going to work. And that's, that's how it was for me in that buildup is like my body is

1547
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:48,040
depleted. I didn't have enough calories on board. So it didn't matter how I train, it wasn't going

1548
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:53,400
to work. So just a frustrating period of training leading up to that actually had to take my watch

1549
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:58,520
off for all my workouts, because it was so discouraging to see what my workouts were and

1550
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:03,240
see how slow I was running them compared to what I was accustomed to. So that was good for my mental

1551
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:07,640
health. And I think there is a point that can be helpful for people out there sometimes just get

1552
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:12,680
away from the data, take all that stuff off and just go off feel. And that was helpful, but it

1553
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:18,360
wasn't enough to get my body back into the state it needed to be in. So, so what did you feel at the

1554
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:26,120
start line in London? Did you feel like, was there any hope in you at that point? Or were you like,

1555
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:30,520
look, I'm here at this point out of an obligation to my country, I'm representing my country,

1556
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:36,120
I'm wearing the flag of my country, but this is going to be the most difficult two hours of my

1557
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:43,720
life. Yeah, you know, there's, I'm very optimistic, optimistic person. So I'm pretty good at generating

1558
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:48,680
hope. So, and it did help not timing my workouts. So there was a little bit of mystery of thinking,

1559
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:53,720
oh, maybe I'm actually in a lot better shape than I think and feel here, you know? So there was some

1560
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:59,480
genuine hope on the starting line that, Hey, and that's the thing with running that I've experienced,

1561
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:04,040
sometimes like training can go really bad and you can just pop on, have a big day. So there's always

1562
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:09,560
that kind of thought in my head of like this, you know, like let's not think that something special

1563
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:14,280
couldn't happen today because it could, but it became obvious like really early on in the race.

1564
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:20,440
The pace felt super hard, super fast. And then as is the case oftentimes when I get too lean and too

1565
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:25,880
light, I have all these injury issues, right? So like I had all this hip stuff going on before the

1566
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:31,560
race. Luckily, like my Cairo guy, John Ball is amazing, had me in one piece on the starting line,

1567
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:36,280
but then very early on in the race, it was like, then my right hamstring started hurting. And

1568
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:40,600
that's ultimately what led me to drop out as I was in the middle of that race. I was already

1569
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:44,680
starting to limp a little bit. It wasn't even the middle. It was early on. It was like seven miles

1570
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:49,800
into the race and I was limping. I was like, all right, like what do I do here? What's the right

1571
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:53,320
call? You're trying to kind of coach yourself through it, not give up hope, but then at the

1572
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:57,160
same time, you want to be smart. This is my livelihood, you know? And I'm looking out for

1573
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:04,360
the long term. And I was like, I'm willing to be that guy who comes limping in like seven hours

1574
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:10,840
after everyone gets the cheers and inspires people for just hanging in there. But at the same time,

1575
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:17,640
I also want to be good to my body. And I've been not good to my body a lot. And that was just kind

1576
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:23,480
of like a moment where I had a sense of clarity that I needed to be good to myself and call it

1577
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:28,600
a day. So that was actually the first race I ever dropped out of in my life was the London marathon.

1578
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:33,320
And it felt so surreal. I remember stepping off the, cause it's a loop course, you know,

1579
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:38,440
as you're going past the finish and the start a number of times. And I think it was the second

1580
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:42,920
loop. I could be wrong on that, but I think it was the second loop when I dropped out and I remember

1581
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:48,440
stepping off and I almost started running again cause it just felt so wrong. It felt so weird. It

1582
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:54,680
felt like I was in someone else's movie or something. And, but then ultimately I just

1583
02:19:54,680 --> 02:20:00,760
walked off the course and then began the long process of working through that mentally and

1584
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:06,680
emotionally, you know, what was that like? Well, it started with Cinnabon.

1585
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:14,200
Funny, funny thing. So the next day I'm like touring around with my family in London. And

1586
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:18,680
Sarah knows like how I tend to go to food when I get emotionally low, you know,

1587
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:26,040
and yeah. So we pop out of the subway onto the streets and it's like, it's like Cinnabon is

1588
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:32,040
like heaven. It's like right. My eyesight is just like, ha Cinnabon. And she sees me, look at it.

1589
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:37,160
She looks at me and she knows exactly where I'm going. You know, she's like, don't do it. Don't

1590
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:41,880
do it. But of course I went to Cinnabon and got a big old cinnamon roll. Now I'm sitting out on the

1591
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:46,360
curb just eating it. And I look up and like someone's like taking a picture of me in my

1592
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:51,240
Cinnabon and I was like, I felt like I was going to be on like Esquire magazine or something.

1593
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:59,320
But no, actually I've learned to pick myself up so many times I've gotten a lot better at it.

1594
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:06,040
And for me, it's kind of like I need this period of just being sad and just let myself be sad for

1595
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,720
however long that takes. The period of kind of like mourning the loss, you know, because this

1596
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:16,440
was a big goal for me. And then for me, the next step then is like, okay, restore hope. So what is

1597
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:22,120
the next thing I'm going after? Find that target, put it on the calendar that begins to restore my

1598
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:26,840
hope. And then like, I have a little meeting with myself of things I'm going to tweak different, do

1599
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:31,880
differently, do better. So that also gives me just way more hope that I'm not just going to repeat the

1600
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:37,000
same experiment I just did. Right. So like I'm doing this right now with myself. I'm going back

1601
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:41,400
after this sub five minute mile and sub five deadlift. I'm like, I'm going to tweak this, this,

1602
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:45,800
and this. And like, I really believe it's going to work this time. Right. And so you've got to,

1603
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:49,800
you've got to, that's the starting ground. You have to believe that your training is going to work.

1604
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:52,920
That's why it's so important for athletes to believe in their coach. Like if you don't think

1605
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:56,280
it's going to work, it doesn't matter what it's going to prescribe. It's probably not going to

1606
02:21:56,280 --> 02:22:01,560
work. Right. So that, that belief is so, so important. So, you know, I picked myself up and

1607
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:06,840
got going again, but then the problem was, and is common in the case with runners is then you have

1608
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:12,360
all these compensation issues. Right. So I had that issue in my upper high hamstring where

1609
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:17,320
attaches there, and then just ran through that. And that started by the way, because I had

1610
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:22,840
plantar fasciitis training for the 2012 Olympic trials. I got that right before the trials,

1611
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:27,400
had no choice, had to run through it. And then that persisted for like eight months. And so

1612
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:31,400
low compensation, get an injury on the other side and upper hamstring in the games.

1613
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:36,680
Then I tore my left quad building up for New York. I tore my right quad building up for

1614
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:42,520
Boston. Then I got a sacral stress fracture on my left side after that training for my next

1615
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:47,640
marathon. And it was literally marathon after marathon. I'd sign up for it, get the deal all

1616
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:52,600
worked out, not be able to do it. Cause I'd get some huge injury that would put me out for a long

1617
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:56,520
time. And I didn't have a lot of injuries leading up to that. I always considered myself to be super

1618
02:22:56,520 --> 02:23:03,000
durable. And yeah, so it was just injury after injury. And that's kind of that four year wild

1619
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,520
ride of trying everything I could think to try. And ultimately nothing was working. But you know,

1620
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:13,960
as I look back at it now, I really think a big piece of it was the nutrition piece. And I started

1621
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:20,200
to be in a better mental health point to where like I didn't have to use food as like a binging

1622
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:25,960
mechanism for after these bad races. But that actually, I still needed to put on the weight

1623
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:30,440
though, right? I still needed to get my body in a good spot. And I wasn't doing that because I

1624
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:35,240
didn't need to do it from an emotional mental standpoint, but then that was also killing me

1625
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:41,960
at the same time, physically speaking, right? So if I, you know, looking back at it, I would say

1626
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:47,240
that was a big, big part of why I had so many struggles from 2012 up until my retirement in

1627
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:52,440
2016. And if I could go back and do it differently, I'd actually do something like my mom always

1628
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:56,840
wanted me to do. And I never wanted to. And that is to, she's like, you should just take like three

1629
02:23:56,840 --> 02:24:01,720
months completely off and like not run at all. And I was like, you crazy? Like I'm never going to

1630
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:06,360
do that, you know? But that actually would have been super helpful. Just get away from it, get my

1631
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:13,880
body back in a completely good spot. And now, you know, like I feel so much better in my current

1632
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:19,240
lifestyle, folks on the lifting, doing very minimal on the endurance and, and even like my testosterone,

1633
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:25,400
like I just got a testosterone blood test result recently and it came back at a thousand. And like,

1634
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:30,440
I didn't think that was possible for me, but again, the lifestyle shift, lifting heavy,

1635
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:36,760
eating more calories, just having my body in a better state, sleeping a ton is just allowed me

1636
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:40,600
to kind of like restore myself. And that was exactly what my body was telling me. It was like,

1637
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:45,640
I've, I felt like my body was saying to me, I've given so much to you over the last 20 years,

1638
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:49,880
like you've pounded me into the ground with a hundred mile weeks after a hundred mile weeks.

1639
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:54,440
Now it's time to get back to me. And so that's ultimately like why I got into the lifting. I was

1640
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:59,000
like, I want to get back to my body. I want to build it back up. I want to make it strong. And

1641
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:03,640
there's this thing of like, okay, like I did something I was genetically gifted at. Now let

1642
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:08,680
me see what I can take something where I'm not genetically gifted at all. The opposite of that.

1643
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:13,880
And again, I just love like the challenge. I love lifting hard. So every single day I'm in the weight

1644
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:17,480
room, I go to failure and I know that's not recommended, but that's just who I am. That's

1645
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:23,240
what I love to do. So that's, that's what I do, you know? So I feel like in a really good spot now,

1646
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,840
but I'm curious, like if I would have allowed myself to get into a similar state as I'm now

1647
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:34,280
and then went back to the running, how that could have went. But the ship has definitely sailed on

1648
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:40,360
that. And you know, walking around it, 185 pounds now, or even like I'll go for runs. And it feels

1649
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:45,560
like a completely different sport at this body weight compared to, you know, 137 pounds.

1650
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:50,280
Yeah. And it's even different from cycling. I mean, both sports punish you for the weight,

1651
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:54,360
but one of them you feel it much more than the other. I mean, in running, it changes your

1652
02:25:54,360 --> 02:26:00,760
gait. I mean, my wife, even though she weighs exactly what she weighed before having kids,

1653
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,680
she's tried to explain to me that the shape of her pelvis has changed since having three kids.

1654
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:13,480
And she said she has ever since having, especially the boys, because they were so big,

1655
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:17,560
she's like, I've never felt the same running again. She's still, you know,

1656
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:22,520
weighed thin, 110 pounds. To me, looks like she has a nice stride, but she's like,

1657
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:29,640
it doesn't feel the same. I don't float anymore. Like literally her pelvis is just in a different

1658
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:34,520
shape now. So, you know, that's an example of something that I think women can experience.

1659
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:41,480
And then of course, just the change in weight. Yeah, it's huge. It's huge.

1660
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:48,440
So what would you say to someone who says, you know, I love exercise, but cardio is the only

1661
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:54,200
thing that matters. And they're not doing a hundred mile weeks, but they're doing something

1662
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:59,480
cardio every day, but they're sort of averse to strength training. Given that you've experienced

1663
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:06,120
both ends of this spectrum and at very extreme levels, how do you think about this in terms of

1664
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:11,880
overall health beyond performance? Yeah, I mean, I think when you think of health, you have to

1665
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:17,160
think about all these different levels of health, right? So like, what is your hormonal health like?

1666
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:21,400
Because that's going to really affect like your mental health, like how motivated you are,

1667
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:29,000
like your energy levels, all that stuff, right? So I just know from myself, my own experience,

1668
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,680
like number one, like you can run every single day and be healthy, right? But you do need something

1669
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:42,440
especially as you're getting older to offset how depleting of the body that can be, right? And that's

1670
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:46,760
where heavy lifting comes in. And I think I just say the word heavy and I can feel like all the

1671
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:51,560
runners being like, oh, I don't want to do that. And I was the same way. I hated lifting heavy,

1672
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:56,680
but I think there are there's ways around that, you know? And like we mentioned BFR a little bit,

1673
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:01,400
like I love BFR for runners. Because like, if you're not, here's the thing with lifting,

1674
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:05,960
like I've been lifting super heavy for six years and I've never gotten hurt lifting,

1675
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:11,160
but that's just because I'm in, I have crap form when it comes to a lot of things too. So it's not

1676
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:16,360
because my form is good, but I am intuitive in there, right? Like if something's not feeling right,

1677
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:21,160
like I don't put on the weight, I don't go down. Like I'm very cautious in the weight room, right?

1678
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:26,760
So there are ways to like lift heavy and healthy. So like for runners, for example,

1679
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:32,600
the stuff that I love to prescribe to our runners are hex bar deadlift with the handles up.

1680
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:36,200
So you're not going down as low, you're not loading up the lower back as much.

1681
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:42,440
That's much more running specific strength that is going to be great for your power development.

1682
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:47,240
I also love half squats, you know, for the same reason, like a lot of running is just hip extension,

1683
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:52,040
right? It's like every time your foot contacts the ground, your hips have to extend to get out

1684
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:56,360
of that position. So we need to do things that really focus on that. So half squats, great for

1685
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:03,160
your liability of getting hurt. Half squatting is way less than butt to the ground. So you can load

1686
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:08,120
up the bar super heavy with the half squat, get all the hormonal benefits of lifting heavy,

1687
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:13,320
get the bone benefits of loading up a bar and having it on your back and avoid things like stress

1688
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:18,760
reactions, your bone density up that way. And just feel really good coming out. There's just

1689
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:23,960
no other feeling than like lift, having a bunch of weight on your back and setting it down. You just

1690
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:28,600
get this like huge rush of like, I don't know what is endorphins energy, but I always just feel

1691
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:33,480
amazing coming out of the weight room energy wise, you know? So there are ways to lift heavy in a

1692
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:38,200
healthy way. And then again, like if you don't even have access to heavy weights, you can do things

1693
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:44,120
like BFR. And I've been playing a lot with BFR and I really like the feel of that as well. And

1694
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:48,680
I think it's a way for runners who are maybe skinny, more concerned about getting hurt to get

1695
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:53,160
the same benefits of lifting heavy without having to put a bunch of weight on the bar.

1696
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:59,160
Do you ever have runners run in blood flow restriction? I for the first time really,

1697
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:06,200
like a couple of weeks ago, did some sets on the air bike. So like, you know, those air dying bikes,

1698
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:12,120
I did like two minute sets with heavy BFR on my upper thighs. And I remember thinking,

1699
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:16,440
well, I remember not knowing what to expect, right? I remember thinking, okay, for two minutes,

1700
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:23,400
I should be able to hold 300 Watts or whatever. And it's like no freaking way. Like I was

1701
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:30,440
struggling to hold 200 Watts for two minutes. And it wasn't that my heart and lungs were blowing up.

1702
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:35,960
It was like just the absolute pain in my legs. So I thought that was kind of interesting. And I was

1703
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:40,200
like, huh, I wonder if, you know, I was still cycling. Like if this would be an interesting

1704
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:45,320
form of cross training. I don't know if it would translate to running because I can't really walk

1705
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:50,840
when I'm in the full BFR. So maybe it just wouldn't work and maybe it's only amenable to

1706
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:56,920
being on a bike. And I also think there's certain exercises like I once stupidly tried to deadlift

1707
02:30:56,920 --> 02:31:02,840
with BFR. It was very lightweight, but I also thought it was altering my form a little bit.

1708
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:09,240
And I didn't think that would be beneficial. But I love it. I do BFR every day that I lift. I do at

1709
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:14,200
least one to two sets. That's interesting. I'm definitely going to try the BFR on a run next

1710
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:18,360
time I go for run. I'll be curious to try that. Yeah. You won't be able to go as heavy as you do

1711
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:24,120
for list. Like at least on my device, it allows me to select like low, medium, or high intensity.

1712
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:29,240
So maybe if you set it on a lower intensity, but if anyone's going to experiment with it, it's you.

1713
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:32,120
So I'm curious to hear what you think. Yeah, I'll try that.

1714
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:36,840
Something else I wanted to ask you about, which is, you know, we talk about sports like cycling,

1715
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:42,040
where drug use is just the norm. There's never really been a clean era of cycling.

1716
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:49,160
We're probably in the cleanest era now for the last 10 years. But there was just no way you were

1717
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:53,400
going to be able to compete and be one of the 10 best cyclists in the world if you weren't using

1718
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:57,960
a performance enhancing drug, non-negotiable. So if you didn't want to use those things, you

1719
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:01,480
were free not to, but you were not going to be in the top 100 or whatever.

1720
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:08,680
How much? Well, I guess it doesn't seem to me that distance running has suffered the same thing,

1721
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:14,360
right? We see it in track and field all the time. How much buzz has there been about performance

1722
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:19,320
enhancing drugs at the marathon level, at the world class marathon level? I just, I haven't

1723
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:22,760
been paying attention to it, but I really don't remember hearing much about it. And I'm curious

1724
02:32:22,760 --> 02:32:26,360
as to whether or not that's been your experience. And if so, why, why do you think that marathon

1725
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:31,400
runners, which would certainly benefit from tons of PEDs, haven't traditionally used them?

1726
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:40,120
Yeah, I think the thing that is the culture, right? So like for me, I knew guys who 100% weren't on

1727
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:44,440
it and were winning races, Meb, for example, he's, he's winning Boston, he's winning New York,

1728
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:49,560
he's winning medals, Dina's winning a medal at the Olympics and 100%, no, they're not on it,

1729
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:54,600
right? So I think that's huge, right? If you can think of one person who's doing what you want to

1730
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:59,480
do and they're not on it, you're like, then I can too. You know, and you look at like Lance and the

1731
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:04,760
cycling culture and it's like, if that's not the case, then it becomes very difficult, like to me,

1732
02:33:04,760 --> 02:33:10,040
to be optimistic on the starting line, right? So like I always chose to believe everyone was

1733
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:15,960
innocent, even if I heard rumblings, just because like I didn't want to be at a mental disadvantage.

1734
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:20,200
Like if I believe this person next to me is on something, then they already got one on me

1735
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:25,720
because I think they're just gonna be superhuman because they're on a PED, you know? So I always

1736
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:30,280
just believed everyone was innocent. I never like concerned myself with too much about it. And also

1737
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:34,920
like, honestly, I've been around a lot of training groups in the US, a lot of different athletes.

1738
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:40,520
I've never heard of anyone talking about taking it, about having access to it. Like I wouldn't even

1739
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:47,080
know the first step to even like, how do you even find this stuff, you know? Whereas there, it's not

1740
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:51,560
like that everywhere though, you know? Like I've been in Kenya and they talk about it a lot over

1741
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:56,600
there. And I'm not saying like Kenyans are dirty or anything like that, but the culture there is one

1742
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:03,400
where it's talked about more there. And I think that alone makes you think more athletes are on it.

1743
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:08,120
And there have been like guys getting busted, not just from Kenya, but from all over the world,

1744
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:13,720
you know? So it does happen. What are the drugs of choice? Is it EPO? Is it testosterone? EPO,

1745
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:18,760
yeah. And then there's, you know, lots of like kind of gray line stuff too, where people are just,

1746
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:23,240
you know, looking for every advantage they can get and maybe crossing some of those lines and,

1747
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:28,280
you know, with Alberto and all that like stuff. So it's, but again, like,

1748
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:32,360
That's right. I forgot about that. What was the controversy around Alberto Salazar?

1749
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:41,000
So yeah, I wouldn't even be able to like, it was a large document of case thing of all the stuff

1750
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,720
that was supposedly going down. Honestly, like I kind of stayed out of all that and didn't even

1751
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:52,120
fall out closely. I wouldn't even be able to do it. But you're right. I guess there has been some

1752
02:34:52,120 --> 02:34:58,360
rumbling about it. You obviously spent a lot of time in Africa. I know you've adopted four

1753
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:03,720
girls from Ethiopia, which probably speaks not just to your, you know, sort of love of children,

1754
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:11,560
but also like how much you've embraced that sort of East African culture. Having spent as much time

1755
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:19,480
there as you have, do you have a sense of what makes them great? How much of it is their genetics?

1756
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:24,520
How much of it is the environment in which they're raised? How much of it is the training, the mindset?

1757
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:33,960
Again, I would imagine if you're born poor in Ethiopia or Kenya, running as a way out would be

1758
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:40,360
viewed as, you know, playing in the NFL here or playing in the NBA or the major leagues. Like it's

1759
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:47,160
it is their sport. So when you think about all of these different factors, what explains

1760
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:53,160
the absolute greatness of this population in this really relatively small part of the world?

1761
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:58,200
Yeah, I mean, it's the perfect storm of kind of everything you mentioned, right? It's like

1762
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:03,880
highly motivated individuals who are highly genetically gifted. Like you were talking about

1763
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:08,440
your wife's pelvis and it widening, like there's like, I think some theories about their pelvis

1764
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:12,520
being really small and not being helpful for distance running. But I mean, like I just,

1765
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:17,880
I walk behind my kids on hikes sometimes and just look at how narrow their shoulders are and how

1766
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:23,720
small their bone structure is, right? And I'm just like, this is crazy. Like they're just so

1767
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:27,800
small. And like, I'd be running next to highly giver slosie, one of the greatest distance

1768
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:31,640
runners of all time. And I remember the first time I ran with him at the London marathon,

1769
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:35,800
I caught up to his group and I was like, I'm running next to highly like this is insane.

1770
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:40,120
And I just could not get over how small he was. I was just staring at his back. I was like,

1771
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:46,200
this guy is tiny. So I mean, there's like this whole huge, like their, their makeup, their body.

1772
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:51,640
And to be honest with you, I think there's a lot more there actually. I think they can run a lot

1773
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:58,520
faster than they're even running. Like as we, I'm curious, like, like their approach to train versus

1774
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:03,000
our approach to training, like who's doing it right? Not that it's one or the other, you know,

1775
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,720
it's probably like a blend of the two, but you're thinking if they adopted some of what you've

1776
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:13,240
talked about and what others have talked about as far as more strength training, more gap between

1777
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:19,880
intensities, they might even be able to, to be better. Yeah. Cooling down, you know, things like

1778
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:25,320
that. What makes Kip Choggy so great in your mind. And I think he really is the greatest marathon

1779
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:31,320
runner today. And I don't think that's just on the basis of doing this incredible, you know,

1780
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:36,600
feat of breaking two hours in a, in a very controlled unofficial way, but, but also just

1781
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:41,720
his overall marathon performance on the racetrack. What is it about Kip Choggy? Have you, I don't

1782
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:49,240
suppose you ever ran with him, right? Was he, was he there in 16? No, I don't think we ever,

1783
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:54,360
we were, we were coming up at the same time. Like we're very similar in age. I don't know

1784
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:58,680
his exact age or if he even knows his exact age, but we're right around the same. So we crossed

1785
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:02,120
paths a lot. Like I saw him at the London marathon a couple of years ago when I was there.

1786
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:08,920
But I think, you know, obviously like genetically gifted, but also his like humbleness. I think

1787
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:13,720
that's a huge thing. It's like when you start to think you're great and that you've done all this

1788
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:18,520
great stuff, it almost makes it harder to get back there, right? Or to exceed it. It's like when you

1789
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:23,560
buy into how great you are, that I feel like it kind of sets the limit on you. It's like, that's

1790
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:30,680
your cap, right? And he is so, like I've never seen anyone as successful as he is. I mean, he's

1791
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:36,040
got to be getting huge paydays to do these marathons, right? And yet living in super simple

1792
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:42,440
place with sharing a room with training partners. Like, come on, like how many like multi,

1793
02:38:42,440 --> 02:38:47,560
multi-millionaires do you know that like do that, right? So like, I think there's something about

1794
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:53,320
like his mentality and humbleness. And that's really what I've always found most inspiring

1795
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:58,760
about African runners, whether it's from Kenya or Ethiopia, and why I enjoy being over there so much

1796
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:04,920
and have fallen in love with their culture. It's just this like carefree, fearless mentality of

1797
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:10,520
just like, I'm just going to put myself in it and go for it. But Kipchoge also balances that with

1798
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:17,720
like being very controlled. It's like he controls his strengths so, so well. And I think that kind

1799
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:22,360
of sets him apart. Like when you read about his training, he's always talking about running like

1800
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:28,600
80% max and everything being super controlled. And I don't know, like I have personally have not

1801
02:39:28,600 --> 02:39:33,160
gotten results through that type of training, but it's without a doubt it's working for him. I mean,

1802
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:38,440
he's by far and away the greatest marathoner to ever walk the planet, right? So whatever he's

1803
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:44,040
doing is working. But I honestly, I feel like a big thing is just his mentality, like his,

1804
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:50,600
his mental approach to training and racing is the most composed I've ever seen in an athlete.

1805
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:55,880
So I think that's a huge part of it. Do you think we will see a sub two hour marathon as

1806
02:39:55,880 --> 02:40:00,600
an official marathon in our lifetime? I think we will without a doubt. I mean,

1807
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:08,360
so a woman just ran 62 minutes, 62 50 or something for a half marathon, which is absolutely insane.

1808
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:14,760
So that predicts, that predicts 210 as a full. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, she could potentially run,

1809
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:20,440
be the first woman to break 210 for the marathon. And we're just seeing huge performances like this.

1810
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:23,560
And I think, you know, how much of it is the shoe? Yeah. I was just going to say,

1811
02:40:23,560 --> 02:40:28,120
how much of it is the shoes? Yeah. The shoe thing is really interesting. Because I don't think it's

1812
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:33,080
just the technology, like the technology without a doubt, like people are running two minutes faster

1813
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:38,040
over the marathon with these shoes on. But I think it's affected the psyche a ton. I think

1814
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:43,960
what people think is possible now has just been blown up, right? And so now like we're just getting

1815
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:49,320
people trying to do insane stuff. I mean, like a sub two hour marathon, like that would have never

1816
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:54,040
happened if we didn't have these shoes. Like I'm sure even Kipchoge wouldn't have even tried,

1817
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:57,880
right? But now it's kind of opening the doors of like what's possible here. And then you see a

1818
02:40:57,880 --> 02:41:03,560
woman around 62 minutes for a half. And you're like, if she can run 62 minutes for a half, like

1819
02:41:03,560 --> 02:41:09,160
in an actual race, that wasn't even a set up Kipchoge type situation. That was the actual race,

1820
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:14,600
like people can do it in the marathon. So I'm certain we will see it. And who knows too,

1821
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:19,640
like what other kind of technological advances will happen in the coming years. But, you know,

1822
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:24,440
the shoe thing is, has been profound from technology standpoint, but also from a mental

1823
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:30,200
standpoint for athletes. Speaking of a mental standpoint, of all of the stunts you've done,

1824
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:37,160
and I've followed many of them, the seven marathons in seven days, i.e. seven consecutive marathons

1825
02:41:37,160 --> 02:41:44,520
in seven days on seven continents is in and of itself ridiculous, but it's made only more

1826
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:51,400
ridiculous by the fact that you didn't train for it. So tell people a little bit about this

1827
02:41:52,120 --> 02:42:00,840
thing and the extent to which you both got better during it and then kind of crashed at the end and

1828
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:07,560
how painful that last one was. Yeah. So I was retired from pro running and one of my pastor

1829
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:11,640
friends from LA, Matthew Barnett texted me. He's like, Hey, I'm doing this crazy challenge. Seven

1830
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:15,720
marathon, seven days, seven continents. And there's something just captured me about it.

1831
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:20,520
Similar actually to when I was 13 and went on that first round around Big Bear Lake. It's like

1832
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:24,120
a similar kind of feeling where it's just like, there's just something about this that like,

1833
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:27,720
I just got to do it. So I texted him back. I was like, let me know if you want me to join you,

1834
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:32,360
man. I'd love to go. And again, running zero at this point, just in the weight room, just

1835
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:38,120
focus on strength training. And so, you know, he's like, okay, let's go. It's on whatever.

1836
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:43,160
So we ended up doing it and I was, I started training for it. So I was like, okay, like if

1837
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:47,640
I'm gonna do this, like I want to enjoy it. But then I was hating the training for it. It wasn't

1838
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:51,480
enjoying it. And I was starting to get a lot of those same fatigue issues that came when I was

1839
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:56,040
running professionally. So I was like, you know what? Either I can enjoy my life for like the nine

1840
02:42:56,040 --> 02:43:03,080
months leading up to this thing and not run hardly at all or, and have a really bad week or I can

1841
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:07,400
like train for it, not really enjoy my life for nine months and then have a good week. I was like,

1842
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:13,480
I'll take the nine months of good living. So I decided not to train for it. I mean, I did do,

1843
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:18,600
I was running like three days a week, like between five and eight miles. Eight miles was my long run

1844
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:24,600
leading up to that. And so I was taking on this challenge where we're going to have to run 183

1845
02:43:24,600 --> 02:43:29,320
miles, I think it is in a week, which is by far the most I'd ever done. I think the most I'd ever

1846
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:34,840
done was 140 miles and you're hopping on airplanes. Like you run, you get on the airplane, you run,

1847
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:40,520
you get on the airplane, right? So yeah, it was quite the experience. Definitely like trip of a

1848
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:45,960
lifetime. It was like a group of people. So there's like 30 of us, Richard Donovan puts it on,

1849
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:50,280
it's called the World Marathon Challenge. And he just, the guy who puts it on Richard is such an

1850
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:54,680
amazing dude. This guy's taken 30 people around the world running marathons every day. I never

1851
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:59,400
saw him stressed once. I never even saw him close to stressed. How much does one pay for the privilege

1852
02:43:59,400 --> 02:44:05,560
of doing this? I believe it's like 40 grand. So it's a bit of a trip. But you're also...

1853
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:08,520
Yeah, because they're flying you privately, obviously you're chartering a flight.

1854
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:08,520


1855
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:13,800
Feels the only way you could make this work. So the first one, I think if I recall was South Africa?

1856
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:15,720
Antarctica.

1857
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:17,560
Antarctica. Oh my God.

1858
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:17,880
Yeah.

1859
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,280
Okay.

1860
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:22,600
Yeah. That was the coolest marathon. You're running on snow. It's like a seven mile loop course.

1861
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:26,760
And I thought Antarctica is just going to be like flat, just white, you know? But there's all these

1862
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:30,280
mountains. We're on a glacier. There's all these mountains going. We had to take like a

1863
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:35,000
Russian airplane to like get down to there. It looked like something out of a movie. It was

1864
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:38,040
super cool. So yeah, we did that one, hop on an airplane.

1865
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:39,000
And how did that one feel?

1866
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:49,080
It felt pretty good actually. Funny though, I was super into lifting, right? So my great idea was to

1867
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:54,040
take in 50 grams of protein like every seven miles or something. So I was like,

1868
02:44:54,040 --> 02:45:00,280
I don't want to lose my gains. So which is like the opposite of what I usually do, right? Usually

1869
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:07,080
it's like simple sugar. So I'm doing this and I get to like mile 23 of this race and I am so out

1870
02:45:07,080 --> 02:45:11,560
of it. Like I'm like, I need sugar like stat, like right now. Cause my protein bars, like hardly

1871
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:17,480
any carbs in it. So they have this little tent that's set up and they, they put all these like

1872
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:22,840
dried fruit and candy and stuff in there and it's an unmanned tent. So I crawl in there and I just

1873
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:31,880
grab like as much candy as I can. And I started feeling better immediately. So like right after

1874
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:35,640
that, I kind of learned my lesson. I think I ran like three 30 something on that one.

1875
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:40,200
Which is kind of amazing. Like three 30 is still a fast marathon for a

1876
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:44,280
okay. So then where do you guys go from the Antarctica? Where's the next one?

1877
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:49,080
So then we went to Chile and we got to sleep in a hotel room that night. So that was nice.

1878
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:52,600
So there was only two nights during the week where we got to sleep in a hotel room. And

1879
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:56,520
that was one of them. So ran the next marathon and actually felt pretty good. You know,

1880
02:45:56,520 --> 02:46:00,120
we're on concrete, not snow. So it felt a little bit better. It was warm.

1881
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:02,920
What was the temperature in Antarctica when you ran that?

1882
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:08,280
So it was supposedly really cold, but it must be like a dry cold cause it didn't feel that bad to

1883
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:13,080
me all. Like I was in my regular run stuff that I would do if I'm doing a run here and flagstaff

1884
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:18,440
in the wintertime. Like I had full tights at a long sleeve and I had like a, like a shell jacket

1885
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:22,680
and gloves, like mittens and a beanie. And I was totally good. I wasn't sweating at all.

1886
02:46:22,680 --> 02:46:27,080
Cause they say like, you don't want to sweat and it freezes on you and get hypothermia, you know,

1887
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:33,880
but I was, I was totally good. So yeah. So then, so then South, South America, you ran,

1888
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:39,560
how fast you run that one? I'm trying to remember what my time was. I think it was a little bit

1889
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:43,720
faster than the Antarctica, but not a lot, but I didn't, it was nice cause the Antarctica one

1890
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:48,200
doesn't beat up your legs cause you're on a snow. So it's a little bit softer. We always do all of

1891
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:52,840
our easy running on, on soft surfaces to keep from beating up your legs. And I was also in like the

1892
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:57,240
most cushy shoe I could find cause I was like, my legs are going to take a beating. So I think at

1893
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:03,800
that time I was like 170 pounds. So I was prepping myself for that a little bit. Then we flew to

1894
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:09,160
Miami and that was kind of fun. It was like a homecoming back to the States, you know, but also warm.

1895
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:14,200
And I had a little bit more trouble in that one. I think I was a little bit slower than I was

1896
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:21,000
in, in Chile, but not much. Like maybe I was like, again, like 330 or something like that.

1897
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:26,040
And then we flew over to Spain and I had the worst day ever in Spain. Luckily you're like one

1898
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:30,680
of my Dutch friends, Jop, Jop, he came over and he was with me on the bike the whole time. And I

1899
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:35,720
was just in the worst mood and having the worst day ever. I was like running is the worst thing on

1900
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:41,720
the planet, which I've said that many, many times. That's actually not a new thing for me to say,

1901
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:45,560
even when I was running professionally, running can be like your best friend and like your greatest

1902
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:49,880
enemy at all at the same time. All right. So that's Europe. So then which continent next? Asia,

1903
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:57,720
I'm guessing. So then we had to Morocco for Africa and we got a hotel room slept in that one. I was

1904
02:47:57,720 --> 02:48:02,680
like, all right, considering how bad I felt less than 24 hours ago, I'm going to start out just

1905
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:08,200
super chill and just like make it through this. Right. So I start that way. And then again, the

1906
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:13,320
mystery of running, why you'd all of a sudden feel so good. I have no idea, but I just started

1907
02:48:13,320 --> 02:48:17,560
feeling like a million bucks. Like I started charging. Like I felt like my old self, I was

1908
02:48:17,560 --> 02:48:23,800
like mentally super engaged and like just came home super quick. Like I went out really slow and

1909
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:29,720
then ended up running like three Oh four, which for me off like zero training was like really good,

1910
02:48:29,720 --> 02:48:34,200
you know? And so then I was like pumped. I was like, all right, now it's on. Like I'm going to

1911
02:48:34,200 --> 02:48:38,840
just get faster and faster every day from here. You know? So then is Dubai the next day?

1912
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:44,760
So then yeah, Dubai is the next day. And the problem was though, then after Morocco, I'm

1913
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:48,600
walking to get food with my buddy and I just develop a little bit of a limp and he's like,

1914
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:52,440
Hey, why are you limping? I was like, Oh, my hips kind of bother me a little bit, uh, whatever,

1915
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:57,000
you know, just shake it off like you usually do with most running things, you know? But then the

1916
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:01,480
next day in Dubai is like my hip was on fire. And I was like, this isn't good. Like something's

1917
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:05,880
really wrong here. So I ended up walking like the back half of that marathon, a lot of it.

1918
02:49:05,880 --> 02:49:09,720
So I don't know what my time was there, but it was probably up over four hours, you know?

1919
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:16,200
And then we head on the airplane to Sydney for the last marathon in Australia. And it was crazy

1920
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:20,600
this whole time. Yeah. We're on a private jet with like, you know, food and everything movies.

1921
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:25,720
I didn't watch one movie the entire week. Whenever I was on the airplane, I was asleep. I was so

1922
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:33,160
tired. Um, so we land in Sydney and I tried to stand up and I put weight on that leg where the

1923
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:37,880
hip was bothering me. And if that kind of like, take your breath away, wincing kind of pain that

1924
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:44,600
you get like super sharp. And I was like, Oh, I'm in trouble. This is not good at all. Like I had a

1925
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:51,320
hard time putting any weight on it at all. And also to like, I was so sick of all the little tiny

1926
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:56,280
things you do as a pro runner, like the mobility, the stretching, all that stuff that I wasn't doing

1927
02:49:56,280 --> 02:50:01,720
any of that anymore. So I didn't wear my compression socks the entire week. So I got to Sydney and my

1928
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:07,240
ankles look like elephant ankles. Like they're so swollen, but like to the point where it was painful,

1929
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:11,720
I was like, I didn't know you could actually get pain from this, but like I could like barely like

1930
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:18,200
bend my ankles. I was a mess. So I put on my same singlet that I wore my first marathon at the

1931
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:25,080
London marathon in 2006, 2007, the same single that I wore in that race. I put it on cause I was

1932
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:29,560
like, this is my last marathon. Like this is my goodbye tour here. You know, the same way I went

1933
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:34,120
in with a big long run, 15 mile run around big bear. I'm going out with a bang too, you know?

1934
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:38,040
And I never got to say goodbye to the sport. It's like, I just like kind of faded out and all of

1935
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:42,280
a sudden I was gone and my body wasn't able to run. I never got to say goodbye to the sport that I

1936
02:50:42,360 --> 02:50:49,320
loved. So this was my chance to say goodbye. And so this last marathon, Manly Beach, we did a mile

1937
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:56,840
out mile back for the whole marathon, but it was, it was sick though. Cause it was lit up by the moon,

1938
02:50:56,840 --> 02:51:01,720
the stars, all that stuff was just blazing. We're running for some reason. We started like 1 AM. I

1939
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:07,960
was like, why can't we get some more sleep? We're running 1 AM. And, uh, was that because it was, uh,

1940
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:12,520
too hot to run during the day? No, I think, I think Richard's thought process was just,

1941
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:17,880
you wanted to get people enough time to get it done. You know, it'd be like such a sucky thing

1942
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:22,680
to like not finish it within the seven week period because you had a really bad last day. So I think

1943
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:26,920
he was thinking like, yeah, yeah, yeah. The seven day period. So, so I think he's just trying to

1944
02:51:26,920 --> 02:51:31,400
give people as much time as possible. And so it could have been good. Like for me, like I kind

1945
02:51:31,400 --> 02:51:37,400
of needed it that day. I, I like got a massage in the middle of that, but I went on to find out when

1946
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:42,760
I went home, got MRI that a stress reaction in my hip. So massages aren't, aren't the best for

1947
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:47,000
stress reaction. It doesn't do a whole lot, but, uh, yeah, I'll never forget like coming across that

1948
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:52,360
finish line, the sun was up at that point. It took me five and a half hours. It was like the longest,

1949
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:57,320
slowest, most painful marathon. It's like every time I put my leg down on that concrete, it's just

1950
02:51:57,320 --> 02:52:02,200
like getting zinged with like that super sharp pain, you know? But I mean, after you've run six

1951
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:06,680
marathons in a row, you're like, I'm do whatever it takes to get through the seventh one. Like I'm

1952
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:11,960
not stopping now. And I'm never signing up for this trip again. So I got to get it done, you know?

1953
02:52:11,960 --> 02:52:15,720
So I came across the finish line and these are just like all like runs that are set up by

1954
02:52:15,720 --> 02:52:19,640
volunteers. So not like a ton of people. They're not like big productions, like major marathons,

1955
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:24,840
but still super cool. And I came across the finish line and I took off my shoes, left them on the

1956
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:29,880
finish line. And it's something I kind of stole from wrestlers, Olympic wrestlers after they,

1957
02:52:29,880 --> 02:52:33,640
they wrestled their last match, they leave their shoes on the mat. It's just kind of the symbolic

1958
02:52:33,640 --> 02:52:37,960
way of saying like, I've given everything I have to give. And now like the season's over, I'm

1959
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:42,840
walking away, leaving my shoes on the mat. So I did that. I walked away barefoot from the finish

1960
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:46,840
line. And it was actually, even though it was just kind of like me and a couple of people got

1961
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:51,960
super emotional at that time. I was like tearing up as I was walking back to the hotel, just because

1962
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:57,880
you know, running gave me so many gifts. It was so life altering for me. And the most beautiful

1963
02:52:57,880 --> 02:53:03,400
part of all of it was the people, you know, meeting my wife, my kids, all the people I

1964
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:07,240
crossed paths with continue. Like I wouldn't be chatting with you right now, Peter, if it wasn't

1965
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:13,000
for that, you know, like that, that is what I hold most dear from, from all of the experience, you

1966
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:17,160
know. And what's cool about that is like, it doesn't matter what level you run at. Like we all get to

1967
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:22,040
experience that, you know, you sign up for any race and you're out there with a 50,000 amazing

1968
02:53:22,040 --> 02:53:27,720
people that are on a journey with you and we get to do it together, you know. So that whole

1969
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:33,320
sentiment just like hit me super hard, just saying goodbye to the sport I love. But then, you know,

1970
02:53:33,320 --> 02:53:39,080
it's been such a beautiful transition though of like realizing that that whole season, it felt

1971
02:53:39,080 --> 02:53:43,800
like it was for me, you know, like it was my thing that I was going after seeing how good I can get.

1972
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:47,240
But I've since kind of realized like it wasn't just for me, like everything I learned in that

1973
02:53:47,240 --> 02:53:52,120
season was meant to be passed down and it was meant to be shared and meant to help other people.

1974
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:56,440
So it kind of launched me into the season of, you know, moving into the coaching space, coaching my

1975
02:53:56,440 --> 02:54:01,800
wife, coaching other athletes in person, starting run free training where we coach runners of every

1976
02:54:01,800 --> 02:54:08,280
single discipline, you know, every level, super slow people, middle school kids, like all the levels,

1977
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:12,200
because like just it doesn't matter where you're at, right? It's a mat. We just want to be on the

1978
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:16,920
journey with you and want to guide you well and help you on your journey. So it was really

1979
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:21,640
special to kind of like realize that even all the mistakes that I made, they weren't for not,

1980
02:54:21,640 --> 02:54:25,640
you know, I'm on this podcast, I'm able to share it with your listeners and hopefully they won't

1981
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:30,120
make the same mistakes and they'll be better off for it, you know? And that's really kind of like

1982
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:36,760
my goal now is like, how can I help people take this thing living to the next, not just running,

1983
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:41,720
but living, be happier people. Like I'm far more concerned with my athlete's happiness than I am

1984
02:54:41,720 --> 02:54:46,680
with how fast they are, right? Like I want them to enter into the good life and I think running is

1985
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:51,160
a way to do that. Lifting can be a way to do that. It adds to that, but more than anything,

1986
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:54,360
like I just want them to find, I want them to find joy, you know?

1987
02:54:55,800 --> 02:55:00,840
Well, Ryan, it's been a joy sitting here talking with you about this and I hope we get to meet in

1988
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:04,680
person one day because there's, I hope we get to work out in person one day, actually. That would

1989
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:10,600
be a ton of fun to lift together and I'd love to try some of these crazy things you're doing. Not

1990
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:16,920
all of them, but actually I'm really intrigued by the, I wouldn't be able to do it with a fraction

1991
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:22,360
of the weight you just described, but the farmers carries up the Grand Canyon. That's something that

1992
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:28,440
I could see wanting to do that one day. The Grand Canyon is such an amazing place to me. I've only

1993
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:33,400
been there once, but it's still probably one of the most significant things I've ever done.

1994
02:55:35,720 --> 02:55:39,880
Just the season of my life in which I got to do it, the manner and how we made it physical.

1995
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:46,440
I sort of made it a hiking swimming trip, so I swim in the Colorado River and then in each of

1996
02:55:46,440 --> 02:55:52,120
the waterfalls on the way up because you have these four huge waterfalls that get progressively

1997
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:57,240
smaller as you go up. I was actually just talking about it with one of my kids last

1998
02:55:57,240 --> 02:56:00,120
night when I was reading him a story and the Grand Canyon came up and he's like,

1999
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:07,480
is that a real place? I was like, yeah, this is real, man. When you guys get a little older,

2000
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:11,320
we're going to be going back there. Yeah, you need to bring the kids up,

2001
02:56:11,320 --> 02:56:17,320
start doing 20 minutes every other day. I'm sure you have 20 minutes and we'll go do it

2002
02:56:17,320 --> 02:56:22,680
together. That'd be so fun. Awesome, man. Well, I really appreciate this time, Ryan.

2003
02:56:23,320 --> 02:56:28,760
This was so much fun for me to just kind of be able to pick the brain of one of the world's

2004
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:34,920
greatest. I loved it, Peter. Awesome chatting with you, man. Thank you for listening to this

02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:54,760
of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally

2009
02:56:54,760 --> 02:57:00,040
kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we

2010
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:06,120
discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA

2011
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:11,400
episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private

2012
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:16,120
podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this.

2013
02:57:16,760 --> 02:57:21,640
The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday,

2014
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:26,280
highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive.

2015
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:31,000
This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily

2016
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:36,520
listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting

2017
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:41,320
paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time

2018
02:57:41,320 --> 02:57:45,160
goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits, you can head over
