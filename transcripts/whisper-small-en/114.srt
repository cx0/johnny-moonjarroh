00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,560
today's episode. I guess this week is Professor Eileen White. Eileen is the deputy director and

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,640
chief scientific officer along with the associate director for basic research and the co-leader of

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,400
the cancer metabolism and growth research program at Rutgers University Cancer Institute in New

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,040
Jersey. She received her bachelor's degree from RPI and her PhD from SUNY and Stony Brook and

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
did her postdoc with Bruce Stillman at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Eileen's early work

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,720
focused on apoptosis, but it was doing some of the work there that she stumbled upon autophagy.

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,840
That is the focus of our discussion today. Now, if you're even remotely familiar with this podcast,

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,720
you'll certainly know that the concept of autophagy has come up on so many previous episodes. It is a

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,000
fundamental pillar of health and maintenance of health. We talk a lot about it in the context of

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,880
fasting in particular. I have wanted to sit down with Eileen for a really long time, and I don't

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,680
think this conversation disappoints, although we certainly could have gone longer. In this discussion,

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,880
we talk about Eileen's career and how it morphed from studying apoptosis into autophagy. We go into

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,640
describing the regulation of autophagy, both metabolically and otherwise. Then we spend a

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,600
lot of time talking about the role autophagy plays in both the prevention of disease and also the

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,200
treatment of disease. I think this is where it gets really interesting, especially around cancer.

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,480
That's potentially one of the most confusing aspects of the entire discussion on autophagy.

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,880
That's actually one of the reasons I really wanted to talk to Eileen, was to better understand

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,880
something that at the surface seems confusing to me, which is that autophagy seems to very clearly

27
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,560
protect a person or an organism from getting cancer. Yet once someone has cancer, it appears

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
that autophagy may disproportionately benefit the cancer cell versus the non-cancer cell.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,920
We tease this idea apart along with talking about the amazing work that her lab has done to

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,640
demonstrate the importance of autophagy in preventing Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration,

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
along with the benefits of metabolic health. Of course, we do talk about the age-old question

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,840
that many of you have heard me go on and on about, which is, how do we delineate and understand the

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,280
dosing and frequency of fasting as a tool? In other words, when I talk about doing a fast of

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,320
three days every month versus seven days a quarter versus five days a quarter, how could we possibly

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,560
get a handle on what the ideal strategy is? We talk a lot about that as well. I'm actually quite

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,240
hopeful that from this discussion comes some research that can shed light on that. Without

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,120
further delay, I hope you enjoy my discussion on autophagy with Eileen White.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,640
Eileen, thank you so much for extending your trip in San Diego for a day to come and make time to

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,800
talk with me about this stuff today. Oh, it's my pleasure. I'm looking forward to it. I don't know

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,520
if you remember this, by the way, but David Sabatini introduced us a few years ago. Do you remember?

41
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,480
I still have my notes from that phone call five years ago. I took about 20, maybe not 20, that's

42
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,480
an exaggeration, maybe 10 pages of notes in my journal and probably have gone back to those

43
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,920
a dozen times in the last five or six years. I always appreciate it when people just pick up

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,840
the phone and talk to total strangers for no reason. That's greatly appreciated. Well, you

45
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,000
are excited about the science. Nerds like me like to talk about science.

46
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Let's actually start from there. Tell me where your interest in science came from.

47
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
Was it something that was always in you from a young age? Were you just naturally curious?

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,920
I've been asked that question many times before. I come from a family where there was an interest

49
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,040
in science. My mother was a elementary school teacher and my father was a lawyer, but he

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:58,400
always wanted to be in science. All of our discussions were related a lot to new scientific

51
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,920
discovery. From an early age, I was introduced to science, which was probably unusual.

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:14,480
I then went to college and majored in science and biology and continued from there. I decided when

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:22,880
I was an undergraduate, I wanted to get a PhD in biology. I was very fortunate to go into graduate

54
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:31,840
school in the department led by Dr. Arne Levine, who discovered P53. That was an inspirational

55
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,760
experience because he has got scientific insight. That's absolutely incredible. Then I went on to

56
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,400
Cold Spring Harbor Lab where I was a postdoc with Bruce Stillman and again, another incredible

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,480
scientist. It was an incredible scientific environment. There were a whole cadre of

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,360
investigators there that were making major contributions in the field of cancer at the time.

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,000
It was just a very thrilling experience to be in an environment where once a week there was some

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,840
fabulous discovery and everyone was excited about it. There were even, I think, two Nobel Prizes

61
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
awarded while I was there. I joined the faculty at Cold Spring Harbor after that and then I moved

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,840
on to Rutgers. I had the fortunate experience of building a cancer center. When I went to Rutgers

63
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,800
to be on the faculty, there was no cancer center, but shortly after I arrived, they hired a cancer

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:41,280
center director, Bill Haidt from Yale. I joined him to help build what's now the Rutgers Cancer

65
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,880
Center or the Rutgers Cancer Institute, which went from nothing to now there are multiple buildings.

66
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:58,480
There are 11 hospitals in our health system. We have 240 something members of the Rutgers Cancer

67
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,640
Institute and we have we're a consortium cancer center with Princeton University.

68
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,920
It was very thrilling for me to not only maintain my scientific interest by running a research lab,

69
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,680
but also help expand and grow something from nothing where now we're treating large numbers

70
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:28,080
of patients in standard of care in clinical trials and making large discoveries and moving

71
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,600
cancer treatment, advancing cancer treatment as fast as we can. How many years have you been at

72
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,400
Rutgers? I joined there in 1990. I've been there for a long time, but I moved about 12 years ago.

73
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,000
I moved from one research building to be physically in the cancer center where I could

74
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:57,040
be more directly helpful. Where in your journey did autophagy peak your curiosity? It was purely

75
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,600
serendipity. This goes back to when I was a postdoc with Bruce Stillman at Coldstream Harbor.

76
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,720
I was given an oncogene to study. That time they had just sequenced the adenovirus genome.

77
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:18,560
They knew what genes caused cancer in the virus. I was given one of those genes and said figure out

78
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,960
what it does and that was a dream project for a postdoc. What I found was that this gene was a

79
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:34,480
viral homologue of BCL2. BCL2 is a gene, it's a human oncogene, and it functions by blocking

80
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,760
apoptosis or programmed cell death. That was transformative to me and took other people a

81
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:50,640
while to realize the importance of that, that one novel function of cancer is to evade cell death.

82
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,520
That field grew. We and others contributed to cloning the other genes that regulated

83
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,120
apoptosis. We figured out how the mechanism by which it worked and the pharmaceutical industry

84
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,880
started developing inhibitors of BCL2 to promote apoptosis and cancer. That was the ultimate goal,

85
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,240
was to make tumor cells die and have a drug that will do that. Once that happened,

86
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,080
the field of apoptosis, I think, we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish. We understood

87
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,680
everything and that led to the development of the first of many drugs that were in clinical trials.

88
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,520
In fact, my lab is still involved with taking those drugs and putting them in patients and

89
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:50,240
optimizing their use in solid tumors. While the field of apoptosis matured to the point where

90
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:59,920
things were being translated, we made a serendipitous discovery. We had engineered tumor cells to

91
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,240
be unable to undergo apoptosis. They were refractory to being able to commit suicide.

92
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,200
Can we pause for a second there, Eileen, and just let's explain to folks exactly how apoptosis

93
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,840
works because shortly we're going to obviously contrast this with autophagy. They have common

94
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,240
threads, but they're different. Let's go down the path of what does it take to get a cell to undergo

95
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,440
programmed suicide? There's a family of proteins called the BCL2 family. They come in different

96
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,280
flavors. There are the BCL2-like proteins which inhibit apoptosis, so they keep tumor cells alive.

97
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:49,760
BCL2 is a prototypical member of that family and is upregulated and amplified and translocated in

98
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:59,920
many cancers to do exactly that. There are antagonizers of BCL2 and its related proteins.

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,440
These are called the BH3-only proteins. They are often activated to inhibit BCL2

100
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:17,200
to trigger apoptosis. Then there's the core apoptotic machinery that triggers apoptosis.

101
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,080
This is back-to-back. They reside in the mitochondrial membrane. When they're

102
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,720
triggered to undergo apoptosis, they oligomerize and poke holes in the mitochondrial outer membrane

103
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:40,160
that releases proteins that activate proteases to grade the cell. BCL2 and BCLXL, all the

104
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,800
anti-apoptotic proteins are involved in antagonizing this process. What are some of the things that

105
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,600
would have to be going wrong in a cell for it to go down that suicidal pathway? For example,

106
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,960
mitochondrial injury that is irreversible, genetic mutation that is unfixable. What are the sweet of

107
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,920
things that basically take a cell down the path of, I can't fix this and being around here and

108
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,600
replicating is going to be dangerous to the host. I got to take myself out of the game.

109
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,640
Mitochondrial damage can certainly trigger apoptosis. Probably the best way to explain it

110
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:28,160
is by using the example of P53. P53 is a tumor suppressor and a transcription factor.

111
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:37,280
Some of the transcriptional targets of P53 are proteins like Puma and Noxa, which are these

112
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,560
antagonizers of BCL2 and activators of back-to-back. P53 is a tumor suppressor.

113
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:53,600
One of the functions is to promote apoptosis to prevent an emerging cancer cell from progressing.

114
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:02,320
One mechanism by which P53 does that is by turning on the transcription of Puma and Noxa,

115
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,840
and then that will antagonize BCL2 and initiate apoptosis. Then the question becomes, what

116
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,320
activates P53 to do that? That could be a long list of things from DNA damage,

117
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,520
from oxidative stress, and so forth. You can think of something bad happens to an emerging cancer

118
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:32,320
cell and then P53 gets activated. One of the tumor suppression functions of P53 is to turn on

119
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,360
these promoters of apoptosis that antagonize BCL2.

120
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Now loss of function in P53 probably accounts for half of all cancers, correct?

121
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,360
Right.

122
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,880
And I assume that you have to lose both copies of it or is losing one copy sufficient?

123
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:57,200
Well, what happens in most of the time is not deletion of P53, but rather a point mutation.

124
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
That reduces function.

125
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,080
It's more of a dominant negative. In fact, there's even evidence that there's a gain of function.

126
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:14,480
There are hotspot mutations in P53 that are very common in cancer, and P53 functions as a heterodimer.

127
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,960
What these mutant P53s do is that they end up entering into a dimer with wild-type subunits,

128
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,760
and that interferes with the function of the complex.

129
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,000
So yes, in that respect, it can be a loss of function of the P53 heterodimer, but there's

130
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,640
evidence that it not only causes a loss of function, but it actually may do other things as well that

131
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,080
are cancer-promoting.

132
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,360
That's just a great example of the nuance of evolution, right? I mean, in med school,

133
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,960
the classic teaching, a hundred years ago for me, was P53 loss of function, oncogene,

134
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,320
gain of function, black and white. Of course, it's never black and white.

135
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,560
Right.

136
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:03,840
So what is the wreckage of apoptosis? So when a cell undergoes apoptosis, to everything outside

137
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,240
the cell, inclusive of the immune system, what becomes visible? In other words, does an apoptotic

138
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,880
cell, once it dies, elicit any immune response? Or does the process of apoptosis yield sort of an

139
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
inert body of cellular matter that just goes away?

140
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
I'm not so sure I'm the best person to answer that question.

141
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,960
I think the whole idea initially was during the process of apoptosis, you would get protein

142
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:38,400
degradation and packaging of pieces of the dead cells into these apoptotic bodies. And then that

143
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:45,040
would reduce inflammation. And then there's evidence that macrophages can then go and take up

144
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,720
these apoptotic bodies. And that may facilitate antigen presentation, and so forth.

145
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,880
So it's possible, for example, that if you have a cell that has become cancerous, either through

146
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,600
a gain of function, loss of function, but whatever, there's some mutation that now renders this cell

147
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,440
to go down a pathway of cancer. Fortunately, it undergoes the apoptotic transition,

148
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,480
the macrophages take it. Is it likely that you get an immune response to that that is protective

149
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,560
in the long run against similar mutations? Because, I mean, even though the macrophages

150
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,240
part of the innate immune system, does that ever translate to the adaptive immune system

151
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,080
such that you gain some long term immunity from that specific type of mutation?

152
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,840
Yes, I think something like that occurs. And I'm just thinking I'm the wrong person to answer that

153
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,800
question. I could give you the better names of people that can do a better job. But the,

154
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,760
I think the best way to compare it is to contrast it with necrotic cell death. So in apoptosis,

155
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:54,960
you have proteolytic degradation and of a cell and packaging it into these bodies. And you say,

156
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:01,520
well, does that limit inflammation? Well, the way to explain how it does is to compare it to a

157
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:09,440
different form of cell death like necrosis. So necrosis is cells lice and that is very

158
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,000
pro-inflammatory. You have nucleic acids released, you have essentially everything is released.

159
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,240
Including mitochondrial content, which is probably the most immunogenic given its bacterial

160
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,240
origin of the DNA. Absolutely. And so apoptosis, what I'm hearing you say is apoptosis is much

161
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,720
cleaner than necrosis. Absolutely. So now let's talk about autophagy. Let's contrast autophagy

162
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,520
with apoptosis. That's right. Well, before we get to that, I should go back to your original question

163
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,680
of like, how did we start working on autophagy? Then this sort of bridges us to what you just

164
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:51,200
mentioned. So when we disable apoptosis in a cancer cell, it can't commit suicide. And we're

165
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,480
doing that all the time. And we could show that then the tumor cells become more tumor-ogenic.

166
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,600
But what we didn't expect was the extraordinary propensity for survival.

167
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:13,440
We could leave the cells out and put them in buffer. They wouldn't die under extraordinary

168
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,320
circumstances that we couldn't explain. So why would a cell that just couldn't commit suicide

169
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,680
survive in buffer with no nutrients at all? And just for context, this is the mid-80s,

170
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,200
late 80s? This is the mid-80s. Okay. No, it's probably later than that. It was probably

171
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,520
early 1990s. And so it was a conundrum. I mean, just because a cell can't commit suicide doesn't

172
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,560
explain how it can be a cancer cell can just sit in buffer and be fine. And we puzzled over this,

173
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,800
like how can this be? And then we discovered that what these cells had done was turned on autophagy

174
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,280
and we're using that for survival. Before you go down that path, help me understand something.

175
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,000
What did you observe about those cells that were sitting there in the absence of nutrients surviving?

176
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,440
Did you notice any metabolic changes that were unusual? Like what was your

177
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,800
clue that they were able to usurp the environment they were in?

178
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,200
It was an act of desperation. We tried a bunch of things and nothing was informative. And then I

179
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
told the people in the lab, why don't we just look at these cancer cells onto the electron

180
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,800
microscope? And that way we can see everything because we couldn't understand how they could be

181
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,320
surviving a buffer. And when we got the electron micrographs back, we saw something we had never

182
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,840
seen before and all these double membrane vesicles all over the cell. And so that when we finally

183
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,760
fail, those are autophagosomes, which we had never ever seen. But wait, how did you, I mean,

184
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,360
first of all, this is just to me one of the beautiful moments in science that I think

185
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,160
it's so important for people who don't do science for a living to understand that while science is

186
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,400
99% failure, every once in a while you have a moment like that. A eureka moment. Yeah. It

187
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,720
probably makes up for 10 years of failure. Yes. When you realize in that moment you are seeing

188
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,880
something that has never been seen before and therefore this is the cusp of new knowledge.

189
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,320
That's right. That's happened to me a bunch of times in my career, which is fortunate. And this

190
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,200
was one of those moments. And then we started to read them all, what are these autophagosomes?

191
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,600
What do they do? And then when we realized from when we looked in the yeast literature,

192
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,600
they were meant to capture intracellular proteins and organelles and bring them to the

193
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,400
vacuole or the mammalian lysosome for degradation and recycling. And that this was a mechanism by

194
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,560
which yeast survived starvation. And what was the tumor line or what was the cell line you

195
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,720
were doing this in? At the time we were using kidney cancer cell lines. Mice are human.

196
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,520
These were mouse. But it was basically the first time this had been seen in mammalian cell line?

197
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,880
No, I think people had seen autophagosomes before. I mean, you've got to remember in the

198
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,680
olden days when electron microscopes were first available, that that's one of the things that

199
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,080
people did was describe all kinds of different processes. So autophagosomes were known to exist,

200
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,200
but there was very, very little information, almost no information on

201
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,120
autophagy and cancer at the time. So we went into this area where there was almost no information.

202
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,640
And so the first question we asked is, okay, well, the yeast data tells us that when you see

203
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:57,040
autophagosomes, that means cells are starved and they're recycling and they're using this to survive.

204
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,760
And we hypothesized that that's what was going on in these cancer cells.

205
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,680
And if that was the case, if autophagy was a survival pathway in cancer,

206
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,840
that was a game changer. We had to understand it. And we had to demonstrate that that's what was

207
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:26,240
actually happening. And then if that was the case, if cancer cells had usurped the autophagy pathway

208
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:34,240
for their survival, then we needed to inhibit autophagy for cancer therapy. The first thing

209
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:42,240
we did was we looked to see what would happen if we inhibited autophagy in these cancer cells.

210
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,440
And the answer was very simple. In many, many circumstances and many different cell lines that

211
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,040
we looked at, when you inhibited your autophagy, the survival of the cancer cells was reduced.

212
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,360
Let me interject for a second and ask a question. I don't know if you ever did this experiment,

213
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,040
but if you took the kidney line and the kidney cancer line, so basically the same histology

214
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,680
from the same tissue, from the same animal, but one has the oncogenic properties and one does not,

215
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:19,440
and you put them in the identical nutrient deprived stress, can you quantify the amount of

216
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,600
autophagy or the efficiency with which those two cells undergo autophagy? In other words,

217
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:31,840
is cancer simply preserving the autophagy capacity that it had as a non-cancer cell,

218
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,240
but not enhancing it or not having any attenuation of it? Is it simply just, hey,

219
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
this just happens to be something that gets preserved as you go from non-cancer to cancer?

220
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,400
Or is there some qualitative or quantitative change in the character of autophagy as a cell mutates?

221
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,240
That's interesting. So let me see if I can unpack that. So if you have the general observation

222
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,800
is that normal cells in the fed state don't have autophagy on it, functions at a very,

223
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:11,360
very low level. And if you starve cells or mammals for nutrients, then there's a massive

224
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,560
upregulation of autophagy. What was striking about the cancer setting was that even in the

225
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,600
fed state, autophagy was elevated. So there is a fundamental difference there.

226
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,320
Yes. And then if you stress them, it goes up even further. But the problem is, is that when it's

227
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:37,440
already high, how much higher can it go? And just to be clear, Eileen, this is in vitro. So you can't

228
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,920
even make, when you said that, the first thought that came to my mind was, well, maybe the reason

229
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,000
is they're undergoing a different stress, which is, for example, a vascular stress, a hypoxic stress,

230
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
because, you know, haven't got enough VEGF or they haven't created enough. In other words,

231
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,800
the apoptosis is going up despite being fed because there's something else that's impairing

232
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,560
them. But if what you just said is true in vitro, then that wouldn't explain that, would it? In other

233
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,800
words, if they're not limited for oxygen, if they're in a Petri dish and this is happening,

234
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,640
my hypothesis wouldn't make sense. That would only make sense if what you said was true in

235
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,080
vivo. Right. So in the fed state, the cancer cells already have elevated autophagic flux.

236
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,160
And when you fast them, it does go up, but it only so high it can go.

237
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,920
I see. So this probably, you know, it's really funny. I'm sure you're familiar with the paper

238
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,840
that Matt Van der Heiden and Luke Cantley and Craig Thompson wrote in Science in 2009,

239
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,400
which was at least to my knowledge, the first time that someone offered an alternative explanation

240
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,440
for the Warburg hypothesis, which is, hey, it might not be that the mitochondria of the cancer

241
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
cells are defective and can't undergo oxidative phosphorylation. It might be that they're

242
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,680
optimizing for growth as opposed to metabolism. They don't care as much about ATP as they care

243
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,680
about building blocks. And therefore they're deliberately taking an inefficient route of

244
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,360
glycolysis to lactate because they want the cellular building blocks. And that might be the

245
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,800
explanation here is that the tumor cell is undergoing more constant proliferation and therefore

246
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,320
they want more building block. Exactly right. And in fact, when we look at cancer cells and we study

247
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,720
their metabolism, what we've noticed, and this is something that we found and it's been a common

248
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:34,400
observation, is that nucleotides seem to be rate limiting. And so the metabolism of a cancer cell

249
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,880
is designed to facilitate de novo synthesis of nucleotides. So it's really interesting,

250
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
isn't it? When you really start thinking about it, like you think of all the things that could

251
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,720
potentially be rate limiting to a cell. Think of how many phospholipids, for example, they need to

252
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:57,680
build all of those cell membranes. And yet it's the nucleic acid to continue to propagate its DNA

253
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,760
that becomes rate limiting. That to me is very interesting. I wouldn't necessarily have ever

254
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,280
guessed that. We may learn more as going forward, but that is what seems to be a recurring theme.

255
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,400
But it's not just DNA, it's also RNA. And you have to remember that RNA and ribosomes make up a huge

256
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,840
amount. They're much greater demand. Exactly. And I think David Sabatini has mentioned this many

257
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,600
times that a large amount of the mass of a cell is ribosomal RNA. And he had a beautiful paper

258
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,280
where he was making the argument that ribophagy, the autophagy of ribosomes,

259
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:43,200
was an important metabolic survival mechanism. And you could think of ribosomes as being a depot,

260
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,520
a storage depot for not only nucleic acids, but also protein. And when a cell is stressed or

261
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,600
starved, it doesn't need to make protein. So it doesn't really need larger numbers of ribosomes.

262
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,000
And so the autophagy pathway can cannibalize those ribosomes because they're unnecessary.

263
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,880
And then recycle all that protein and nucleic acids to support survival.

264
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
Amunago, you mentioned, of course, that some of this had already been observed in yeast. And the

265
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
moment we start talking about things that are true in yeast and then true in animals, mammals,

266
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,120
for example, are higher animals, we're talking about a billion years of evolution here. So

267
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,840
this ranks as one of the few things that seems remarkably conserved over evolution. As a general

268
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,320
rule, that makes it very important. Do we have a sense of when this first showed up?

269
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,280
Again, I might be out of my league. I mean, I know it's certainly a big function in yeast.

270
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
Prior to yeast, I don't know.

271
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,240
Yeah, but it's amazing. I mean, it's sort of, it's in the category of mTOR.

272
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,960
Yes.

273
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,840
Something that is so important that it just doesn't really seem to change over about a

274
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,640
billion years. Rule of thumb, it matters.

275
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,960
That's right. And I think when you compare how yeast does autophagy and how mammals do autophagy

276
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,120
and what they're using it for, it just looks like mammalian version of autophagy is a little

277
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,240
bit more complicated. It's probably, they have probably more different circumstances where

278
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,040
autophagy might be necessary, but the basic process is surprisingly the same.

279
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,400
What are some of the other stresses that induce autophagy? And let's maybe just for the moment,

280
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,280
even start with just in a normal cell. So let me sort of re-synthesize what we've talked about.

281
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,320
Clearly, nutrient deprivation is one of the biggest triggers for autophagy. And I mean,

282
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,280
maybe just for the sake of time, I'll kind of throw this out there and you can correct me if I'm wrong.

283
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,760
But I've always sort of thought of this through three pathways at the sort of mechanistic level.

284
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,240
So you have sort of the mTOR pathway, which is mostly sensing amino acids. You have the

285
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,920
AMPK pathway, which is mostly sensing energy and ATP in general. And then you have sort of the

286
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,840
acetyl-CoA protein deacetylation pathway, which is also just basically sensing substrate of

287
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,760
fatty acid and glucose. Is that sort of a fair way to say that those are three ways that nutrient,

288
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,680
low nutrients can still trigger the same pathway? Yeah. And I think you could add on to that

289
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:26,560
stresses that result in organelle damage, such as depolarization of mitochondria or dysfunction

290
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:34,640
of mitochondria, activation of protein misfolding, and generation of protein aggregates. So I think

291
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,920
there's the things that are directly related to metabolic signaling that you've mentioned,

292
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,240
but then there are other stresses that also can tie into the autophagy pathway.

293
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,360
Are there other stresses like the nutrient that are stresses that come from outside the cell to

294
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,000
inside the cell? So the protein misfolding, the mitochondrial depolarization, those are things

295
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,160
that are occurring as damage within the cell that stress. Do we know anything, for example,

296
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,280
about temperature? Do heat shock proteins stimulate autophagy in extremes of temperature?

297
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,440
Does exercise, I mean, which obviously is in the short term quite stressful, how potent is that at

298
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,040
inducing autophagy in a normal cell? So temperature wise, I would fully expect that

299
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,440
temperature extremes would induce protein misfolding and induce autophagy as a remedy

300
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,840
for that. But I don't recall any studies on that. In terms of exercise, that's very well studied,

301
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,080
that exercise induces autophagy very potently. And you actually need autophagy too, because

302
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,920
exercise damages the muscle and autophagy is one of the processes that helps mitigate the damage

303
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:55,200
that occurs during exercise. What about hypoxia? Oh, potently. Hypoxia potently induces autophagy.

304
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,600
Wow. And in fact, one of the first things we did was when we looked at tumors, tumors are well known

305
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:11,280
to have hypoxia in the center, when we engineered tumor cells to be genetically deficient for

306
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:18,480
autophagy, and you look at them, they're completely hollow. Meaning they have no organelles, nothing?

307
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,240
Not the cells are hollow, the tumor is hollow. Oh, wow. The further the cells get from a blood

308
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,680
supply, meaning the more susceptible they are to hypoxia, they're dead. Right. So if you take a

309
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,560
tumor, the middle is hypoxic, that's where your autophagy is most active. And if you genetically

310
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,280
ablate autophagy in the tumor, you end up with a hollow tumor, because the tumor cells in the

311
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,920
middle don't survive. Yeah. So it does come back to this idea that we talked about earlier about

312
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,640
hypoxia being potentially one of the things that autophagy is protecting cancer from.

313
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,880
Absolutely. How easy is it to create an animal model that is unable to undergo autophagy? How

314
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,680
difficult is that from a knockout perspective? Well, it's been done and we've done it, and it

315
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:08,960
can be done different ways. So the original mouse strains that were made were deficient in either of

316
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,960
two of essential autophagy genes, one called HGG5 and another one called HGG7. And these mice were

317
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,560
developed in Japan, and these mice are born, but they fail to survive the neonatal starvation

318
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,680
period. So when mammals are born... Meaning once they are cut off from an umbilical nutrient source,

319
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,680
it's almost like they have a glycogen storage disease. You know, those conditions where you

320
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,560
can't produce any glycogen, but it's uniformly fatal if not treated the moment you're cut off

321
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,280
from an umbilical source of nutrient. Right. So that neonatal starvation period between

322
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:55,120
the cutoff of the placenta and suckling is a common feature in mammals. And there's potent

323
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,600
induction of autophagy during that period. I can't speak for humans, but certainly I would think so.

324
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:09,440
And in mice, that's exactly what happens. And so these autophagy deficient newborn mice don't survive.

325
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,600
Wow. That really, I mean, again, I think that simply underscores the evolutionary preservation

326
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,960
of something. If you knock it out, it is uniformly fatal. Do not pass go, do not collect $200,

327
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,000
you're gone. And then what we did was, he asked a different question. It was like,

328
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,080
what happens in an adult mouse? So in a newborn mouse, it's very different situation because

329
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:40,400
any newborn mammal, they don't have any fat, they have no reserves. And so when the Japanese group

330
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,240
did the extraordinary thing of trying to force feed these autophagy deficient newborn animals,

331
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,720
then they didn't extend their survival very much. Now, is this Yoshinori's group? This was the

332
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:00,560
Burum-Isushima and the Kumatsu group, I believe. I think it was coming from those two labs.

333
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,480
So what happened in that experiment?

334
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,120
They discovered that the mice died shortly after birth. And then they realized that,

335
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,720
well, they suspected they had a metabolic problem and they weren't suckling because they were

336
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,760
probably too ill to by the time they would have been able to. So they force fed them.

337
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,440
And that allowed them to live for 24 hours, but they still died anyway.

338
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,160
And then are you able to induce an autophagy knockout in an adult?

339
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,040
Yeah. So that's what we did because we realized that the newborn animal is-

340
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,160
It's just too fragile.

341
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,760
Too fragile. They have no nutrient reserves. And actually, in the setting of cancer,

342
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,320
we're thinking of, you want to treat an adult with a tumor. So what's happening in autophagy

343
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,880
in a newborn animal isn't even relevant. And so we engineered mice where we can take an adult mouse

344
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,480
and give the mice a chemical so that an essential autophagy gene will be deleted throughout the

345
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,640
entire animal. So one day they're an adult mouse with autophagy. And then a few days later,

346
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,120
there are an adult mouse with no autophagy. And these mice were very extraordinary. They

347
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,600
lived for two to three months and then they died predominantly of neurodegeneration. Autophagy is

348
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,960
very important in the brain over the long term. But if we fasted the mice, they were all dead

349
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,240
within 16 hours.

350
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,880
Let's unpack that again. That's pretty remarkable. So you take a normal mouse that's got through the

351
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,120
vulnerability period of infancy and you genetically knock out its capacity for autophagy.

352
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,960
The first thing you observe is if you fast it for 16 hours, which admittedly is a pretty long

353
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,400
fast for a mouse, that might be the equivalent of fasting a human for a week. But that degree of

354
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,560
nutrient deprivation is uniformly fatal. If you continue to feed them well, they only survive

355
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,600
another couple of months because they ultimately succumb to neurodegeneration, suggesting that the

356
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,280
role of autophagy in preventing neurodegeneration is essential. And it's really not surprising when

357
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,040
you think about the role, everything you talked about with protein misfolding. I mean, when you

358
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,560
start to think about the toxicity that are driving neurodegeneration using Alzheimer's

359
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,880
disease specifically as an example, there's a lot of crap that's basically getting accumulated in

360
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,720
neurons. This would be an elegant way to suggest that autophagy is keeping that at bay.

361
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:43,360
Exactly right. So one other way of looking at it is what tissues are more autophagy dependent than

362
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,920
others.

363
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,640
Exactly.

364
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,280
Brain would be really important. And there are a few others. And what we've noticed when we

365
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,640
looked at the mouse, the lack autophagy when we genetically deleted the autophagy gene in the

366
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,880
adult mouse, was that there were tissues like the brain that were very sensitive. And there were

367
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,440
other tissues like the lungs that didn't have any phenotype.

368
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,520
So wait, in other words, when those animals ultimately die of nerd generation, and you

369
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,560
undergo the pathology analysis, obviously the brain is where you see the cause of death.

370
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,520
You're saying in the lung, it looked completely normal.

371
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,040
Relatively normal.

372
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,160
What about liver?

373
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,840
Liver was very sensitive. So it doesn't lead to the death of the mouse. So if you did a liver

374
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:37,280
specific knockout of essential autophagy, those mice have theatosis and their liver gets huge and

375
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,520
whatever, but it doesn't kill them. I mean, they can live for quite a long time.

376
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
So you induce fatty liver disease.

377
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes.

378
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,080
So again, suggesting that autophagy probably plays a role in preventing fat accumulation in the liver.

379
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,600
Exactly right. And also protein aggregate formation. One of the other phenotypes of

380
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,920
steatosis is the accumulation of these malary bodies, which are large protein aggregates

381
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,600
composed of a protein called P62. When you lose autophagy in the liver, you're causing

382
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,360
accumulation of fat, accumulation of protein aggregates, but the liver manages to tolerate it.

383
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,160
The brain, however, is a different story. If you have post-mitotic neurons where

384
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,040
They don't have the capacity to divide.

385
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,080
They don't have the capacity to do that. I mean, when they

386
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,200
accumulate the crap, as you said, then it's game over.

387
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:36,320
Was there evidence that the brain in some last ditch effort to survive was undergoing more

388
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,160
apoptosis of neurons?

389
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Yes. That's the common feature of these animals is increased apoptosis in the brain.

390
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,120
But before that, you see all kinds of terrible things going wrong. This has been

391
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:58,480
part of a major effort to generate autophagy stimulators as a remedy or as a means to delay

392
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,160
neurodegenerative diseases.

393
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,600
I want to come back to this later on in the discussion, but I'll just plant the seed now.

394
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,760
Obviously fasting is one of the most potent stimulators of autophagy. I spend a lot of time

395
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:20,080
thinking about how does fasting fit into our toolkit of longevity, a big part of longevity.

396
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,320
In fact, probably the single most important piece of longevity when it comes to the lifespan

397
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,920
aspect of it. So, you know, you think of lifespan versus health span, how long you live versus how

398
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,680
well you live. On the how long you live front, I think it's very safe to say based on all of the

399
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,920
animal data and frankly, all of the centenarian data that the key to living longer is delaying

400
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,320
the onset of chronic disease. So even when you look at centenarians who are genetically gifted

401
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:54,240
with tools to live longer, if you unpack what the gift is, it's delaying the onset of the disease,

402
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,880
not living longer once you have the disease. So the centenarians, once they get cancer and once

403
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,200
they get heart disease, they die at about the same rate over the same duration as the rest of us

404
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,200
schmucks. The difference is they get those diseases 20 to 25 years later. And again, that

405
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,800
suggests to me that if you want to live longer, you have to delay the onset of these things,

406
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,280
not live longer once you have them. And so it's hard to think that fasting doesn't play an

407
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,440
essential role in that. When you realize the role that fasting plays in the mitigation of

408
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,200
Alzheimer's disease and metabolic disease. Of course, what we're going to come back to in a

409
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,360
second is cancer, which seems to be this conundrum. This is the needle we're going to want to thread

410
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,680
a little later down the line. I'll plant the seed now, but I do want to come back to the idea of

411
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,560
ways that we can also induce autophagy sort of pharmacologically or chemically. The first thing

412
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,240
that would jump to your mind is anything that mimics fasting. The first thing that comes to

413
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,440
mind would be metformin, rapamycin, things like that, that what we talked about earlier, just for

414
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,880
the listener to sort of tie this together, we talked about these huge pathways that tell the

415
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,840
body nutrients are scarce. So when mTOR activity is down, that's a sign that we're deficient in

416
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:15,440
amino acids, but we can also do that with rapamycin. When AMPK is up, that's the cell being told we're

417
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,240
deficient in ATP. Another way you can do that is to give metformin. We haven't talked about

418
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,760
sirtuins yet. Maybe I'll pause for a moment. Do we have any sense of what sirtuin activity does

419
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,800
in autophagy? I'm not familiar with that literature. Okay. I was going to say, because then you could

420
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,720
get into the whole NAD versus NADH ratios and how that might factor into it. So again, I'm really

421
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,920
curious about this through a clinical lens as well, which is what is the suite of products? But

422
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,960
almost just saying that out loud, so between the two of us, we remember to come back to this,

423
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,760
but I now kind of want to get back to your story, which is we've got these mice, you've got this

424
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,000
much more elegant experiment now, which is you're actually going after the phenotype of interest,

425
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,840
which is in an adult in which you inhibit autophagy. What was happening in that animal

426
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:05,120
if it had cancer? So did you ever do the experiment where you had an adult with cancer,

427
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,600
then you knock out autophagy? That's actually one of the reasons we made that mouse.

428
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,920
So we had two questions we wanted to answer. One was, if you inhibited autophagy in an adult mouse,

429
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,080
what would happen? Because if they died in an hour, then targeting autophagy for cancer

430
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,400
therapy would be pointless. Especially if you can't do it specifically. That's right.

431
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,040
So the answer was it didn't die in an hour. They died in two or three months, which was actually

432
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,920
good news because that meant that there was a potential window of opportunity for inhibiting

433
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,680
autophagy for cancer therapy. And I'm sorry, Eileen, when they died in two to three months,

434
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,280
was it still from the neurodegenerative disease? Yes. And did they still have cancer at the time

435
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,400
of death? We had to first make a mouse that lacked where we could switch off autophagy

436
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,720
and find out what happened to that mouse. Okay. So we did that and we saw that they died of

437
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,840
neurodegeneration in two or three months, which was good. If they died immediately, then we would

438
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,800
have stopped. There would be no point in trying to make cancer in that animal. But we did learn

439
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,280
that they were intolerant to fasting, which was perfectly consistent with everything we knew about

440
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,800
what autophagy functionally did. So then we moved to the second step was to do the experiment that

441
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:31,280
you just suggested to make cancer in that mouse. And then after the mouse had cancer to then shut

442
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,080
the autophagy pathway off. And then to ask the key question, which died first, the mouse of the tumor?

443
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,440
And the answer was the tumor died first. Wow. Okay. So then here's the gangster question.

444
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,000
Once the tumor died, could you reactivate autophagy to prevent the neurodegeneration,

445
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,880
or is it a one switch direction? That required a different type of mouse model. So what we were

446
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,320
doing was making a mouse with cancer. And then once the mouse had lung cancer, in this case,

447
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,680
we deleted an essential autophagy gene in the entire mouse tumor and all, but the gene was gone.

448
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:17,920
So it wasn't like we could turn autophagy back on in that model. But since then, one of my trainees

449
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,840
in collaboration with the lab in the UK, they have developed a model where they can toggle

450
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,640
autophagy off and then back on again. And what they've seen is a remarkable capacity of the

451
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:40,000
normal tissues to restore themselves. So the experiment would be to have a mouse to induce

452
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,000
an SHRNA to a specific autophagy gene to down regulate the expression and inhibit autophagy

453
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,800
that way. And then later on, take that SHRNA away or shut it off and restore normal autophagy

454
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:04,400
in the mouse. And you see a lot of capacity for the tissues to restore themselves back to normal.

455
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:14,240
So that experiment basically becomes the proof point that says targeting autophagy in cancer

456
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,560
makes sense. That's probably the most elegant description you could provide of that.

457
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:26,720
That's right. I think it would be better if we had specific targeted therapies against some of the

458
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:34,000
enzymes in the autophagy pathway, because these are all genetic experiments and it's not exactly

459
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,600
the same. Right. You might not get the complete penetration with a drug. Or inhibiting a protease

460
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,800
is not exactly the same as deleting the gene. But this is all what's called proof or principle

461
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,240
that the concept of inhibiting autophagy in cancer is valid.

462
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:00,640
So what do we know today about what you've just described as it pertains to two things? So I want

463
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:07,440
to slice the data across two variables. The first is tissue type or histology of cancer.

464
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,200
And the second is underlying genetic mutation. So I know that a lot of what you're describing

465
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:22,720
is clearly true in KRAS mutation. What about other drivers? We and a number of other cancer labs that

466
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,760
use genetically engineered mouse models for cancer have been banging away at that for a number of

467
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:36,800
years. And what we've learned is that KRAS driven lung cancer and pancreatic cancer are extraordinarily

468
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,560
autophagy dependent and you do it, you know, make the mouse models and the tumors are very

469
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,800
susceptible to the functional loss of autophagy. Can you briefly tell folks what a KRAS driven

470
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:55,440
cancer does? Like what is it about the mutation that drives the oncogenesis? So KRAS is a GTP

471
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:03,200
binding protein that is responsible for activating what's called the MAP kinase pathway. And this

472
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:12,720
pathway is very key in driving cell proliferation. And so cancers have a mutation in KRAS or mutations

473
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:21,760
in KRAS that leave it in the GTP bound or on state. So there's perpetual growth signaling through the

474
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,640
MAP kinase pathway. Which of course is the hallmark of cancer, which is it's unresponsive to cell

475
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,720
signaling. And when you are fixed in the on position, you can't turn off and basically that is cancer.

476
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,680
That's right. And what's particularly interesting about RAS driven cancers is that

477
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,480
we have been very unsuccessful in drugging RAS. And there's recent hope that the cysteine,

478
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,280
the particular subset of the mutations in RAS that involve cysteine residue,

479
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:58,160
that there are now drugs that target that. There's hope after decades of failure.

480
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,880
Is the primary issue in the failure to drug RAS that you can't do it without creating toxicity

481
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,040
for other cells that are non-cancer or that it has too many workarounds to whatever you put in place?

482
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,040
I think too many workarounds is a common problem. What they've done is that they said, okay, if

483
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,720
targeting RAS is difficult, then let's go downstream of RAS. And try MAP kinase. Right, right. So there

484
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:31,520
are inhibitors of RAF, MEC and ERK, which are downstream of RAS. And those are actively in use

485
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:39,440
in the clinic, but they seem to be not durably effective in RAS driven cancers because of the

486
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:47,840
workarounds. Yeah. So are there mutations or mutant drivers of cancer that we know are not

487
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,160
dependent on autophagy and unresponsive to the autophagy blockade? Yeah, it seems like there's

488
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:03,120
a spectrum. So RAS driven cancers are particularly sensitive. B-RAF driven cancers like B-RAP V600E

489
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:10,720
is a common B-RAF oncogenic mutation. And those cancers are particularly sensitive. And those,

490
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:18,320
the ones that were examined were lung cancers and melanoma. The B-RAP V600E mutation, melanoma

491
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:25,360
is very common. Homologous recombination deficient breast cancers. And those would be,

492
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,560
well, I mean, those would be models of hereditary breast cancer. Those are very sensitive to loss

493
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:40,880
of autophagy. APC deficient colon cancer is another example. What about non-APC driven colon

494
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,240
cancer, which of course is the majority of it? What do we know about that? I don't think I can

495
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:53,520
remember seeing a paper. I remember the APC deficient model. That's in fact the most commonly

496
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,520
used model. Anything we know about prostate cancer or other hormone sensitive breast cancers?

497
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,760
So prostate cancer is sensitive. We did that work. And hormone sensitive breast cancer,

498
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:13,200
I'm not recalling right now, but there are a long list of cancers that are sensitive. The sensitivity

499
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:20,240
is not all equal. For example, B-RAF driven cancers are very sensitive, more so than RAS

500
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:27,520
driven lung cancers. You just compare lung, B-RAF lung cancer to RAS lung cancer, the B-RAP mutant

501
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,440
lung cancer is more sensitive. The most sensitive cancer that we've encountered is in fact

502
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:40,960
RAS driven lung cancer with LKB mutations. And this makes a lot of sense too. So one of my trainees

503
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,200
who has her own research lab hypothesized that we sat down and we thought what cancer would be,

504
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:55,600
would you predict to be most autophagy dependent? And it should be a cancer with loss of LKB1.

505
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:04,320
LKB1 is a tumor suppressor gene that's involved in activating AMP kinase. And AMP kinase activates

506
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:11,280
autophagy as a survival mechanism to low energy. And so there were a whole class of lung cancers

507
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,840
that have lost LKB1. And as a result, they can't activate this protective mechanism.

508
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:26,320
This is Dr. Jessie Guo. She made this mouse model, RAS driven lung cancer without LKB1.

509
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:33,040
And lo and behold, when you delete an essential autophagy gene, you abrogate tumor genesis.

510
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:41,760
So it makes a huge amount of sense. LKB deficient RAS driven lung cancer is probably the number one

511
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:50,880
sensitive tumor. So how do we reconcile these two observations that almost seem to have a

512
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,720
difficulty coexisting? So the first is everything you've just stated, which is pretty clear and

513
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:05,680
unambiguously suggesting that autophagy is at least for a number of cancers, an important part

514
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,800
of their survival and proliferation. And we contrast that with an abundant body of literature

515
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:19,920
that suggests that when you combine fasting, which is a potent inducer of autophagy with

516
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,520
chemotherapy, for example, you enhance its efficacy. And we can speculate about why that might be the

517
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:33,120
case. These two things, although not directly comparable, seem a little bit at odds. How do you

518
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,320
think about those things? I would probably think about it in a slightly different way.

519
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:46,000
So if you want to get at the two different roles of autophagy, one is cancer cells usurping it and

520
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,240
turning it on for their own survival. Then the other side of it is when we know that autophagy

521
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,480
is protective. We know what happens if you have a mouse without autophagy. Many terrible things

522
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,520
happen. It takes a while, but the mice die of neurodegeneration. Can I interrupt for one second?

523
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,280
I'm sorry to do this, but I'll forget this question. I want to come right back to your thought.

524
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,680
In those animals that died of neurodegenerative disease after two to three months,

525
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:19,600
did they show an increase in tumor genesis in any other tissue? No, they don't. But if you make a

526
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:26,880
mouse where you bypass the neurodegeneration by knocking out an essential autophagy everywhere

527
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:34,400
but not the brain, then those mice will get benign hepatomas, so benign tumors of the liver.

528
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,040
But that makes sense too. Think about autophagy in normal tissues. We know it's important because

529
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:47,280
if you knock autophagy out on a mouse, there's tissue specific but gradual deterioration

530
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:54,400
ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and you end up with steatosis, fatty liver disease.

531
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,280
The brain phenotype can be explained, as we discussed before, neurons in the brain need this

532
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,080
protein and organelle quality control function. They're post-mitotic. They have to have a way of

533
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:11,760
getting rid of the garbage. In the liver, what happens when you damage the liver?

534
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,160
It regenerates. It's got infinite capacity.

535
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,960
That's right. But what happens when you...

536
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,960
Unless there's too much inflammation.

537
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,320
Exactly. So you end up with... When you inactivate autophagy in liver, you end up with these

538
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:31,600
chronic cycles of damage, repair, and chronic inflammation. And that is oncogenic. And that's

539
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,520
not... It's particularly obvious in the liver. The pancreas as well.

540
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,760
Exactly. Very sensitive to that inflammation.

541
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,200
So I think what this is telling us, this is something very important. It's telling us that

542
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:51,360
a main function of autophagy in tissue homeostasis is to preserve cellular function

543
00:55:52,160 --> 00:56:00,320
to be normal, to prevent chronic damage and inflammation. And tissues that are susceptible

544
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:07,360
to cancer as a result of chronic damage and inflammation, autophagy is highly protective.

545
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,080
Which again, think about how complicated this is. Now I'll bring us back to the question I

546
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:17,120
posed a moment ago, but using this example, why does an AfroD ultimately lead to cancer?

547
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,640
Because if you have enough accumulation of fat, you get enough inflammation, you're going to get

548
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,800
a peticellular carcinoma. Same with pancreatic cancer. This is why alcohol is such a horrible

549
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,960
molecule. It's so toxic to the pancreas, to the liver, and you sow those seeds of inflammation,

550
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,160
and lo and behold, you're increasing this risk of cancer. So on the one hand, we know that autophagy

551
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,760
helps ameliorate that. It cleans that up. It buffers that. At the same time, we just realized

552
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,440
a moment ago, oh boy, once you do get pancreatic cancer, it's a KRAS driven cancer. Autophagy is

553
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,880
helping it. That's right. So now let's come back to the question I posed a moment ago that I so

554
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,240
rudely interrupted you in answering, which was how do you reconcile these? I think it's a matter

555
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,680
of thinking of the role of autophagy in cancer as being context dependent. On the one hand,

556
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:12,160
functional autophagy can delay the onset of chronic damage and inflammation that are known

557
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,080
causes of cancer in particular tissues such as the pancreas and the liver, amongst a few others.

558
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:27,200
So I think that stimulating autophagy through fasting or through pharmacologic means at one

559
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,440
point can be thought of as preserving health. But once you have a cancer, I think it's a different

560
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:43,280
ballgame. And at that point, it's a completely different context. And in that setting, what we've

561
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:50,400
learned is inhibiting autophagy is preferentially damaging to the tumor compared to the normal

562
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,240
tissues. And then going back to the other literature, which looks at the efficacy of

563
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,920
fasting combined with chemotherapy, which is superior to just chemotherapy.

564
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:10,560
Do you think that the reason for that is that the chemotherapy itself, maybe once you you're

565
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,200
rendering the cells more sensitive to chemotherapy and also potentially generating a more durable

566
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,760
immune response? Because one interpretation of what you're saying is a person with cancer

567
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:26,720
should never be calorically restricted. I don't know that's going too far. I would say that I

568
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:34,240
don't know that you can equate caloric restriction with the loss of autophagy or regulation of

569
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,680
autophagy, because I think they're not equal things because I think that caloric restriction is

570
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:48,560
limiting tumor nutrients. And so I think what that's doing in the context of cancer therapy

571
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:55,200
needs to be better understood. I'm just not sure that we know what's happening there.

572
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,640
If I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying, look, it might be that we can't necessarily say that

573
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:07,280
fasting isn't helpful in cancer, because while it may be counterproductive from the standpoint of

574
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,440
autophagy, that may be offset by other things that are beneficial, such as the reduction of

575
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,880
overall nutrients and inflammation that accompany this. Exactly right.

576
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,120
Yeah, to me, of all of the areas of autophagy that have me scratching my head the most,

577
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:28,400
it is this question of given that fasting is one of our most potent ways to stimulate it. In fact,

578
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,960
I would argue it's more potent than metformin, which is an AMP-AK activator, more potent probably

579
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,200
than exercise. I mean, it might be the most potent thing we can do to turn this amazing tool on.

580
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,240
How do we think about using it in disease prevention and disease treatment? And they

581
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,760
aren't necessarily the same thing. I completely agree. And in fact, I would ask a question of you.

582
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:56,240
So there's multiple efforts in the biotech industry to identify pharmacologic agents that

583
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,880
are potent stimulators of autophagy. And I think their idea is, as a normal healthy people will

584
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,040
take a pill, autophagy will be turned on, and there'll be some fountain of youth type thing.

585
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,560
Spermidine is one of the things that people are talking a lot about, right?

586
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:18,800
So why not cultivate the use of fasting instead?

587
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,960
I will tell you exactly why, Eileen. And I love how you have fed into it. It's almost like you can

588
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,800
read my mind and know where I'm going to go with this discussion. I think a big part of it is we

589
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:37,520
don't have the tools to measure the signatures of autophagy. In other words, if a patient comes

590
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:44,480
to me and says, Peter, I want to do whatever I can to enhance autophagy because I have now bought

591
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:50,240
into the idea that it is going to basically protect me from every chronic disease, I would say, yeah,

592
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,400
I agree with you. And they say, great, fasting seems like a great way to do it. I'd say, you're

593
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,880
absolutely right. And they say, well, how long do I need to fast, Peter? Guess what I get to say?

594
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,720
I don't know. And I'll tell you in reality what I say. I say, well, look, I'm really sure that

595
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,320
after about seven days of nothing but water, autophagy is fully cranked. And I'm also really

596
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:16,560
sure that if you just go 12 hours without a meal, you probably haven't done anything. Where I

597
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:22,000
struggle is where between them. Now, I want to share with you some personal experience and I

598
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,440
want you to weigh in on it. And then I think maybe we can pivot off into actually kind of going back

599
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,840
to what you and I spoke about over the phone five or six years ago, which is what would a

600
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:38,000
molecular signature for autophagy look like? And again, I think this is, I put this in the top

601
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,280
three most important translational questions in my field. In other words, as I think about the

602
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:51,600
practice of medicine, as it pertains to longevity, it's our inability to understand how to quantify

603
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:57,040
the benefit of nutrient deprivation. In other words, our inability to dose it. That is our

604
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:04,800
greatest, certainly among our top three, detriments to using this incredibly potent tool. So I fast a

605
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:10,160
lot. I just finished a fast yesterday, actually. So I used to do a thing where I fasted seven days

606
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:16,400
every quarter. So four times a year, I would just do a water only fast. How hard is it to do that?

607
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,600
It is not that hard. I'm going to be completely honest with you. I wish I could sit here and say,

608
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,040
oh, I'm a real stud. Nobody can do it. No, no, no. Anybody can do it. I really think anybody can do

609
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,640
it. It's not to say that there aren't moments throughout those fasts where it's sort of

610
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,160
difficult, but you'd also be surprised at how resilient the body is. So yeah, not that hard.

611
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,480
You have to make some adjustments. Obviously you have to be very thoughtful about how much water

612
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,920
you're drinking and how many electrolytes you supplement. There are a lot of changes that are

613
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,400
happening in terms of electrolyte management and things like that. But again, we certainly have the

614
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,040
knowledge to know how to manage people through that. But I began to ask the question, right?

615
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:59,760
Which is, okay, is seven days a quarter the right dose? I'm convinced that it's a big bolus of

616
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:06,080
autophagy, but is it frequent enough? What about three days every month? That's about the same

617
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:11,680
number of total days fasted, but it's more frequent, but it's probably less potent. And the reason I

618
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:17,680
sort of decided to try three days a month was I noticed that a couple of things happened at the

619
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:22,480
end of my fasts. So I always check my blood before and after one of these seven day fasts,

620
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,880
and there's a very predictable set of changes that occurs. Some of them that are really obvious,

621
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:34,080
glucose plummets, insulin becomes unmeasurable. Uric acid goes through the roof along with beta

622
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:39,200
hydroxybutyrate, of course, two possible explanations for the uric acid going through the roof.

623
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,480
One is the breakdown of nucleic acid. And obviously when I talk go through, I mean,

624
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,400
doubling of uric acid. So much so that I started taking allopurinol during a fast to make sure I

625
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,920
didn't get gout. Of course, it could also be, and I've read something that says that uric acid and

626
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,160
BHB compete for the same transporter in the kidneys. So there might also be a bit of a

627
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,760
competitive blockade, but nevertheless, we have at least one possible explanation there.

628
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,160
Endocrine function changes dramatically. T3 goes down significantly and reverse T3 goes up

629
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:16,720
significantly such that the ratio of them changes by four to six fold, which means you basically

630
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:23,200
shut off metabolism. Not surprising. Explains why you become incredibly cold and tolerant during a

631
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:28,560
fast and also gonadotropins go down. So you have all these really predictable things. Well, what I

632
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,080
noticed was I see virtually all of them, though not quite to the same magnitude after three days,

633
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:40,800
but not after two days. So that just got me intuitively thinking in a hand waving way

634
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:48,080
that three days was sort of the minimum dose you needed to really move the needle on a bunch of

635
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,120
these other metabolic things, meaning the spike in uric acid, the bottoming out of glucose. So

636
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:58,000
there's another thing that sort of happens. It's as you turn more and more free fatty acid into

637
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,920
ketone and turn more glycerol into glucose, you reach an equilibrium where your glucose is

638
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,040
pretty much going to stay at about three to four millimolar and that takes about two to three days.

639
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,880
And again, when we think about it through the lens, we've already discussed.

640
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:20,880
AMPK must be up through the roof. MTOR must be through the floor and protein de-acids must be off.

641
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:27,920
I think my gestalt is that that takes about three days and obviously it gets greater and greater

642
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,240
the more you go. But what would be amazing is if I could draw a tube of blood, send it to you

643
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,840
after a three day fast, a four day fast, a five day fast, a seven day fast, a 10 day fast,

644
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:46,800
and get some sort of quantification. What is it that we would see in... Now, of course,

645
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,080
it's complicated because you'd probably want to accompany each of those tubes of blood with a

646
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:55,360
muscle biopsy so that you could look at LC3, LC2 and things like that. So I'll stop on my diatribe

647
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,240
for a moment and now turn it over to you, which is where would you even begin to look for that

648
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,400
signature of autophagy? And let's just start broadly with any tissue. You can have blood,

649
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,160
you can have muscle, you can have liver, you can have adipose tissue. How would you now create a

650
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:17,760
dose effect? Well, we do bet what happens in a mouse. Let's just take a minute to discuss that.

651
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:26,400
So Mizushima Lab made a mouse that had a transgenic LC3-EGFP protein expressed,

652
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,320
and that could use that mouse. Tell folks what LC3 is, just so because we're going to talk about

653
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:38,640
this quite a bit. So LC3 is the protein that is attached to the autophagosome membrane and links

654
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:44,560
to the cargo that ends up in the autophagosome. So this is a very mechanical thing, right? Like

655
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,800
this goes back to your observation in the electron microscope. Exactly right. So LC3 is one of the

656
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:59,680
key proteins attached to the autophagosome membrane, and you use it to see autophagosomes,

657
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:08,000
because normally when autophagy is off, LC3 is diffuse. But when autophagosomes form,

658
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:15,360
the LC3 protein is attached to them, and you start to see spots where all the autophagosomes

659
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:23,920
are present. And so the Mizushima Lab used that to assess autophagy in a living mouse.

660
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:30,320
They fasted the mouse and they found that they could see the formation of autophagosomes

661
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,960
throughout the mouse. And could they do this in like PBMC out of blood or do they need to use tissue?

662
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,760
They did it with tissue. What they learned was that, yes, autophagy is turned on during fasting

663
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:48,480
in a mouse, which wasn't surprising, but it seemed to not be uniform across every tissue.

664
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:56,240
So that was interesting. But we don't have a way to do that in people. All we can do,

665
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,600
because this involved making a genetically engineered mouse. So the only thing we can do

666
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:08,240
in people would be to look at a tissue section and stain it for LC3 and to look to see if there

667
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:15,520
were spots. In other words, you could not look at LC3 conversion in white blood cells. You could,

668
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:21,440
but there's another problem in that you could take PBMCs and do a western blot for LC3,

669
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:29,600
and LC3 gets processed from LC3 1 to 2, and the 2 form is the one that's attached to the

670
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:38,800
autophagosome membrane. So you could do a western blot of PBMCs to measure the conversion of 1 to 2,

671
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:48,400
but then 2 ends up in the lysosome and gets degraded. So the typical measurement of autophagic

672
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:57,440
flux involves measuring the rate at which LC3 1 gets converted to LC3 2, and then the rate at which

673
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:06,240
LC3 2 ends up being degraded in the lysosome. And in order to see that flux, you need to block

674
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:14,240
the degradation of LC3 2 in the lysosome with baphylomycin or hydroxychloroquine. And so you

675
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:22,800
would only be able, by looking at LC3 1 and 2 in PBMCs in a person that was fasting, you would only

676
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:29,760
be able to infer autophagic flux because you wouldn't actually be able to measure it.

677
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,480
It's a clue.

678
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:37,280
It's a clue. It wouldn't be proof, but it would be, one could presume, I would expect you would see

679
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,760
more conversion of 1 to 2 and then 2 going into the lysosome. I don't think that would get you

680
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,960
the answer that you need.

681
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:52,640
Now, what if we had 100 volunteers who are willing to fast and subject to blood draws and muscle

682
01:09:52,640 --> 01:10:00,160
biopsies? So you could use the muscle biopsies to actually quantify the flux and establish,

683
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,480
let's say you could do it a different time point. So you had 100 people fast for different periods

684
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,320
of time, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days, et cetera. You've got tissue and you've got blood. What else could you

685
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:17,520
look for? So again, could BHB be a proxy? Could glucose be a proxy? I remember you once mentioning

686
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:23,280
another organic molecule you had identified. You knew it by how many carbons it had and you

687
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,520
thought it was ringed, but you weren't sure what it was yet. Have you figured that out?

688
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,640
Yes. That was something that accumulated when we inhibited autophagy and that was

689
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,520
glucuronic acid. So that would be, I think you're going down the right road. So I think

690
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:47,280
what we can do, and we haven't really done this yet, would be to look at metabolites

691
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,280
because metabolism is so drastically changed. So if we can't look at directly measure

692
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:03,920
autophagic flux in humans very easily, because we don't yet have the proper tools, we could use

693
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:12,560
metabolites as surrogate markers for the consequences of autophagy. That's exactly

694
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,760
why I call it a signature as opposed to a biomarker, because I think it's basically,

695
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,840
how do you use machine learning to take many metabolites? There's a bunch of things we know

696
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,920
are happening. We just have to integrate them. We know that leucine is going down. We know

697
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,200
methionine will be almost unmeasurable. We know what's going to happen to glucose, uric acid,

698
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:37,120
and then there's probably a whole bunch of other small molecules and things in the proteome that

699
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:44,240
we don't yet know that are probably discernible from PBMC directly or indirectly through other

700
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:50,720
things in the plasma. It just seems like a problem that is so ripe for a machine learning environment

701
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:56,320
where you don't need that many people because you know what the gold standard is. You just starve

702
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,480
them and then you have the check, which is the muscle biopsy, which can give you some sort of

703
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,680
quantifiable gradation. I mean, do you get the sense that that's something an IRB would approve?

704
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:10,160
It's invasive. It requires biopsies and fasting and things like that, but or would they demand

705
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:15,840
that you, hey, first you have to do this in mice? That's what I would expect. One of the things that

706
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:24,800
we have been talking about is we've done some of this, but probably not enough, is to do a metabolic

707
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:32,720
characterization of a wild type mouse fasted versus an autophagy deficient mouse fasted.

708
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:39,840
I think that would potentially identify the metabolic changes that were autophagy dependent,

709
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:46,000
and I think that would provide some clues as to what to look at in humans because the problem with

710
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:52,880
looking at metabolism is you get an enormous amount of data, and it's very, very helpful to know what

711
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,720
to look for. We may have a list of things that are obvious to look for, but. Right, but the fine

712
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,040
tuning is going to come in the non-obvious. It's not going to be a regression model based on five

713
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,880
things we know. It's going to be much more complicated. And I prefer not the under the

714
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:16,800
lamppost science. Yeah, take an unbiased view and go, and honestly, I get asked about this more than

715
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,360
any other translational problem. So the good news is I think there are a lot of people in the

716
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:26,240
philanthropic community that would be interested in this, even if this is not a question NIH is

717
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:32,320
interested in. I doubt NIH is interested in this problem, although that strikes me as odd given how

718
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,200
potent a tool fasting is, and yet how we don't know how to dose it. And I think it's worth

719
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:43,360
pausing on that for a moment because that is such a stark statement, if I'm correct. I believe I am,

720
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:51,040
which is imagine we had the most amazing drug imaginable. Imagine we had a proteose inhibitor

721
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,560
for HIV and we knew deep down this could cure HIV. The problem is we didn't know how to dose it.

722
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:04,000
How long would we tolerate that ignorance? Imagine we had a drug that we knew could kill cancer,

723
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,200
but we just didn't know how much to give or how often to give it. We wouldn't tolerate that for

724
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:17,280
a minute. And yet in fasting, we have arguably the most potent tool and certainly if not the

725
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,640
most potent, probably one of the three most potent tools in which we can affect human health,

726
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,520
and we don't have a clue how to dose it or what frequency with which to use it.

727
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:36,160
And I find that ridiculous. So I'm actually really confident that if there were a really

728
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:41,360
great proposal put together that would go from the animal model to the human model,

729
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,520
it would be fundable. It would be fully fundable through philanthropic efforts.

730
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:50,640
And so if nothing else comes to this discussion, I would love to plant that seed with you and think

731
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:56,240
about what would be the right consortium of people to do that work. Obviously, there are lots of

732
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,400
skill sets that we'd want to have involved in there, but I really believe that could be funded

733
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,360
quite easily. And I think that the implication of that is as potent as anything else, because again,

734
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,560
here I am doing my three day fast every month versus my seven day every quarter versus five

735
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:16,800
day every quarter. We just don't know. And it really is troubling to me. It just drives me insane.

736
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:23,440
Well, I think for the general community, I think it's an important question, even for practical

737
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:32,480
reasons, because you may be able to control your life to the extent that you can do all this at

738
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:40,480
your own convenience. But a lot of people don't have that flexibility. And so if they can be told

739
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:48,400
that fasting for X amount of time is all you need to do, then the beneficial effects of fasting

740
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,920
could be there would be more people that could take advantage of it. Absolutely. And if you look

741
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:00,400
at the work of someone like Walter Longo, who his assertion is, you can get most of the benefit

742
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,720
without actually having to be fully fasted, but to do something that is like a fast mimic,

743
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:10,640
where you reduce your calories significantly for a period of five days. Again, maybe he's right,

744
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,160
but we have no idea. We have no idea what the efficacy of that approach is versus a total

745
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,520
water only fast for five days. And it would be great to know because if we could demonstrate

746
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,040
that you're getting 80% of the benefit doing a fast mimicking diet versus a complete fast,

747
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,000
well, that opens the door to many more people who would be willing to do fast mimicry versus

748
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,080
an outright fast. And again, I think about this constantly, which is I'm almost willing to do

749
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:44,080
anything. I just want to know what to do. So I think that now is the right time to ask that

750
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:51,920
question. Let me just digress a little bit to talk about metabolism. So we know a lot about

751
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:58,480
metabolism, essentially the field of not only just cancer metabolism, but metabolism in general,

752
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:06,240
mapped out all the metabolic, most of the metabolic pathways. But what we lack the ability to do

753
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:13,360
until fairly recently was to have a thorough understanding of metabolism in a living mammal.

754
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:21,200
And so Josh Rabinowitz and I have invested a lot of effort in developing technology to

755
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,840
use isotope tracers. This would be C13 labeled glucose and amino acids and so forth.

756
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:36,400
And to deliver them to living mice running around and doing normal mice things in a cage,

757
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:43,920
and then look to see how they're used and how different tissues use them and how there's

758
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:50,560
nutrients sharing between tissues. Because when you're fasting, there's many complicated things

759
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:57,440
going on. It's not just like there's no food and you're inducing autophagy and that's that.

760
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,280
That's the only thing that's happening in a vacuum, right?

761
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,880
So you have dedicated nutrient stores, you have glycogen in your liver that's mobilized,

762
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:11,360
and that's dumping glucose into the bloodstream. You have beta-atipose tissue that starts

763
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:17,520
segrating your triglycerides, and then you end up with glycerol and fatty acids in the bloodstream,

764
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:23,920
which then are taken up by the liver and so forth. So you have all these, if you're really

765
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,680
without nutrients for a long time, then your muscle proteins start being degraded,

766
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:35,600
which is probably undesirable. That's dumping amino acids into the circulation so that

767
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,480
you can maintain your survival. We have to understand all of that.

768
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,520
Because it really occurs in different phases. Again, if you just limit it to humans for a moment

769
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,160
where we have a pretty good understanding of this, what's happening in the first 24 hours

770
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:55,040
versus the next 24 hours versus the next 24 hours is very different. And George Cahill's

771
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:00,560
famous fasting study, the 40-day fast on the healthy subjects, really divides it into these

772
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,880
phases. What's interesting is by about seven days into a prolonged fast, you pretty much reach a

773
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,800
steady state. You've got a pretty consistent flux of triglyceride into free fatty acid out of the

774
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:19,280
fat cell. You reach a steady state level of beta-hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate and glucose,

775
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,400
such that basically the sum total of them in millimolar concentrations is about preserved

776
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:30,240
to where you would be non-fasting like. And so it begs the question, if we posit that once you reach

777
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:36,400
that steady state of seven to 10 days, you're clearly in a fully turned on autophagy state,

778
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:43,600
what's the switch look like? When you're 24 hours or 48 hours or 72 hours into that,

779
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:49,120
are you 80% of the way to the benefit or just 20%? That's a jugular question.

780
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:56,240
Yes, I think it would be fascinating to understand that. And I think that if you look back over

781
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:04,960
history, almost all cultures have fasting as part of their history. And I'm thinking that

782
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,680
that is not by accident. I think they must have learned by trial and error that this was a healthy

783
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:20,000
thing to do. And so I think that autophagy, I would expect is playing a major role in promoting

784
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,840
health in response to fasting. But I really think, well, maybe I'm sticking my neck out,

785
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,960
but I think using fasting as opposed to trying to find some pill you could take is something

786
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,480
that's easy to do. And of course, it speaks to the irony of it, which is if you took probably

787
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:45,040
1% of the budget that is being dispensed to find pills that stimulate autophagy, we would actually

788
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,960
be able to answer this question clearly. Absolutely. And actually just have a dose

789
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,640
and look, that doesn't mean these things can't coexist. I'm all for it. And I wanted to ask you,

790
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:59,200
of course, about some of the other pills like rapamycin and metformin and the role that they

791
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:04,400
might have and how we might be able to measure that. But again, this just strikes me as the most

792
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:12,640
obvious question in the space of how to prevent disease. And it's like you have this beautiful,

793
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,760
beautiful tool and you don't know what the dose is and you don't know what the frequency is.

794
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:26,480
If someone knows that they're susceptible to a neurodegenerative disease, has anyone looked

795
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:33,520
at those people to see if they engaged in some sort of fasting regimen, whether that was helpful

796
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,000
or not? Indirectly. I mean, it's possible that that's been done directly. And I just am not

797
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,680
familiar with that. I think what we've seen indirectly is dietary restriction as opposed

798
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,880
to just pure caloric restriction, where you improve the quality of macronutrients,

799
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:54,240
specifically around improving glycemic control. You can take people that are in an early stage

800
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,360
of cognitive impairment and delay it and or reverse it through that type of nutritional

801
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,000
intervention. Now, of course, that doesn't necessarily say autophagy is playing a role,

802
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,360
because that's doing a lot of other things. It's improving glucose and insulin signaling in the

803
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:13,200
brain. It's doing a lot of other things. And we're really starting to see the impact of

804
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:19,600
metabolism in the brain. So that's not entirely clear. Indirectly, I would say there are, I think,

805
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:25,200
some pretty interesting, compelling pilot data that suggests that rapamycin is neuroprotective.

806
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:32,240
And again, rapamycin, a very potent inhibitor of mTOR would presumably on some level induce

807
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:38,960
autophagy. I think it's a very interesting question as to what is it about rapamycin

808
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:44,240
that induces a longevity phenotype? Rapamycin to me is the most interesting molecule out there,

809
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:49,120
because it is, I think, the only molecule that has demonstrated a longevity benefit

810
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:55,680
across all four models of eukaryotic cells. So that's a really big deal that can't be ignored.

811
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,640
But how much of that benefit is through autophagy? I'd like to turn that question to you.

812
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:06,800
How much of it is through inhibition of senescent cells, reduction of inflammation? Again,

813
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,920
so it's very indirect. And it speaks to, again, again, I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy

814
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,720
theory guy, because I'm not, but it is a little frustrating that we have these amazing tools.

815
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:20,880
But because they're not particularly profitable, you don't really have somebody that's interested

816
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,680
in answering them. And that's why I again, come back to, A, I think these are answerable questions.

817
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,920
B, I don't think they are billion dollar questions. I think they are really questions that are

818
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:36,320
amenable to the philanthropic community. And I think from an ROI perspective, it's hard to think

819
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,400
of examples of where you could put dollars to work in research that would have a greater impact on

820
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:49,280
human life. Right. And I think that our biomedical community is mostly focused on putting out fires

821
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:56,080
rather than disease prevention, although I've seen a change. I mean, I see at the NCI,

822
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:02,880
the National Cancer Institute, a bigger interest in cancer prevention. So I think people are coming

823
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:12,240
around to realizing that making people healthy or longer is probably more important than once they

824
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:18,960
discovered to have stage four pancreatic cancer, what can we throw at it to make them live another

825
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:27,840
two months? Yeah, again, it is sort of amazing to me how lopsided our resource allocation is with

826
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,920
respect to that problem, because you're absolutely right. We have spent probably a quarter of a

827
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:40,960
trillion dollars in the last 40 years on the second question, which is once you have metastatic

828
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,480
cancer, how do you live longer? And we've done an analysis on this. So for the quarter of a

829
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:53,280
trillion dollars that has been spent on that problem on average for solid organ tumors,

830
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:59,280
we have extended median survival by less than about a year since 1970. So almost 50 years.

831
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:05,040
That's pretty sad when you think about the fact that there's not much evidence we've reduced

832
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:12,320
the arrival of cancer. In fact, all we've done is basically come up with a second leading cause

833
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,120
of cancer in terms of modifiable behavior, which is after smoking, it becomes down to diabetes,

834
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:22,880
insulin resistance, and all of the metabolic dysregulation. So yeah, I'll get off my soapbox

835
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,840
now. But again, this is in many ways just a sort of a plea for help, which is I think there's

836
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:33,760
an amazing opportunity to understand this. So there's another component to this that worries

837
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:41,760
me greatly. So what we've seen, you know, so a lot of this, you're talking about controlling

838
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:49,360
metabolism to preserve health through implementation of fasting and understanding fasting. But look

839
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:56,720
what's happened to the American diet. I mean, there are people now that don't even

840
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:05,040
recognize vegetables in the supermarket. There are people that only eat prepared food.

841
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:12,560
And so what we've seen is, on the one hand, you're talking about preserving health and all that.

842
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:19,920
But on the other hand, the overall health of Americans is deteriorating, obesity is greatly

843
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:28,320
increased, and has no sign of abating the diet of Americans loaded with high fructose corn syrup,

844
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:36,880
and diets that are disproportionate with prepared food. So the only way to globally

845
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,440
improve the health of Americans or anyone else for that matter is to deal with both of these

846
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:49,200
problems at the same time. And to me, that's probably the greatest line of reasoning that says

847
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:56,160
fasting is probably protective against all chronic disease. Because if you look at the three main

848
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:05,200
chronic diseases that account for, to our last analysis, 82% of deaths above the age of 50 in

849
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:11,120
the United States, excluding COPD. So if you take out the obvious smoking related death of COPD,

850
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:18,000
82% of death is attributable to cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and

851
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,560
complications of diabetes. That's pretty stark. There's no question that when you improve

852
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:29,920
metabolic health, which you can do through fasting, you reduce the risk of all of those

853
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,120
significantly. Of course, the question becomes how much of a role does autophagy play in that?

854
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,000
Specifically, you look at the example you gave of neurodegeneration that makes a very compelling

855
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,560
case for it, probably also in cancer. What do we know about cardiovascular disease, by the way?

856
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,840
Nothing comes to mind. I don't recall seeing anything in that area.

857
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:58,160
Yeah. I mean, my take on the literature is that the benefits of fasting in cardiovascular disease

858
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:04,320
are primarily mediated through the metabolic health benefits of it. Lower glucose, lower insulin,

859
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:11,520
lower homocysteine in time, lower inflammation primarily, as opposed to something that directly

860
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,520
pertains to APOB or the inflammatory response to that. But again, maybe it's just there and

861
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,640
I haven't seen it. What else do you think is going on? What travels with autophagy? Can we talk about

862
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:27,200
senescence for a moment? Do we understand a sense of what's happening when an animal or a human is

863
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:33,680
undergoing autophagy with respect to either SASP or just the overall senescent cells?

864
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:41,680
Yeah. There seems to be complicated roles for autophagy and senescence. There's evidence from

865
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:49,360
the Nereeda lab that SASP, the secretion of inflammatory factors that occurs during senescence,

866
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:57,520
is facilitated by autophagy. But then in the cancer setting, there's also examples where

867
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:05,200
loss of autophagy limits senescence. So I think in the senescence area, it's still a little bit

868
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,880
confusing and maybe a little bit context dependent as to what's happening.

869
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,560
And then going back to the question about molecules, what do we know about metformin

870
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:23,680
and autophagy? Do we know that in a fed state, if we give an animal or a human metformin,

871
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:28,720
we can still induce autophagy, all things equal, through just the AMPK activation?

872
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:35,840
Yes. And I think that that's true, but I think that we don't understand over the long term what

873
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:43,360
happens and what the consequence of having autophagy or not having autophagy is. So for example,

874
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,000
we've never given metformin to our mice that don't have autophagy. That might be an interesting

875
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:57,840
thing to do. What is the consequence of autophagy induction by metformin? It actually might be better

876
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:06,800
to do that in a system where autophagy wasn't completely gone, but could be toggled up.

877
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:12,720
Do you have the ability to turn autophagy into an analog versus a digital,

878
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,040
meaning where you can actually use gradations versus just on or off?

879
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:24,320
Yes. I think the mouse model where autophagy, the expression of essential autophagy gene is

880
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:28,640
controlled by an SHRNA might be the way to do that experiment.

881
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:34,320
And then what about rapamycin? What do we know about the use of rapamycin,

882
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:40,400
which has been studied so liberally across, again, everything from yeast, flies, worms, mammals,

883
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:47,040
uniformly extends life, potent inhibitor of mTOR, which would signal autophagy all things equal.

884
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:53,360
Where do we see that relationship? So there's been a lot of discussion about using rapamycin

885
01:30:53,360 --> 01:31:00,880
or rappalogs as autophagy stimulators, but it's like what you said before. It does many other

886
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,400
things and it's also immune suppressive. Although that also depends on the dose, right? I mean,

887
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:12,240
the Everlymus data suggested that it was actually immune enhancing when given intermittently.

888
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:19,680
I also have to remember that if you have a small molecule like rapamycin and you want to use it to

889
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:26,880
preserve someone's health, you have to make sure that it's safe. And I think that's when everyone

890
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:33,760
backs away because if you've got cancer and they want to try an experimental drug and you've got

891
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:41,040
no other hope and you're going to be dead in a short period of time, there's a bit of latitude

892
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:48,160
in what can be done clinically to test whether or not there's a small molecule or some sort of drug

893
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:55,520
that will be safe and possibly have efficacy. But when you're talking about prevention,

894
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:02,240
it's a big problem. The drug companies are not interested in it because the amount of time it

895
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:08,080
would take in the risk of- Right, just a much narrower margin. By the way, that's exactly the

896
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:14,800
reason we're in the situation we're in. So just to reiterate, we have a situation where I am not

897
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:21,360
convinced that longevity as a game is going to be one on the back of extending the time you have a

898
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:27,280
disease. I have never seen a shred of evidence to suggest that that is the answer. Everything

899
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:33,120
in humans and animals points to the opposite end of the spectrum. Longevity is about delaying the

900
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:38,960
time it takes until disease comes. The implication of that is prevention is the single most important

901
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:45,760
tool in the longevity toolkit. How do we reconcile that with what you just said? All of our pharmacologic

902
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:52,720
efforts, the trillion dollars we spend on drug development is all on the wrong side of the

903
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:59,120
equation. It's on the how do you live longer once you have a disease? And I understand why

904
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:04,960
that's the case for all the reasons you just said. And if that doesn't make the most compelling case

905
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,720
for taking the best and safest drug of them all, which is fasting and understanding how to dose it

906
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:14,640
and what frequency to dose it, I don't know what makes a better case. Along with exercise, by the

907
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:19,760
way, I put exercise in that same category, which is it bothers me that we don't really know how to

908
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:25,760
dose exercise either. I mean, it's less of a problem, I think, because for most people,

909
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,920
the issue is do more. But it would be really nice to know what the dose response is on different

910
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:37,360
types of exercise, especially for people who want to do the minimum effective amount. So both from

911
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:43,200
an exercise perspective and a nutrient deprivation perspective, there's no more low hanging fruit

912
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,120
in terms of minimizing human suffering and understanding how these things work.

913
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,600
You should start a biotech company to do this. David Sabatini and I have talked about this at

914
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:57,600
length, and he has constantly told me to do this. And the way we thought about it, it's not going

915
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,000
to happen because I won't do it. So someone else will have to do it. The way David describes it

916
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:10,320
very eloquently is right now, metabolic response to nutrients is a black box. And what David thinks,

917
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:16,000
and I think he's right is there's a multi-billion dollar opportunity in decoding the black box.

918
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:22,400
In other words, when we understand exactly what the response is to each different type of nutrient

919
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:28,160
in every different dose and frequency, and we can decode that in the way that we can do with so many

920
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:32,800
other biochemical processes, you can do everything. Because then you could actually develop drugs,

921
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,240
probably they could actually do something. So there's a drug development platform that comes

922
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:41,280
out of that. And then from my standpoint, what I'm really interested in is simply just on the front

923
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:46,640
lines as a sort of knuckle dragging doctor, how do you even just put this into clinical practice?

924
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:51,680
But again, it's high risk. It's a lot of effort to do part of that. I think on the drug development

925
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:56,080
side, there's a lot there. I don't think it's very high risk on the question I posed to you earlier.

926
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:04,400
I think the, let's do the mouse study and identify the 50 metabolites, proteomic signature

927
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:10,800
things that are generally going up with autophagy, and then let's shotgun that in an unbiased way

928
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:16,880
against human subjects. Like I feel like that's a project in the tens of millions of dollars,

929
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:22,080
not even the hundreds of millions of dollars. And again, if you add one year of life to each human

930
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:29,520
as a result of that, that's kind of staggering. Right. And I think if you couple understanding

931
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:38,480
mechanisms of metabolic delay of damaging diseases with surveillance for risk factors,

932
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:47,040
I think those two things really need to be coupled together because you can, even if you define

933
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:55,600
what the optimal diet and exercise and fasting regimen is for delaying the onset of disease,

934
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:03,600
there are still unlucky people. And I think that we can't forget about them in the context of

935
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,680
health and longevity and wellbeing, because you could have the healthiest diet and do everything

936
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:14,400
right. Vogelstein has written about this, right? I mean, there's clearly a component. There's a

937
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,720
stochastic component to this. And yeah, so absolutely. And again, I don't think there's

938
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:22,800
any reason to believe that we couldn't be addressing both of these. Yes. Yeah. I mean,

939
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:30,320
I think that there's no reason to do everything. One always has to bear in mind that there is this

940
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:37,440
other risk factor that no matter what happens with understanding metabolism and fasting and

941
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:43,920
good health practices, that other thing is still going to be there. If you have a BRCA1 mutation,

942
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:51,760
that's a compounding and separate issue. So in 2016, the Nobel prize was awarded for

943
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,960
the, basically the genetic elucidation of autophagy. What are the salient features

944
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,960
of that award? What was it about Osumee's work that led to that award?

945
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:08,720
So what Osumee did was quite profound and very creative. He developed an essay. Well, he asked,

946
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:15,040
what are the, I mean, yeast requires nitrogen for survival. And he asked, what are the genes that

947
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:21,840
are required for nitrogen survival? And he identified the essential autophagy genes.

948
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:29,760
And I always wondered whether if he was in the United States, would work like that be funded?

949
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,680
Because it just seems like it was an important question, but.

950
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:37,200
It didn't have such a clear application down the line.

951
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:37,680
That's right.

952
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:40,080
It was a bit too high risk to fund.

953
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:45,840
Right. And also the clear disease connection wasn't there and so forth and so on. And

954
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:52,560
nonetheless, he did that. And I guess the point is, is that sometimes scientific discoveries are

955
01:37:52,560 --> 01:38:00,080
so basic that you can ever anticipate what it would ultimately lead to. And in this case,

956
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:06,160
it led to something very extraordinary, but he probably had no idea at the time.

957
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,840
And once they discovered these essential autophagy genes in yeast, then it was apparent

958
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,760
that there were homologs and mammals and so forth and so on.

959
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,680
How conserved are those genes between yeast and mammals?

960
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:24,080
If you do a blast search, you can see them. I mean, not all of them,

961
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:28,800
but the amino acid homology was compelling.

962
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:34,960
Wow. So when you sort of think about the future of this, I think so much of what we've talked about

963
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,240
kind of feeds into what your optimism is. But how do you want to spend the next

964
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:43,920
10 years of your career? What are the questions you want to probe?

965
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:52,320
I think I would like to translate what we've learned about the role of autophagy in cancer.

966
01:38:52,960 --> 01:39:01,360
And that involves developing small molecule inhibitors to inhibit autophagy for cancer

967
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:10,400
therapy. And Alec Kilman and I started a company to do that. And what we're focusing on now is

968
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:18,080
defining at the molecular level what the functional requirements for autophagy are in

969
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:26,560
individual cancers. And this involves understanding the metabolic role of autophagy, why one cancer

970
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:32,480
needs autophagy more than another. And then the newest connection is the connection to

971
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,840
inflammation. When you inactivate autophagy, you stimulate inflammation. And this is what we've

972
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:43,760
talked about earlier. In the context of cancer, that could be a really good thing, because the

973
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:50,400
game changer in cancer therapy now is immune checkpoint blockade. In fact, what I was just

974
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:58,000
talking about at the ASER meeting yesterday was the particular patient that came to our cancer

975
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:07,040
center and went through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and it all failed. And her body

976
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:14,240
was riddled with tumors. And she went on a clinical trial for immune checkpoint blockade,

977
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,960
and all the tumors melted away. And that was five years ago, and she's perfectly fine.

978
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:26,800
So what we have to do is make that work for everybody. And if inhibiting autophagy activates

979
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:34,240
the immune response and can facilitate not people who wouldn't respond to immune checkpoint blockade

980
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,120
to respond, then that would be critically important to do.

981
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:44,640
I mean, let me think about that for a second. So when we think about the patients that are

982
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:52,320
responsive, and we really have two big targets, right? CTLA-4 and PD-1. Melanoma, obviously,

983
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:59,040
is a huge success story here because it is so mutagenic. It's interesting. I have a friend who

984
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:05,200
has Lynch syndrome. So that's a familial syndrome where people are predisposed to cancer. He

985
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:10,400
developed colon cancer when he was quite young, went on to develop pancreatic cancer, adenocarcinoma,

986
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:16,000
the pancreas, which is uniformly fatal, almost without exception. He presented with an advanced

987
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,440
state. So he was not even a surgical candidate. So the tumor had completely engulfed his mesenteric

988
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:26,160
artery and vein, which meant he couldn't even undergo the surgical procedure, though it wouldn't

989
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:32,000
have done much anyway. I had just read a paper six months earlier in the New England Journal of

990
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,440
Medicine about, I forgot what the paper was exactly about, but it made me think that because

991
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:43,520
he had Lynch syndrome and he has so many mutations, he might be a candidate for a

992
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,640
checkpoint inhibitor. So we went back to his oncologist and said, hey, can we get him on

993
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:54,480
chytruda? They said, which is an anti PD-1, they said, no, there's no standard for that.

994
01:41:54,480 --> 01:42:00,880
But we found a clinical trial actually got him in. He got chytruda. That was five years ago.

995
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:08,080
He's disease free. So you go from unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma to no pancreatic cancer,

996
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:15,280
pretty remarkable. Now the question is, when I think about how broadly extendable that's going

997
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:21,840
to be, it really comes down to how many shots on gold you get, how many mutations do you get such

998
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:28,000
that you can activate these checkpoint inhibitors. And so tell me how autophagy fits into that,

999
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:35,280
because I think I'm missing the link of why enhanced immune, non-specific immune response

1000
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,280
would factor into that. I know there's a link, but I need you to explain it to me.

1001
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,120
So that's exactly where we're going with our research and

1002
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:50,400
should have been at the ARC yesterday. Yeah. So we know that tumors with a very high mutation

1003
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:56,800
burden respond better to immune checkpoint blockade, but it's not that simple because there

1004
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,360
are patients with tumors that do have a high mutation burden that don't respond. And we don't

1005
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:07,200
know why. It could be they've upregulated some other checkpoint that we can't yet inhibit,

1006
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:11,920
or it could be some other reason they don't express class one or that the immune system

1007
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:18,640
can't see the tumor for some various reasons. And then we also know there are tumors that have a

1008
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:26,000
low mutation burden that do respond. And so a big part, in fact, we just got an NIH grant to study

1009
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:36,480
this, is to make mouse models of cancer with low, medium, and high mutation burden with which to

1010
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,920
And then you can bang out autophagy. Exactly. We haven't done the autophagy part yet. We're just

1011
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:50,640
doing the generating the models using proofreading mutations and polymerase epsilon and delta to

1012
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:57,520
generate mice with cancer with various levels of mutation burden in their tumors.

1013
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:03,680
And this is so cool because we'll be able to ask basic questions like how many mutations do you

1014
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:12,000
need when you have a low mutation burden? What can you do to make the immune system see that tumor?

1015
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,680
Do you need only mutations in a nuclear genome? What about mutations in the mitochondrial genome?

1016
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:25,760
So one of the mouse models we made was to generate a mutator phenotype in the mitochondrial genome.

1017
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:31,520
There are human cancers that have a high level of mitochondrial genome mutations.

1018
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:37,760
Whether that has any effect on anything is completely unknown. There's no reason why

1019
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:44,240
they couldn't be presented as tumor antigens. And you'd think if anything, they would be

1020
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:49,040
more immunogenic. I mean, they should be all things equal just because of their bacterial

1021
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:54,160
origin. That should elicit a much greater immune response. Exactly right. This is what this grand

1022
01:44:54,160 --> 01:45:01,760
is designed to do, to generate mutator phenotypes in mouse models of cancer so we can have a spectrum

1023
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:07,600
from low to really high mutations in the nuclear genome as well as the mitochondrial genome,

1024
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:13,840
then to figure out the mechanism of response to immune checkpoint blockade to make cold

1025
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:19,520
tumors hot. And that's essentially what the loss of autophagy is doing by promoting

1026
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:26,400
inflammation. It's taking a tumor that is not killed by T cells, that does not respond to

1027
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:33,120
immune checkpoint blockade and rendering that tumor responsive. And where do you put this in

1028
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:38,400
the hierarchy of optimism for the future of cancer therapy? I mean, to me, the interesting

1029
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:42,640
stuff in cancer therapy is getting more and more targeted and stacking more and more therapies on

1030
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:48,720
top of each other. So this is an elegant example of stacking something that is clearly going to

1031
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:54,640
become a pillar of oncology, which is immune based therapy with something that frankly is

1032
01:45:54,640 --> 01:46:00,480
partially metabolic and frankly, partially more complicated than just metabolic therapy. So you've

1033
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:06,400
got, you almost add this to the layer of pieces of Swiss cheese you start to stack on top. If you

1034
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:10,160
have enough of them, you're not going to be able to drop a pencil through the cancer doesn't survive.

1035
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:16,480
That's right. So one of the limitations that we have with immune checkpoint blockade is some of

1036
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:21,520
which I've already mentioned, we can't identify who's going to respond and who's not going to

1037
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:29,280
respond and we have to extend the responder pool, but we have to be able to model that because

1038
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:36,320
it's very clear that a single agents is going to be immune checkpoint blockade therapy is not going

1039
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:44,560
to help most of the patients. So how do we go about optimizing this treatment and having

1040
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:52,720
models where you can combine immune checkpoint blockade with other therapies to evaluate what

1041
01:46:52,720 --> 01:47:00,160
is the optimal response is critical and that's what we're doing and whether fasting influences

1042
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:07,600
this is completely unknown. What's the role of autophagy in the immune cell itself? So either

1043
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:16,560
adaptive or innate, I mean, maybe both. So we know that one of the things we did was to turn autophagy

1044
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:27,200
off in a mouse and ask how that affected basic immune responses. And the answer was everything

1045
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:34,000
in the short term appeared to be completely functional. And if anything, the T cells were

1046
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:41,440
more anti-tumorigenic. But if you go into the long term, if you knock out an essential autophagy

1047
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:48,240
gene only in T cells, for example, and look nine months later, I think those T cells are not going

1048
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:55,840
to be very functional. But it really depends on how you design the experiment. For cancer therapy,

1049
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:03,920
we want to know what happens acutely. When you're inhibiting autophagy, you're going to be looking

1050
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:11,840
at things in the short term, not in the long term. So there's still a lot we need to do in that area.

1051
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:20,480
But in the short term, for cancer therapy, the immune system seems to function well, if not better,

1052
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:26,320
in the presence of autophagy inhibition. This just doesn't stop getting confusing,

1053
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:34,960
because again, you would think that given the benefits of autophagy and preventing cancer,

1054
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:41,200
you would think that that would only enhance innate immunity because of the role innate

1055
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:47,120
immunity plays in cancer screening. Which again, I think just speaks to we are still

1056
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:55,200
really scratching the surface of all of the different tentacles that come out of these tools.

1057
01:48:55,200 --> 01:49:02,000
Something like fasting seems very simple. And it's simple, of course, to do. But it has such a

1058
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:09,600
set of pleiotropic extensions and benefits that it's very unlikely that it's about all or none.

1059
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:15,040
There's nothing black and white here. It's really all these shades of gray that it's not intuitive

1060
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:19,200
when you look at them what the net effect is, because it's a little bit of this, a little bit

1061
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:24,720
of that, more of this than that. It's the balance of this versus that. Yes, I would agree. And I

1062
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:30,480
think context is important too. When you think of all the big chronic diseases, just based on what

1063
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:35,360
you've talked with us today about, I think we have to be really excited about Alzheimer's disease

1064
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:42,640
based on the model you've shared. I mean, that strikes me as an amazing opportunity because one,

1065
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:47,200
we don't have a single tool. Once somebody has Alzheimer's disease, I'm sure you saw the most

1066
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:52,880
recent, I don't know if you follow that literature, but we just saw two enormous failures in the

1067
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:59,040
anti-amyloid beta drug trials. So we're back to kind of square one, which is not a single drug

1068
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:05,680
that works for this condition. If any disease demands prevention, it has to be this one.

1069
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:10,880
It's hard to make the case that fasting isn't going to play a beneficial role there, isn't it?

1070
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:16,960
I believe you. I'd love to. We have to test this now. We have to be tested. But I think that when

1071
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:25,520
you look at the dramatic failures in preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease, you have to ask

1072
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:33,120
the question, what is the root cause of that? And if you look at the approaches, all the approaches

1073
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,520
are designed to m

1074
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:45,440
eelerate a symptom. And the research has not yet gotten to the root cause. And I think that that is

1075
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:53,200
the reason for these spectacular failures, is they're trying to treat a symptom of the disease

1076
01:50:53,840 --> 01:51:01,840
rather than the cause of the disease. And when you look at the genes that are involved in neurodegeneration

1077
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:09,840
in general, they fall into a broad array of different categories. And so my thinking is that

1078
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:15,680
they're all doing different things, but there's some common denominator that has yet to be

1079
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:27,600
identified. And I think that until the root cause of disease is identified, just finding means to

1080
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:32,720
ameliorate the symptoms is not going to be productive. Eileen, you know, I could sit here

1081
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,040
and talk about this for hours and hours. I want to be respectful of your time because I know you've

1082
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,640
stayed an extra day to have this discussion with me, which I really appreciate. Is there anything

1083
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:46,080
else you want to talk about today? Either as it pertains to your work, something you're excited

1084
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:53,040
about in the future, or anything else that pertains to autophagy? I mean, I think that understanding

1085
01:51:53,040 --> 01:52:00,640
in greater detail how autophagy impacts metabolism. We've done some of that, but I think

1086
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:07,680
there's way more to do. We have the technical ability to examine metabolic flux in a mouse

1087
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:16,480
in vivo in normal and starvation conditions, and in response to different diseases. And we're only

1088
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:22,240
at the beginning of doing that. And I think that that's something that we will continue to do

1089
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:33,120
and hope that we can identify new targets for anti-cancer therapy or signatures of metabolic

1090
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:38,880
problems. And we will continue to do that. But again, I want to return to the immunotherapy,

1091
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:48,000
I think in the field of cancer building on that huge gain. We can't take our eyes off that ball.

1092
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:52,640
Those are both very interesting. And of course, the former, it sounds like you really agree with

1093
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:59,200
David Sabatini, which is there's an enormous opportunity to decode metabolism in a way that

1094
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:04,720
we should have done 20 years ago. I think we lack the technology. I mean, I think that,

1095
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:15,200
so maybe I could take a minute to explain what we do, and that by using C13 or N15 labeled tracers,

1096
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:24,400
you can put them into a mouse, infuse a mouse with these tracers. And by looking at where they go

1097
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:32,160
by mass spectrometry over different time points, you can see metabolism. And that was something that

1098
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:37,200
was never possible before. What is it because we've been able to label these things forever,

1099
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:41,040
what was it the mass spec didn't have the resolution before? Or what is it that why is

1100
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:45,680
it we couldn't do this 20 years ago, I guess? I think they could do it with radioactive material,

1101
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:51,920
and they could do it somewhat with the technology they had way back when. But I think that the

1102
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:59,120
technology now is far more sophisticated. By using heavy isotopes, you don't need radioactivity.

1103
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:05,760
Now there are more mouse models of disease, you could even do this in humans. So Ralph DeBarradinas

1104
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:13,200
at UT Southwestern is infusing these isotope tracers into humans with cancer and actually

1105
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,920
measuring the metabolism of human tumors. Wow, that's interesting. I did an experiment once

1106
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,160
on myself with doubly labeled water, which of course is a very simple version of doing

1107
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:28,400
that sort of thing to examine energy expenditure. I had a field day doing that.

1108
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:35,680
Oh, yeah. But I think that in fact, next week I'm supposed to go to a keystone tumor metabolism

1109
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:41,840
meeting where all the experts in this area will get together and talk about this in detail. But

1110
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:52,160
this is a growing field. It's very exciting and understanding metabolism in mammals at a level

1111
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:59,760
we've never seen before in various disease states is tremendous. And then lastly, is it safe to say

1112
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,960
that should there be a strong enough public demand and a philanthropic demand to go after that

1113
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:10,560
question we talked about earlier about sort of decoding the dose effect of fasting? Is that the

1114
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:17,360
sort of thing you'd be interested in working on? Yes. I was fascinated by what happened when mice

1115
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:25,280
didn't have autophagy and they died when they were fasted. And I am very much interested in

1116
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:32,320
fasting as a way to preserve health. I'm also interested in, as I mentioned earlier, the dietary

1117
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:37,440
part because I think all of this has to go together. It's not just how many calories you eat

1118
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:44,080
or how often you eat them. It's what they are. So yes, that's something that's very important to me.

1119
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:50,240
Well, Eileen, thank you very much. This was super, super interesting. And I know that folks are gonna,

1120
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:55,280
