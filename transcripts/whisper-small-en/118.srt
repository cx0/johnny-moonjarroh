00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,520
today's episode. I guess this week is Lloyd Klikstein. Lloyd's the chief scientific officer

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:04,040
at Restore Bio. So that's little R-E-S, big T-O-R, little B-I-O. Get it? Tor, T-O-R. Restore Bio is a

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,640
clinical stage bio farm company that develops meds that are primarily aimed at targeting Tor,

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,480
targeted rapamycin. We'll talk a lot about that throughout this episode. So prior to joining

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,720
Restore Bio, Lloyd was the global head of translational medicine for the new indication

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,000
discovery unit at Novartis. Prior to that, he was an academic physician at the Brigham and

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,280
Women's Hospital, which is one of the flagship programs at Harvard. Lloyd received his bachelor's

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,840
from Tufts and an MD, PhD from Harvard. He's got more accolades than you could shake a stick at.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,320
So accolades aside, the reason I wanted to speak with Lloyd was because he is really one of the

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,880
few people on this planet that has a really nuanced understanding of the clinical application

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
of rapamycin and rapologs. And we talk a lot about one of them in particular called

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Evrolimus. Lloyd was the senior author on a paper that I have spoken about many times on this

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,880
podcast, which we'll go into in great detail here. December 2014 paper, Joan Manik was the

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,280
lead author on that paper. And that was the study that was basically the turning point in my personal

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,720
evolution or thinking when it came to the use of rapamycin for the purpose of longevity. Prior to

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,960
that, there had been a lot of studies that had certainly suggested in animal models that rapamycin

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,880
could be a true longevity agent, but it was the Manik-Klickstein paper of December 2014 that was

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,800
the real turning point in my thinking. And that's really where we're going in this discussion along

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,000
with talking about all that's been done since then. It is important before we start this interview

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
that I mentioned, of course, that Lloyd is an employee of RestoreBio. RestoreBio is a for-profit

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
company that is working on mTOR inhibition. So please caveat everything that we discuss

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720
through that lens. Before this podcast begins, I want to note that we recorded this interview in

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,560
September 2019. Now in the interview, we discussed an upcoming phase three trial from RestoreBio.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,760
Since that time, the results have been published and the study did not meet its primary endpoint.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,120
Now I frankly left the option to Lloyd as to whether or not he wanted to still have the

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,280
podcast air and he felt that that would be fine to do. And so we're going to go ahead with it. And

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,800
eventually I'm going to be interviewing his colleague, Joan Manik, along with Nir Barzal.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,920
I'm going to have the two of them back on an episode where we're going to discuss a whole

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,480
bunch of things that'll be quite interesting. And this gets more complicated because I think

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,080
I have a pretty clear understanding of why that study failed and what it does and doesn't say

39
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,000
about selective inhibition of agents like it. Nevertheless, I think the most logical thing

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,240
to do is to go ahead and proceed with this interview, which is one of my favorite interviews

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,720
on this subject matter, and just know that there are going to be a number of things that are left

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,320
as open-ended questions from this discussion. We're going to pick back up with Joan Manik when

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,840
we do that interview, which I'm scheduled to do a few weeks from now. And hopefully we'll try to

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,200
get that one out at a much quicker turnaround. There are a number of issues that delayed the

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,360
release of this, not the least of which being some of the COVID stuff, but I can promise you

46
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,960
that there will be a shorter gap between when you are hearing this and you will hear the follow-up

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,320
to this than there was between the recording of this and when you're hearing it. And without

48
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Lloyd Klikstein.

49
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:29,600
Lloyd, thank you so much for making the trip up to San Francisco today. I know you didn't

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,560
come here specifically to see me, but I appreciate you carving out a little extra time to meet today.

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,240
I'm happy to be here and looking forward to our talk.

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
I hope the view is enticing enough here.

53
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,240
It's lovely.

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,080
When the weather is nice in San Francisco, there are a few things that compare to it. And when it's

55
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,160
not, it's like Mark Twain said, right? The worst winter he ever had was a summer in San Francisco

56
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,280
or something of that effect. And hear from Boston, so you laugh at that.

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,440
Right now, this is the weather we all wish we had in Boston.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,040
Yeah. So Tim Wright, one of your colleagues, offered to make this introduction over dinner

59
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,400
one night. And there's probably never been in the history of an introduction from the moment the

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,320
intro was offered until I was sitting down talking to someone on a podcast that was quicker than this

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,080
one. In other words, I'm sorry to hear that actually.

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Well, it was just a meaning I was so excited when we sat there and it was so I was with Tim and with

63
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,480
DA Wallach, who some folks listening will know because I've interviewed DA on the podcast as

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,560
well. And we were having this dinner. And as is always the case when I'm talking with dorky

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,080
science friends, Rapa Mice comes up and one thing led to another. And then I'm embarrassed to say

66
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,680
this, but the 2014 paper that I talk about constantly, I always refer to it as the manic

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,080
paper because she's, of course, the first author. But you're sort of the lead author. You're the

68
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
final author. You're the senior author on that paper. And so I was embarrassed to say this. I

69
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,520
didn't even when they mentioned your name, I didn't put two and two together. And I didn't know you

70
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,920
were at Restore Bio at the time either. So anyway, they connected us. We communicated over email. The

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,320
rest is history. We're sitting here today and I am beyond excited. And then this is a topic that I

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,640
just know listeners are dying to hear about because it's been over a year since I've had a

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,800
podcast on this topic. So very early in this podcast, which is about a year and a half ago,

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,080
we had discussions with David Sabatini and with Matt Kaberlin, who are both amazing folks and

75
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,720
legends in this area as well. So I'm going to discipline myself for a moment before getting

76
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,840
right into the Rapa stuff to give a little bit of background. You've got a pretty interesting

77
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,960
background. I want to hear a little bit about it. When did you realize this is what you wanted to

78
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,920
do, which was be basically physician, scientist, and then ultimately now move into industry?

79
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,680
Well, I guess I can begin by stating that science and medicine is the family business. So it wasn't

80
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,120
much of a stretch for me to be here doing what I'm doing now doing what I've done before on both

81
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,080
sides of my family, both sides of my kids family. All of my kids are scientists, doctors are both.

82
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,240
So did you do a combined MD PhD or did you do them separately?

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,000
I did the combined one. My wife did them separately, actually, the long and expensive way.

84
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Yeah, exactly. At least when you do them together, they pay for each other.

85
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,720
Yeah.

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,680
When did you decide you want to focus on immunology, rheumatology? I mean, there's no shortage of

87
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
things one can specialize in.

88
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,760
One of at least my challenges and I know the challenge of many physicians and many scientists

89
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,120
is that so many things are interesting. How do you focus? And like many things in life, it was about

90
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,680
the people, not the science that led me into immunology, rheumatology and where I am. When I

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,360
had left college, and wasn't sure where I was going to go next, I spent a couple of years working in a

92
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,360
laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital. I had such an incredible time and met such wonderful

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,800
people that ultimately my decision was to stay there and work with them, learn from them. What

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,880
years were you at the Brigham? I worked in a technical capacity from 79 to 81, started medical

95
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:12,560
school in 81 and finished both degrees by 1989 and then stayed there through all of my training and

96
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,880
then left in 2006 to join actually Tim Wright's department at Novartis Institutes.

97
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,920
What prompted that decision? And is that a one way street for most people?

98
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,840
There are people who go back and forth, but I think we have to be realistic that it's more

99
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,920
challenging to go back to academia if you don't have extant grants and external funding. It has to

100
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,920
come from somewhere in most places. In terms of what drove the decision, I'm a physician-scientist.

101
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:49,520
For me, it's important to do both, science and medicine. And it's harder and harder and harder to

102
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,760
do that now in an academic environment. At least I'll get in trouble for saying this, but at least

103
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,200
a primitive academic environment like Harvard, where you eat what you kill and you have to, at the

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,160
same time, see patients be at the top of not just your game, but the world's game in seeing patients

105
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
and administrative and teaching responsibilities and so forth.

106
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Well, I mean, let Harvard get upset at you for saying that, but I mean, there's no denying what

107
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,400
you're saying is the case. I interview so many people who are straddling that and I'm constantly

108
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,600
amazed. In fact, I was interviewing someone recently, a very remarkable scientist and academic,

109
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,240
and I couldn't believe how much clinical obligation he had and yet how prolific he was. It's sort of

110
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,480
amazing to me that some folks can actually straddle that. It's certainly not optimal, I guess,

111
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,320
is the point. No, and it was much more challenging than I had seen it in the late 70s and early 80s.

112
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,520
What changed? Is the reduction in grant? The competitiveness of the grant environment or?

113
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,720
No, it wasn't so much the grant environment. It was more the regulation and the paperwork

114
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,160
that was imposed mostly on the clinical side. I need to be fair and say I was both running from

115
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,640
something and running to something. As a physician scientist, the goal is to have each of them

116
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,760
contribute to the other and translational medicine, which was a new concept around the turn of the

117
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,480
millennium, was growing and was perfect for somebody like me. The Vardis Institutes was

118
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,000
created by Mark Fishman in the early 2000s as a new concept and a new approach to drug development,

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,480
thinking about pathway biology. They were building translational medicine departments and Tim

120
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,640
recruited me to lead the musculoskeletal one. Maybe explain to folks the difference between

121
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,280
basic science, clinical science or clinical research and translational research, which,

122
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,600
as you said, the latter there being a relatively recent phenomenon.

123
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,920
Lots of examples of basic science. One that's pretty exciting and has led to Nobel Prizes

124
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,000
is the study of restriction enzymes. Who thought that studying obscure bacteria and how they limit

125
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,080
their infection by viruses might have led to the concept of restriction enzymes, which was required

126
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,160
for the development of modern molecular biology. Another one of basic science. You've probably

127
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,280
talked about CRISPR technology here. We have a dedicated podcast to it and I'd love to get

128
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,080
Jennifer on to do so, but please continue. Yeah, that's a great example. I'll give you a one-minute

129
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:39,760
summary. It is another critical element of the bacterial immune system. It's simple, it's elegant,

130
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,520
it's powerful and there were scientists in Europe studying fermentation for yogurt and cheese.

131
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:56,480
And they discovered CRISPR, Jennifer Doudna and colleagues here, MIT and the Broad Institute. And

132
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,560
they were studying basic science. They were studying bacterial biology and it became so exciting

133
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,520
when somebody translated the biochemistry, if you will, in the bacteria to see what it

134
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,400
worked in humans. Who would have thought that would work? Bacterial chromatin, the DNA is so

135
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,120
different, it's supercoiled in a bacterial cell whereas human DNA is organized into chromatin

136
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:33,200
and methylated, but it did. So the point here is basic science isn't necessarily in pursuit of

137
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,880
anything beyond knowledge, but it doesn't come with the caveat of this needs to have a clinical

138
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,440
application with respect to the species of interest. Exactly right. Clinical medicine,

139
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,160
I think everybody knows, it's getting your flu shot in the fall, it's being told the diet and

140
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,600
exercise and take your antihypertenses if they've been prescribed. Right, does taking this medication

141
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,360
lower your risk of a stroke? Does taking this vaccine lower your risk of getting the flu?

142
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Exactly. And translational medicine... There's a big gap between those two, isn't there? Yes,

143
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,440
and that's what translational medicine does. People had been doing this for a long time,

144
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,760
but never in an organized and conceptually holistic way, if I could say that. It's,

145
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,480
how do you take a basic science observation and make something useful for human health out of it

146
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:40,720
and prove it, which is surprisingly challenging. So you're saying that basically up until roughly

147
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,240
20 years ago, this hasn't been particularly well organized, and now pharma companies, among others,

148
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,760
are saying we'd like to own some of this risk. I think everybody has bought into the concept of

149
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,320
translational medicine now. Probably all big pharma companies and many small ones do it.

150
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,680
Many academic institutions have organizations to do translational medicine. It's in part our

151
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,720
responsibility, it's in part a way to do it more efficiently by providing appropriate training and

152
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,960
experience to younger scientists. We always have to think back to who's funding our basic science,

153
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,960
especially in academia. Ultimately, it's the people. Most heavily taxpayer funded. Yes,

154
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:32,000
it's most heavily taxpayer funded, and the reason they're doing it is to make their lives better,

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,880
or the lives of their family and friends better, and we need to be better at that, and I think

156
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,760
this is taking a step in that direction. So what was the first translational problem then you

157
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,560
began to work on when you joined Novartis in the, what would have been I guess the 90s, right?

158
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,920
It was in the early 2000s, so I joined a musculoskeletal program at the time Novartis was working on,

159
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,040
it was a regenerative medicine concept in musculoskeletal biology to increase bone density and

160
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,920
increase muscle strength, and so we had to put together some programs that would translate some

161
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,280
basic biology observations from human genetics. Remember translation can go both ways, and in fact

162
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,200
to skip ahead a little bit, we actually did that from that 2014 paper. We took what we learned there

163
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:28,640
and went back into the mouse, and there were a few projects. The one that has been successful

164
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:36,160
is a drug called zolidronic acid to increase bone density. And what was the state of assets that you

165
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,560
came into? Did Novartis already have a basic program that had shown some new insight with

166
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,280
respect to biology that could then be extrapolated into a compound? Did they already have the compound?

167
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:57,200
What was the actual program you were creating? At that time Novartis worked very much like most

168
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,720
other pharmaceutical companies did. There was a basic science department led by PhD scientists,

169
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,880
there was a clinical development organization led by clinical developers including MDs,

170
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,720
and there was a throw it over the wall mentality. The scientists make something that they like,

171
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,240
then they throw it over to the clinical scientists and they have to figure out what to do with it.

172
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,640
This is pre-IND? Yes. Okay, we should explain what an IND is I suppose. Yeah, do you want to tell

173
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,520
folks about that? Sure. So an IND stands for investigational new drug, and this is the

174
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,240
application that sponsors make to the FDA to get permission to begin clinical trials.

175
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:48,480
And there are a whole raft of requirements that are necessary in terms of quality manufacturing,

176
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,480
clinical plans, risks and benefits, experiments and so forth, so that we can make it as safe as

177
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,520
possible to test something new in people. But in any event that's the way Novartis worked is they

178
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,680
separated research from clinical development. Other companies did it a little differently. They

179
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,440
had the initial testing in healthy volunteers or the initial testing in patients depending on the

180
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,480
risk-benefit argument as part of the research organization. But in principle it's the same

181
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,640
thing. You had scientists making medicines and then clinicians testing them. The goal of

182
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
translational medicine is to provide clinical input right at the very beginning of the process,

183
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,920
even when you're thinking about what to do. And it really helps to focus the drug development

184
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,560
process on the patients and the clinical need right from the beginning so that ultimately the

185
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,120
drug that's made is the drug that's needed. Not let's make something and figure out what we can

186
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,040
do with it. Let's figure out what we need and then make it. Is there evidence by the way this is a bit

187
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:56,880
of a tangent but that that transition has rendered pharma more efficient at yielding capital?

188
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,920
This is studied in an anonymized fashion by an industry organization. It varies by company.

189
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,720
I see. So let's fast forward a little bit to the first time you became involved in

190
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,280
a molecule that would be involved in a nutrient sensing pathway. What was your foray into that?

191
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
There's a step before that and that is how did I get from musculoskeletal disease

192
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,560
to something new. We have to credit again Mark Fishman who was the founder of the Novartis

193
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,120
Institutes for this because he challenged me and a few others to put together an organization within

194
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,080
the company and answer the question what aren't we doing that we should be doing and then start

195
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,960
some projects. And again it's all about medical need and of course scientific tractability.

196
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,840
So we started that project. We called it the new indication discovery unit. What year is this

197
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:03,840
roughly? Mid-2000? This would have been about 2008 or 2009. We basically applied those principles,

198
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,040
a real medical need, a problem that's scientifically tractable and that Novartis wasn't working on an

199
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,600
ideally that nobody was working on. And we ended up with a few very interesting areas.

200
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,880
Joan Manick who was the first author on that 2014 paper brought the idea forward. Well maybe

201
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,160
the biology of aging is tractable but how do we actually make a medicine and develop it?

202
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,040
That was Joan at Novartis at this time? Yeah she joined our group in part to do this.

203
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,600
Her real innovation beyond just the ideas that she figured out a way to

204
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,440
test a medicine that could alter the biology of aging in humans and find an endpoint that's

205
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,880
measurable and modifiable in a reasonable time frame. Which really is the Achilles heel of aging

206
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,200
research which is the ultimate outcome is virtually unmeasurable in the species of interest.

207
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,520
Yes so our approach is not necessarily what you might read in the popular press about making

208
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:19,600
medicines for aging. Our approach is to address serious aging associated diseases and if we're

209
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,400
successful the side effect will be longevity. Yeah so keep going then. Now Joan floats this idea

210
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,920
which is here's a really good proxy for aging that can be measured out in a time course that's

211
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,320
clinically tractable and also frankly amenable to the type of research that we can do in humans.

212
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,240
And so what was your aha moment? This is interesting. This is interesting to Lloyd.

213
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,720
I needed and beyond interesting to Lloyd we then as a team had to persuade the rest of the

214
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,760
organization hey let's try this idea and again we always come back to the medical need,

215
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,560
scientific tractability and in proposing a project what's the evidence that it's going to be successful

216
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:13,520
and you know as well as anybody there's substantial scientific data that mTOR inhibition will

217
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,200
extend health span in many preclinical species certainly all the ones that have been tested.

218
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,400
Now that was not obvious in 2008. I mean 2009 people had been speculating and of course there

219
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,520
was a major publication that came out in 2009. I have to correct the time frame. We started our

220
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,680
new indication discovery unit in 2008 or 9. I think Joan started the project in 2010. Got it.

221
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,440
So you already had a very important study behind you as a catalyst for that. Let's take a step

222
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,600
back now and explain because it's been a while and there's going to be people listening who

223
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,880
don't recall all the details of our discussion with David Sabatini and with Matt Kaberlin.

224
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,920
Let's talk about what is mTOR. Sure well I can't add anything to David Sabatini about what mTOR is.

225
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,760
Nobody can but let's assume people have not heard what David has to say. Sure. In a nutshell,

226
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,680
mTOR is the master integrator of external availability of nutrients and growth factors

227
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,240
and then is the master regulator of the outputs of that integration deciding whether

228
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,560
cells are going to make proteins, make lipids, make nucleic acids grow or are we going to circle the

229
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:36,080
wagons, conserve resources, recycle and wait during times of little for hopefully future times of

230
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,360
plenty. So that's the role of mTOR. So it takes a bunch of signals which are external to the cell

231
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,960
ultimately become internal to the cell because mTOR is in the cell not out of the cell. It

232
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,760
assimilates and integrates across that signal and makes decisions that lead to, as you said,

233
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,800
at the risk of oversimplifying grow or don't grow. Yes I think that's exactly right. The signals it

234
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:11,600
takes are amino acids, glucose, cellular energy, growth factors from other parts of the organism

235
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,720
as probably the major ones and then decides are there sufficient resources that the cell

236
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,960
should grow or not. And between, this is just a little history lesson for the listener, sort of

237
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,920
between 1991 when Hall first identified what was not called at the time TOR but what would go on

238
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:38,160
to become TOR in yeast and 94 when Sabatini identifies it in mammals, you basically had

239
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,400
some of the just the heaviest hitters in biology all sort of converging on this idea which is

240
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,280
this is a really ubiquitous thing that has been preserved across about a billion years of

241
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,360
evolution with very little change. You don't see that every day in biology. Why is that relevant?

242
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,360
The simplest argument is that things that have been conserved from single-cell organisms to

243
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,320
us are probably important. There's some interesting comparative zoology that's relevant to mTOR here.

244
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,880
If you think about where in the cell mTOR lives, it's active on something called a lysosome

245
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,800
and that is a structure in the cells that's responsible for breaking down either cellular

246
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,960
material or material that's been acquired from outside the cell into its component elements

247
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,240
that then could be recycled like amino acids and sugars and so forth. Very early in development,

248
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,800
well in evolutionary biology when there were single-celled organisms and then the early

249
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:53,360
multiple cellular organisms, the way that the organism ate was by creating a vacuole

250
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,520
from whatever was on the outside and then creating a lysosome. So we can sort of picture this

251
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,120
endocytotic process as the cell membrane or wall depending on what if it's eukaryotic or

252
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,680
prokaryotic, sort of sucks in a little bit which creates basically a space and then the outer parts

253
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,760
of that wall reach up, reach around it and can actually seal and now you've created like a vacuole

254
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,520
that you pull into the cell. Yes and in the early multicellular organisms there were specialized

255
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,440
cells for doing this and they were called phagocytes for eating cells. Later on it was

256
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,000
learned that phagocytes could also serve an immunologic role, in other words that they could

257
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,680
eat pathogens as well as nutrients. This happened in the late 1800s when higher quality microscopes

258
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,760
were available. A Russian scientist named Ilya Mechnikov did a lot of the pioneering work on this.

259
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,200
He was working in Paris and he described, he was an embryologist and comparative zoologist,

260
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,800
and he described by looking at small animals that were completely transparent so he could see all

261
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,080
the cells inside and what they were doing. He actually imaged them while they were alive and

262
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,440
he could watch them eat and he could watch them fight bacterial infections and he was the major

263
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,600
champion of something called cellular immunity. At the same time some German scientists, notably

264
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,160
Paul Ehrlich, were working on what we now understand as antibodies and they said no it's

265
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,920
humoral immunity or soluble immunity in your blood and they had the cellular immunologists

266
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,080
in Paris and we had the humoral immunologists in Germany. Eventually they figured out they were

267
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,160
both right and they both got the Nobel Prize in 1908. But this is why mTOR is probably on

268
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:54,080
a lysosomal vacuole because in the context of evolutionary development it was on these vacuoles

269
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,000
that very simplest organisms use to ingest food and nutrients. And so you want to have it close to,

270
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,360
because it's there to sense those things, you want to have it very close to where they enter the cell.

271
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes, exactly. So if we take a given eukaryotic cell today, take one of our cells, how many mTOR

272
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,480
complexes would exist in a cell? What order of magnitude? I'd turf that question to David

273
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,560
Sabatini. I don't think I've ever asked David that question. I don't know. I would guess it

274
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:33,440
would be on the order of thousands, not millions, not tens. So one of the other things that David's

275
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,720
done is not just recognizing this in mammals but also recognizing that mTOR, which again,

276
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,920
it's one of those things that's funny when you start to explain it to people,

277
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,080
because you can't explain what mTOR is without somewhere explaining what rapamycin is,

278
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:56,000
given the name. mTOR stands for mechanistic target of rapamycin. But David also played the

279
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,200
fundamental role in elucidating that mTOR can be organized in a couple of different ways and

280
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,320
sort of two main different ways it can be organized known as complex one and complex two.

281
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,960
Explain a little bit about what those two mean. How do they organize differently? And

282
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,760
perhaps more importantly, is there a functional difference between those?

283
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,600
Sure. So in yeast, there are two separate TOR proteins, one and two. And in, I think,

284
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,120
all other species, there's just one mTOR protein and it can be assembled into two different

285
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,320
complexes. One of them, or called TORC1, for target of rapamycin complex one,

286
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:42,080
regulates many of the things we've been talking about. So protein synthesis, lipid biosynthesis,

287
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:50,240
protein translation, and so forth. The other complex, TORC2, regulates cytoskeletal,

288
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,720
so in other words, the skeleton of the cells organization, and growth decisions. So different.

289
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:05,120
Now this is sort of interesting. So let's talk about rapamycin now. How does rapamycin interact

290
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,400
with TOR, its target? That's an excellent question because you think about TOR being

291
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,360
the target of rapamycin. It's not exactly. The target of rapamycin is an immunofilin

292
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,880
called FK binding proteins or FKBP. And there's several of these. There's three different classes

293
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,840
of immunofilins. The complex of rapamycin bound to FKBP then binds to the TORC1 complex

294
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:43,520
and inhibits it. And it inhibits it in different ways for different downstream targets. The one

295
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,560
that's most commonly measured is something called phospho-S6 kinase, which name's not important,

296
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,720
it's just this is the protein translation pathway. And it's very efficient in inhibiting that.

297
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:05,840
A little less so for another target called 4-EBP1, and even less so for a target called ULK1,

298
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,040
which is involved in activating the cell's recycling machinery called autophagy.

299
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,600
In other words, let's go through that again. So rapamycin binds, and how tightly does it bind,

300
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,560
pretty tightly? So it binds pretty tightly to this binding protein. This binding protein then

301
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,080
moves towards TOR. And in the case of, did we explain Raptor and Richter yet? We haven't

302
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,600
explained those cases. Do you want to spend maybe just a minute so that they can see the difference

303
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,000
between complex 1 and complex 2? So mTOR is present in both TORC1 and TORC2 complex,

304
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,360
but there are proteins that are unique to each complex. So as you were saying, the yeast have

305
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,680
two different TOR. Everything else has the same TOR, but it's another binding protein. It's another

306
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,240
protein bound to it that creates the distinction between complex 1 and 2, correct? Exactly. And we

307
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,840
should qualify every organism we looked at as only one mTOR. I'm sure we haven't looked at all of them.

308
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:12,480
So Raptor and Richter, again discovered in David Sabatini's group, Raptor is unique to TORC1 complex,

309
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,640
and Richter is unique to the TORC2 complex. And they're covalently bound to TOR? I don't think

310
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,400
it's covalent. Okay. So it's some sort of conformational configuration, but not necessarily?

311
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,560
Well, it's a multi-subunit complex, but I think they bind on the basis of having a fairly large

312
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:39,280
surface of interaction, not covalent. And then the complex, to get back to the FKBP of FKBP plus

313
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,360
Rapamycin, then binds to the TORC1 complex and inhibits it. But again, it inhibits it very well

314
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,160
for some of the downstream pathways and not so well for some of the others. And let's review,

315
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,800
again, those three. So the first one that binds really well, the serine phosphate, is which one?

316
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:07,360
There's the binding interaction of the Rapamycin FKBP to TORC1. Yes. And then that alters the TORC1

317
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,360
downstream activity. It inhibits quite effectively phosphorylation of S6 kinase.

318
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,920
S6 is a critical protein in the ribosome required for protein translation. It works a little less

319
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:29,120
well for a protein called 4-EBP1, which is an inhibitor of protein translation. So you inhibit

320
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:37,280
the inhibitor and you activate protein translation. And it's less effective at phosphorylating ULK

321
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:44,160
1, which is an early step in the activation of the cell recycling machinery called autophagy.

322
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:53,200
The interpretation of that is as following. Rapamycin is a strong inhibitor of making new

323
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,000
protein and a modest activator of autophagy. Exactly. Is that a fair statement? Yeah,

324
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,440
I think that's a fair statement. We're talking about these pathways as specific examples.

325
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,520
Remember, TORC1 does other things too, particularly in terms of regulation of lipid synthesis,

326
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:21,360
pyrimidine synthesis. Pyrimidines are part of DNA. What about mTORC2? So how does RAPA and FKBP

327
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,160
bind to mTORC2? I don't think it does directly because there's no immediate effect of the

328
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,360
complex on TORC2 activity. If you look at the downstream targets, they're not affected in the

329
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,320
short term. There's a longer term feedback inhibition of TORC2. And is that more due to

330
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,960
the failure to resynthesize enough TOR? Is there a shortfall of TOR because so much of the TOR is

331
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,480
bound to the RAPA FKBP complex that you now run out of enough TOR to make mTOR complex too?

332
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,560
You could imagine that is one possibility, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's more

333
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,400
there's a feedback signaling pathway that down regulates TORC2. What you said is very important,

334
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,320
and we're going to come back to it in great detail, but there's something temporal about this,

335
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:18,240
isn't there? Yes. Do we know how much exposure to rapamycin or a rapalog is necessary,

336
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,160
constitutive exposure, before you start to see this dual prong of inhibition? Are we talking about

337
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:32,000
a day, two days, three days, a month? I know you had David Sinclair on recently. Yeah. And I listened

338
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,520
to your talk with him. He talks about mouse experiments. My bias is to talk about people

339
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:45,280
experiments, given my role. In humans, after a week to a month, you can start to see consequences

340
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,680
of TORC2 inhibition with a rapalog alone, and it's reflected in hyperglycemia and hyperdruglyceridemia.

341
00:34:53,680 --> 00:35:00,720
So biomarkers in the peripheral blood, you can measure. Why is it that inhibition of mTORC2

342
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,400
leads to that phenotype you just described? I don't think we know exactly. Is it confirmed

343
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,000
that that phenotype exists in healthy volunteers? In other words, we see this for sure in patients

344
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,240
who take rapamycin or its analogs in the context of organ transplantation, but if we took

345
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,600
non-diabetic, non-immunocompromised, quote unquote, as normal as possible subjects,

346
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,880
do we have evidence that those things happen? We do. MTOR inhibitors, well, rapalog specifically,

347
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:41,040
have been tested in non-transplant, non-malignant disease patients. Some specific examples include

348
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,040
the rapalog RAD001 was tested in patients with polycystic kidney disease. These people are

349
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,240
basically well, except for that renal disease. And even in those patients, there were a substantial

350
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,600
fraction who saw these biochemical changes in their blood. Now, not everybody gets it. We don't

351
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:08,160
understand that either. Do we know what the dose equivalence was of RAD001 versus rapamycin? In

352
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,960
other words, they were getting it daily. Do you recall at what dose did you start to see this

353
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,320
consequence? That was a phase three study. It's published so you could look it up. If I recall,

354
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,120
the dose was 10 milligrams a day and I think they had an opportunity to decrease the dose to 5

355
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:34,160
milligrams if it wasn't tolerated. Is RAD001 identical to rapamycin in dosing? What's the

356
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,320
dose equivalence? Again, it's hard to do an exact dose equivalence because the biochemistry of how

357
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,480
exactly the complex works with the mTORC complex is a little different. But if your rapamycin dose

358
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:54,400
is somewhere between 2 and 8 milligrams a day, roughly, at the immunosuppression level of dosing,

359
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,640
which is what we're talking about, that's comparable to 5 to 10 milligrams of RAD001.

360
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,680
Got it. So they're pretty similar, but not identical. Yes. So let's put a bow on this

361
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,400
particular question and then take a step backwards. Is it safe to say that most of the

362
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,080
inhibition of mTORC complex 2 seems to produce things that are not really desirable at all,

363
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:30,800
whereas the output of an mTORC complex 1 inhibition pathway seems quite desirable at least some time?

364
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,080
Yes. And in fact, most genetic experiments have supported that conclusion.

365
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,400
Let's talk a little bit about those experiments. So if you genetically knock out

366
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,840
raptor so that you no longer have complex 1, but you still have mTORC and rictor, so therefore

367
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,280
you have complex 2, what does that animal look like? Depends on how you do it. If you imagine

368
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,320
making a mouse that doesn't have raptor 1, which means it doesn't have

369
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,400
torque complex 1 from conception. I assume it has muscular dystrophy or something like that?

370
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,160
They're embryonic lethal. Yeah. Okay. You need torque 1 for development. So if you just turn it

371
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,440
down by some amount, 50% reduction. Not much of a phenotype of that, but the way the experiments

372
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,800
have been done is you can conditionally knock out a target in a mouse experiment. So you can

373
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:30,240
create an experiment where the mouse is normal and is born and develops normally. And then when the

374
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,680
mouse is a young adult, you can knock out raptor or knock out torque 1. So once they're out of the

375
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,280
development window, then they've reached adult size, then it's better tolerated. Yeah. And again,

376
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,960
David Sabatini has done a lot of these experiments. His group published a nice paper not that long

377
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,280
ago where they knocked out several components of the torque 1 complex. Inhibition of torque 1

378
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,840
extends lifespan and health span and rodents. If you do that to torque 2, it accelerates death.

379
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,280
Such an interesting concept. I mean, because what it basically suggests is at least with the tool

380
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,240
that we currently have to block tor, which is like rapamycin or rapilogue, giving intermittent dosing

381
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,720
may be beneficial. Giving constant dosing may cancel out the benefit. It's hard to know because

382
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,080
when you give it constantly, you're getting the quote unquote good inhibition and the bad inhibition.

383
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,000
You don't know what the net effect is, right? If you're using a rapilogue with continuous

384
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,440
administration, yes, you'll eventually down regulate torque 2 as well. And as far as we know,

385
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:46,000
that's not favorable. There are some other ways to do this. And Joan Mannock's second paper from 2018

386
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,520
was the first time we've explored that in humans. I want to come back to the 2018 paper, but I want

387
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:58,400
to build up to the 2014 paper. In 2009, this mouse study comes out. It was the first of what

388
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:06,080
would become a series of very interesting, highly reproduced ITPs funded by NIH that sort of did

389
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,680
something we didn't typically see, which is consistently across multiple labs and across

390
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,200
different strains show the same result. A lot of times in biology, you just don't get that. You get

391
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,120
the one hit wonder and it doesn't work in any other model or in any other lab. And that's not

392
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:29,760
because people were nefarious. It's just there's some very, very particular niche sort of circumstances

393
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,920
that are being exploited that we don't even understand. That didn't seem to be the case in

394
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:41,920
rapamycin. On a personal level, by 2009, I am now very interested in this compound, but I don't know

395
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,440
what to make of it because I remember being a resident at the hospital giving lots of serolimus,

396
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,640
a rapamune, to transplant patients along with their prednisone and their other immunosuppressive

397
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,880
drugs. And there didn't seem to be anything about that that seemed to be longevity producing. It

398
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,080
didn't make sense that you could suppress the immune system and somehow reduce death. It seemed

399
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,640
counterintuitive. I mean, in the transplant patient, it made sense because of course their

400
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,200
greatest risk is by far organ rejection, but these animal studies were not replicating that.

401
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,080
So I remember being incredibly confused for about the next five years. How did you guys

402
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,720
start thinking about that problem inside Novartis?

403
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,040
Joan proposed the idea, and again, the real innovation was being able to recognize

404
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,920
that I'm doing air quotes for the listeners age of the immune system is something that's

405
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,760
measurable and potentially modifiable in a reasonable timeframe. And we had that

406
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:58,480
paper from Chen in Science Cell Signaling that showed a short course of a rapologue

407
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
could alter the biology of lymphocytes.

408
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,440
And you're saying that in a favorable way, not a disfavorable way.

409
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,320
Yes.

410
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Because the earliest observations of Serensegal were that lymphocytes being highly proliferative

411
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,000
were heavily targeted by rapamycin.

412
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,520
It's all about the dose.

413
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,840
Yeah. So let's talk about those doses. As you alluded to earlier, a transplant patient

414
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,720
might be taking five milligrams a day of rapamycin, day in and day out.

415
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,960
What types of doses were you seeing that were producing this counterintuitive phenotype?

416
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,240
Well, if we get back to the mouse paper.

417
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,840
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like lower or higher, I guess is what I'm saying relative to that.

418
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,560
It's hard to compare is you have to look at exposures. So the doses on a weight basis

419
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,560
or a body surface are much higher in a rodent experiment, but the exposures can be comparable.

420
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,160
They were actually fairly high in his paper. They were at least equal to what we use in

421
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,440
transplant. Obviously, we couldn't do that in healthy volunteers, especially healthy

422
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,920
elderly volunteers. There was some additional information that gave us some confidence we

423
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,480
could use much lower doses than what was used in transplant patients, yielding much lower exposures.

424
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,600
And for the listeners, exposures means how much of the drug is actually in your body over time.

425
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,720
So let's use Cialis as an example of this. I don't know why, but it's just I was talking to

426
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,000
a patient about this the other day. Cialis is typically given as either five milligrams or 20

427
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,280
milligrams. And patients typically have a choice if they want to take 20 milligrams, quote unquote,

428
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,880
on demand. So you're heading into the weekend, you're going away with your wife. It's Friday,

429
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:01,120
you take the 20 milligrams of Cialis and erectile dysfunction is ameliorated Friday through Sunday.

430
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,680
Conversely, another way to take Cialis is to take five milligrams every single day, whether or not

431
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,520
you're going to be sexually active or not. But now all of a sudden, any time you want to be sexually

432
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,800
active, you're functionally like that person who just took 20. Use the lingo of exposure to explain

433
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,280
how those two things are comparable. I don't know why this is somehow the first example that

434
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,400
came to my mind, but probably just because it was a discussion I had two days ago.

435
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,360
It's actually a good example because when you take the medicine, doesn't always reflect if the

436
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,400
medicine is in your body or not. And medicines that work have to be in your body to work.

437
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:49,440
So the five milligram dose of Cialis taken once might be in your body for a day. A 20 milligram

438
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,240
dose of Cialis taken once is in your body for two to three days. So it's why the higher dose

439
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:03,840
taken once can last over the even long weekend perhaps, because it's still there. This we call

440
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,760
in drug development a half-life of the drug. So the half-life of Cialis is long enough that it can

441
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,120
do that. But there's not the case for Viagra, for example. That's right. Now there's another

442
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,720
interesting thing here, which will also be another, will have a parallel to the Rapa story, which is

443
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,160
generally patients will tolerate five milligrams daily of Cialis more than 20 milligrams on demand

444
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,440
because of the side effects. You have fewer side effects because you don't have the same peak levels.

445
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,840
So five milligrams daily will produce a very consistent and narrow gap between peak and trough,

446
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:48,640
which is therapeutic, whereas 20 will overshoot. You'll get a very high peak level, which may

447
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,400
increase the side effects, lightheadedness, changes in vision, things like that. And then you have a

448
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,160
long enough way down before you hit trough. And it's during that entire window that you have

449
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,440
the availability of the effect of the drug. Now that's true for the class of drugs. The

450
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,320
phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Yeah, B5 inhibitors. It's not true for other drugs. Two specific

451
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:18,480
examples, Rapamycin, where if you remember when you were treating your transplant patients,

452
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,560
you measured trough levels. We measured, yeah, daily. I mean, we were constantly doing this.

453
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,160
But you measured the trough levels, not the peak levels. That's right. Because the side effects are

454
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,240
driven by the trough levels as well as the efficacy. And I think that's also true with

455
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,840
gentamycin and a lot of the antibiotics that have the same toxicities on the trough, right?

456
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:42,880
Yes. So gentamycin, years ago, we used to dose three times a day. And modern times we dose it

457
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:50,000
once a day and we get better efficacy and far fewer side effects. So why is that the case? That

458
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,240
a drug like gentamycin or Rapamycin is producing toxicity by its nadir, not its peak.

459
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,720
Every drug is different and it depends on the specific mechanism for gentamycin

460
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:11,440
and immunoglycosides in general. Remember these work on the bacterial ribosome and there's some

461
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:19,280
congruency between mitochondrial ribosomes and bacterial ribosomes. And with sustained inhibition

462
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,920
that can cause toxicity, particularly in the kidney and the tubular epithelial cells, also in

463
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,840
interior hair cells and some other places. So having some drug-free time seems to allow the

464
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,400
organelles to recover. At least that's the hypothesis I heard in medical school. We all

465
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,320
know that half of what we learned in medical school is wrong and they just weren't sure which half.

466
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,560
You had a better medical school than me. I think 90% of what I learned in medical school is wrong.

467
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,320
But you went to Harvard. I only went to Stanford. So I think that's the West Coast, East Coast

468
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,520
difference. No, I think that's, I mean, to me, that is the most logical argument, which is

469
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,840
drugs that have trough toxicity are drugs where you must have a break from the drug.

470
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,160
And the higher the trough, the lower the probability of a break. Peak drugs aren't

471
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,360
about time away. It's literally too much of this thing eventually hits a trigger.

472
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,360
That's probably an oversimplification, but it's a useful conceptual framework.

473
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:21,200
So let's now taking that model back, the first glimmer of hope that this drug had

474
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,080
wasn't uniformly immune suppressing was, yeah, what if we dose this lower, basically? And not

475
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,960
from the standpoint of side effects, because that's a common reason you'd go lower, but actually

476
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,760
change the profile of inhibition. Was it known at the time that that's what they were trying to do?

477
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:49,200
Like, did they have enough insight into how rapamycin bound to the two different complexes to

478
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,040
test this hypothesis proactively? Or was this more empirical an observation that after the fact,

479
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,960
the mechanism became elucidated? We had some information up front. One bit of information

480
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,280
that the mechanism could be favorable for immune function, not solely immunosuppressive,

481
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,200
was looking again in your transplant patients at those who were on a calcium ion inhibitor versus

482
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:20,720
those who were on a rapilogue. And there was a significant trend that those on rapilogues had

483
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,000
fewer cytomegalovirus infections than those on calcium ion inhibitors, all of the things being

484
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,920
equal. An observational study, not as well controlled as ideally we would like, but

485
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,120
it was intriguing. Do you remember the order of magnitude on that difference? So you're

486
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:45,280
basically talking about FK 506 versus? Cyclosporine. Yeah. Well, it was rapamycin versus

487
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:52,480
cyclosporine or FK. Maybe I don't remember. We'd have to go back and look. So that was item one.

488
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:03,040
Item two is we had done exposure response experiments in cellular systems, looking at

489
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,040
how much drug is required to inhibit the downstream targets of torque one. And it was

490
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:18,000
much, much lower than the exposures that are observed in the usual dosing framework of

491
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,040
rapamycin, at least for transplant and immunosuppression. If we were going to be treating

492
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,760
healthy people with a rapilogue and test whether their immune function was better, we couldn't be

493
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,040
giving them a typical rapilogue side effect. And this is again, a critical element of the

494
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:43,760
translational medicine that Joan did in order to make this proposal is what doses and what schedule

495
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,440
would be required to keep the trough levels actually less than assay, which would be as

496
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:58,720
safe as we could get it, plus nonetheless achieve adequate exposures to at least partially or

497
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,640
temporarily fully inhibit torque one. That would let us ask the question.

498
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,960
Let's now pause for a moment to explain we've switched back and forth between the term

499
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,760
rapamycin and rapilogue. So again, a little bit of a history lesson, but rapamycin

500
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:21,280
is the name given by Seren Segal to the compound identified on Easter Island. That

501
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,120
went through two companies before being eventually absorbed by Pfizer through Wyeth.

502
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:36,240
And that was a drug named rapamune or cerolamis. And that was FDA approved in 1999

503
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,280
for transplantation. What was the first rapilogue to come along?

504
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,240
Arguably, it's rapamycin. The next drug...

505
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,280
Yeah, sorry, semantics aside. After rapamune, rapamycin, cerolamis, we're talking about the

506
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,360
experiment that we're about to discuss in detail is using a different molecule.

507
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,400
It's using a different molecule. We called it RAD001 in the paper. The generic name is

508
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,240
everolamis. It was the second one. Temcerolamis is another one.

509
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,040
How does it differ from rapamune or cerolamis?

510
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,800
There's small structural changes.

511
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,960
And it was synthesized to be different versus discovered in nature or was it deliberately

512
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,000
modified, presumably?

513
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,720
Yes. Again, to improve the properties of the compound.

514
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,200
Has that borne out? I mean, obviously there's an IP reason one would do that, obviously. But

515
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,000
in terms of clinical efficacy, are there differences?

516
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm not aware of any comparative studies. In vitro, potency seems to be a little greater.

517
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,560
I can tell you from firsthand experience looking at the cost of these drugs,

518
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,400
there certainly is a difference. Good Lord!

519
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,800
Yes, it's generic versus brand, I think, at this point still.

520
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,760
But even rapamune branded compared to...

521
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,480
But anyway.

522
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
I am not somebody who can talk about drug costs.

523
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,800
Yeah, yeah. No, well, it's one of the most comical things I've ever seen, actually.

524
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,680
So let's now talk about this experiment. I'll tell you from my vantage point the day I'll

525
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:14,160
never forget, which is I remember getting an embargoed copy on the day before Christmas.

526
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,800
So it's Wednesday, December 24th. It's probably noon.

527
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,400
It's funny, I was in my office, which is dumb. Why was I in my office at noon on Wednesday,

528
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,320
the day before Christmas? I certainly shouldn't have been, but I remember being in my office

529
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,440
and I remember how sunny it was. I remember what a beautiful day it was and I remember

530
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,160
someone from the New York Times emailing me the embargoed copy and it's embargoed.

531
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,920
Yeah, it was embargoed for another couple of hours.

532
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,000
The person at the time she sent it to me knew how interested I was in the subject matter.

533
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,240
And I'm reading this thing and I'm like, this is unbelievable. I just couldn't believe what I was

534
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,640
reading. And I have a background in immunology, so of course I can understand what these figures

535
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,440
are showing. Give people a sense of how long it takes to get there. So if the public is first

536
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,320
seeing this in December of 2014, when did the experiment start? And I didn't mean that

537
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,360
conceptually. I don't just mean you're enrolling patients. This is about a four or five-year journey,

538
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,400
right? That's right. About 2010 we started.

539
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,200
So what was the hypothesis that you wanted to test and that you, Joan, and the team wanted to test?

540
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,160
There was some pre-work before we could ask the question. The pre-work was one, we reviewed

541
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,920
the existing literature, especially that paper from Chen. And we then looked at some other work

542
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:37,680
that had looked at drug levels in cellular systems necessary to partially or fully inhibit

543
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,360
the target. And we had to look at a lot of different cells because Torq1's biology,

544
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:51,280
while in the big picture is the same in different cells, the sensitivity of the complex to the drug

545
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:58,720
is different in different cells. And we have some hypotheses now for why that is. And we then did

546
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,680
some modeling to understand whether the low doses, and we looked at internal data that

547
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,720
the company had to see, could we come up with a low dose and a schedule that would

548
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:17,760
yield exposures in people that would partially or fully inhibit Torq1, yet give

549
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,160
less than assay trough levels to help ensure safety in the healthy volunteers.

550
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:31,440
Now, Lloyd, was this mostly because at the time you wanted to see if it even made sense to pursue

551
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,360
a new molecule entirely that would inhibit complex one or so-called selective inhibition,

552
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:43,280
but the idea is why go down that path of doing that without a proof of concept that says it works?

553
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,920
Or did you think at that point in time, if we can get this to work, you would never need a

554
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,160
selective mTORQ1 inhibitor? You're asking really for Novartis thinking that's probably still

555
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,880
confidential, but the big picture is we want to know if something works. We want to figure out if

556
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,520
we can make it better. Again, ultimately, Novartis, we at RestoreBio, and hopefully everybody at a

557
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,160
pharmaceutical company is thinking about how can we make patients' lives better, and then everything

558
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,680
else is important but secondary to that. And then what do we measure? What dose do we use?

559
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,520
How frequently do we give it? How long do we treat people? How do we answer the question clearly? What

560
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,000
do we measure? All of those questions had to be answered, and they had to be answered before

561
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,240
Joan brought the program to the decision board of the company to say,

562
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,200
give us a lot of money to do this experiment. Each of these clinical experiments costs millions of

563
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,800
dollars. And at the time, RAD001 was FDA approved for another indication or no? Yes. It was already

564
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:56,000
approved in cancer or in? I think it was in renal cell. RCC? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that only raises

565
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,760
the stakes of what you're asking because you're taking a drug that's already gone through phase

566
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,920
three, and you're going to spend a lot of money on it that you technically don't need to spend.

567
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,800
Is that a common thing to do inside of a company as large as Novartis to take a

568
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,440
drug that basically you're trying to make the case for a totally different use?

569
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:22,720
Yes. I suspect most companies do things like this, where when a drug is registered in one indication,

570
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:29,280
if you can find others, it's a good thing. So, I mean, for the sake of time, I will just,

571
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,600
I mean, basically say that you guys did something kind of amazing, which is with so little human

572
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:45,920
data, you did a great job of identifying the right patient population, identifying the right primary

573
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,960
outcome, identifying a correct power analysis so you wouldn't miss the signal. So in other words,

574
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,400
you didn't know how to power the study, which means you had to have a sense of how much the

575
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:03,280
benefit was going to be, knowing how long to pulse, how to dose. I mean, this could have gone sideways

576
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,640
six other ways. It could have. We had some additional help too. At the time, Novartis had

577
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:18,080
a vaccines group and they had commercialized a flu vaccine. So we knew a lot about flu vaccination

578
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,520
and responses required for making a clinical difference and so forth.

579
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,480
So let's walk people through the study design. You've got what, about 300 people

580
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:36,640
aged 60 plus more or less? I think it was 218 in that 214 paper. Everybody was over 65,

581
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,920
no unstable medical conditions. Were these subjects all in Australia? Was there something

582
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,640
about this that was in Australia? Well, because this was a flu vaccination, so let's just skip

583
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,800
ahead. The endpoint to the study, the primary endpoint by which we were going to decide, did

584
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,720
the study work or not work, was the response to a flu vaccination, the seasonal flu. Now,

585
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,760
because it's a seasonal vaccine, we had to do the study when we were ready, wherever in the world

586
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,480
people were about to get their flu vaccines. In that paper, we were ready for the Southern

587
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,960
Hemisphere because our summer is there winter. Right. And since the CVS and the Antarctica

588
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,920
ran out of vaccine that year, Australia made the most sense. Australia and New Zealand. Yeah.

589
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,680
So there are four arms in this study. There's a placebo arm that gets just obviously a placebo.

590
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:35,120
There's three treatment arms, one that gets 0.5 milligrams of RAD001 daily. So ever all of us.

591
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,560
There's a group that's getting five milligrams once a week, and there's a group that's getting

592
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:47,840
20 milligrams once a week. So it's a clever design because the five and the 20 that are

593
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:53,120
both getting it once a week gives you a great, you get to answer both efficacy and toxicity questions

594
00:59:53,120 --> 01:00:01,840
as they pertain to that dose. The 0.5 daily versus the five weekly is your closest aggregate dose

595
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:06,720
where you get to see is there a difference in trough. So overall, a lot of interesting stuff.

596
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,160
What was your personal null hypothesis? Not necessarily the same, but do you recall what

597
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:19,360
your null hypothesis was going into that experiment? I mean, obviously the null hypothesis is that

598
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,520
there's no drug effect. Yeah, sorry. What was your first alternative hypothesis? I guess it's

599
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,280
a better way to say it. This was a little bit less hypothesis testing the way that academic

600
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:36,560
investigators work than it was asking questions. And the question was, and there were several,

601
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:43,920
but at a high level, it's can we see an improved vaccine response at an acceptable level of

602
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,040
toxicity that would have this drug make sense? And that's the high level question. And you went

603
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:56,640
through the doses and schedules we used and we tested three different ones because each of those

604
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:03,200
doses did a different thing to torque one inhibition. The 0.5 milligram dose partially

605
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:10,240
inhibited in a sustained fashion. The five milligram once a week fully inhibited torque one

606
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:17,360
for a couple days out of the week. And the 20 milligrams we modeled would fully inhibit torque

607
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:24,160
one over the dosing interval. I didn't realize that actually. 20 is so high that it gave you

608
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:31,680
functionally nonstop inhibition of mTORC1 until your next dose. Did any of these have mTORC2

609
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,240
inhibition? I would have expected the 20 milligram would have. I don't remember that anyone had to

610
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,800
discontinue the drug for that reason, but it's been a couple of years since I read that paper.

611
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,800
Well, let's look at the toxicity table. So table one of this paper, which is again such an

612
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,360
interesting paper, I was surprised. Obviously it was the first thing I looked at. Usually table

613
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,520
one is inclusion criteria or something like that, but you guys just skipped the foreplay and went

614
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:01,200
right to it. Table one, incidence of treatment related adverse effects. I wish I could honestly

615
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,960
say I remember how I read this the very first time because I've looked at it a number of times

616
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:11,440
since. But what's interesting is I certainly remember seeing that the placebo group had

617
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,600
21 adverse events. So that's important to always keep in mind when you look at clinical studies

618
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,920
is there's just a baseline level of adverse effects that have no bearing on the drug whatsoever.

619
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:30,080
So it's almost like you could subtract 21 out of all of the others to get a sense of what the noise

620
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:37,440
is. So the group that got 0.5 daily had 35 adverse effects and each of the treatment groups had about

621
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,360
the same number. So I mean there were 53 groups in each of the three arms, 59 in the placebo. So

622
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:49,520
the 21 you might discount that slightly, but it basically went from 35 to 46 to 109. So

623
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:54,240
at this point, obviously this means each patient is having more than one adverse effect likely.

624
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,080
But here's what I found interesting. The next line in the table tells you how many people actually

625
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,080
had adverse effects and not just the total adverse effects. And this was surprisingly

626
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:11,520
constant. So in the placebo group it's 12. In arm one it's 22. In arm two it's 20. In arm three it's

627
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:19,760
27. So looks like 0.5 daily versus five weekly. No real difference in adverse effects. And by the

628
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,640
way, I'm not going to, don't worry, I won't read you guys the whole table here. We're going to link

629
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,400
to this paper in the show notes. The other thing that really stood out to me though in terms of

630
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,400
side effects was mouth ulceration. Now that's the side effect I remembered the most from residency

631
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,240
was the patients getting apathos ulcers with their daily dose of rapamycin. And most of them were

632
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,080
getting more than 0.5 daily. So most of the patients that I wrote, my recollection was that

633
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:53,600
two to four milligrams was a very common daily dose for rapamune. And again, this is rad001. So

634
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:59,840
it's a different vehicle, but it's comparable. And so 0.5 daily would definitely be lower than

635
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:05,280
what I was used to seeing people get. And yet 11.5% of these folks had mouth ulcerations,

636
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:13,440
whereas the people getting 0.5 daily were at 0.5 once a week was about 4%. And 20 once a week

637
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,960
was about 17%. So that's really interesting. I mean that tells a very interesting story about

638
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:25,200
the kinetics of this drug. Was there any other toxicity that surprised you in the study?

639
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,960
Well, as you pointed out, mouth ulcers are one of the more common and fairly specific side effects

640
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,080
for rapilogues. Should we spend one moment explaining why? I think we could certainly

641
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:44,160
speculate why. I don't think anybody knows why there are some hypotheses, but, and it isn't just

642
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:50,640
rapilog associated mouth ulcers. We don't know what causes the ordinary spontaneous

643
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,240
apthas ulcerations that people get. There've been a fair amount of work on it, but nobody knows.

644
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,440
There are a lot of mysteries in medicine and that's just another one of them.

645
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:05,440
Anecdotally, through five years of residency, I don't think I went more than two weeks without

646
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,240
an apthas ulcer. They can be stress related. I'm sure they are. And it was to the point where they

647
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,400
would drive me so bananas, I couldn't even get relief from those sort of topical lidocaine gels.

648
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,120
The only thing that could give me real relief was if I could inject bupivacaine directly into it,

649
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:26,320
because it was such a long acting agent. Lidocaine only lasts an hour or two. That was not going to

650
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,440
do me justice on a call night. And it got to the point where I would sit there and inject bupivacaine

651
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,320
into my tongue or into my mouth. And I remember once somebody walking in the call room while I'm

652
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:41,120
sitting there holding my gums out, jamming bupivacaine in and I'm kidding them. They must

653
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:47,200
have thought I had some drug problem. But two weeks after leaving residency, I never had an

654
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,000
apthas ulcer again. I hope you never have another one. They're very painful. They're unbelievable.

655
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,120
But then of course I did get them once I started rapamycin. So we'll come back to that. But I

656
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,280
certainly went many, many years without them again. My hypothesis was some combination of

657
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,680
stress and sleep deprivation might have played a role. It doesn't help mechanistically though.

658
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,920
We just don't understand them. So overall, I thought the side effects were less than I

659
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,000
would have expected. Let's now talk about the results. I'll actually hand you the table here,

660
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,440
because not that I would ever expect you to remember table 2a, but walk a little bit through

661
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,400
kind of what you guys saw and how you tested it. So you're using a couple of different

662
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,080
flu vaccines, et cetera, a couple of different strains. Yeah. So the standard flu vaccine had

663
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:38,560
in those days, three different antigens for three different kinds of viruses, two

664
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:46,000
influenza A strains, one influenza B strain. And I think as we all know, the flu vaccine is designed

665
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,200
every single year based on the circulating flu strains in Asia to try to match the vaccine

666
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,280
to the strains of flu that we expect to get in this case in the Southern hemisphere

667
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,680
or for us in the Northern hemisphere. So patients were treated with one of those doses of RAD001

668
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:14,000
or a placebo. And the study was randomized, double blind and placebo controlled. So neither

669
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,960
the doctors nor the patients knew who was getting what. And I guess there's one detail I omitted,

670
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,960
which if my memory is correct, the patients were treated for eight weeks. Six weeks. Six weeks. And

671
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:29,760
then there was a washout. So then they had a period of nothing for, was that six to eight weeks?

672
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,840
It was two weeks after the six weeks of treatment. Oh, that's where the eight came in. So it was six

673
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:41,920
of treatment, two of washout, then vaccination. Right. And the rationale for that was we wanted

674
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,840
the drug to be completely gone at the time we vaccinated. So we were asking the question,

675
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:54,720
is this a residual effect of the drug on the immune system? Not a lingering effect on the

676
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:01,040
immune system per se. Yeah. Not a direct effect of the drug, but an indirect. Yes. Okay. So with

677
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:08,480
that said, what was the first finding? So we were looking for whether the response to the flu

678
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:16,400
vaccine was 1.2 fold better in a drug treated group than the placebo. And that 1.2 fold came from

679
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,200
a previous study that had been published that showed that was the minimum requirement

680
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,320
to see a clinically meaningful decrease in symptomatic flu in vaccinated patients.

681
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,160
We saw, and we required, and this was pre-specified two out of the three strains to have that

682
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:42,240
improvement. And we saw that improvement or better in the two low doses of RAD 001,

683
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,320
but not in the high dose. And the high dose we just saw one string better. One of the three

684
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:51,120
strains was better. And the other two were actually a little below one, so a little below

685
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,600
the placebo. What do you make of that? Is it noise? Do you think there's something

686
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:02,000
mechanistically happening there? I do. I think we certainly know that high doses of

687
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,280
a Rapalog or immunosuppressive, the dose of 20 milligrams once a week is sufficiently high to

688
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,800
fully suppress torque one. I expect that we probably interfered with lymphocyte proliferation.

689
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,760
And do you think it's just a tweak that you didn't see? What's confusing to me is that you

690
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:23,680
still saw a much greater immunity in one strain. And if I recall, it was even higher than the two

691
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:30,320
low doses, thinking about the first figure in the top figure in the second figure of the paper. So

692
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:36,720
that would be, my first guess would be, oh, clearly you just hit the daily dose of an

693
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:43,520
immunosuppressed patient if they were all below baseline. But if you did a 25

694
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,840
weekly in there, do you think you would have just seen them all eventually start to go down?

695
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:53,120
Certainly, if we got to some high enough dose, I think they all would have been low.

696
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,240
I got it. Yeah. So it's almost like there's a J curve here, or an upside down J curve,

697
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:03,520
really, or an upside down U, I suppose, of some combination of dose and frequency producing a

698
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,000
sweet spot where we're seeing, and by the way, I can't recall, it's been so long since I looked

699
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,360
at the paper, was there any lympho proliferation? I mean, these were functional assays. Any changes

700
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,880
in the counts of lymphocytes or any other? This specific assay that was the primary

701
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:25,840
endpoint was an antibody titer assay. Right. We didn't do mixed lymphocyte reactions or some

702
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,960
proliferation assays part of this paper. Did anyone ever look at fractions of lymphocytes,

703
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:41,600
for example, did anyone look at CD25, CD3 to see if anything had happened to suppressor T cells?

704
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,560
We didn't do it in this study. Well, we didn't do functional lymphocyte assays. Part of this study

705
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:56,240
was a very comprehensive multidimensional flow cytometric assay to get lymphocyte subsets. And

706
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:04,400
we reported one of the results in figure three, which is where we saw improvement in

707
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:14,160
checkpoint protein levels on both CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes, which mean in checkpoint proteins,

708
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:20,080
they're very popular in oncology now. And some of your listeners may have heard about those things

709
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:26,240
like PD1, for example, the drug target of Keytruda or Optivo. We had Keith Flaherty on recently,

710
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,880
and we had a beautiful discussion about checkpoint inhibition. But that said, let's assume people

711
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,840
don't know what that is. It's always worth rediscussing it. Yeah, these proteins inhibit

712
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,520
lymphocyte function, and they go up as the lymphocytes get exhausted. And what we saw in

713
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,200
this study is that the level of PD1 went down on the lymphocytes in the drug treatment group

714
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:53,920
compared to the placebo. By what percent? It was a relatively small effect, a 10 to 20% change.

715
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:59,360
But comparable to the effect that you saw in the increase in antibody recognition. I mean,

716
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,320
it was like the mirror of that. I guess, yeah. And presumably the teleologic rationale for that is

717
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,760
the more tired a lymphocyte gets, the more it wants to weaken its breaks. I'll go along with that.

718
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,840
Everything in me, in my world, Lloyd, comes down to just anthropomorphizing the immune system.

719
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,440
That's how I do things. So has anyone looked at this, by the way, to see what rapamycin does

720
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:27,280
or rapalog does in this type of intermittent dosing to inhibitory T cells?

721
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,240
There have been a lot of studies of T cell subset functions with rapalogs,

722
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:40,000
both in mice and in humans, looking at effector memory transition, looking at Tregs with high

723
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,200
exposures or substantial inhibitory effect on B cell function. There's a lot out there.

724
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:51,040
Do you think that rapalogs could be used to suppress Tregs? Selectively, of course.

725
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,120
There are a couple of papers that show that.

726
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:58,640
Because it would sure be interesting to start layering in rapalogs with immunotherapy,

727
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,400
oncology-specific.

728
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,200
Yes. Yeah. There's a small literature on that.

729
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,480
What else did you see in this paper? I think we've touched on the high points.

730
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,280
Yeah. The other experiment we did, which I think we mentioned in the text,

731
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:17,920
but didn't go into great details, is the flu vaccine is a T-dependent antibody response.

732
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:24,480
We also vaccinated patients with a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine, which is B cell,

733
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:30,640
which is a pure polysaccharide vaccine. So it's a T-independent response.

734
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:37,200
We were thinking, could we improve antigen presentation? Perhaps if the dose of

735
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:43,040
the rapalog we used augmented autophagy, and could that contribute to antigen presentation?

736
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,200
We saw and we measured seven of the 23 antigens.

737
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:55,680
Wait. Tell me why that would be... That's not an obvious purview into autophagy to me. So let's

738
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:01,360
back that up a little bit. So you're giving them a pneumococcal vaccine, which is what type of

739
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,120
vaccine? That's a...

740
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,720
Polysaccharide antigen.

741
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,400
Polysaccharide antigen. You're not giving back the whole bacteria.

742
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,040
And how does it get presented to the immune system?

743
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:17,120
There are specific elements of innate immunity that recognize bacterial polysaccharide antigens,

744
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,240
and that brings it to professional antigen presenting cells, likely dendritic cells.

745
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,760
And then it has to be internalized and then presented.

746
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,040
So that's MHC class one?

747
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,600
This isn't a peptide presentation. This is presented in the context of an innate

748
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,080
element that recognizes polysaccharide antigens.

749
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,480
Okay. All right. So we're outside of class one, class two.

750
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:40,720
Yes.

751
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:47,040
And you're saying the ability to internalize, or basically the ability to phagocytose

752
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,640
that like the polysaccharide, and then...

753
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,320
And directly stimulate B cells.

754
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:59,840
It was an exploratory element of the study. We saw in the seven specific antigen responses we

755
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:05,600
measured, if I recall, six of them increased, but by a small amount.

756
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,960
It was an encouraging trend, but we didn't further follow it up.

757
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,160
Okay. Any other markers you could have here for autophagy?

758
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,960
I mean, did you look at light chain transition or anything like that?

759
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:22,960
No. Autophagy is a really difficult clinical investigation paradigm.

760
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:29,600
And I know you recently saw Mitch Weiss's paper on unpaired hemoglobin.

761
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,520
In thalassemia patients. I was super excited when I read that paper,

762
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:39,520
because here is now a clinical paradigm where we can test drugs that augment autophagy and see

763
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,240
something easily measurable in a not that rare patient population.

764
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,800
Yeah. Let me think. In those patients, did you collect serum that allow you to look at amino

765
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,440
acid levels in the plasma or anything else?

766
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,280
No, we didn't do any of that.

767
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,960
Do you still have any of that banked serum?

768
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,000
I don't think so.

769
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,120
Easy enough experiment to repeat, but of course, the other thing I'm curious about is,

770
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:11,040
is there anything about RAD001 administration that mimics fasting, for example? I mean,

771
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:19,040
how much of the benefit here is through direct inhibition of mTOR? And are there any

772
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:24,960
pleotrophic benefits that aren't quantified through this? Obviously, some of them, I mean,

773
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,360
the fact that you waited until the drug was out of the system to check the immune response is

774
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,600
actually a great insight, because obviously you eliminate some of those things. But in the way

775
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:39,280
that many people have argued statins have a direct effect, they inhibit cholesterol synthesis,

776
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:46,240
an indirect effect, the liver upregulates LDL-R, a really indirect effect, which is immune suppression

777
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:51,200
or other sort of benefits around endothelial health and things like that. Do you think there's

778
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,080
a possible third leg to this stool that we haven't thought about?

779
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:00,880
The fasting story is kind of complex. So do I think there's some other persistent benefit of

780
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:09,520
a rapologue? I think the mouse experiments tells us there is, and it's because relatively short

781
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:17,200
course of a rapologue is nonetheless sufficient to extend a mouse's lifespan. And we do not

782
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:23,040
understand that. Although it's so hard to extrapolate what short versus long means in a mouse, isn't it?

783
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:29,040
Yes. Look at the mouse that fasts for 24 hours. Look at Jay Mitchell's stuff where they do a one

784
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:36,080
day fast prior to ephemeral artery ligation and a reperfusion where the mouse that was just fed

785
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:43,360
normally through the insult, they all die. The mice that had 24 hours of fasting prior to a lethal

786
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:50,480
reperfusion injury either all or mostly live. I don't know how to extrapolate that into a higher

787
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:56,080
order animal because it's not even the duration of the fast, it's the metabolic consequence of

788
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:02,000
the fast. There's some long-term consequence of that that we don't understand. And there's

789
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:08,800
several things you could hypothesize. Is there a change in the DNA structure based on histone

790
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,800
methylation or DNA methylation? Or is it something else? Those are just the things that come to mind.

791
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,680
Yeah, that's a great point, right? You could literally be resetting methylation on that.

792
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,960
You could turn back a methylation clock to its template, potentially.

793
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,880
But people have looked at that with raphologs and it doesn't seem to happen.

794
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,880
In other words, you take a Horvath clock pre and post and you're not seeing unwinding of methylation.

795
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,040
Yeah.

796
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,000
That's been done in mice as well or just in humans.

797
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I suspect it's been done in a bunch of species. It's one of these sort of negative studies that

798
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,880
may never get published. That's a pet peeve of mine, by the way. Negative studies not getting

799
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,320
published. I think it's a pet peeve of a lot of people. It's hard enough to publish

800
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,720
positive studies. And I'm sympathetic and agree.

801
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:05,360
So we're high-fiving on New Year's Eve, 2014. How do you go from, what is Novartis,

802
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:10,400
and again, if this is confidential, by all means, just gloss, we'll skip it, but what are the brass

803
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,640
that Novartis think of the results of this experiment, which is effectively taking a drug

804
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:20,160
that we already have on the market for a very clear indication and now potentially

805
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:25,760
expanding an indication? Can the FDA take a study? This is a very well done study here.

806
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,640
This is double-blinded. This is placebo-controlled. And this found a significant outcome. Is that

807
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,520
enough to change the indication for a medication like this?

808
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:40,640
I can speak in general in that for an indication that could be relevant to many, many people,

809
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:48,480
you need a corresponding, a lot of safety data. This study was way too small for

810
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,680
studies that would be required for marketing authorization.

811
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:59,440
I got it. So because something like renal cell carcinoma is relatively infrequent relative to

812
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:06,400
influenza vaccination, you had enough safety data to justify treating people with RCC. This would

813
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,520
not constitute sufficient safety data to basically give every person over the age of 65

814
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,080
who's getting vaccinated this type of a medication.

815
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,680
That's exactly right. If we fast forward a little bit in the conversation,

816
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:25,520
we've advanced this program in Restore Bio. Novartis licensed it to Restore Bio. And our phase

817
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:32,640
three program is two very similarly designed clinical studies. One has a thousand patients.

818
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,040
The other one will have about 1600 patients.

819
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:42,800
You able to speak about how the decision was made for Restore Bio to basically acquire a piece of

820
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,000
an asset from Novartis and what else was brought in to create that company and how did you, Joan,

821
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,160
and I assume many others decide to leave. I mean, that's obviously a loss to Novartis,

822
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:57,040
presumably, which implies that they probably still have a vested interest in the success of Restore

823
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,080
Bio. Yeah. Let's take one step backwards and answer an earlier question you asked,

824
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,800
which is, what did Novartis think when we got these results?

825
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,840
Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.

826
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,200
I think everybody was very excited for reasons that you're excited.

827
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,800
That was my Christmas present of the year.

828
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,000
And the guidance was, this is so important, let's go back and do it again.

829
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,680
Try to do it in a more torque one selective way.

830
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,760
Are you able to say how much that study cost just to give a sense of?

831
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:34,080
I don't think we talk externally, but any clinical study like this, a phase two study with

832
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:40,640
two to 300 patients costs millions. And a lot of the cost is driven by

833
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,720
often exploratory assessments you do in the context of the study beyond the per patient

834
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,200
cost and investigator cost, but millions. I mean, it's a lot of money for anybody,

835
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,440
and it's done with a lot of deliberation and thought.

836
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,280
So the guidance was to go back and do it again, make sure it's real,

837
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,160
come up with a way to be more torque one selective.

838
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:09,280
But using the same vehicle, which means putting a finer point on the dosing, not necessarily,

839
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,120
I mean, you're still not at the point where people are saying,

840
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,720
we need to make a new molecule to replicate this.

841
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,520
Well, we had one.

842
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:24,000
The research team at Novartis had come up with a very cool finding that a combination of an

843
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:31,840
allosteric and catalytic torque inhibitor could be more torque one selective and more potent.

844
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:39,040
There was actually synergy. And this is published by Beyot Niefeller and Lohn Murphy.

845
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,000
They showed synergy. So a wrap along.

846
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,400
Can you explain to folks what the difference is between allosteric versus catalytic inhibition?

847
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:55,600
Sure. So catalytic inhibition means an inhibitor that's binding at the catalytic site of torque one

848
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,680
and blocking phosphorylation of targets. An allosteric inhibitor is a fancy way of saying

849
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:06,880
an inhibitor that binds someplace else on the molecule and nonetheless inhibits it.

850
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,400
Rapamycin complex.

851
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,360
I always think of allosteric as sort of shape blocking.

852
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:11,760
Could be.

853
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,320
Let's say shape blocking. So in this case, the allosteric inhibitor is the

854
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:24,080
combination of FKBP12 plus rapamycin binding to torque one. So the combination of those two

855
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:29,840
synergistically inhibits torque one and it's a little more torque one selective.

856
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,960
Everol almost does the same thing. It also binds to FKBP.

857
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,800
Yes, it binds to FKBP also. Maybe later on we can get to that lambing paper, which is...

858
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,640
Which I'd love to get to that paper.

859
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:42,880
Yeah.

860
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,600
Yeah.

861
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:53,040
So with that understanding, we could then explore, put a finer point on the dosing as well as explore

862
01:23:53,040 --> 01:24:00,080
the biology of that catalytic inhibitor with and without RAD001. And that's what the next study did.

863
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,840
Overall, a very similar study design. We treated for six weeks,

864
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:11,200
two week washout, interrogated the immune system function with flu vaccination and got

865
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:17,440
fundamentally similar results. There's one other point I'd like to bring in because it leads to

866
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:24,800
where we are now. In the very first study we did in analyzing, we saw immune function improvement,

867
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:30,480
which in our marker for that was flu vaccine response. In the adverse event listings,

868
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:36,800
we saw fewer infections in the drug treated people compared to the placebo patients.

869
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,320
Over what time horizon?

870
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,920
We followed people for a year.

871
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:44,640
And by the way, did that increase in vaccination translate to a reduction in influenza?

872
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,400
Or was that the infection you're speaking about? Are you speaking about all infections?

873
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,440
All infections.

874
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,600
Okay. What about influenza specifically?

875
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,720
Too few events to be able to make a conclusion.

876
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,320
It's underpowered to look at the flu.

877
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:02,160
Exactly. If you think about all infections you get or patients get, most of them are respiratory

878
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,280
tract infections, colds and flus in the winter season.

879
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,600
An interesting thought experiment, you wouldn't do this experiment, but an interesting thought

880
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:18,720
experiment would be a two by two vaccine, no vaccine, RAPA, no RAPA, powered to see difference

881
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,240
in infection.

882
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,200
Big experiment.

883
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,760
Huge experiment, but great gedanken, right?

884
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:30,800
Yes, I agreed. So in this very first study we found, again, we weren't thinking about it and we

885
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,920
weren't looking for it, but we observed it in the adverse event listings.

886
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,800
So what were some of those infections, Lloyd, that you saw? Like UTIs or cellulitis, that kind of

887
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,280
stuff?

888
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,880
Two most common ones. By far the most common was upper respiratory tract infection or respiratory

889
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,600
tract infection.

890
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,440
That was not influenza, yeah.

891
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,120
Maybe some of them were. We didn't measure. We don't know what the pathogens were.

892
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:59,920
We do know from surveillance experiments that the CDC has done that most of them are

893
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,080
rhinovirus and then there's metanumavirus. There's various other.

894
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,520
Echo, God only knows what.

895
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,200
Yes. And we saw a decrease in UTIs also.

896
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,760
And that persisted for a year?

897
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,680
The biggest effect was when the patients were shortly over the course of drug treatment and

898
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:22,080
sometime thereafter. But even if we analyze it over the course of a year, we saw it,

899
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:27,280
although the effect waned. In this very first study in 2014, we brought patients back a year

900
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:33,440
later and revaccinated them to see if the improvement in immunologic function persisted.

901
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:33,760
And?

902
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,560
It did not.

903
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,040
Okay. So by a year, they'd clearly lost it.

904
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,600
Yes.

905
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,360
And of course, we didn't do the experiment, but do you know if six weeks was necessary or could

906
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,800
you have done four plus two or three plus two or two plus two? Would the benefit have been better

907
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:54,880
if you went eight plus two or 10 plus two or 12 plus two? Like how did you agree on six weeks of

908
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,960
treatment? I understand the two week washout, but what about the six weeks of treatment?

909
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,760
It came from two places. One is that that's what they did in the mice.

910
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,000
My same caveat implies.

911
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:14,000
Totally agree. And then secondly, we know the timing of lymphocyte production from committed

912
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,800
precursors in human bone marrow. And we were thinking that the drug could be acting at that

913
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:26,000
level. And six weeks of treatment is sufficient to, by the time you vaccinated eight weeks,

914
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,760
have some new lymphocytes from those committed precursors.

915
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:37,520
So your hypothesis would be six was the minimum time required to get a full turnover and going

916
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:43,840
eight versus 10 would not necessarily bring benefit and might only expose you to longer side effects.

917
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:49,840
We actually never tested this. We came up with our dosing period for the rationale that I gave

918
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,800
you. And we've not, at least with a Rapalogue, tested other intervals. We did see in the second

919
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:03,680
study, which also worked on the vaccine endpoint, we promoted respiratory tract infections and

920
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,400
infections in general to secondary endpoints. So we're looking at them prospectively. We're

921
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,120
collecting them more carefully. That was in the second study.

922
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:17,600
In the second study. And again, the drugs decreased the incidence of respiratory tract

923
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,640
infections. The biggest effect was observed with just the catalytic inhibitor alone.

924
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,960
The second biggest effect.

925
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,040
Wait, the catalytic inhibitor was a new molecule?

926
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:34,640
Yes, it's a new compound. In that paper, it was called BEZ235. And this is the molecule licensed

927
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,920
by RestoreBio.

928
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,720
So BEZ235 is not RAD001 combined with something else?

929
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:46,400
No, we tested the combination and it also decreased respiratory tract infections. And the

930
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:53,120
combination was the best at improving the flu response. But the single catalytic inhibitor

931
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,080
was the best at preventing respiratory tract infections. This study had an extra arm. It was

932
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,280
a somewhat bigger study, 264 patients.

933
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,360
Was this the one published two years ago?

934
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,560
Yes, 2018.

935
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, a year ago. Okay. So let's now talk about the creation of RestoreBio.

936
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:16,960
So essentially the story is that we did the second study for prevention of respiratory

937
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:25,680
tract infections and enhancing immune function with mTOR inhibition. Worked again. Everybody's

938
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:34,560
excited. And Novartis, as in most big companies, big pharma companies, the research teams produce

939
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:41,920
more than global development can handle. And it's done deliberately. It gives early in drug

940
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,680
development, you never know exactly what's going to work best. You want to create enough

941
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:51,680
opportunities so something will be exciting. And the program transitioned to global development,

942
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:57,280
and they had a lot of exciting things to do. And this fell below the funding line. It reflects in

943
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:04,400
part the excellent productivity of Novartis research. It reflects in part the great opportunities

944
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,720
the global development has. Of course, as the champions of the program, we were kind of

945
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:14,560
disappointed. But Novartis felt, and again, I'm speaking for myself now, I'm not a Novartis

946
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:20,480
spokesperson, but Novartis felt this drug looks like it could work and it could help people. We

947
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:27,040
have to find a way to make it available to people if it could work. So other pharma companies do this

948
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:35,040
too. The decision was to out license it. And Joan is the sort of originator of the idea and the

949
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:41,520
biggest champion, wanted to go outside of Novartis and start a company. I introduced her to an

950
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:48,240
absolutely awesome CEO I know who was ready for his next role. And they raised money and they

951
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:53,760
created the Restore Bio. And that was a pretty quick path to going public. Restore Bio went public

952
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:00,320
late in 18, didn't they? It reflected in part the need for funds to run a phase three program.

953
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:06,240
Yeah. What did Restore Bio raise in the IPO? You're asking me a hard question. I was at Novartis,

954
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:12,480
but probably around 90 million, I think. Wow. Yeah. So yeah, as you said, that's, you're

955
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:17,680
basically going right to phase three at this point because, so you licensed one or two molecules from

956
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:25,920
Novartis. Restore Bio licensed BEZ235, which is now named RTB101. And they then did a phase two

957
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:33,760
B study. These two studies we had done were phase two A. Phase two A. Yeah. Right. So in the first

958
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:40,080
study published in 2014 that we've been discussing, respiratory tract infections and infections in

959
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,160
general were observed to be decreased in the drug treated group compared to the placebo

960
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,400
by reviewing the adverse event listings. This was not something we had considered a priori,

961
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,840
but we recognize decreased infections could be a consequence of improved immune function,

962
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,720
which is why we looked in the first place in the listings. And then in the second study,

963
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:09,200
where we explored a catalytic inhibitor, which is now RTB101, RAD001, as well as the combination,

964
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,520
we promoted respiratory tract infections and infections in general to a secondary

965
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:22,720
endpoint. And we specifically included collecting those data, both by patient reporting, as well as

966
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:31,440
investigator querying the patients at home regularly. And again, we saw decreased respiratory

967
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:40,320
tract infections. The best drug was BEZ235, which we now call RTB101 in terms of decreasing

968
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:47,360
respiratory tract infections. The combination also worked. Interestingly, the combination,

969
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:57,840
as well as RAD001, improved the flu vaccine response, but the BEZ235 or RTB101 did not.

970
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:05,040
Remind me, it's catalytically inhibiting. So it's binding directly to TOR?

971
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:05,840
Yes.

972
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:14,080
And is it binding equally to TOR when bound to raptor, meaning complex one, as it is binding to

973
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:18,320
TOR bound to Richter, known as complex two?

974
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:24,640
So the way this is usually done is in a cellular assay context. So we don't look specifically for

975
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:30,480
the binding, but we look for inhibition of phosphorylation of sites.

976
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,640
Of serine 6 or which one?

977
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:40,080
S6 kinase for TORC1 and phospho-AKT there. And we look specifically at the phosphorylation site

978
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:47,200
that TORC2 does, not the one that any other enzyme does. So we're able to see that a catalytic

979
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:56,960
inhibitor at high concentrations will inhibit both. RTB101 has some preference for TORC1,

980
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,760
and it's a little different depending upon which cell you look in.

981
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:05,280
I wanted to come back to that because, and I got to remember where we are in this story,

982
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,840
because I don't want to lose this thread. So maybe we can agree to just park this again,

983
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,800
but I definitely don't want to leave the discussion of tissue selectivity.

984
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:22,080
We've focused so much on C1, C2 selectivity, but we haven't talked about muscle versus liver

985
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:27,120
versus adipose tissue, for example, which you could argue you might want very different behaviors

986
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:38,400
there. In terms of drug design, drug pharmacokinetics, is it easier to target tissues or is it easier to

987
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:44,800
target enzymes, proteins, et cetera, when designing a drug or waving magic wands?

988
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:53,040
No magic wands involved. It's far easier to design a drug to hit a target. To hit the target in a

989
01:34:53,040 --> 01:35:00,000
particular tissue is harder, but doable. Sometimes you can do it in a deliberate,

990
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,440
designed fashion. For example, making a prodrug that's cleaved to an active form only by an

991
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:10,640
enzyme present in your desired tissue. You also have to be mindful that within every tissue,

992
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,960
there are multiple cell types and you want the drug in the cell type that will make the difference.

993
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:20,880
And again, all of this is possible and it's just how much time and effort you're going to put into

994
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:28,000
it. So when you go back to even the first experiment in 2014 and all of the animal data that came from

995
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,800
it, did you have a sense of where this was acting tissue wise? Did you feel like you were acting on

996
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:40,000
bone marrow? Did you feel like you were possibly acting in the thymus? Did you feel like you were

997
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,600
acting in some other cell line that directly or indirectly was playing a role? I mean,

998
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:51,040
or did you have a sense that you were seeing this everywhere, but it didn't seem to matter except in

999
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,840
the bone marrow? We thought it would be bone marrow and perhaps secondary lymphoid tissue,

1000
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:03,280
which are lymph nodes or glands, but we didn't explore it exactly. In general, small molecules

1001
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:10,480
that aren't specifically tissue targeted will often go to many tissues. We knew from toxicology

1002
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:16,240
studies with the compound that it distributed to our target tissues. We felt we had enough

1003
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:25,280
information to move ahead. Yeah. So when RTB101 was basically the basis upon which RestoreBio

1004
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:31,200
was formed, correct? That's right. Now, I was very confused during your road show, which was

1005
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:36,080
about a year ago, maybe more than a year ago. It might've been early 2018. I've sort of lost track.

1006
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:41,200
You were at Novartis at the time, so it wasn't really your road show at the time, but I naively,

1007
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:51,680
I guess, thought that RTB101 was actually RAD001, the Evrolimus, combined with a PI3K inhibitor.

1008
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:55,280
So that's actually what I thought was happening. And I remember even having discussions with other

1009
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,320
people looking at the data and saying, is this what this company is? So I assumed that this

1010
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:07,520
company outlicensed Evrolimus combined with a PI3K inhibitor. So how were we confused by that?

1011
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:16,880
When RestoreBio was formed, it licensed RTB101 from Novartis for all uses. And there was also

1012
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:27,120
a limited license to use RAD001 only in combination with RTB101 for our indication.

1013
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:38,400
Now, the phase 2B study that RestoreBio ran showed that the most effective drug or drug combination

1014
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:45,360
for preventing respiratory tract infections was just RTB101 alone at 10 milligrams. And remember the

1015
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:52,640
previous study that Novartis had run had shown that although the combination was best at augmenting

1016
01:37:52,640 --> 01:38:01,280
a vaccine response, it was just RTB101 alone, which at the time was called BEZ235, was the best

1017
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:08,800
at preventing respiratory tract infections. We believe this is because the mechanism by which

1018
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:15,680
it prevents respiratory tract infections is upregulation of an interferon-stimulated antiviral

1019
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:24,480
gene response. Interferon, remember, is a substance in the blood that upregulates many

1020
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:31,360
different proteins, most of which are involved in preventing viral infections. And you need protein

1021
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:40,000
synthesis to make all of these proteins. And I worry that if we inhibit mTOR for a long time,

1022
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
we can upregulate the genes, but they won't be expressed adequately. And there are some

1023
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
literature data that you need mTOR in order to express the proteins induced by interferon.

1024
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,440
So these experiments taken together suggest to you that I guess it just reinforces this idea

1025
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:00,560
of intermittent dosing, not just intermittent within the week, which I think was clearly

1026
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:07,920
established by the phase 2A study, but even applying a secondary cycle over the course of a

1027
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:13,920
year, for example. I mean, you know that doing a six plus two once a year is probably not adequate.

1028
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:20,320
So there's some frequency upon which you want to meta cycle that. But the reason you don't just

1029
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:28,080
want to go all the time taking it presumably is you might actually start to impair protein

1030
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:34,640
synthesis that's necessary to, for lack of a better word, basically empower your new superpowers of

1031
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:40,480
immunity through enhanced protein synthesis. Yes. Protein synthesis, there's several different

1032
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:47,360
kinds of protein synthesis and some are more or less sensitive to inhibition by Rapalog.

1033
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:53,120
Mitch Weiss's very recent paper, one of the interesting things I found in it was that

1034
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,920
there wasn't much of an inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis, despite the fact that they were using

1035
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:06,080
fairly high exposures of a Rapalog. So I think there are some proteins that are sensitive to

1036
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,920
translational inhibition by Rapalog and perhaps some that are less sensitive.

1037
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:17,360
Before we go down this path of getting a little bit more into RTB101, let's take a step back here

1038
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:23,520
and say, do you think that all of the benefits that we saw in the ITPs across all these other

1039
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,080
species, if you think of the benefits that Matt Cabraland is seeing in dogs, if you think of

1040
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:34,320
sort of the global excitement that exists around Rapamycin and Rapalog's, how much of it do you

1041
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:40,800
think is mediated through what you guys are testing, which is you're clearly enhancing

1042
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:46,960
immunity in a positive way, which could have at least two very distinct benefits. One is the

1043
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,760
reduction of infection. The other could be frankly reduction of cancer through increased surveillance.

1044
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:57,680
They're very similar. Viruses and cancer obviously behave or susceptible to the similar

1045
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:02,400
branch of the immune system. Do you think there are other things that we haven't talked about yet,

1046
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:08,320
such as increased autophagy, targeting of endor, destruction endor, desilencing of

1047
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:14,720
senescent cells, reduction of inflammation, enhanced mitophagy. What other mechanisms do

1048
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,400
you think could have been involved here and what evidence exists to support or refute that?

1049
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:24,080
Well, I think we know from academic experiments that every single one of those mechanisms

1050
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:33,280
can extend health span in preclinical models. We do not know in people. And I think similarly to

1051
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:38,400
follow up our earlier discussion about what tissues you have to inhibit endor in in order to get a

1052
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:43,760
clinical benefit, we don't really know the answer to that either. It's been studied in some of the

1053
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:49,040
preclinical models. I can recall an experiment in the Drosophila fat body where inhibition of

1054
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:55,200
endor right there was sufficient to extend a fly lifespan. There's still a lot we need to learn.

1055
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
What does your intuition tell you? How much of an overlap or parallel do you see between the

1056
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,520
benefits of fasting and caloric restriction and the benefits of rapamycin globally?

1057
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:13,920
Yeah. So one of the interesting things that we did and was done previously in a Nature publication,

1058
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:21,680
I think the author was Sengupta, was looking at the consequences of fasting on endor activity.

1059
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:29,920
In young people, as you would expect, fasting leads to suppression of endor activity, activation

1060
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:38,320
of the cellular recycling machinery, autophagy, suppression of protein synthesis and DNA lipid

1061
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:46,080
synthesis and so forth, basically preparing for lean times. In old mice, that's impaired. We've

1062
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:53,760
only done the liver tests in mice. So we back translated this experiment and gave,

1063
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:01,360
actually I think it was rats, it was old rats, doses of endor inhibition that corresponded to

1064
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:07,600
the doses we were using in people that were well tolerated. And then we looked at their ability to

1065
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:13,680
suppress endor. So in the old rats, even with fasting, their endor was still active in the liver.

1066
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:18,720
In a young rat, it's suppressed. So the young versus old had the same degree of inhibition

1067
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:25,280
to the same dose of rapamycin. Well, you couldn't test in the young rats because their endor was

1068
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,880
already low. Oh, but if you did it outside of the fast, I mean. Well, certainly the exposures were

1069
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:37,680
the same. There was no age dependent difference in exposure of the liver or the blood. That's

1070
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:44,160
interesting. Does that suggest that the older animal lost the ability to respond to the

1071
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:52,240
environmental reduction in nutrient? Exactly. Exactly. Hmm. That's upsetting. Although it

1072
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:57,280
does explain a very interesting finding, which is everything comes back to the 2009 paper.

1073
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:05,520
What really was interesting scientifically was that those mice were 600 days old. Those were mice

1074
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:11,120
that if you fasted them, wouldn't have lived longer. It already passed that stage where

1075
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:17,280
caloric restriction would extend their life. And yet their lives were extended 15 and 25%

1076
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:26,480
by rapamycin. That was a big freaking deal. Yeah. We published our experiments in that 2008 paper.

1077
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:32,160
It was sort of an interesting back translation experiment where we treated the old rats based

1078
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:36,240
on what we do about the old people. And of course we could do in rats. What we can't do in people

1079
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:40,720
is take their livers out and study their endor inhibition. But we weren't the first ones to do

1080
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:45,280
that. There was a very good nature paper that showed the same thing. Do you think this applies

1081
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:50,800
to humans? I mean, do you think that intermittent periods of caloric restriction are not beneficial

1082
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,560
to people in their sixties or seventies, which would be the equivalent of those quote unquote

1083
01:44:54,560 --> 01:45:01,520
old rats? The only thing that our group has been able to try is we looked at whether we could detect

1084
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:08,240
mTOR activity as assessed by things like fossil S6 kinase in the peripheral blood leukocytes of old

1085
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:12,960
people and we couldn't detect activity. We can't answer the question. I think we would need liver

1086
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:18,800
samples under fasting conditions. I mean, are you volunteering? Yeah, I'm absolutely volunteering.

1087
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,800
No, I tell you, there's a lot of things I subject myself to. I'm never excited about the liver

1088
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:28,560
biopsy. I just, I think that's the problem of doing a residency in general surgery is you've

1089
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,040
had one too many calls down to the interventional radiology suite with the patient that you have

1090
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:38,320
the recency bias of you only remember all the cases of liver biopsy has gone bad. The,

1091
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:41,680
all those hepatologists that have never had an issue, you don't hear about those cases,

1092
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:46,160
but you hear about everyone that. Yeah. There's sort of a referral bias. You never see the

1093
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:50,480
thousand that go well. Yeah. You only see the one that didn't. Yeah. I don't know. I think

1094
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:54,080
at some point I'll probably have to sign up for a liver biopsy. I think there's a lot going on

1095
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:59,440
there. There's so many questions I have about the liver, especially my own. No liver biopsies. You

1096
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,560
can get samples other ways, at least for this reason, but it is an interesting open question.

1097
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:11,520
And yet another one of these things we don't know is, is mTOR suppressed in elderly people

1098
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:20,800
with fasting and in which tissues. And by the way, do we know if autophagy is impaired in older

1099
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:26,800
folks with fasting? Because autophagy and mTOR inhibition are not synonymous. That's right.

1100
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:32,960
They overlap, but they're not synonymous. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of biology there and you,

1101
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,360
it's not only mTOR that can trigger autophagy. There's other mechanisms. There's

1102
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:42,160
Becklin one mechanisms and so forth, but it's an interesting set of experiments to do

1103
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:47,840
with a young group of patients and an old group of patients. And there's a priming effect to this

1104
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:52,400
that I just don't, I mean, it's so multifaceted to study all of these things. You think of the

1105
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:58,400
infinite combinations you can have, which is what's the effective wrap-up plus fasting when

1106
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:04,320
staggered, for example, does one prime the other? It's hard. You can't really go on fishing

1107
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,880
expeditions with these questions. You have to be more thoughtful in your hypothesis generation.

1108
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,080
There's just too many variables. That's right. There's too many ways to be fooled. That's right.

1109
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,360
So what can you tell us now about RTB 101? What has been published on this? In other words,

1110
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:20,320
I don't think we can speak about obviously anything that's not published at this point,

1111
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,400
or at least hasn't been publicly signaled. What's next for this compound?

1112
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:30,240
So the excitement is in the phase two A study that Novartis ran, we saw decreased respiratory

1113
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:36,960
tract infections in elderly people treated with it. In the phase two B study that Restore Bio ran,

1114
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,320
again, the same dose, 10 milligrams once a day saw the same thing, a decrease in respiratory tract

1115
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:51,280
infections. Now that study was a complicated study. And did it also have an RTB 101 plus RAD 001 arm?

1116
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,400
It did. And there was not a decrease in respiratory tract infections there.

1117
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,640
But there was an increase in immunity? Or was that, that was a secondary outcome?

1118
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:05,840
That was assessed, but it hasn't been talked about yet. The cool thing about the 2018 paper

1119
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:12,160
that was published from the Novartis study is that because we saw a decrease in respiratory

1120
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:20,160
tract infections, but we did not see an increase in vaccine response, it told us that the mechanism

1121
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:26,480
for the decrease in respiratory tract infections had to be something different. And we had collected

1122
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:34,320
some samples for exploratory profiling. We learned that there was an upregulation of antiviral

1123
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:41,360
gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. So a set of interferon stimulated genes responsible

1124
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:48,000
for antiviral activities was upregulated. So we identified a candidate mechanism and it

1125
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:55,280
makes a lot of sense. So to put that in English, it's not that the response was mediated by better

1126
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:02,480
recognition of viruses. It was mediated by more efficient targeting of and or disposing of viruses.

1127
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:08,720
Perhaps another way to say it is that the vaccine response we were measuring as the primary

1128
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:17,280
endpoint was a lymphocyte acquired immunity measurement. So in other words, you're immune,

1129
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,840
the flu, because you've been vaccinated. If you've been vaccinated for rabies, you're immune to that.

1130
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:27,200
I've never been vaccinated for rabies. I'm not immune to rabies. In contrast, there's something

1131
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:34,880
called innate immunity, which is the immunity of our species. This is an immunity that was

1132
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:40,080
developed because we have all co-evolved with our pathogens. And those of us who are here.

1133
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:45,920
Yeah, this is what the LPS on strep is. You don't need to be vaccinated to recognize it.

1134
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,240
Exactly. So there are many, many, many, many other things that we can recognize,

1135
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:56,480
elements of pathogens. So we can mount an effective immune response. And we're born with this. We don't

1136
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:02,560
have to be immunized for it. And this part of the immune system is what mTOR inhibition

1137
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:08,160
can also activate. Yeah, which is to go back to historical, that's not what we care about in

1138
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:15,200
transplant. No. Because in transplant, we didn't evolve to reject kidneys. We evolved to accept

1139
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:21,840
our kidneys. Therefore, we reject someone else's kidney. That's MHC-based. Right. Although blood

1140
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,640
type matching of your organ transplants is for... Well, that's true. And now they're doing so many

1141
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:31,040
ABO incompatibles that it's... I mean, the immunology involved in organ transplantation today is

1142
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:35,120
remarkable. A subject for another time. I know. And all started that you're alma mater. That was

1143
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:40,560
the Nobel prize right there, right? That's right. Dr. Murray. So is there anything else you can tell

1144
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,400
us? Because this is obviously something like, have you guys spoken about what the phase three is going

1145
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:50,320
to look like? Yeah. Well, we're almost halfway through. Halfway through enrollment. We enrolled

1146
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:55,680
the first phase three study fully and getting ready to start the second. So tell us about the

1147
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:01,680
first one. Yeah. So, well, let's do a little more on the phase two B because that study answered

1148
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:07,040
several questions in one study. We enrolled patients with pre-specified comorbidities

1149
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:15,360
and pre-specified an analysis of them independently. We did doses. We did five milligrams and 10

1150
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:20,800
milligrams. We did a different schedule. We did 10 twice a day. And we did a combination with

1151
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:27,520
a raphalog, our RAD001, with the primary endpoint of decreased respiratory tract infections. We also

1152
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,800
extended the dosing period to cover winter cold and flu season. So now we're dosing 16 weeks.

1153
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:40,880
Uninterrupted? Uninterrupted. Okay. Although with the once a day dosing, which is where we saw efficacy,

1154
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:47,440
we're only inhibiting mTOR partially for part of the day. By the way, if you had to speculate,

1155
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:56,080
going back to the very, very first, the 2a with RAD0001, if you had taken all four of those groups

1156
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:00,960
and measured them at the end of six weeks and then after the two week washout, what's your

1157
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:05,680
prediction as to how they would have differed? I'm sorry, because we didn't vaccinate until

1158
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:10,480
if we vaccinated at six weeks versus vaccinated at eight weeks. Correct. And you did comparison.

1159
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:15,920
In other words, I'm asking on drug versus off drug, how much, I know why you had the washout,

1160
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,640
but is it also possible that on drug you would have the same immune response?

1161
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,640
Yes. On the low doses, on the high doses, I bet we wouldn't have.

1162
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,960
And do you define high as five and 20?

1163
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,920
High as 20, yeah.

1164
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,000
Okay. Got it. So you think the five and the 0.5 still would have had benefit on drug,

1165
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,280
20 probably got a benefit. In fact, that might explain the question I asked, which is why did

1166
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:41,600
they still at least have one good strain response? It could have been that the two weeks off gave them

1167
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,160
recovery.

1168
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,200
It could be.

1169
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,880
Yeah. So back to restore bio, we figured it. And then the other element to the study is we ran it

1170
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:54,320
in two different cold and flu seasons, one in the Southern hemisphere, one in the Northern hemisphere,

1171
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,760
652 patients in the study, because we answered a lot of questions.

1172
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:06,720
We found that some patient populations responded well, over 85 patients and patients with asthma,

1173
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:12,960
patients with diabetes also responded. Patients who were smokers or had COPD did not.

1174
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,720
There are some preclinical data that provides a mechanism for why this is the case,

1175
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:23,840
in the sense that it's a different mechanism for airway inflammation and smoking and COPD,

1176
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,880
and it's exacerbated by mTOR inhibition.

1177
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,080
Oh, so I thought it was going to be a different way of antigen presentation or something.

1178
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:30,880
I don't think so.

1179
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,680
Okay.

1180
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:38,240
The coolest thing about the study is that we saw the same degree of efficacy if we looked at the

1181
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:42,320
patients in the Southern hemisphere as in the Northern hemisphere. It's almost as if there was

1182
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:48,400
two sub-studies in this study. Now, each of the patient groups by themselves were insufficiently

1183
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:55,680
powered to get any statistical significance, although overall, the patient population did.

1184
01:53:55,680 --> 01:54:00,480
That's a bold study design move. That could have backfired badly, right? Because if you had

1185
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:04,480
discordance between the Northern and Southern hemisphere, you would have been underpowered.

1186
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:08,880
Well, the goal of the study was to look at the overall patient population, which we did,

1187
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:16,960
which included responders and non-responders. We saw a 30% decrease in respiratory tract infections.

1188
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,520
Yes, but you had two different strains of the flu, didn't you?

1189
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:23,680
Flu was not involved here. There was no vaccination in this study.

1190
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:28,160
Oh, sorry. What I mean is you had two different environments of viruses.

1191
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,720
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

1192
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:37,280
So you diluted, I'm just saying you loaded the deck against yourself. If you did everything

1193
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:42,240
identical, but they were all in the same country, presumably you'd have a higher concentration of

1194
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:45,680
pathogen. You'd have a better chance of seeing a signal. That's sort of all I was saying.

1195
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:50,000
Yeah, I think you'd have a higher chance of seeing consistency.

1196
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
That's right. And you had the lowest chance imaginable because you spread out across two

1197
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,640
hemispheres.

1198
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:56,080
Yet we saw consistency.

1199
01:54:56,080 --> 01:55:00,640
Yes, so I think we're saying the same thing, which is it's more a credit to the finding.

1200
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,040
Yes.

1201
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,360
And I'm just saying, thank God.

1202
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:07,120
Well, if the drug works, this is what we should have seen.

1203
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:09,040
Yeah, it's just a big bet for a startup to take.

1204
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:17,760
Yeah. And so now we've seen 10 milligrams of RTB101 decrease respiratory tract infections

1205
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:25,280
in the phase 2a and in each of the parts of the phase 2b. And we use the phase 2b to power

1206
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,560
the phase 3 program. So the phase 3 program is-

1207
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,000
And the primary indication is respiratory infection or all infection?

1208
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,760
Respiratory tract infections.

1209
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,240
And patient population is 65 and up?

1210
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:41,520
65 and up. So the first study that we're calling the program, the protector program, the first one is

1211
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:49,120
fully enrolled, 1,024 patients. They're getting 16 weeks of drug treatment and we're following them

1212
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:55,040
for respiratory tract infections with sort of an electronic record that the patients fill out.

1213
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,600
If we were just targeting this at Northern Hemisphere patients, is it your view that the

1214
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:07,040
optimal 16 week window would be sort of May, June, July, August? How are you deciding when?

1215
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,320
Winter cold and flu season.

1216
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,360
Is when they actually want to receive the drug?

1217
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:11,600
Yes.

1218
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:18,800
Okay. So basically, so you're so confident that 10 milligrams is not too high that you're willing

1219
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,480
to give them the drug during flu season or during winter cold season?

1220
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,200
Yes.

1221
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:28,240
All right. So let's turn over to something else you brought up earlier, which was the

1222
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:33,200
the Laming paper that came out about two months ago. That's a prolific lab.

1223
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:39,760
Laming was a postdoc in David's lab. So no stranger to this science. There are lots of folks out there

1224
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,120
that are working on selective mTORC1 inhibition, notwithstanding the potential ways around it

1225
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:50,960
through intermittent dosing or looking at catalytic binding or things that might be off

1226
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:57,440
you a little bit more insight. What is your take on the biochemistry of selective binding

1227
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:01,360
and selective inhibition more specifically? The binding is quite selective.

1228
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:06,160
Yeah. I thought basically to summarize that paper for the listeners,

1229
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:15,040
the Laming group looked at, I think it was 90 different rapologs, presumably related to

1230
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:24,960
rapamycin and looked for their ability to be selective for Tork1 even with more sustained

1231
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:31,120
exposure. Then they identified a couple that were and most of the paper was on one that they liked

1232
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:36,640
the best. The really cool thing, and this is going to get us into an immunofilin discussion,

1233
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:44,160
is that they found possibly the reason the compound was selective was that it bound to

1234
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:52,480
one of the immunofilins, but not another. So specifically it bound to FKBP12, or at least

1235
01:57:52,480 --> 01:58:00,480
FKBP12 was required for the compound to have activity, but another FKBP, FKBP51 was not.

1236
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:10,000
But I still don't understand this. If you bind to FKBP12 and then the rapologue plus FKBP12 binds to

1237
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,440
mTOR, don't you still get into the same problem where after a long enough period of time,

1238
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,760
you don't have enough TOR to make complex 2? I don't think that's why complex 2 is inhibited.

1239
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,080
What do you think rapamycin specifically is doing to inhibit complex 2 then?

1240
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:31,920
I think it's a downstream and indirect counter regulatory signaling mechanism.

1241
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:37,760
I see. So it has to do more with the serine kinase or the 4EBP1 or something like that.

1242
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:44,480
Like something downstream of a direct phosphorylation is counter regulating or...

1243
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:44,960
Yes.

1244
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:52,720
Yeah, I see. And you're saying presumably if you only bind a rapologue to FKBP12,

1245
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,240
you somehow don't hit that target?

1246
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:01,600
Well, I think what their data say is because the compound that they show has no TOR2 activity at all

1247
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:10,480
does not bind to FKBP51 or at least that's the implication because down regulating FKBP51,

1248
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:16,080
which I think they did with an siRNA, had no effect on its inhibitory activity,

1249
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:22,240
suggests that there's a complexity to the complexes formed, sorry for that,

1250
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,600
that we don't yet understand and it's an exciting area to explore.

1251
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:33,200
So remember every cell has many immunophilins in it. It has several cyclophilins.

1252
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:40,000
It's got several FKBP's. So FKBP12, 51, and 52 are probably the big three,

1253
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,360
but there are a few others.

1254
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:45,600
By the way, I thought rapa only bound to 12. Rapa binds to what?

1255
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:49,120
They showed that it binds to at least 12 and 51.

1256
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:55,520
Okay. I mean, that's amazing. I had always thought that rapa binds only to FKBP12.

1257
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,440
Which then binds to TOR. I didn't even realize it was binding to 51.

1258
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:03,040
So we know it binds to 51 in their paper and there have been some other papers

1259
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:10,000
studying the ryanidine receptor that show that it binds to 12.6 also, which is in cardiac myocytes.

1260
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:15,760
We've talked all about inhibition. Are there any times when you want to be activating this?

1261
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:21,840
There's a lot of talk that ketamine may be activating mTOR and obviously ketamine has

1262
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,520
some really interesting properties as it pertains to recalcitrant depression.

1263
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:33,600
Yeah. So two points here. For patients with major depression, intravenous ketamine

1264
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:42,480
is almost a miracle drug. We're accustomed to typical antidepressant drugs requiring weeks

1265
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,920
and weeks to work and having modest effects at best.

1266
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,720
Or even days, but this is minutes.

1267
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:54,240
Ketamine works in minutes to hours and a huge effect size. It's really amazing.

1268
02:00:54,960 --> 02:01:01,600
I don't think we know what the specific cellular mechanism is of that. I'm giving you lots of

1269
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:04,960
things we don't know in our discussion. Wasn't there a study that showed

1270
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:12,080
rapamycin blocked the effect of ketamine? Yes. And there's a biotech company called Navator.

1271
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:17,040
I know them well. And they're using an mTOR activator to treat depression.

1272
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:23,920
Their Lloyd equivalent is also a very smart guy. So, yeah. George is fantastic.

1273
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:30,640
So Lloyd, is this a relatively recent understanding then about how RAPA is binding to the FKs

1274
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:36,080
and how it's the complexity around first of all, how many of these things there are

1275
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:40,240
and how you can change their properties by which ones you're binding to?

1276
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,880
Yeah. So it's something that's not discussed a lot in the literature, but there are several

1277
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:54,960
FKBP's or FK506 binding proteins. We almost always talk about FKBP12, and it's sort of a shorthand.

1278
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:59,440
But the understanding has been that rapamycin binds to all of them.

1279
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:06,640
In a few specific cases, that's been shown to be true. There's also a bunch of other activities

1280
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:14,800
and roles for FKBP's that aren't at all part of Torq1 biology. For example, they all have

1281
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:21,120
enzymatic activity. They're peptidylprolilisomerisis. But what the biology of that is

1282
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:28,960
remains pretty much unclear. It's a very interesting enzymatic activity. It's involved in

1283
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,920
protein folding. But there have been some studies where maybe a dozen different of these

1284
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:39,120
immunophilins are completely eliminated at the same time from cells. There was no clear cellular

1285
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:44,320
phenotype. So whether that means the others can all substitute because it's such a critical function

1286
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,800
or they have no function that's important. Are there disease states where people are lacking

1287
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:57,200
any of these? There may be, but I don't know them. And how conserved are they across species? Highly

1288
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:02,240
conserved. These immunophilins are present in almost all species, although they can vary a

1289
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:08,160
little bit. Is there any cell in the body that does not contain mTOR? I would bet some of the

1290
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:15,360
terminally differentiated a-nucleate cells may not. Red blood cells, for example, do? Certainly

1291
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:20,240
red blood cell precursors do. I was thinking about platelets, for example. I don't know if

1292
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:25,520
they have mTOR. Yeah. Interesting. And I bet that's known. It's just, I don't know the answer.

1293
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:30,240
I feel better that you don't. So now we need to make a list of David Sapatini questions.

1294
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:34,000
Well, I'll make sure David listens to this. And you know what? Maybe we'll do an AMA with David

1295
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,320
specifically on tOR. So last thing I want to chat about, because the paper came out kind of

1296
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:43,040
recently, was this sort of interesting paper. It's interesting not in the sense of the intervention,

1297
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:48,240
because it was an N of 9 and it was a very poorly controlled study in the sense that there was no

1298
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:53,760
placebo group and every patient actually was on their own sort of tailored cocktail of three

1299
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:59,600
different drugs or two hormones in a drug. But the paper did get a lot of press because it used an

1300
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:04,720
epigenetic clock. Are you familiar with these clocks? Yes. Yeah. This is Horvath's work, right?

1301
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:09,840
Yeah. Yeah. Horvath's probably the best of these clocks. Maybe it's just as a little bonus episode.

1302
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:12,800
Tell folks how these things work, what they're measuring. We've already talked a little bit

1303
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:20,400
about methylation. So maybe we put a bow on this by discussing that. So I forget how many years ago

1304
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:29,200
it was now, but it wasn't that many that we learned from Horvath and others that by looking

1305
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:35,840
at the methylation pattern on peripheral blood leukocyte DNA, we can tell how old you are within

1306
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:42,880
about six months to a year. And this has been replicated by several groups. So we're all familiar

1307
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,680
with DNA and... And that's even true among centenarians and people that are just genetically

1308
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:54,160
blessed to live longer. Excellent question. The studies that I've seen and actually the one that

1309
02:04:54,160 --> 02:05:01,600
we participated in, I don't think we had people over 80. Okay. I don't know the answer to that,

1310
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:12,160
but for people between about 20 and 80, there's a stereotypical change in methylation patterns on DNA.

1311
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:18,480
And this is just a chemical change to DNA that happens over time that's quite characteristic of

1312
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:23,600
your chronologic age. This is what David Sinclair talks about as sort of the scratching of the CD.

1313
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:29,840
The CD being the master copy of your genomic. Yeah, I guess we have to say something like that

1314
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:36,480
because we can't use wearing out of the vinyl anymore. But I think about it a little differently.

1315
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:44,480
I think about aging fundamentally as a biologic process controlled by pathways. And presumably,

1316
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:52,320
it's a consequence of changes in gene expression. And this methylation changes gene expression.

1317
02:05:52,320 --> 02:06:00,320
So it's a pretty cool story. And certainly we know that if you take a differentiated cell

1318
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:03,920
and treat it with a set of transcription factors called the aminaka factors,

1319
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:09,840
you can reset the cell back to a pluripotent stem cell and the methylation goes away too.

1320
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:19,360
So I'm thinking that DNA methylation likely could be causally related to the expression,

1321
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:24,800
gene expression changes that not only are associated with aging, but may cause aging.

1322
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:31,920
So has anybody looked at the effect on the Horvath clock or DNA methylation in response to the

1323
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:36,720
rappalogs we've been discussing today? I'm thinking of one experiment,

1324
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,400
but I don't know that it's published yet. And I think the answer was negative.

1325
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:45,440
So it's interesting because the paper that I was talking about, again, there are 10 ways to Sunday,

1326
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:50,560
this could just be an outlier, especially without a control group. I mean, it's really difficult to

1327
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:58,000
make any conclusion. But if any of this benefit was real, which was growth hormone, DHEA and metformin,

1328
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:03,200
set the Horvath clock back, I think it was a year and a half or two and a half years,

1329
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:09,680
the initial hypothesis of the experiment was that this was going to improve thymic function,

1330
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:14,320
which was going to improve immune function. Doesn't seem like a stretch that you could

1331
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:21,280
potentially see that benefit from a rappalog if it's also acting on immunity, which is why I think

1332
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:26,800
I was sort of probably why I asked about the thymus in the past. Yeah. So I have a few comments

1333
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:35,200
about this. One is first DHEA we know goes down substantially with age, but there have been

1334
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:41,920
several to many studies of replacing it and there's no clinical benefit. And I think the author

1335
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:48,480
used it for the effect of reducing the hyperinsulinemia that follows the administration

1336
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:55,360
of growth hormone. And in his, I think, personal experience, taking growth hormone noted that he

1337
02:07:55,440 --> 02:08:00,960
could blunt the hyperinsulinemia by taking something like 50 milligrams of DHEA by itself.

1338
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:05,040
But again, I've, that's not something that's well documented in the literature. And your point,

1339
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:09,440
of course, is documented, which is DHEA by itself. You can fix the number, but that doesn't

1340
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:16,320
seem to have any clinical bearing. Exactly. My second point is the growth hormone,

1341
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:25,120
the biologic activity of it is mostly driven, not exclusively by IGF-1, which used to be called,

1342
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:33,040
I think, somatomedin when we were in medical school. We know that lymphoid tissue is probably

1343
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:41,600
the most sensitive target organ for IGF-1 and it causes hypertrophy. So if he's looking for

1344
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:48,240
enlarged thymus in patients he's treating with growth hormone, I would be surprised if you did

1345
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:54,000
not see that. And he did. And so the question is, wouldn't you have expected that to have sped up

1346
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,360
growth? I would have expected, if he treated long enough, I would have expected to increase

1347
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:05,040
the size of the thymus if he could find it in people. I believe the study looked at MRI and

1348
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:10,000
showed an increase in thymic size. They were treated for a year, I believe. Not surprised at

1349
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,760
all. I bet the spleen increased too. Is there any reason to believe that that would enhance immune

1350
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:22,000
function? I'm thinking if I've read a paper about that and I don't know. And then what about the

1351
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:30,080
metformin wrench in the works? Metformin is a really interesting compound. I think we have

1352
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:36,560
excellent data that in diabetics it is a wonderful drug. And there's some retrospective data of

1353
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:42,400
longevity in diabetics treated for a long time with metformin. And of course, this is the question

1354
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:46,720
near Barzilay wants to answer with the TAME study. Right. And Nier and I have spoken about this many

1355
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:52,400
times and I agree that it's hard to make the case for a more beneficial agent in someone with

1356
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:57,920
diabetes or hyperinsulinemia metabolic syndrome or anything on that continuum and on that spectrum.

1357
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:03,840
Of course, the question is, what is the benefit of metformin in a perfectly healthy person or even

1358
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:10,080
a fully optimized person with respect to other variables? I'm not aware that there is a benefit

1359
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:14,880
of it. Remember, it has some adverse effects on mitochondrial function too, potentially.

1360
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:20,400
It's so funny you bring that up. That's exactly the question that I think most plagues me, which is

1361
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:28,240
if it is a weak mitochondrial toxin, is any benefit that you might see in a non-diabetic

1362
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:34,560
more than dwarfed by that downside? Whereas even the simplest benefit of it, like a reduction

1363
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:39,600
in hepatic glucose output in diabetics might more than make up for the sort of inhibition of

1364
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:41,600
metformin. Yeah, I don't think we know the answer to that question.

1365
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:46,400
It's one I'm super interested in and working on and actually going to volunteer for a study that

1366
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:51,360
will take some muscle biopsies and look at peak mitochondrial function, which you can induce

1367
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:57,360
through certain types of exercise with and without metformin. Interesting. Yeah. Well, Lloyd, this has

1368
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:03,040
been just a fantastic discussion. I am so grateful for the introduction that Tim made and it's been

1369
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:07,760
an honor to sit and speak with you. I had tried to reach out to Joan about a year ago. I never

1370
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:13,360
heard back. So I'm gathering it was just too busy a time, but in many ways it was better to get to

1371
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:18,000
talk now because so much more has happened in the last year and maybe that might've been just after

1372
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,320
the IPO. So it was a very busy time. I'm guessing my email went to spam, but this has worked out

1373
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:28,160
really well and I'm incredibly grateful for this. I wish you all the continued success with this

1374
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:33,920
program. Well, thanks. We remain optimistic and we will have top line data from the first phase three

1375
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:40,320
by the beginning of 2020. So the data will speak for themselves. Well, we'll count down the day

1376
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:44,560
till we see it. It's been a great discussion. I've enjoyed being here. I feel like I've said,

1377
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:49,200
I don't know an awful lot. I'm feeling a little bit like I'm back in school, but it's been fun.

1378
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:53,760
And I have some homework to do. Thanks. Well, I think that's one of the beautiful things about

1379
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:58,560
folks that come on this podcast is great scientists say, I don't know probably more than they know the

1380
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:02,240
answer. So that's, I think a testament to your honesty, but thank you, like, appreciate it.

1381
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:07,360
Thank you. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in

benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that

1386
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:32,960
detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is,

1387
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:38,320
nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes,

1388
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:43,360
hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to

1389

hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short

1390
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,840
podcast, typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting

1391
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:58,720
the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great

1392
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:03,760
way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1393
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:09,760
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,
