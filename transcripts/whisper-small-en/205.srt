00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hey, Lane. Good to see you again, man.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah. I'm happy to be back. I'm stoked for this. I know we had the marathon session the

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
first time, and I think we got through like a third of the topics that you were interested

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in. So we'll see how we do this time.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,060
Yeah. Yeah. Well, and of course, a lot of people had a bunch of follow-up questions.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,840
So it's sort of some combination of all the things we didn't get to talk about the first

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
time, plus some new things I thought about and that you and I have had a bunch of emails

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,840
exchanged over the last few months, coupled with some of that residual stuff. But one

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,200
of the topics that people really want to hear you and I talk about, because I think there's

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,760
this belief that we are going to be so orthogonal in our views, and we will have not a single

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,120
thing in common, although I'm pretty sure this isn't going to be the case, is on energy

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,680
balance and the role of calories in weight gain. So why don't we just lead with the fireworks

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:07,460
that everyone is hoping for? So talk to me about energy balance, calories, and weight

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,900
gain.

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,940
So I think one of the big misunderstandings is people don't really understand what energy

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:22,300
balance truly is. So if we look at what most people think it is, is, well, I track my calories

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:31,060
in, I track my calories out. Therefore, if I am burning 2,500 calories a day and I'm

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,340
tracking 2,000 calories a day, I should lose one pound of body weight per week linearly.

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,700
And that's just how it should go. Perfect math. And when that doesn't happen, they go,

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,900
see, this doesn't work. And there's a lot of different reasons for that. But before

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,820
we get into that, let's talk about what energy balance actually is. So you have, it is calories

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,180
in versus calories out, or the energy you consume versus the energy you expend. And

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,260
it's worth talking about real quick before we get into that, what do we mean by energy?

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,180
A lot of people say, well, calories, they don't even exist. You can't look under a microscope.

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,540
No, you can't look at them under a microscope. What we're talking about is the energy stored

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,900
in the chemical bonds of food. And when you break that food down, when those molecules

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,660
go through metabolism and they go through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, that energy is

29
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:34,660
liberated but captured ultimately as mostly ATP, which is our high energy phosphate. But

30
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,540
you can't just store a bunch of ATP. It's not practical for the body and ATP is very

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,380
unstable molecule. So we evolved to have fat stores or adipose tissue basically to store

32
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
excess energy. Now you can store some in glycogen. I would argue that you really can't store

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,800
some as protein. Some people will say, well, you can break down, you know, lean tissue.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,340
To me, that's kind of like saying, let's build a house. So it's a reservoir for wood. I don't

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,420
really think that that's a great analogy. I built this amazing teak table such that if I need fire

36
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,660
wood, I've got it right there. Right. Like in practicality, are you right? Sure. Yeah, you

37
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,060
could, but that's not why you built the table, right? Yeah, that's the nuclear option. Yeah.

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,700
Right. For sure. But if you look at the contribution of glycogen to your relative

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,940
energy stores, it's actually really small. I mean, you're talking about, you know, 1,500 to 2,000

40
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,300
calories of energy. So your adipose is by far the biggest store and you store it that way

41
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,540
because one, it's economical for space because you can fit a large amount of lipid in the small

42
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,140
area and it's energy dense and it's relatively easy to convert to ATP. And it's anhydrous. So

43
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,680
therefore it's, you know, incredibly well packed as you said, right? That's a glycogen has to

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,900
track with all that water. It's not a very efficient way to store energy. Correct. You would

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,420
be 800 pounds if you were trying to store the same amount of energy as glycogen. So there's a

46
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,540
lot of really practical reasons why the body evolved that way. Now, when we say calories,

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,180
calories are literally a measurement of energy. And so this is really important to understand.

48
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,420
When people say, well, are all calories created equal? That's like saying our different notches

49
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,180
on your speedometer different. No, this is just a, this is just a unit of measurement. Literally all

50
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,300
that is. And you, you, you truly have to think of it as energy. So if we think of it as the energy

51
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,860
stored in the chemical bonds that can be transferred throughout these various metabolic

52
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:44,180
processes, and that's what metabolism really is, is trying to capture that energy. When we look at

53
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,820
what the energy inside of things is, that is essentially the metabolizable energy in food.

54
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,740
Now there's a couple of important caveats to that. Notice I said metabolizable energy,

55
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,740
because not everything in food is metabolizable, especially with regards to fiber and specifically

56
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,180
insoluble fiber. It used to be thought that insoluble fiber is completely, you can't digest

57
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,340
it at all. It's absolutely zero calories. And I wouldn't say that there's good evidence,

58
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,380
but there's starting to be some evidence that suggests that our gut microbiome can actually

59
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,860
extract some calories from the insoluble fiber you eat. That's coming from a friend of mine,

60
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,700
Suzanne Devkota, who's one of the premier gut microbiome experts in the world. She actually

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,340
did her master's at the same lab I was doing my PhD in. Very smart person has been to like the

62
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,900
Nobel ceremony, you know, like incredibly well-respected scientist. So there is some evidence

63
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,420
of that. And then when you come to soluble fiber, it's pretty, pretty variable. It's like anywhere

64
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:56,140
from one to four calories per gram. So anywhere from a normal carbohydrate amount to one calorie.

65
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,900
And it also probably depends on your individual gut microbiome. Right? So even before we get to

66
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,820
the calories outside of thing, we see that there is some variability and probably some individual

67
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:15,500
variability in how many calories one person can consume, and then actually have available as

68
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,260
energy. Lane, I like that you started with this. I'm just going to add a couple of points so that

69
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,980
we can build off this together. So let's even give people the definition of a calorie. And I think

70
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,700
we should remind people that when you and I and most people are talking about calories, we're

71
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:38,300
really talking about kilocalories. And some people will get those confused. So big C calorie is equal

72
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,860
to a thousand little C calories or a K calorie. But regardless of that nomenclature, I think most

73
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,140
people when they're saying I eat 2000 calories are of course referring to kilocalories. Each of

74
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,180
these, one of those, if I'm not mistaken, and you're going to be probably remembering this better than

75
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:05,180
me, Lane, one calorie, I believe is the energy required to heat one gram of water from 14.5 to

76
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,420
15.5 degrees Celsius at one atmosphere. Correct? That sound about right? Bingo. Yeah. Yeah. About

77
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,620
right. I actually have specifically forgotten the exact definition, but it's basically the amount to

78
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,260
increase the degree of water by one degree Celsius. So again, to your point, it's simply a unit of

79
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,860
energy, just as we would think of a jewel as a unit of energy. And I also want to highlight

80
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,660
something you said, which I think is a very important thing for people to understand,

81
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,620
which is when we talk about the conservation of energy, that also implies when you change forms

82
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,740
of energy. So when you eat food, the energy, as you said, is stored within the bonds. It is

83
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,060
chemical energy. We turn that into electrical energy via the electron transport chain,

84
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,940
and then we turn it right back into chemical energy, both in the immediate sense of ATP,

85
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,900
where you again now create the energy in the phosphate bond. But more importantly, as you said,

86
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,940
when you're storing it, you're putting it right back into a hydrocarbon. And it's those carbon,

87
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,380
carbon, carbon hydrogen bonds that if my memory serves me correctly, are the most energy dense

88
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,940
bonds within our body, much more than say a carbon oxygen bond would be. Correct. And that's why,

89
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:27,100
you know, we see fatty acids have much more calories or much more energy per gram compared

90
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,020
to carbohydrate because carbohydrate has more oxygens. Whereas fats through beta oxidation,

91
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,100
where you're having lopping off two carbons with hydrogens, you can pretty much, I mean,

92
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,500
it's not direct, but you can pretty much create acetyl-CoA right from that, which then goes

93
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:48,780
directly into the Krebs cycle. Whereas glucose, there's a lot more involved in getting the ATP

94
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,100
or generating ATP from that. Now, glucose does have benefits in terms of amount of oxygen required

95
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,780
to generate the same ATP. It just depends on the metric you're looking at, right? And then,

96
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,100
of course, the final point you make there, Lane, I think is worth restating because it is so

97
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,420
important, which is, and this will come up later, I think, when we talk about genetic differences

98
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,140
in tolerance to amounts of macronutrients and things like that. But you can really liberate

99
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:19,180
different amounts of energy from the same foods, depending on many things, but presumably based on

100
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,780
your gut microbiome. That's probably one of the things that's going to create a pretty sizable

101
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,060
delta when it comes to how much food you're capturing. In other words, how much of that

102
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,300
chemical energy you're able to recoup and repurpose into electrical energy?

103
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,740
Yeah. I mean, there is evidence, for example, that obesity-prone people, that they have a

104
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,980
flora of gut microbiome, or sorry, a gut microflora that is better able to extract

105
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,780
energy from the foods they eat. Now, that could be reverse causation as well. It could be that

106
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,060
obese people eat a diet that causes this kind of gut microflora to bloom, so on and so forth.

107
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,900
So we've got to be careful about establishing correlation versus causation. And I will say

108
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,260
that when they look at, because they can actually assess how much energy is lost in fecal matter,

109
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,580
it's usually around 5% to 10%, depending on people. And most of your 95% of your

110
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,900
Gaussian distribution falls in there. So it is a significant difference, but what I would tell

111
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,260
people is be cautious about saying, well, this is why we see huge differences between individuals.

112
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,260
Maybe for certain individuals, but I think for the vast majority of people, unless you're

113
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:42,220
literally an outlier, it's probably going to be somewhere relatively close. So I think establishing

114
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,780
that, okay, we understand that there is some variability in how much energy you can extract

115
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,740
from the food you eat. And I'm going to come back to that as well, because there's another aspect,

116
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,940
the tracking portion that we need to talk about as well, that confuses people. Now, let's talk about

117
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,180
the energy outside of things, because this is way more complicated. So there's different ways

118
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,860
people have broken it down. But essentially, you have your BMR, which is your basal metabolic rate.

119
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,900
And what that that's usually about 50 to 70% of the energy people expend per day. And the way I

120
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,220
told is it's basically the cost of keeping the lights on. And we would determine that if you

121
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,380
were putting somebody in a metabolic chamber, I believe that we don't require them to be sleeping,

122
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,940
but it's laying up laying there, but being awake, correct. And that's slightly different from your

123
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,660
energy expenditure while sleeping. Yep. And there are some like you have RMR and you have BMR. And

124
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,340
there are some subtle differences between the two. But I mean, essentially, it's very similar.

125
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,500
I've had my RMR assessed, which is basically you go into a lab, you lay down, they make sure you're

126
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,980
stable for 20 minutes, you don't talk, you don't listen to music, you don't do anything, you just

127
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,500
sit there and breathe, or you lay there and breathe. And I mean, RMR and BMR are going to be very

128
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,660
similar, I'm going to simplify it for our audience just because it's an already complicated subject.

129
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,300
But that's basically the cost of keeping lights on. So the other way to think about it is if you

130
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,500
were in like a coma, per se, where you're awake, having some brain activity, that sort of thing,

131
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,620
but you're not moving, you're not physically moving. That's still about 50 to 70% of people's

132
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,460
total daily energy expenditure. And that's what we refer to as metabolic rate.

133
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,540
And when you had yours measured, Lane, did you have it done using indirect calorimetry?

134
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,220
Yeah, so mine was, when I had it done, I'm anywhere between 1900 and 1950 calories per

135
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,260
day pretty consistently. Tell folks how that works. Because I think when most people say,

136
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,500
I just had my BMR measured, it's usually not the rigorous way that we're talking about using

137
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,100
indirect calorimetry. It's usually relying on heart rate and respiratory rate, which

138
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,460
can probably give some approximation, but it's probably important for people to understand that

139
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,220
there's an enormous error that's introduced when you make that approximation. So what's the

140
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,020
rigorous way to determine energy expenditure? So direct calorimetry is the most rigorous way.

141
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,260
And that is literally, you know, kind of in a bomb kilometer, right? You're in a metabolic chamber.

142
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:20,140
And they are looking at, you know, how much heat you're generating, essentially. And from that heat

143
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,020
that you generate, they're able to determine your total daily energy expenditure. And then using an

144
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,140
equation based on your oxygen consumption versus your CO2 production, they can determine what from

145
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,460
that is your BMR, which is actually the same way they do it for indirect calorimetry. So you're

146
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:43,180
wearing, you're inside this like hood and you're breathing into a tube essentially. And basically

147
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,740
your metabolic rate is very closely associated with how much oxygen you consume. So how much

148
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,740
oxygen you consume versus how much CO2 you expire will one, give you a really good idea of your

149
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:03,020
metabolic rate, because the end products of metabolism are CO2 and water. So when everything

150
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,980
goes through this process of breaking down carbohydrates and fats, it all, if you talk

151
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,540
about like what happens to body fat, it ends up as CO2 and water. Okay. So if they know that, and you

152
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,140
can use a constant for water, if they know that, it's also why they can use doubly labeled water to

153
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,540
estimate energy expenditure. We'll get to that later. But if you know that, and you know these

154
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,900
constants and you make several assumptions, I mean, again, this isn't direct. You're making

155
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,700
assumptions. You're making assumptions about how much is being generated. You can come up with a

156
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:40,860
relatively accurate estimation of your metabolic rate. And for reasons that I can't explain,

157
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,220
this is something I can never forget, which is the coefficients for that equation,

158
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:56,860
the WIR coefficients, right? So energy expenditure is 3.94 times VCO2 plus 1.11 times VCO2. So as you

159
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,340
said, it's heavily weighted to oxygen consumption. It's nearly four times the consumption of oxygen

160
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,060
plus about one times the production of carbon dioxide. And that gives you that. And for anybody

161
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,620
listening to this who's ever had a VO2 max test, I would encourage you to ask the lab that does it

162
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,500
for you to give you the raw data, because what they'll spit out for you, usually in 15 second

163
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,260
intervals, is VO2, VCO2. And while the purpose of that test might be to determine your maximal

164
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:34,940
VO2, you can also plug in these two variables to the WIR equation and get how many calories per

165
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,780
minute you're consuming or requiring to maintain that energy output all the way to your max. It's

166
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,940
actually quite remarkable when you consider that a highly trained individual will easily get to

167
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,700
20 calories per minute of energy demand. Yeah. I mean, if you think about, you know, we say lean

168
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,220
mass is by far the biggest correlate with total daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic

169
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,060
rate. Lean mass requires quite a bit of oxygen compared to like adipose tissue, which is

170
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,380
relatively nonvascular. So it makes a lot of sense that you would see that. And then if you

171
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,820
think about activity, obviously if you start doing activity, it requires a lot of oxygen.

172
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,300
So we have our BMR, which is about in terms of the energy outside of things. And I guess I should

173
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,780
define that. Energy out is your total daily energy expenditure. So all the energy you expend in a day,

174
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:34,940
that's your TDEE, we call it. And the biggest portion of that is your BMR for most people.

175
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,780
Now, if you're an elite athlete who trains like six, eight hours a day, you can get to the point

176
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,100
where your physical activity is actually greater than your BMR. So don't be those listening. Don't

177
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,140
be dogmatic about these numbers. But for most people, 50 to 70% is a relatively accurate

178
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,620
representation. For me, it's probably about 55 to 60% of my total daily energy expenditure,

179
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,860
because I do train like two, two and a half hours a day. So that is a significant contributor.

180
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,060
So we have that. Then we have what's called TEF, which is the Thermic Effect of Food or

181
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:10,700
Diet Induced Thermogenesis. And this is anywhere from five to 10% of your total daily energy

182
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:16,940
expenditure for most people. Very, very hard to measure. Usually it's expressed in terms of

183
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,820
calories per minute, because they're only looking at it in the short term. And when we do studies

184
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,660
of total daily energy expenditure, I mean, usually what they're doing is using a constant for TEF.

185
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,460
They're making an assumption because it's just so hard to measure, unless you're just measuring

186
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,940
that over like the course of a couple of hours or maybe a day at most. But we feel relatively

187
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,420
confident based on the studies out there that it's about five to 10% of your total daily energy

188
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,740
expenditure. So not a big contributor, but still. But it also seems to be macronutrient dependent,

189
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,660
correct? It is. It is. So that's one of the things I'm going to get to.

190
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,380
We'll come back to that when we get to you.

191
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,980
Yeah, yeah. And then if we look at the last component, we have our physical activity. And

192
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,900
this encompasses all physical activities. So people hear this and they think exercise,

193
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:13,580
but actually the biggest, for a lot of people, their biggest component of physical activity

194
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,500
is actually what's called NEAT, which is Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis.

195
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,260
And that is something that's actually extremely modifiable. And we see it in terms of one,

196
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,860
people who are obese resistant, what we term obese resistant, they tend to fidget a lot. They

197
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:37,420
tend to move a lot. I was like this as a kid. I still am. Whereas people who are obese prone

198
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,540
tend to have very low NEAT. In fact, there was a study done by Liebel in 1995 where they overfed

199
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,420
people by, I want to say, a thousand calories per day. And they determined this. They looked at

200
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,740
their total daily energy expenditure in a metabolic award. So very accurate. And then they took that

201
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,420
number and added a thousand calories on top of it. And they looked at how much weight people gained.

202
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,940
Some people gained more than they expected. One person did not even have significant weight gain.

203
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,660
And what they found was this individual's NEAT, their spontaneous physical activity,

204
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:17,500
went up so much it just compensated for that extra calories. And so I think this is what

205
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,100
people really don't understand as well. I want to be very purposeful about how we define NEAT

206
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:31,180
because when it comes to NEAT versus exercise, exercise is purposeful. So something I'll hear

207
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,380
a lot is, well, I'm going to go do a walk and get my NEAT up. No, you're doing exercise. Maybe I'm

208
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,100
being a little bit pedantic, but it's important because NEAT is what I'm talking about. Fidgeting,

209
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,780
not right now because now I'm thinking about it, but I'm waving my hands around. I'm kind of

210
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,580
moving from one foot to the next. I've seen Peter that you move your fingers and you'll

211
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,260
kind of twitch your neck. That's what all that stuff, even though it seems like nothing,

212
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,100
thousands of those movements over the course of a day actually add up. So then I have people say,

213
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,140
well, I'm just going to tap my foot to get NEAT up or fidget. Well, guess what's going to happen.

214
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,940
Whenever you try to do something that also requires your brain, you're going to stop doing

215
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,460
that because you actually can't really do two things at once in terms of thinking about it.

216
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,180
So this truly is spontaneous energy expenditure and appears to be modifiable by about five to

217
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,380
600 calories per day. And we do see this with overfeeding and underfeeding. So people who are,

218
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,140
and we'll get into talking about metabolic adaptation and how this affects things,

219
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,460
but people who lose like 10% of their body weight, they've seen up to a 500 calorie reduction in

220
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,660
NEAT. So that's a big portion of it. And then obviously you have your purposeful exercise.

221
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:53,820
So if we look at energy out or energy in metabolizable energy, energy out, BMR, TEF,

222
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,060
NEAT and exercise, I'm simplifying this equation a little bit, but though that's essentially it.

223
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,340
So when people, if people want to invalidate energy balance, what I always say is, listen,

224
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:13,020
you ate those carbons, something must happen to them. You cannot just, they don't flutter off

225
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,300
into oblivion and you don't create them out of nothing, right? Something has to happen to them.

226
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,380
And we have a lot of metabolic tracer studies to pretty much know what happens to them.

227
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:29,660
I think the confusion becomes, well, I tracked my calories. I ate in a 500 calorie deficit and

228
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:37,660
I didn't lose weight. First off, if we look at where these mistakes come in, people weigh

229
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,100
themselves sporadically. And if you only weighed yourself once a week, I would say it's virtually

230
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,260
meaningless. When we are trying to get data on people, we're very regimented with how we do it.

231
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,380
So it's you weigh in first thing in the morning after voiding your bladder and bowel, if possible,

232
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,340
fasted, first thing you do, as soon as your feet hit the floor after you've gone to the bathroom,

233
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,260
you weigh in. And then we take that weight every single day. And then we look at the average and

234
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,300
then we compare week to week averages. Because anybody who's ever tracked their weight, and I'm

235
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,940
sure you've had this experience, Peter, where you're eating very consistently, you're tracking

236
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,620
your weight and it'll easily fluctuate by one to 2% per day. So if you're 200 pounds, you could be

237
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:27,500
204, you could be 196. And I always tell people, it's like the stock market. Sometimes there's a

238
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,820
good explanation for why it goes up and down like that. But other times there's no good explanation

239
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,100
whatsoever. And you don't just want to take like one isolated data point. And this is also with

240
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,420
people who get DEXs done and they go, they freak out because I've lost a pound of lean body mass.

241
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,460
No, you went and had it done at a different time where you're less hydrated.

242
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,580
Or on a different machine or with the different software.

243
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,780
Tech. Yeah, I tell people, I don't want to tell them not to get DEXs done, but unless you're going

244
00:22:52,780 --> 00:23:00,300
to do it, same tech, same machine, same conditions, it's unlike cool. It doesn't really mean anything,

245
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:08,220
but you haven't. So when you look at that, so you can have somebody theoretically, and I've

246
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,940
shown this example with clients, where I've said your average weight is down by a pound. But if

247
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,620
I had weighed you on this day last week and this day this week, you would think you were up by two

248
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,300
and a half pounds. So people will start doing a calorie deficit diet. And they'll say, well,

249
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,300
see, I gained weight, so this doesn't work. No, that was a fluid shift from day to day to day

250
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,260
changes in weight are much more dictated by fluid shifts than they are adipose tissue levels. But

251
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,940
your weekly and monthly changes in weight are much more dictated by your actual body mass.

252
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,820
So that's one thing that confuses people. The other thing that really will kind of confuse people

253
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,540
is thinking that they can track their energy expenditure accurately. So these watches,

254
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:02,780
there was a recent study done in 2018. I guess some people went, I consider that recent. I do

255
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,900
because the years tend to blend together for me now. But they looked at about 20 different devices

256
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,620
and found that these overestimate your exercise energy expenditure by

257
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,540
23 or sorry, 28 to 93%. So if it says you burn 500 calories, you probably actually burn more like

258
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:27,340
260 to 400 calories. Right. And so again, people say, well, I, you know, I burned 1000 calories on

259
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,740
the treadmill today. Like, you know, and I always tell people, what do you think is more likely that

260
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,140
you have found a way to violate the laws of thermodynamics or that this watch might not be

261
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,740
accurate because I'm going to go with the latter. So there's that it's very funny how like,

262
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,460
people are very distrustful of certain things and other things. They're just like, oh yeah,

263
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:54,620
I totally trust this thing. So there's that. And then there's also the fact that we can't

264
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,460
completely accurately track calories in either, because there is up to a 20% error label that's

265
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:07,820
allowed in foods. So I think that's where some of the confusion comes in. The other thing I will say

266
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:15,740
that's worth saying that will really upset some people is people are horrible estimators of their

267
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:22,460
energy intake. Horrible. There was a study done, I think it was back in the 90s where they took

268
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,580
self-report people who were self-reportedly resistant to weight loss. These were people who

269
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,500
said, I eat 1200 calories a day, I can't lose weight. They put them in a metabolic ward and

270
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,700
they also had them do doubly labeled water, which is basically a free living way of determining

271
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,780
energy expenditure. Plus they had the direct callimetry and they said to them, we want you

272
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,500
to track your food and report it to us, but we will know if you're incorrect, like we will know.

273
00:25:51,980 --> 00:26:01,340
So the average under-reporting was by 50%. So they were under-reporting their energy intake by 50%

274
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,180
on average. And that's right in line with a lot of the other studies. Most, if we look at people

275
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,900
who are overweight and obese, most of them under-report by 30 to 70%. The demographic of obese

276
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:20,060
women tend to be at the higher end of that. Obese men tend to be at the lower end of that. And then

277
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,140
even lean people-

278
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,700
Yeah, I was about to say for lean people, would the same bias, I mean bias might be the wrong word,

279
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,380
but would the same error in reporting still exist?

280
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,460
So there is an error, it's less. I think it's around 18%, but even dieticians under-report

281
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,660
by about 10%.

282
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,620
That's kind of amazing that they could be within 10%.

283
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,380
Yeah. Some of the subjects actually argued with the researchers about it, which is funny.

284
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:56,220
But people don't like that kind of self-accountability sort of thing. And what I'll tell people is, now,

285
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,060
the message people will hear when they hear that is, you're saying I'm a liar. And I don't think

286
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,300
that people were necessarily lying. I think people are horrible estimators of their food intake.

287
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:14,780
Because if I put a salad in front of you and I dump 50 grams of oil on it versus 20 grams of oil,

288
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,780
versus 20 grams of oil, you will have absolutely no idea of the difference. You might be able to

289
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,500
taste like a little bit of difference in mouth feel, but most people go, ah, that's a salad.

290
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,940
It's got some dressing on it. It's probably 200, 300 calories. Meanwhile, it's got nuts.

291
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,700
It's got bacon, eggs. It's got oil, all that kind of stuff. And I'm not saying anything,

292
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,700
those things are inherently bad. I'm just saying it's all energy. So I think that's another big

293
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,300
component is people are just horrible estimators of their food intake. And what I'll tell people

294
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,860
is if you really believe that you are not able to eat in the calorie deficit, lose weight. I want

295
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,580
you to just for one week, track every single piece of food you put in your mouth. No licks, no bites,

296
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,780
no snacks, not an account. I'm not saying you got to do this for the rest of your life,

297
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,620
but just do this for one week. And usually I'll come back with people who are mind blown.

298
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,340
They'll say, well, I thought I was eating 600 calories. I was eating 2,700 because they didn't

299
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,940
realize it like they grabbed that handful of nuts, or they grab a handful of potato chips,

300
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,300
or whatever it is, when they take a bite of a candy bar. And yeah, in isolation,

301
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,940
none of that stuff is a big deal. But when you accumulate it throughout the course of a day,

302
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:33,580
it can be a big deal. Yeah, about eight years ago, when I was really, really interested in this

303
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,740
topic, I had the luxury of being able to spend a couple of days, probably about a total of six days

304
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:45,420
in total inside a metabolic chamber in two day blocks. So three, two day blocks, or four,

305
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,940
two day blocks inside a metabolic chamber. Probably wasn't actually very much fun at the

306
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,540
time, but actually it was the most fun thing ever, Lane, because it was everything I love.

307
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,740
First of all, I got to be in a room. Nobody could bug me. And we had arranged it so that I could

308
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:05,420
do all my exercising. So I had my bike on a fluid trainer. I had tons of weights in there,

309
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:15,980
plyometric box, a bed. It was a dream. It was literally a vacation. And I had this amazing

310
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,780
food being prepared by a metabolic kitchen. You've got this staff that is making to the

311
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,980
gram everything that we had agreed at the outset we were going to be testing. And then after the

312
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,860
fact, I went and did the 10 day doubly labeled water experience, which I guess we could explain

313
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:37,740
for people what that is. So water, everybody knows is H2O, hydrogen two oxygen one. But it turns

314
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,340
out there's a heavy form of hydrogen called deuterium. And there's another form of oxygen

315
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,260
that doesn't have 16, I'm so glad in my chemistry now, is it 16 protons or is it?

316
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,140
A neutron.

317
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:57,340
A neutron, 16 neutrons. So instead they have one with 18 neutrons. And so you drink a D2 regular O

318
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,220
and then an H2 heavy O. When you drink this, you basically get to exploit a trick, which is by

319
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:11,020
collecting your urine, you're measuring the hydrogen that's coming out without measuring

320
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,660
the carbon that's coming out. So you can impute what your VCO2 is effectively. And you collect

321
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,620
urine serially. And over the course of 10 or 12 days, you get an estimate. And so the only

322
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,580
instruction to me when doing this was try to be weight stable for that period of time,

323
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,540
which I was able to do. And it was interesting. That was a time in my life when I was really

324
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,780
tracking ins and outs pretty well, mostly just out of curiosity, not because I was trying to lose

325
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:47,260
weight or gain weight. I wasn't. And by my calculations, I was about 4400 calories in,

326
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:54,220
which would imply about 4400 calories of energy expenditure. The DLW ended up being 4200.

327
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,300
So I was surprised it was pretty close because I agree. I expected it to be way far off.

328
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,860
But it was such an amazing experience. And it's like I almost wish stuff like that could be done

329
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,700
commercially because of course I had to do this with an awesome guy named Eric Ravison at the

330
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,100
Pennington Biomedical Research Institute. And Eric's staff had done this for me. So it was,

331
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,020
you know, I was able to do this in a research lab, not, but this would be an amazing thing that I

332
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:27,340
wish you could order a home kit, drink this stuff down, run it out for 10 days and truly get a sense

333
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,740
of your energy expenditure. Right. What I would say is most, so since you're supposed to be weight

334
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,380
stable, most people could actually do it just by default because at the end of the day, if you're

335
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,420
weight stable within a reasonable amount, then whatever you're eating is actually for all intensive

336
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,940
purposes, your total daily energy expenditure. Oh, yes. Yes. I'm just saying it's so hard for

337
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,900
people to met to your point. Like that's, that is a hard thing for someone to do unless they're

338
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,820
going to have a food scale with them everywhere and they're right. Yeah. Yeah. And then the other

339
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,260
thing is it becomes a little bit of an artificial exercise. Cause even if somebody says I'm willing

340
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:03,500
to for 10 days measure everything, then you get this sort of Hawthorne effect of they won't take

341
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,900
that extra bite of the candy bar. Cause A they don't want to measure it and B and they won't grab

342
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,580
the handful of nuts and they won't do this. That and the other thing. Whereas if you say, look,

343
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,900
I'm just going to eat the way I normally eat for a week and not measure anything. All I have to do

344
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,500
is maintain my weight, which means if I get on and do what you're saying, right? Every morning you

345
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,180
get on that scale and you kind of tweak it up and down, then you can say, okay, in a truly free

346
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:30,300
living environment without the Hawthorne effect, this is my energy intake. So it's so funny. You

347
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,780
say that in science, we know that right down to individual particles, when you observe it,

348
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,580
it changes its behavior. Absolutely. And that's true for just on the atomic level.

349
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,500
And it's true for people. And in fact, that's, we have a coaching team called team bio lane,

350
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,580
where we do, we do one-on-one coaching. And we have a team of seven coaches. And one of the big

351
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,740
things that we train our coaches on is like, Hey, if somebody's like really resistant to something,

352
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,380
just see if they'll just track what they're already doing. Right? Like just, just to enlighten

353
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,540
them, right? And we'll tell them like, listen, we want the raw data. We don't, don't change

354
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:15,660
anything. And almost every time just by them doing that for a week. Wow. You know, I lost

355
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,460
half a kilo or a kilo this week. And it's like, yeah, like you said, it's, you didn't take that

356
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,660
extra bite of snacks. We have that problem actually in our practice with our patients, because we,

357
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,380
for at least half the patients, once we do our intake, we realize nutrition is going to be an

358
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,300
important thing to modify. And a lot of times we want to see what the baseline is. And so we go

359
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,700
one step further, which is we do exactly that, which is, you know, we don't want to see you do

360
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,460
anything different, but we really go out of our way to say, please do not change anything. In other

361
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,980
words, eat that candy bar and grab that handful of nuts and take that extra, you know, pour that

362
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,780
glass of wine a little taller than you think it should be like, do everything naturally. And even

363
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,900
still to your point, it's almost impossible to get a true baseline once you apply those constraints.

364
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,260
Yeah, we can go over the, that just shows you how inaccurate 24 hour food recalls can be and all

365
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:15,820
that kind of stuff. So yeah, and so I think those are some of the biggest misunderstandings. Now,

366
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,180
I do want to address the whole is a calorie, a calorie thing. Yes, all calories are equal.

367
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:27,260
Because again, calories are just a unit of measurement. All sources of calories are not

368
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,740
equal in terms of their effects on energy expenditure and metabolizable energy. We already

369
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,420
talked about soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. And then if we look at the TEF of various foods,

370
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:45,420
protein. So let's start with fat fat, fat has the lowest TEF. So if we talk about TEF is basically

371
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:52,460
the amount of energy the system has to put in to extract the chemical energy out of food. So you

372
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,740
can't just put it in and then boom, you have the energy, your body has to do work to get it. Now,

373
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,540
it's always a higher net, even on stuff like you know, people say, well, celery is a negative

374
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,700
calorie food because your money has to put more, no, no, no, they're, unless we're talking about

375
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:12,940
tree bark, there is no energy negative food, right? Even celery has like 50 calories, I think it's

376
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,340
or it might be five calories per hundred grams. So very, very low, but still not negative. We would

377
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:24,780
not have lived long as a species if we had energy negative foods. So if we think about how much

378
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,220
energy has to go in to get energy out, we have, you know, how many calories you consume and present

379
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,580
as metabolizable energy. And then how many calories we net out of that after the energy

380
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:41,100
expenditure required to get the chemical energy out is done. So if we look at fats, fats are the

381
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,460
lowest and they're about zero to three calories. Meaning if you eat a hundred calories from fat,

382
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,300
you net about 97 to a hundred calories. And then we have carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are about five

383
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:56,300
to 10%. So if you eat a hundred calories of carbohydrate, you net about 90 to 95 calories.

384
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:03,500
Protein is around 20 to 30%. So if you eat a hundred calories from protein, you net about 70

385
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,260
to 80 calories. Now people will hear that and they make a much bigger deal of it than it actually is,

386
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,780
because when you consider how much of a proportion of your overall energy expenditure it is,

387
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,660
and I do this example where I'm like, let's double your protein and see how much more TEF you get,

388
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,500
it ends up being like 150 calories if you double your protein, right? And we're talking about people

389
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,660
already eating like, you know, a standard amount of protein to a really high amount of protein.

390
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:34,460
So yeah, it helps, but it's probably not the cure for the obesity crisis, right? So it is important.

391
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,980
It's important to talk about although I mean, to push back on that for a second, Wayne, I've never

392
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:45,740
thought about this until you said that. One of the challenges when thinking about weight loss,

393
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,220
sustainable weight loss over a long enough period of time is how much is enough on a daily basis

394
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:57,820
before an adaptation would take place that would correct it. So for example, if we were talking-

395
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,100
You're asking the right questions.

396
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,780
Yeah, yeah. So if we were talking about, let's just say one of your dieticians came to you and

397
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,020
said, Lane, I've got this idea. I've got this patient who is truly by every metric 50 pounds

398
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,180
overweight. Like, you know, we could do it on lean body mass, body fat, whatever. But this,

399
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,660
if this guy's 50 pounds lighter in a year, everything about his life has gotten better

400
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,420
from a health perspective. And this person said, look, I'm going to double their protein intake.

401
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,060
And let's not make it the extreme example of where you're getting an extra 150. Let's just say it's

402
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:34,620
a hundred calories or 75 calories. If you could create an energy deficit, and this again assumes

403
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,420
that you can change nothing else. And I mean, there's so many silly assumptions, but think of

404
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,820
this almost more as a thought experiment. If you could create an energy debt of 75 calories per day

405
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:52,700
by a macronutrient shift to more protein over a long enough period of time, could it be relevant?

406
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,900
It could. However, what we're neglecting to talk about is something I briefly mentioned

407
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,140
which is metabolic adaptation. And so I think this is the other big thing that confuses people.

408
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,300
They think energy in, energy out. These are static things that do not affect each other.

409
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:17,900
And the reality is they are intrinsically tied to each other. So anybody who's ever tried to lose

410
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,140
weight, if you went on a, let's say a 500 calorie deficit per day, which is a pretty significant

411
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,780
deficit. Do you just lose linearly one pound per week until you no longer exist and you die

412
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,260
because there's no more body weight? No, we all know that eventually like that plateaus, right?

413
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:39,500
Now, part of that is just because you have less body mass. So your body has to expend less energy

414
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,780
in order to just maintain upright posture and those sorts of things. But then there's also the

415
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,060
neat component. As you lose weight, you become spontaneously less active. We see this in animals

416
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:57,260
all the way up to humans. Then not just that voluntary exercise tends to go down past a certain

417
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,860
point. Like if you're very obese and you start to lose weight, it's not really going to affect this

418
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,900
that much because you have such an energy surplus. But especially people who are going average to

419
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,340
lean, your vault, like your will to exercise will go down. I've definitely experienced that during

420
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,460
contests, perhaps getting very lean, you know, just having to like will myself to get up off the couch.

421
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:28,860
And then if you look at their BMR, you actually get a reduction in BMR above what you would expect

422
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:34,220
based on the loss of lean tissue and fat tissue because fat tissue is somewhat metabolically

423
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:43,260
active. There's actually up to like on average a 15% reduction in BMR. So almost at every level of

424
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:49,180
energy expenditure, your body is kind of fighting you to get back to homeostasis, to reestablish

425
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:56,620
homeostasis. And so we see this in people who lose weight. So if we take people with the same lean

426
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,740
body mass and fat mass, people who have never been obese, people who have been obese and weight

427
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:07,100
reduced, the weight reduced people will have a lower BMR than the people that have never had to

428
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:15,020
lose fat. And so it's like this evolutionary, John Speakman had a really good paper on this,

429
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,820
thinking about this kind of getting into set point theory, that we have this kind of native

430
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:26,940
set point that the body likes to be at. And the idea is kind of okay, what are what's regulating

431
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,700
the ends of that set point. So we understand that if we get too lean, lose too much fat mass,

432
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,740
we die. That's a really negative outcome for evolution, right? You can't pass on your DNA

433
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,380
if you're dead. At the higher ends, because there are there are things that work against obesity,

434
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,740
like we already talked about that neat goes up if you overfeed your BMR also goes up if you overfeed.

435
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,820
But obviously, based on what's happening in society with this shift towards adiposity,

436
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:04,780
the regulations on the going up are not as strong as going down. And so if you think about it from

437
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:12,860
an evolutionary perspective, the risk of getting too overweight in the short term, because obesity

438
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,740
is not going to kill you when you're 40. It's going to be the difference between you dying at 80

439
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:25,580
versus 70. That's what the research tends to suggest. The risk in the short term,

440
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,380
is predation, or, you know, fighting or that some sort of physical altercation where you can't

441
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:39,500
defend yourself very well, you can't run away. The risk of predation, after man learned how to use

442
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:45,660
tools, pretty much went to zero. I mean, yes, you have shark attacks, and you have these things, but

443
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,380
I mean, there are essentially lightning strikes when humans get killed by animals or even other

444
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,660
people. I mean, it's very, very rare. But then we look at the risk of starvation is very real,

445
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:04,300
even now in some parts of the world, and was very real in this country until the 1900s. I mean,

446
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:12,860
even into probably the early 1900s. And so it makes sense that the regulatory mechanisms

447
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:18,140
were more powerful on that bottom end to prevent people from becoming too lean,

448
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,740
than they are on the top end. And so bringing this back to energy balance,

449
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,500
you have to think of energy balance, like a car that changes its gas efficiency based on how

450
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:36,460
full the tank is. So think about if you had a car, that when you have the gas tank filled all the way

451
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,580
up, it gets horrible gas mileage. But as that gas tank starts to go down, and think about your gas

452
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:49,100
tank as your body's adipose stores, your energy stores, as that gas tank starts to go down,

453
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,580
you become more and more and more efficient to buy the time there's very little gas left. It's

454
00:42:53,580 --> 00:43:00,220
just sipping gas. It really is kind of a dramatic comparison, but it is an apt comparison. And I

455
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:06,860
think the biggest thing to take away is we cannot know, and we can know at a snapshot in time what

456
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:14,060
your energy expenditure probably is. But it's likely to change. And it's a sliding scale,

457
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:19,900
and it depends on a lot of variables. And so that's also led people to say, well, see,

458
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,580
we can't accurately track calories in, we can't accurately track calories out. There's no point

459
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,340
in tracking calories. And what I would say is that you're kind of throwing the baby out with

460
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,780
the bathwater. I'm not saying you have to track calories to lose weight, because obviously you

461
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,700
don't, because there's all kinds of methodology that people use to lose weight that doesn't

462
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,900
involve tracking calories. But it would be like saying, well, keeping a budget is worthless,

463
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,260
because I have multiple streams of revenue, and I have investments. And so I can't know exactly how

464
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,620
much income I'm getting. And also, you know, things pop up like your car breaks down, you know, you

465
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,460
have repairs to your house, so you can't exactly know what your expenses are going to be. So therefore

466
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:05,340
keeping a budget is worthless. And what always, so the comparison I make is, you don't have to

467
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:11,100
keep a budget to save money. But it's a useful tool, it gets you in the ballpark, and it gets

468
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,260
you a baseline. And I would say the same thing about tracking calories. And it might be that the

469
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:23,020
act of keeping a budget alone is what enables you to think twice before a frivolous purchase,

470
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,140
as one example, right? And we know this too, when people try. So what's so funny is the

471
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,900
parallels here. So did you know that the average person, I'm kind of a finance nerd, average person

472
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:40,700
under reports their debt by about 155%. And again, it may not even be a lying thing, it might just be

473
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,940
they have really horrible ideas about how much debt they actually have. And so same thing when you

474
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,620
have people track their budget, well, now all of a sudden, they're on their best behavior, because

475
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,100
not only do they don't want to admit to anybody else, they don't want to admit to themselves,

476
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:00,300
where they're actually spending their money. And so I use that comparison a lot when it comes to

477
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,860
tracking calories. And we use it a lot with our clients is, hey, look at this thing like a budget.

478
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,020
So Peter, you made the example that you were maintaining your body weight on 4400 calories a

479
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:14,060
day. And by the way, for the listener wondering, I was training a heck of a lot more than I train

480
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:21,020
now. That's when I was, I mean, truthfully, probably exercising three hours a day.

481
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:30,300
So you had a very large budget, right? Now, if you have a large budget, if I'm talking monetary,

482
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,500
can I is it is a sports car a good purchase? I mean, you know, if it brings you happiness and joy,

483
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,900
sure, but not if you can't afford it, right. But if you can, if you make a if you have a large

484
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,460
enough budget, you can pay your mortgage and you can pay your utilities and you can, you know, do

485
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,740
all the responsibilities that you need to and you still have some leftover to buy that sports car.

486
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:57,420
And it brings you happiness. I would say go for it. Right. By the same token, if you make, you know,

487
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,060
50,000 a year and you're going to buy a $70,000 or $100,000 sports car, I would say that's probably

488
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:07,820
a really bad idea. Right. Unless you've got a ton of money sucked away in the bank. And so by the

489
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:13,900
same token, when people see, you know, kind of like, you know, what I what I really tend to utilize

490
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,220
flexible dieting for myself and a lot of our clients, people say, well, they're just eating

491
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,300
junk food all the time. No, no, what you're seeing is people are posting this because they're so

492
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,820
shocked that they can eat some junk food and lose weight that they tend to post that stuff. And

493
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,380
people say, well, you know, that can't be good for them. And my response is, you know, everything is

494
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,500
on a continuum here. You know, there's a big difference between somebody having like a small

495
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,660
bowl of ice cream that they fit into their budget for the day that allows them to kind of

496
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:49,500
feel less restricted and feel like they're they're not missing out, that prevents them from having

497
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,700
a huge binge session, you know, down the road when their willpower eventually breaks. It doesn't

498
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,380
work for everybody, but it works for some people. If they can have that little ice cream, but they're

499
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,700
still getting enough dietary fiber, they're still hitting the protein, they're not going over calories,

500
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,180
they're getting micronutrients in, I would say, what's the problem with that? Right?

501
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,580
This is probably the question I actually get asked the most lane from patients. And I'm guessing you

502
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:20,220
do a lot, which is, Peter, do you think it is better to be completely restrictive

503
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:29,340
or to have frequent cheat meals like one meal a week or one day a week where you go completely

504
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:35,900
off the rails or just to have a little bit of stuff that is an indulgence every single day? And

505
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,340
I actually I don't have a great answer for them other than there is no right answer here. And

506
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,300
even for an individual, that might change. And I'll use always my example, which was for three

507
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:53,660
years, I was on a ketogenic diet with the exception of one day. So in whatever 365 times

508
00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:00,140
three is for that many days, I never deviated from a ketogenic diet except for one meal

509
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,180
when I had about seven pieces of cake at my wife's birthday. And I said, that was really

510
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,940
interesting. Like I'm amazed I was able to do it. I look back at that period, which was 2011 to 2014.

511
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:17,180
And I think I don't know how you did it. I could never do it again. It'd be very hard for me to

512
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:23,980
go on a ketogenic diet for more than two weeks now. So and if I did, if I try, if I if someone

513
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,940
put a gun in my head and said, I really want you to do this for a year. I just can't imagine I

514
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,660
could. I mean, the reality of it is like that would be a very difficult thing to do. And so for me,

515
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:42,060
like I don't know what the word is, but like I can definitely get away with a daily indulgence

516
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,420
or a weekly indulgence. And it's very easy for me to go right back on program because I basically

517
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,220
follow a very simple rule, which is never do too bad things back to back. Like if you ever if you

518
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:57,180
ever miss a workout that which sometimes is going to happen, the single most important thing is

519
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,020
making sure the next day you work out. Yeah, get back on the horse. Yeah. If you and if you ever

520
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:07,260
have like a complete blowout meal, the single most important meal is the next one. So so that

521
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,900
works for me. But I also realize in working with so many people, there are some people who do very

522
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,300
well in a highly, highly restricted environment. And when they deviate from that restricted

523
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:24,540
environment, it sets them off on a path that doesn't make sense. So I mean, do you have any

524
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,340
insights for helping someone predict where they're going to be? Or do you just say, no, you know what?

525
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:34,700
Just try them all out. Try all of these approaches and let's revisit in a month. I think part of it

526
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:40,860
depends on person's personality and their individual psychology. What we know is that if you want to

527
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:45,580
lose weight specifically, you are going to have to use some form of restriction, right, whether it's

528
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:53,660
calorie counting points, carb restriction, fat restriction, you know, unprocessed food, whatever,

529
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,820
you're gonna have to use fasting, you're gonna have to use some form of restriction, right,

530
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,300
either some form of dietary restriction, calorie restriction or time restriction,

531
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,940
you have to do something there. And all of them, when we say calorie restriction, we talk about

532
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,100
counting calories and active loop, but all of these things work because they restrict calories.

533
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,700
That's that's also important to note. I want to come back to that, by the way, because this is

534
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:20,060
to me the crux of where I think people will assume you and I don't agree, but I'm pretty sure we do

535
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,740
agree. But let's go with that thread. And then I'm going to come back to the jugular question around

536
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:29,420
that. Very simple. You have to have some form of restriction, but you should pick the form of

537
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:35,340
restriction that feels least restrictive to you as an individual. And this is where people get

538
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,220
really crossed up. And I'll give you an example. People find will find that form of restriction

539
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,980
that felt really unrestricted to them. And you hear it all the times. I tried intermittent fasting,

540
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:49,020
it felt like I wasn't even dieting, I lost 50 pounds, and it wasn't even hard. Then they will

541
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:54,780
assume that this is the right one, that this is the right approach for everyone because it was

542
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:02,780
the right approach for them. And we tend to retroactively then try to justify why physiologically

543
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,060
that also is the best approach. And this is why you hear people make kind of crazy claims about

544
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:14,860
whether it's low carb or intermittent fasting or any one of these diets, which are all excellent

545
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,500
tools. You know, people think that I don't like ketogenic diets or that I don't like intermittent

546
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,620
fasting or anything like that. And that's not true. I just am not a fan of insane claims about

547
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:31,180
those particular diets. And I think part of the problem is people will say something like, well,

548
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,740
I tried restricting calories, that didn't work. I went on a ketogenic diet and I was eating more

549
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:42,060
in lost weight. You probably felt like you were eating more. But unless you were weighing out,

550
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,860
again, you were weighing out. And the other thing that we should talk about is when you go to a

551
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:51,900
ketogenic diet where you have really limited food choices, there's not a whole lot of options for

552
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:58,620
snacking. You're mostly eating kind of like defined meal foods, right? Intermittent fasting,

553
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:05,260
you're not really snacking, right? You're having defined meals. By the way, that is a very, very,

554
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:12,380
very vigorously present characteristic of people who lose weight and keep it off is they don't

555
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,900
really snack. They have defined meals. And there is, I realize I'm going on a tangent here, but

556
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,100
there is something to be said for snacks do not appear to be as satiating, not just because of

557
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,820
the food, but because of the mindset, because when you snack, you tend to do it like not being

558
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,700
mindful about it. And it doesn't have the same satiety effect. So one of the things we tell our

559
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:39,500
clients is, hey, stop snacking. Not that again, if you like snacks and they work for you and you can

560
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,460
fit them in your calories, it's fine. But if you're having trouble, try stop, stop snacking.

561
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,500
And they say, oh my gosh, like, I didn't even really feel like I was that less hungry. And all

562
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,740
of a sudden I'm losing weight again, cut three, 400 calories out. Yeah. I'll add one point to that

563
00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:02,940
lane, which is when, so I agree just empirically that if you can absolutely eliminate what you

564
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:09,900
eat between defined meals, and that could be two or three meals per day, most people will have not

565
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,220
just an improvement of body weight and body composition, but biomarkers get better. I mean,

566
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,300
you tend to not be snacking on the best things to begin with.

567
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,660
And actually this is where one of the things where I have found fasting to be a valuable tool

568
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,740
because if you put somebody through a three, five, or even longer day fast, I'm talking

569
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:37,260
water only fast, even once in their life, they learn a very important lesson, which is I'm not

570
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:46,700
going to die if I'm hungry, acutely. If I made you fast for 40 days, you might die. But I pretty

571
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:53,260
much don't think there's a human being on this planet outside of the most sick individual who

572
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:01,100
couldn't go five days without food and subsiding only on water and minerals. And something about

573
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:07,500
doing that, even if you do it once for no other reason, it teaches you a couple of things. One,

574
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:14,540
you can do it. That's a big aha moment. Two, hunger comes in waves. So that five day period

575
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:20,620
of eating nothing, you will have periods of time when you literally want to eat your arm,

576
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,380
and you will have periods during that five days when you have forgotten that you're fasting.

577
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:33,420
And so when you take that mindset into, okay, Lane, I just put you through this five days of

578
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,220
very difficult fasting. Now we're going to go to a regimen where I just don't want you to eat

579
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:44,300
any snacks. And that means from noon till six, I don't want you eating anything.

580
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,700
And now all of a sudden you're like, at three o'clock, I'm really hungry. But you now anchor

581
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,260
that to something that was so much more severe, which is, wait a minute, I'm really hungry because

582
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,220
I haven't eaten in three hours. I'm going to eat in three hours. I think I can make it. And at least

583
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:06,060
for me and for a number of patients that I've used this sort of method with, it's a very powerful

584
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:11,260
tool. And you don't need to become a fasting guru to do this, right? You don't have to do a quarterly

585
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:17,580
fast to experience this. I think just one fast will teach a person this lesson. And I certainly

586
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:23,260
remember the first time I really had that aha moment when I did my first really long fast and

587
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:28,300
realized everything that I knew intellectually, but all of a sudden it emotionally made sense as well.

588
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,900
Well, people confuse hunger and appetite a lot. So there's, here's the other big thing is people

589
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,460
say, well, you don't get as hungry on the ketogenic diet or you don't get as hungry on the plant,

590
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:45,020
plant-based diet. You don't get as hungry on XYZ. I say that's true, but there's a lot more reasons

591
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:49,500
people eat other than hunger. In fact, I would argue that some of the major reasons people eat

592
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:56,940
has nothing to do with physical hunger, that it's actually societal cues, stress, and various other

593
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:03,900
things. And so one of the things we'll tell our clients, boredom is a big one for me. Absolutely.

594
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,060
One of the reasons that exercise people, one of the reasons exercise works so well is one,

595
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,780
it sensitizes you to satiety signals. That's actually the most powerful effect it has on

596
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:19,020
weight loss. You actually become more sensitive to your satiety hormones, but two, you're spending

597
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:27,660
an hour doing something physical where you're not bored and eating, right? So it makes a difference.

598
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,180
But one of the things we tell our clients is like, listen, if you want to lose weight,

599
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,780
you're going to be hungry at some point. Like this is just something like physically hungry.

600
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:43,180
You will be. And like this is coming from somebody who has been stage lean as a body builder with

601
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,900
absolutely minimal amounts of body fat. When I talk about the level of discomfort,

602
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,900
it is an all consuming, you cannot think about anything else other than when you're going to

603
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,860
eat next. When you finish your meal, you're hungry five minutes later and already thinking about your

604
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:04,700
next meal. And the level of fatigue is so high that the best way I can describe standing up off

605
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:10,380
a chair is a monumental effort. There's no other way to describe it. And we talked about this in

606
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,860
the first podcast, but just because I find it so amazing, can we can we relive a few minutes of

607
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,900
that lane? So going into a show, we're obviously referring to your bodybuilding stuff, not your

608
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:25,900
powerlifting stuff. You'll be what, 4% roughly on stage? It depends on what the metric. I mean,

609
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:33,740
I've I've caliper it at 2%. In DEXA is the gold standard. But again, it's still I tell people,

610
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,660
unless you're a cadaver and they're excising your adipose tissue, you'll never know exactly

611
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:42,060
what your adipose tissue is because all these measurements make assumptions. On DEXA, I was

612
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:46,540
probably five or 6%. That's where a lot of stage lean bodybuilders end up end up being.

613
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:53,420
So how many days leading to that moment on stage? Are you really in the throes of this type of

614
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,660
discomfort that you're describing? I will tell you that on calipers, I can get to about 7%

615
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,860
come down from like 14 or 15, which is where if I'm up to like 230 pounds, I'll be 14 or 15,

616
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:12,940
probably more like 15 on calipers. Get to seven. No problem. Like that doesn't even hardly faze me.

617
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:21,660
I've done it so many times. From seven to two or 3% is exponentially more difficult.

618
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,340
And that'll take you how many weeks?

619
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:30,780
Probably 12 to 16 to go for those from seven to two. Because again, it's not just losing the

620
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,980
weight. It's also maintain the lean mass to maintaining the lean mass as a drug free athlete

621
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:41,020
is extremely difficult. Those conversations I have with our client, our team, Bialand clients

622
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:45,260
all the time, and if we want to do a show is 12 weeks is not going to do it if you're drug free,

623
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:52,060
unless you're already extremely lean. The best natural bodybuilder ever coached his name was

624
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:57,340
Brian Whitaker. And he won the WMBF lightweight world title six times and is the only man to win

625
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:02,620
the WMBF overall world title and the IFPA overall world title, which were the two biggest federations,

626
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:08,300
the only man to ever unify them. And this guy at 12 weeks out, you would say he's ready.

627
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:13,660
And then he would lose 10 more pounds from that. And of those 10 pounds, how many would be fat?

628
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:20,540
Probably six or seven visit this is the problem is is the loss of body fat and lean mass.

629
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,420
What we see in I realized we're going off of the tangent, but this is really interesting is

630
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:31,180
when you're looking at people who are like overweight and obese, it's they can lose almost

631
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:38,220
100% fat tissue. Now, what people don't realize is adipose is actually about 13% lean tissue.

632
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:45,820
So it is very normal to see about a 13 to 20% loss of lean tissue when dieting, because even if you

633
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,500
lost just adipose tissue, you would lose some lean mass. You mean lean mass in terms of some of the

634
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:57,980
water loss water and adipose also has protein in it as well. And part of that is lost during the

635
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:07,020
during the remodeling of the tissue. So you have that. But then as a drug free bodybuilder,

636
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,020
again, it's important to make that distinction. Because if you're on steroids, that obviously

637
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:15,340
changes the physiology and tilts things much more towards retention of lean mass, if not building

638
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:25,660
some. As you get leaner and leaner, you are going to have a progressive shift of more and more lean

639
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:31,580
body mass loss for a few reasons. One, because your adipose stores are lower, your body is sending

640
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:38,060
out hormones to try and conserve fat tissue. So think about it from this perspective, if you are

641
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:48,380
200 pounds, and 190 of that is lean body mass, because you're just a little bit that last little

642
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:55,900
bit of body fat. Now guess where the biggest reservoir of energy is? It's the wood table.

643
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:01,740
Now, right. So now we're in emergency mode. And okay, well, now we can start to tear the house down,

644
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:08,540
because it's more important to keep this fat tissue than it is to keep this massive amount

645
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:15,420
of lean tissue. Right. So it really is interesting. So for him, people might look at that and say,

646
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:21,580
well, he lost 10 pounds and almost half of it was lean mass. Yes. But one of the fundamental things

647
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:28,860
that people do not understand is the best way to look as muscular as possible is to be as lean as

648
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,740
humanly possible. And I would encourage your listeners to go look up a guy named Brian Whitaker.

649
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,500
He's actually a professor of economics at Oklahoma State, one of the greatest natural

650
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:46,140
bodybuilders of all time and also very smart guy. Lovely person too. Like his gluteus muscles,

651
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:53,900
he's so lean that he has veins in his glutes and striations that look like fingers. I mean,

652
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,460
it's really incredible. Right. Which is something you typically, I remember the first bodybuilder

653
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,820
I ever saw that in, which is not to say it was the first bodybuilder it appeared in, but I remember

654
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:08,460
as a kid seeing that in Samir Banu, who was the 1983 Mr. Olympia. What's that? And I was like,

655
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:14,860
I remember as a kid, like, I'm maybe 13 years old seeing him and looking at the striations in his

656
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:21,340
lower back and in his glutes. And it was exactly that look that you described. Yeah. And yeah,

657
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:25,900
to think that one could achieve that without steroids and diuretics is pretty amazing.

658
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:33,660
Yeah. And so like Brian was about 160 to 165 pounds on stage and he's five foot nine. But if

659
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,780
you would see picture, if you saw him in his shirt, you would go, oh, he's nothing. He looks athletic.

660
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:44,780
You know, but then if you, if you see him in, you know, with his clothes off, you would say,

661
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:50,380
oh, he's 200 pounds at least. And sorry, you said he's five nine and was 165. Yep.

662
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:58,540
Yep. Actually that's, you can't hardly see it, but the photo right there. Wow. We did a, we did a

663
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:03,660
three times bodyweight deadlift challenge and his at Oklahoma state years ago. And because Brian's

664
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:10,380
also very strong. Um, that's him there. And he would walk around at what? In his off season,

665
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:17,820
one 85, you know, one 80, something like that. And it still looked very lean. Right. So again,

666
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,140
when you're talking about bodybuilding and I realized probably lost about 90% of the audience

667
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,580
talking about this, but we'll bring it back to the other stuff in a second. But I think bodybuilders

668
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,900
can really teach important lessons about physiology, you know, in terms of, you know,

669
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:35,900
energy metabolism. I think I agree with you. I think it is such an underappreciated discipline

670
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:44,700
because it's very easy to dismiss bodybuilders as, you know, drug using whatever and everything

671
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:50,140
you're saying applies to the steroid using and the natural. It's just in the natural,

672
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:56,860
it's a bigger lever, but it's still a huge lever. If you're a, if you're a drug competing bodybuilder,

673
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,900
like they can't, they are, I mean, whenever I interact with these guys, I am blown away at

674
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:07,260
how dialed in they are on their nutrition. Yep. Insane. And so one of the things we tell our

675
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,660
clients and one of the things I've heard so many times from different competitors is

676
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:18,060
you have to learn to sit with your discomfort and that, that can apply to many things.

677
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,220
I mean, even in like business, I'm sitting with my discomfort right now because

678
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,180
we've expanded our businesses and our expenses are way higher. Now we're making good revenue,

679
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:35,500
but the, the, the 20 year old lane in me goes, it would just take one bad month and these expenses

680
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:40,860
will crush us. You know, like that, like that, that kind of voice is in there. So it's, you know,

681
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,140
talking yourself through and sitting with that discomfort when it comes to food,

682
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:52,700
it's really asking yourself, okay, am I actually hungry or am I just queued up to eat right now?

683
01:04:53,660 --> 01:05:01,420
And then the answer is yes. If it truly is physical hunger, it's really talking yourself

684
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:07,980
through this and saying, okay, what are my goals? What's important to me? Do I,

685
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:11,980
could I eat sure? Is it going to make it more difficult later? Like for example,

686
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:17,020
if you're hungry at 11 a.m. Okay. Well, if I eat a big meal now, I'll feel better now,

687
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,700
but then what's it going to be like later? You know, all these things weigh in. And again,

688
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,220
there's no right or wrong answer to this, but what I would say is most people can handle a

689
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:31,420
lot more discomfort than they think they can. And just because you're uncomfortable,

690
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,540
doesn't mean you have to do anything about it. You can, you can sit with that. And I think a lot of

691
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:44,540
people really haven't done that. And even that like internal conversation, like in it, again,

692
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:52,780
this is why obesity is so difficult when we talk about people, because it's not people want to make

693
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:57,500
it about the X's and O's. It's not about the X's and O's. It's not about eat this protein, carbs,

694
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:02,460
fats. It's not about any of that. That stuff is, I remember when I first got into coaching people,

695
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,420
you know, 15 years ago, I was like, well, if I just tell them to eat this, they're going to lose weight.

696
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:18,060
And then you realize that like stress and trauma and hardwired habits and behaviors are so

697
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:22,860
difficult to change. And it really is, if you look at the research data,

698
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:31,420
it really is more, I know my cat's making a special appearance. He's the best cat. It really

699
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:37,420
is more about changing people's habits and behaviors than it is about the X's and O's.

700
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:44,460
And I mean, even right down to like sports, I'll use this comparison. X's and O's matter.

701
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:51,260
But you know what really matters for a head coach, leadership. That's what really matters.

702
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:57,980
Being able to get, communicate and get everybody on the same page and changing, you know, what do

703
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,140
they call it in the NFL? They call it changing the culture. This person came in and they changed

704
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:07,980
the culture of this team. That's not X's and O's. That's habits and behaviors. There was a really

705
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:15,580
great systematic review by a gal named Marie Shbrekli. She's doing her PhD over in England.

706
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:24,060
And Humble Brag, she actually messaged me and said that reading my book is what inspired her to go

707
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,900
to her PhD. And now she's done this great systematic review. So that's always like the most

708
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:35,660
cool thing when I hear that. She did a systematic review and looked at people specifically who

709
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:43,340
lost weight and kept it off. What did they have in common? What were the things that identified as

710
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:48,220
being really difficult? And what were the things that they identified as being really motivating?

711
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:58,060
And the things that came up weren't dietary really. It was their environment. It was their habits,

712
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:03,420
their behaviors. You know, one of the big things that came up was support, either good or bad,

713
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:09,420
that support made a big difference. And specifically support in terms of like,

714
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:16,220
I believe in you. I know you can do this. How can I help you? Those sorts of things versus

715
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:25,260
the criticism, micromanaging type of support. And then also stress was a big one.

716
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:31,340
Trauma was a big one. Binge eating was a big one. That's a really underappreciated part of this,

717
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:36,380
is the binge eating component. I think a lot more people struggle with that than would like to admit.

718
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:41,100
Because if you look at people, I would say Monday through Friday, a lot of people do great.

719
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:46,300
And they get to the weekend and they get the pancakes in the morning. They're drinking

720
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:51,340
throughout the day. By the way, everyone, alcohol has calories and it's really calorie dense.

721
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:56,460
And also causes you to make not so great food choices. And so a lot of people eat 1,500

722
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,140
calories the week and then they'll easily go 4,000 calories on the weekends.

723
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:07,020
So a lot of this is just reprogramming habits and behaviors. And that's what really came up in that

724
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:12,060
systematic review was it was not, Hey, this diet came out as this was what these people were using.

725
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:20,140
No, there was no one diet that came up as being superior to the others. What came up repeatedly

726
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:25,100
was these series of habits and behaviors that people had that helped them do this.

727
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,940
Yeah. And I think, you know, bringing it back now to the energy balance question,

728
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:37,660
I think today we know a lot more than we did 10 years ago. I think 10 years ago,

729
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:45,500
at least for me personally, there was still an open question about the impact of different

730
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:51,020
macronutrients on energy expenditure, both deliberate and non deliberate. So,

731
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:58,620
but I think when you look at the body of literature and, you know, I have to declare my

732
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:03,500
conflict here, right? So I used to be part of an organization that actually funded two of the,

733
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:08,540
you know, really big studies in this space, one out of Boston Children's Hospital by David Ludwig,

734
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:12,140
and then one was a consortium of people that included Rudy Leibel, who you mentioned a moment

735
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,980
ago, Kevin Hall was the PI, Eric Ravison, Steve Smith, et cetera.

736
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,900
That's like the heavy hitters name of metabolism right there.

737
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:25,260
This was the six PIs on this study were six of the biggest names in all of this space. And this

738
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:31,420
was a very rigorously done study. And look, was it a perfect study? No, it was a pilot study. It was

739
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,820
really designed to be the study to work out the kinks to do the enormous study that actually

740
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:42,380
never got funded. But it was still a very good study. And it still answered important question,

741
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:49,420
which was at least comparing a relatively clean standard American diet to a ketogenic diet,

742
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:59,740
it'd be hard to make the case that there was more than 50 to 150 calorie difference in energy

743
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:06,540
expenditure at an isocaloric swap. Now, there's different ways to interpret that. Some would say

744
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:12,460
that's huge. If you have a 50 K, which is what the difference was in the chamber versus 150 or

745
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:17,500
160, which is what the W labeled water showed, that could still be very significant over a long

746
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:22,540
enough period of time. There has been a significant debate about the validity of doubly labeled water

747
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:26,860
in a ketogenic diet. You mentioned John Speakman, he and Kevin Hall wrote a review about this

748
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:32,460
suggesting that doubly labeled water really doesn't apply. There's an artifact in a ketogenic diet.

749
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:38,140
So if you just look at the chamber data and say, well, you know, 50 K cal per day,

750
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:46,300
does that really matter? Not sure. But regardless, it wasn't 250 or 500 K cal per day. And to me,

751
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:51,660
that was a very important insight because prior to that point, I didn't really know because if you

752
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:57,900
look back at, you know, the Vermont study from the 1960s, if you look back at Ansel Keyes stuff

753
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,820
where they didn't have metabolic chambers, they're on wards, but it wasn't quite the same.

754
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:09,500
It was really unclear to me. I would say today the evidence has to be overwhelming that if,

755
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:17,500
for example, a ketogenic diet produces remarkable weight loss, it has to be doing it through intake

756
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:23,740
reduction, not through an increase in energy expenditure. I think that you're 100% right.

757
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:29,420
And I'm going to take that kind of piecemeal. So the first thing I will say is let's throw out

758
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,860
the energy expenditure stuff for now. And I know we just spent a lot of time talking about energy

759
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:39,020
balance. It's important, but we're assuming that these measures are accurate. There's even error

760
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:45,420
in direct calimetry because you can only measure as accurately as your equipment that you have to

761
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:51,020
measurement. That's right. And those numbers I just touted, you could argue that they were at

762
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:55,660
the limit of detection, at least for the indirect calorimeter. Absolutely. The 57 K cal per day

763
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,580
was probably right at the detection. So it could have been zero, it could have been 100.

764
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:08,620
It's we're really on a razor's edge of detection. And I think that the point you made was that the

765
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:13,180
carbohydrate insulin model of obesity would predict a much bigger change in energy expenditure. So

766
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:19,660
therefore, at least that version of it, it has to be falsified based on that. And even with the 150

767
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:29,660
calories, that would not explain the difference. And again, if we look at studies that assess loss

768
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:36,620
of body fat under controlled environments, we just don't see differences between low carbon low fat

769
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:40,940
when calories are controlled calories and protein are controlled. We don't see it. In fact, there's

770
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:45,340
actually a very small favoritism towards low fat. But again, I think that that's probably a data

771
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:51,820
artifact and not actually a real difference. There was, you mentioned David Ludwig, there was a

772
01:13:51,820 --> 01:14:01,980
recent or more recent meta analysis he did that got a lot of buzz because basically his assertion

773
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:09,020
was that, well, if you look at the short term data, yes, there doesn't appear to be much difference.

774
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:17,020
But if you look at after 17 days, there appears to be a large difference in the energy expenditure

775
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:21,660
anywhere from like 150 to 300 calories per day favoring low carb. Was that with doubly labeled

776
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:26,700
water again? That's it. So that's so the issue was and I went through this with a fine tooth comb.

777
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:32,700
And again, the meta analysis itself was very well done. The statistics were very good. But when

778
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:39,100
there was metabolic chamber data available or doubly labeled water, they use doubly labeled water.

779
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,340
Now, what I would tell you is that's like saying I've got caliper data available and

780
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:48,860
dexa data available, but I'm going to use the caliper data. Well, that's fine. But keep in mind

781
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:54,700
that dexa is what calipers are validated against. So you're talking about a primary measure versus

782
01:14:54,700 --> 01:15:01,980
a secondary measure. By the way, I've already forgotten Kevin and Kevin Hall and John Speakman's

783
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:09,420
primary criticism of DLW in a KD. Do you remember the gist of the thesis where the artifact comes

784
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:19,740
from? Yes. So basically, there's more CO2 produced than is accounted for in the constant of the

785
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:26,140
equation. The 1.11 is probably too low a number. Yeah. So you overproduce CO2 compared to what the

786
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:32,380
prediction would be based on that equation. And so basically what that means is that in a low

787
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:39,020
carb setting, you're probably getting an artificial increase in energy expenditure.

788
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:43,420
Oh, so the 1.11 would actually be too big. It's probably too big a coefficient.

789
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:48,540
What I went back to is I said, okay, you know what? Let's say that this isn't an artifact

790
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:56,620
or an effect of the differences in measures. And again, direct calimetry, if you're on a

791
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:01,020
standard diet, the association with double the level water is an R of 0.8, which is pretty good

792
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:08,300
for free living stuff. Yeah, but it ain't 0.99 either. 0.8 is good, but not exceptional.

793
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,100
And then a low carb is 0.5, which is a pretty big difference from a 0.8. It basically just means

794
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:18,780
it's not as tightly correlated. Let's throw all that out. I went through every single one of those

795
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:24,620
studies that Ludwig looked at and then looked at, did they measure body composition? And what did

796
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:28,860
the body composition stuff say? Because what do we really care about? Do we care about what energy

797
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:34,140
expenditure says on a readout or do we care about losing body fat? I mean, I think most people would

798
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:41,100
say we care about losing body fat. Not one study saw a difference between the low carb conditions

799
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:47,820
or the low fat or balanced diet when calories and protein were equated. So to me, that's truly

800
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:53,180
the metric and that's what we care about. So to me, that's actually great news because what it says

801
01:16:53,180 --> 01:17:01,260
is, hey, do whatever diet you prefer. If you like low carb, heck yeah, it's certainly not any worse

802
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:06,300
than doing a low fat diet. If you don't like low carb, there's other options. By the way, you can

803
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:11,980
just do a balanced diet too. There's nothing wrong with that. I think balanced diet sometimes can be

804
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:16,540
a little bit harder for people to moderate unless you're doing some kind of portion control.

805
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:23,100
But yeah, it says that pretty much you can do what you want and still lose body fat.

806
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:28,860
That's not, I'm not trying to throw shade at David Ludwig, even though I have on Twitter before.

807
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:34,940
But it just goes to show you that if you change the inputs for a study,

808
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:41,500
and this is one of the really fundamental problems I think is out there, is people, and even like

809
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,740
some doctors and scientists just aren't equipped to understand studies, to interpret studies

810
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:54,620
correctly. And people have asked me like, how can I get better at reading this stuff? And I hate to

811
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,020
be somebody who sits in an ivory tower, but I'll tell them, like, if you really feel so passionately,

812
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:04,940
go to grad school. Because that's, I can tell you sitting down with my PI, Don Layman, who I'm

813
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:12,540
sure you're very familiar with, and just talking about studies and having him, like literally,

814
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:21,580
not in a nasty way, but just crush me so many times based on my hypotheses and everything,

815
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:25,900
and say, well, if you consider this, that was so enlightening for me. I mean, the best part of

816
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:31,740
grad school was just sitting around a table with graduate students and my and Don, and just

817
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:37,820
wrapping back and forth and doing these studies. And you just really get a good idea for how to,

818
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:42,380
like, look critically at this stuff. And now on to the point where I tell people, I'm like,

819
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:46,620
I don't get excited about one study, wake me up when there's 10. You know what I mean? Wake me

820
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:51,340
up when there's 10. And even then, I'm going to look at the how it was done and make sure. And I

821
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:57,420
tell people, I hear this a lot. I don't trust science because this study says this thing,

822
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,260
and this study says that thing. I said, if you truly understand what you're looking at,

823
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:07,420
you understand statistics, you understand research design, when you go into the methods and you look

824
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,300
at the results, don't read the conclusions of the authors. Look at the actual results,

825
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:18,860
look at the methods, and you can usually understand why they seemingly found different results.

826
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:22,780
Yeah, I'll put in one shameless plug for something we did. We have a series on the

827
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:29,740
blog called Studying Studies where we go through all of this methodology. But I agree with you,

828
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:34,700
it's not a substitute for getting reps on the field. In other words, that's sort of like reading

829
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:41,100
everything about playing a sport, but you actually have to play. And one of the things we've done

830
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:46,460
internally, and we've toyed with the idea of if we should just put them out there, is Journal Club.

831
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,020
So what you describe is basically Journal Club. That's really how you learn how to read studies.

832
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:56,140
You sit around with a bunch of people and it's formal, right? We had it every Monday morning,

833
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:00,620
I think, or maybe Thursday afternoon, I can't remember, but twice a year, depending on the size

834
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:06,940
of the lab or four times a year, you present a paper for an hour and everybody else's job is to

835
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:11,100
see how you've maybe missed something or misunderstood something and really poke and pry.

836
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,980
And so every single week you're getting those reps on the field and you get pretty darn good

837
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:24,380
at reading the fine print. So we do this once a month internally with our team, in part because

838
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:29,900
it's just such a fun experience. And two, it gives us a chance to pick a paper a month and really

839
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:34,540
dissect it. So maybe at some point we'll put those out there just so people can at least watch. It's

840
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:38,940
one step closer, I guess, to doing the reps, but yeah, you kind of have to do it.

841
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:43,340
Yeah, it's tough. There's no substitute for that experience. Now, that being said,

842
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:49,340
like one of the... So understanding this, I started thinking about, how can I help people with this?

843
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:55,180
And so we're actually going to have like a periodical, a research review coming out

844
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:00,220
monthly through our website that's going to be subscription-based that we're going to take.

845
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:05,580
There are other research reviews out there, but we're really going to try and make this like

846
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:11,020
for the layman, for somebody who has no... We're going to say, here's what they looked at,

847
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:17,020
here's what they found, here's what we think they found if we disagreed. Because I've read

848
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,460
studies where I'm like, I read the author's conclusion, I'm like, well, that's not what you

849
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:26,780
found, you actually found this. And then we're going to say, here's what it means for you

850
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:32,940
practically. So that's funny that we both kind of like seen that need, because... And again,

851
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:38,860
a lot of this is also media driven, because it's about what's the most punchy headline we can get

852
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:44,620
out there. And so I remember a great example was like, this happens so much with mechanistic stuff.

853
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:50,220
It's like there was an article and it was something to the effect of smelling your

854
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:57,500
partner's farts might help prevent cancer. And what the research study actually showed was that

855
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:05,980
one of the volatile fatty acids that's produced by the gut microbiome in response to fiber

856
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:11,500
may have a protective effect on breast cancer when they gave it to animals in a high dose.

857
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:18,860
And it's like, that's a long way from you taking a sniff of your partner's fart and preventing

858
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:28,300
cancer. But that's what confuses people. All right, let's pivot to another application of this.

859
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,580
Everything we've talked about so far has really set the stage for understanding

860
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:38,780
the role that macronutrients, but more specifically, calories and energy intake and

861
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:43,820
expenditure play in weight loss. Let's now talk about a very specific macronutrient,

862
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:54,940
which is protein and its importance in muscle acquisition. So I have a saying that I'm sure

863
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:59,820
many others have said, and I'm sure I'm paraphrasing it from somebody, but never in the history of

864
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:05,660
civilization, I will assert as a 90 year old person said, I wish I had less muscle.

865
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:12,940
That can't be uttered, right? If you want to be metabolically healthy,

866
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:21,500
the best thing you can do is have lots of lean body mass. It is a metabolic sink is the best

867
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:29,260
way to describe it. If you look at people who are even like obese, who are power lifters,

868
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:36,140
they might have like some elevations in like blood lipids and whatnot, but usually their

869
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:44,380
insulin sensitivity and blood glucose is still okay. If you look at people who train really hard,

870
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:49,740
even with excess adiposity, I mean, they see this with people who are obese, who they start them just

871
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:54,300
exercising without exercise. One of the only things that we know of that without even weight

872
01:23:54,300 --> 01:24:01,020
loss improves metabolic health and substantially, really substantially. And I think I was actually

873
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,980
on the Rogan podcast and one of the points I made a few years ago was I said, this was the one with

874
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:11,420
Dom. Yes. So I said, you know, a lot of people get real caught up in carbs and fats and all this,

875
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:16,780
and they're not even exercising. Well, you're literally, you're, you are stepping over

876
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:24,380
dollars to pick up fractions of pennies right now. Like if you just got active and it's not

877
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:30,460
even a high dose that's required. It's not, I mean, a high dose is great, but just going and being

878
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:35,980
sedentary and walking, you will see improvements in health markers for, you know, a hundred minutes

879
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:42,060
a week. That's it. And then obviously there's, there can be a linear effect. But you know,

880
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:45,740
people will look at me and I remember I had my blood work done a while back that I do have

881
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:50,860
familial hypochlorosterelemia. So my LDL tends to run a little bit high, but you know, people

882
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,700
who are speculating that I would have like really high inflammation because I talk about, you know,

883
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:59,500
I still will eat, you know, um, probably around 70 to 80 grams of sugar a day, but I'm also getting,

884
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:05,180
you know, 60, 70 grams of fiber along with that. Oh, your CRP is going to be all of it. My CRP

885
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:12,620
wasn't hardly detectable. It was on the low ends of detection. And again, that just speaks to the

886
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:18,620
fact that there is a big difference between somebody who is a athlete training hard, who has

887
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:25,500
a lot of muscle mass versus somebody who's sedentary with excess adiposity. It's just,

888
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,820
it's not even comparable when you talk about like food choices and whatnot. You have a lot more you

889
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:39,900
can get away with, with, with a lot of muscle mass. And your point that being older and frail,

890
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:45,500
people don't think about this. This is something that, you know, everybody's kind of like, well,

891
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,860
the funniest thing I get Peter is people say, Oh, you do all that heavy lifting. You're going to be

892
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:53,740
in pain when you're older. You're going to be in pain when you're older, regardless. You might as

893
01:25:53,740 --> 01:26:00,540
well be in pain and strong versus in pain and weak. I have members of my family who I love dearly,

894
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,100
who have been sedentary for a long time, who have all kinds of sciatica and back issues.

895
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:13,260
I mean, I have had back issues from heavy lifting, but they come and they go and, you know, I'm

896
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,140
still here. I'm still able to lift. And honestly, I find most people who have experienced activity

897
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:24,380
and inactivity will almost always tell you if they're being deliberate and how they recall it,

898
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:30,460
you're generally in more discomfort when you're inactive. Oh, for sure. Sitting down. I, again,

899
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:35,340
I don't remember where these zingers came from, but none of them are mine. But this is one of my

900
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:42,540
favorites, right? Sitting is to lower back pain. What bourbon is to alcoholism. Hell yeah. The,

901
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:48,060
the, the worst thing you can do is be a mobile. I say as I'm sitting here, right? I know it's your

902
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:54,860
standing. Yeah. So part of journal club in grad school, we had seminars every week where people

903
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:59,500
would either present their exit seminars for their PhD or we'd have outside speakers come in. And one

904
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,940
of them interestingly was a lower back pain specialist. And this would have been circle like

905
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:10,940
2007, 2008. And one of the interesting things he said was if we, which is now kind of common

906
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:20,060
knowledge, if we MRI an elite athlete, a lot of times I'll look at their MRI and go, Oh my God,

907
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:25,660
you must be in horrible discomfort. And they go, really? No, I feel fine. You know, and they've

908
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:29,820
got all these disc bulges and herniations and whatnot. And they're completely asymptomatic.

909
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,620
And then he'll, he said, we'll have sedentary people come in and they'll be in excruciating

910
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,900
pain and I'll pull up their MRI and they've just got a little tiny disc bulge.

911
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:43,340
There is probably no more diagnostic test that is uncorrelated from clinical outcome

912
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,980
than an MRI of the lumbar spine. Again, not a specialist, but I've, you know,

913
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:53,500
I've spoken with lumbar specialists like Stu McGill. Um, you know, they say, you know, it's,

914
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:58,860
it's data. It's kind of like a DEXA. It's like it's data, but you know, it shouldn't really

915
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:04,140
dictate treatment. Treatment should be based on pain and what triggers your pain.

916
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,460
And that's a whole nother rabbit hole. The pain, the pain world is a whole nother rabbit hole.

917
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:13,980
The idea that people think the human body is like a bag of meat that's just connected to your brain.

918
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:17,740
And now we know that pain is more like an emotion than anything, but I digress.

919
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:22,780
So let's talk about it now through this lens though. Right? So I want to talk about it.

920
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:30,780
Whether we're dealing with a 50 year old woman who comes to you, who's never lifted a weight

921
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:38,620
in her life. Okay. So she's the mom of three has never touched a weight. Um, she's going through

922
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:42,300
menopause. So now she's actually starting to put on a little bit of weight, maybe for the first

923
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,940
time in her life. So she's actually starting to get a little chubby and you know, she, you wouldn't,

924
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:51,340
she's not overweight, but she just feels she's, you know, her clothes are getting a little bit snug

925
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:58,700
and her assumption is I need to do more cardio. I need to be more active and it probably needs to be

926
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:05,100
disproportionately cardio. And so, so you look at her and you make the diagnosis,

927
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:11,980
ma'am, we can do some cardio. We got to put some muscle on you. So you do a DEXA on her and she

928
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:21,180
comes back 30% body fat, but it's kind of skinny fat. Her ALMI is six, right? So meaning it puts

929
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:27,420
her at the 10th percentile of muscle mass. Um, what are you going to do with her and what are you

930
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:34,460
going to make her eat? Yeah. So I think the first thing to say is that muscle is a lot like bone

931
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:38,620
in that you want to lay down as much as possible because eventually it's going to start receding.

932
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:46,140
But it is still possible to add muscle. So people will hear that and go, well, I'm 50. Yeah. No,

933
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,620
in fact, right across the street from my lab at the University of Illinois, trying out my lab,

934
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:55,820
the lab I was in, uh, right across the street, uh, at the exercise physiology building,

935
01:29:55,820 --> 01:30:02,060
they did study an 80 year old frail elderly. Well, they basically had them start where they would

936
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:07,500
squat to a high chair and come up gradually. They put the chair down. This was like a 16 week study

937
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:12,860
and I don't have the citation, but I just remember talking to the other grad student about it. So

938
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:16,620
please forgive me, everyone out there. But they said they were amazed because by the end of it,

939
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:22,060
one, these people as a percentage of their body weight increased their lean body mass

940
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:28,220
pretty much the same amount that a 20 year old does. Okay. So the relative increase was similar.

941
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:32,860
Now they're, they're less overall, they had less overall mass they put on because their weight was

942
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:39,580
lower to start. And they said by the end, some of them were actually able to add weight, like

943
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:44,940
extra weight and squat all the way down to a parallel chair, which the people in the study

944
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:49,660
were completely mind blown that this was possible for them. And it's 16 weeks. It's not even a long

945
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:54,540
time, you know? And we're talking about people who like probably think that they're heading for

946
01:30:54,540 --> 01:31:00,060
a wheelchair, you know, like it is never too late to get active. So that's the first thing. Right.

947
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:05,340
And let's bring it back to your finance example. It's never too late to start saving. Absolutely.

948
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,540
True that you're better off if you can, if you can be one of the fortunate people who write out of

949
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:14,460
college or who doesn't even go to college and go straight to work out of high school or whatever,

950
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:19,980
and you can start saving right away. Well, that's fantastic. But just because you've made it to 40

951
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:24,060
and you've been scrapping by and you haven't been able to save, but now you come into a little bit

952
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:29,100
of disposable income and you can start saving, there is zero downside to that. Better late than

953
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:33,180
never. Absolutely. That's a great comparison. I actually never thought about that before. So

954
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:40,140
I'm going to steal that for later. Take it. So I'll give correct attribution. And then as far as

955
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:45,580
diet wise, so give me a typical because I can tell you what when I see that woman in my practice,

956
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:49,580
which I see all the time, I'll tell you what she looks like. And I want you to compare it to your

957
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,580
version of that. But when I see that woman, she looks exactly as I've said, right? So she's 50.

958
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:59,260
She's going through menopause. She still looks normal, but the composition of her body is really

959
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:04,300
changing. You do that, Dexa, she's 30 to 35 percent body fat, very little muscle mass.

960
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:11,980
You take as close scrutiny of what she's eating. She's getting 50 to 60 grams of protein a day on

961
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:20,940
a good day. And when you do a strength metric assessment on her, she is incredibly weak,

962
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:28,300
even as even if you were to compare her to another female at an appropriate age adjustment.

963
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:33,900
And, you know, I have a very stark conversation with her when I pull up something called the

964
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:42,460
death bars. So the death bars are this analysis that Bob Kaplan did for me, God, probably about

965
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:50,540
six months ago, a year ago, which is basically just causes of death by decade. And I double

966
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,980
click on accidental deaths. So I have a we this death bars is so cool because you can double

967
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:01,420
click on it all over the place. And once once you call out accidental deaths, you realize

968
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:06,460
something really interesting. Unlike cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

969
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:12,140
which are very age dependent, meaning the older you get, the more the incidence goes up. Generally

970
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:17,340
with cancer, it actually comes down a little bit in the last decade. Accidental deaths are

971
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:24,380
basically the same forever once you reach the age of 10. So from 10 year olds to 20 year olds,

972
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:29,180
and 80 year olds to 90 year olds, they all have the same number of accidental deaths per year,

973
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:37,020
more or less. What differs dramatically is the type of accident. So in young people,

974
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:43,580
it is disproportionately, sadly, overdoses that are the lion's share followed by automotive

975
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:51,340
accidents. In the oldest subset of the population, it becomes almost entirely accidental falls.

976
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:56,140
It is. And when you show somebody this graph, because it's so pronounced,

977
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:04,140
I've never seen a person who doesn't just stop in their tracks because they cannot believe how much

978
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:10,940
morbidity and mortality results from falling and frailty once you reach about the age of 70, 75.

979
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:16,620
I mean, the data is there to back it up. The, I believe I may butcher this citation,

980
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:24,380
but I believe there was a study by Bob Wolf that was kind of a review that showed essentially

981
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:32,300
after age 65, you could tie the majority of deaths to some kind of lack of muscular strength

982
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:39,260
or lack of muscle. And if you look at, they've done these meta-analyses of mortality,

983
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:48,060
showing that your lean body mass is inversely, inversely proportional to your risk of mortality

984
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:53,740
after age like 50. And by the way, strength is even slightly higher. So, yeah. So the hazard

985
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:59,260
ratio for being strong to not strong is about 3.2 for all cause mortality. Think about that.

986
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:03,980
Which is a big hazard ratio. It's a freaking staggering hazard ratio. But you're talking

987
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:08,460
about on the level of smoking right there. No, it's higher than smoking. Actually, smoking is

988
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:15,580
about 2. So to put that in perspective, right? End stage renal disease is about 3.

989
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:22,300
And the only thing that's higher, and I talked about this on another podcast, is elite,

990
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:29,100
meaning top 2.5 percentile of VO2 max compared to bottom 25th percentile of VO2 max.

991
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:35,660
That has a delta of 5. 5.1 is the hazard ratio. And of course, these are not mutually exclusive.

992
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:40,780
So why not have remarkable cardio respiratory fitness, muscle mass, and strength?

993
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:45,500
Yep. So I think one of the big barriers, especially with the type of client you're talking about,

994
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:49,820
is, well, I don't want to get too bulky or too muscular.

995
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,620
Can you dispel the myth of accidental muscle, please?

996
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:58,220
Yeah. So as someone who's spent their entire adult life trying to get too muscular,

997
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:05,820
and basically just looks really fit in a t-shirt, yeah, don't worry about that. You're going to be

998
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:12,140
okay. And if you do start to get too muscular, you can always just back off. That's pretty easy.

999
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,660
That's like saying, I mean, literally, let's use a financial comparison.

1000
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:17,500
I'm worried about getting too rich.

1001
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:22,460
I might get too rich and, you know, like, okay, well, if you're worried about that, you know.

1002
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:25,260
We've got some great philanthropies that we can introduce you to.

1003
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:31,260
Yes, exactly. So it's like getting in a car and worried about becoming a NASCAR driver

1004
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:40,300
spontaneously, you know. Just the amount of benefit you will get from three times a week,

1005
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:47,500
30 to 40 minutes of resistance training, not even crazy intense resistance training,

1006
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:58,620
just an amount that forces your body to adapt will be unbelievable in terms of your level of fitness

1007
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:03,980
and your ability to live a long, healthy life.

1008
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:09,740
So tell me what you would do. So let's use this, again, this generic, but rather very specific

1009
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:16,620
example of this 50 year old woman who is not completely unfit. So let's even give it to her

1010
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,300
that she's she still does yoga, doing some cardio, walks, does some stuff,

1011
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:27,740
but she's never lifted weights before. Tell me what her first four month program looks like from you.

1012
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:31,740
Probably going to see what first off what's reasonable for her lifestyle. Like,

1013
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:37,980
what can she actually do? So let's say she says, Lane, I'm willing to commit to 45 minutes,

1014
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:43,580
three times a week in the in the weight room. Great. I think that probably lower body strength

1015
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:47,740
is a little bit more important than upper body strength in terms of preventing falls.

1016
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:51,820
I mean, we always think about falls from a bone density perspective. We don't want people to fall

1017
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:56,860
and break their hip because that that specific fall is pretty much a death sentence if you're

1018
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:04,460
over the age of 65. So but people worry about the bone density. Well, if they didn't fall in the

1019
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:10,700
first place, if they had the muscle mass to catch themselves, you wouldn't have to worry about that.

1020
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:16,540
And also, by the way, bone density is increased by lifting weights much more than anything you'd

1021
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:23,660
ever get through your diet. So I would say, let's just see what you can do. And then I would probably

1022
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:29,260
do two lower body days, one upper body day could even flip flop it on alternating weeks if you

1023
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:35,900
wanted to even it out. And it'd mostly be honestly, just some machine stuff that's very easy for her

1024
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:40,620
to do to get in there because honestly, she never trained before. Everything's going to cause an

1025
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:44,860
adaptation. And that's what we're looking to get. Like, I'm not going to have her come in and try

1026
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:50,220
and free squat or deadlift or anything like that. Like, that's a really horrible idea. It's just

1027
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:55,180
going to frustrate her and not actually apply the load where we want it because she's not going to

1028
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:59,580
be able to balance it very well. So when you say machines, would you be thinking like, look,

1029
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,980
you'd be happy with her doing a leg extension, a leg curl. Absolutely. Yeah. Would you have her

1030
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:09,020
do anything that's a little more compound and complicated, for example, holding dumbbells and

1031
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:15,100
stepping up onto a bench where now she has to manage grip strength with a bit of balance and

1032
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:20,060
also getting the leg load or is that not first cycle? I probably wouldn't do that in the initial

1033
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:25,180
weeks just because the soreness is going to be so high. It's going to impede a lot of that movement

1034
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:31,500
well. And people tend to think about soreness in the wrong way. It's correlated with muscle growth

1035
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:37,420
and strength, but it is not causative. And so what I'll tell people is if you're sore all the time,

1036
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:41,500
you're probably training incorrectly. If you're never sore, you're also probably training

1037
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:46,300
incorrectly. So it's something that if you're doing an appropriate amount of volume and intensity,

1038
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:51,580
there probably should be some soreness from time to time. But if you're getting sore all the time,

1039
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:59,580
then your programming is pretty bad. So what I'm trying to do in the initial stages is just actually

1040
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:06,060
get enough to adapt and not cause enormous amounts of soreness because one, it's going to be-

1041
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:07,340
Can discourage her as well.

1042
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:11,900
It can be discouraging. That's it. I mean, if you can't go about, like everybody's known that like

1043
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:18,220
feeling after their first like hard squat day, like good luck doing anything, you know. And so

1044
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:21,820
that's going to be a discouraging thing, especially if somebody's got life, like not all of us are

1045
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:27,820
meatheads who love that feeling. And also it's going to impede her subsequent sessions, right?

1046
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:31,020
So she's not, especially if you're talking about something like a step up that requires more

1047
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,860
coordination. If you're overly sore, that's going to be really, really difficult. So I'm probably

1048
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:39,660
going to try and get her through like four to six weeks, which if we look at the data on muscle

1049
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:45,740
protein turnover, I think we talked about this last time a little bit. You don't really see

1050
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:49,260
increases in hypertrophy during the six weeks, the first six weeks of resistance training. What

1051
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:54,060
you're getting is actually a remodeling of the tissue to be stronger, more resilient,

1052
01:40:54,060 --> 01:41:00,780
and it starts protecting itself against damage. And so that seems to be where muscle protein

1053
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:04,700
synthesis goes up, but muscle protein degradation also goes up. And so basically you're kind of in

1054
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:09,260
this futile cycle where it's just turning over the tissue. After about six weeks, muscle protein

1055
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:13,260
degradation tends to go down, muscle protein synthesis stays up. And that's where you start

1056
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:18,940
seeing those increases in hypertrophy and lean mass. Now, does a trained athlete also go through

1057
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:24,060
that? Or have you long since passed through that? And are you now generally at the point where

1058
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:29,740
degradation is not having this disproportionate rise relative to synthesis? So it's a great

1059
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:33,260
question. And I actually have a, I thought you might ask this, so I actually have a paper from

1060
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:37,260
Damas et al. pulled up, which is really interesting. So if we look at myofibrillar

1061
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:46,700
protein synthesis in response to resistance exercise, we see what tends to happen is

1062
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:55,900
the amplitude of muscle protein synthesis in trained people is a little bit lower

1063
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:04,060
than untrained. So you don't have quite the same response. It depends on when you measure. If you

1064
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:09,740
measure it 16 hours post, they're about the same. They're about a 40% increase. If you measure it

1065
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:18,220
four hours post, trained is still about 40%, untrained is about 70%. So you've got a little

1066
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:24,060
bit of difference in amplitude, but what really is the difference is the duration. So in trained

1067
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:31,980
people, it's back down to baseline about 10 to 20 hours after the initial resistance training

1068
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:38,940
bout. Whereas the untrained people still have elevated rates of protein synthesis, even like

1069
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:43,740
three days or even like two, three days later. And sorry, Lane, this is just synthesis or this

1070
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:49,260
is net accumulation. This is just synthesis. Got it. So it could be offset by degradation.

1071
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:53,260
It could be and degradation is much more difficult to measure. Unfortunately,

1072
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:59,340
we do have some, so that if we get into the techniques that are used to measure this,

1073
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,060
what you find is you really can't measure all three things at one time, unfortunately. So you

1074
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:08,060
can measure kind of the net balance. We do that with what's called an AV balance. So you're looking

1075
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:13,580
at, you take a labeled amino acid, you're infusing it and you're looking, you're sampling in the

1076
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:19,980
arterial of a muscle bed and then the venous of the muscle bed. And so basically depending on how

1077
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:25,420
much of that label shows up in the vein versus the artery, we know how much is being retained

1078
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:31,420
in muscle so that we know what the net is. You can infuse a second label to presumably get

1079
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:35,820
synthesis as well. And then you can figure out the difference of degradation. But the problem with

1080
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:40,300
this is it requires a steady state. You can't do it when you've trained or had a meal or anything

1081
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,460
like that. It's pretty much exclusively fasted because there's too many assumptions you have to

1082
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:48,140
make about the rate of appearance versus rate of disappearance and those sorts of things.

1083
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:54,700
You can measure synthesis very easily. Well, I wouldn't say very easily, but much easier than

1084
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:59,340
degradation. And you can measure degradation, but the problem with degradation is how you're

1085
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:07,180
measuring it because it's, we know that for example, out of every amino acid that's used

1086
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:13,100
for protein synthesis, seven out of eight of them are actually from degradation. So it's

1087
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:17,420
amino acids being recycled. Yeah, I remember this of all the things we talked about in our first

1088
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:23,980
episode, Lane, this was the most novel to me. And it's the one thing that I literally find myself

1089
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:30,700
thinking about every day when I finish a workout and go and get a protein shake is I wonder how

1090
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:37,580
many of these amino acids in said shake versus these amino acids that I've just eviscerated from

1091
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:45,820
deadlifting are actually going to be the ones that form through the summation of new myofibril

1092
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:51,580
synthesis. What I would say is don't think about it that way. What I would say is if you want to

1093
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:56,620
maximize muscle mass, you want to maximize protein synthesis obviously and maximize deposition.

1094
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:03,340
And so kind of the theory at first was, all right, if it's only one out of every eight,

1095
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:09,420
and you can only really deposit about five to 10 grams per day net in muscle overall of amino

1096
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:14,860
acids. I mean, that's kind of the max. Say that again. Yeah, so about five to 10 grams a day.

1097
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:19,980
Now think about if you do that over the course of a year, every single day,

1098
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:24,780
I've done this calculation before, so I don't remember it exactly. So I'm going to estimate.

1099
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:30,940
That would be about, look, if you do the math on 10 grams a day, that's eight and a half pounds.

1100
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:34,060
But what do we know about muscle tissue? It's about 70%.

1101
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,020
70% water. Yep.

1102
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:41,980
So we're just talking about the actual protein content. So if you take that eight pounds and we

1103
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:46,620
divide it by points or if you take, yeah, 0.3, take eight divided by.

1104
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,620
Yeah, it's about 26 pounds.

1105
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,860
About 26, that's a lot of lean body mass. Yeah.

1106
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:56,220
Right? So I would say that's a lot of lean body mass, even for a novice trainer. So

1107
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:02,220
we know that it's like the max is probably about five to 10 grams per day in terms of drug free.

1108
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:06,060
Do you know how much that can go up to with anabolic steroids?

1109
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:11,340
I'm not sure quite honestly. There's just a dearth of information about that just because

1110
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:16,220
it's hard to get IRB approval for doing research on steroids.

1111
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:20,780
Yeah, I mean, it would simply be basically the anecdotal evidence of looking at a professional

1112
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,660
bodybuilder and asking, you know, for a native.

1113
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:28,700
Yeah. I think the magazines exaggerate a lot of stuff and I would even say 30 pounds of

1114
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:36,220
actual skeletal muscle wet tissue would still be a ton for someone on drugs. I mean, that's a lot

1115
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:40,300
of skeletal muscle tissue. Think about, go to the store and look at 30 pounds of beef.

1116
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:45,180
Oh yeah. Yeah. No, no, it's insane. I mean, look, we just had a female patient in our practice

1117
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:51,660
who went from being not very active to getting very active. And she had a DEXA scan

1118
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:57,100
separated by five months, which I generally don't like doing DEXAs that close together.

1119
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:01,980
But the cardinal sin was just through circumstances were done at different facilities.

1120
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:10,380
The DEXA suggested she gained six pounds of lean tissue. I just said I can't,

1121
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:15,580
one of these DEXAs was wrong. That's six pounds of lean tissue in five months.

1122
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:19,740
I don't know for a woman who maybe I mean, is that possible?

1123
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:21,820
It might. She probably did gain some. Yeah.

1124
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:25,260
I mean, consider also like. Is that would that be expected? I mean, we'll know,

1125
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:29,980
I guess when we repeat it at the one year mark from the beginning, because maybe it'll plateau.

1126
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:34,460
And this would be this remarkable adaptation out of the gate. But it struck me as a lot of lean

1127
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:40,220
tissue. But I mean, if you want to gain eight pounds of lean tissue, lean tissue on a DEXA,

1128
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:44,300
take a DEXA. It could be a lot of water. Yeah. Take a DEXA, jump off, drink a gallon of water

1129
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:47,980
and jump back on and you'll have gained eight pounds. So that's my point. There's the hydration

1130
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:51,420
artifact and all these other things that could be doing it. Yeah. But she probably she probably

1131
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:55,580
did gain some. Most people's lifestyles aren't that volatile that you see that difference.

1132
01:47:55,580 --> 01:48:00,380
So she probably did gain some. But in terms of muscle protein synthesis and how much you deposit

1133
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:08,060
muscle, people say, well, if you only need 50 grams to meet your requirement in terms of

1134
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:11,740
being a positive nitrogen balance, because that's how that's determined as nitrogen balance.

1135
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:16,460
You mean the, the RDAs are based on just that. Correct. Yeah. Which are, I mean,

1136
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:19,340
can we dismantle the RDA in a minute? We'll come back to that.

1137
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:24,060
It'll kind of get to that. Yeah. So people say, well, just throw 10 grams of amino acids on top

1138
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:28,540
of that. That's just go to protein on top of that. Because I mean, you're there, right?

1139
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:34,380
That's, that's not how it works. You're, you're assuming that every single amino

1140
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:40,220
acid after that just goes straight to lean tissue. You've already mentioned the thermogenic effect.

1141
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:45,260
How much of that, correct. How much of that is actually coming from the protein itself being

1142
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:49,420
inefficiently metabolized versus a stored energy source. Do we know that?

1143
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:55,420
I would say it's more about the oxidation of the protein and where it's going. But I'll get to

1144
01:48:55,420 --> 01:49:01,820
that in a moment. The thing to keep in mind is that in order to maximize your deposition,

1145
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:05,580
to get that five to 10 grams, you need to maximize protein synthesis. But to maximize

1146
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:12,460
protein synthesis requires a disproportionate amount of total protein. So in order for you to

1147
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:19,420
maximize protein synthesis, we think it's around 1.6 to 2.4 grams per kilogram of body weight.

1148
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:23,500
Sorry, say that again. 1.6 to 2.4 grams per kilogram

1149
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:27,660
of lean body weight or total body weight? The meta analysis on this was total body weight.

1150
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:32,540
But if you want to say lean body mass, then you could pump it up to like two to 2.8 grams

1151
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:36,860
per kilogram of lean body mass. And you're pretty much at the same number unless you're like obese

1152
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:40,700
or super lean. And people will like quibble about that. And I'm like, let's just just get in the,

1153
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:44,780
just get in the ballpark. Right. Which, which kind of winds up with that old like one gram

1154
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:50,940
per pound of body weight number. Right. So you need a disproportionate amount of protein

1155
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:57,420
to maximize the deposition. And so yeah, it's just kind of an interesting fact. And the other

1156
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:02,300
thing people will say is we have this, one of the ways that protein is assessed or needs are assessed

1157
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:08,620
is what's called the indicator amino acid method, or they also look at direct amino acid oxidation,

1158
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:13,420
but usually the indicator is kind of the one that's the gold standard. But if you look at direct

1159
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:19,180
amino acid oxidation, so I did this, I pulled up a bar of direct amino acid oxidation, which basically

1160
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:24,300
is like, if you feed a certain amount of protein, if you're feeding increasing levels of protein,

1161
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:28,940
and you look at the oxidation levels of a specific amino acid, it'll be kind of flat.

1162
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:34,140
And then you'll hit an inflection point and kind of go up linearly. And they've said, okay, that

1163
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:38,860
inflection point right there, where you start increasing amino acid oxidation, that's obviously

1164
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:43,260
wasteful, right? That that's extra protein you don't need any more than where that inflection

1165
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:48,620
point is. And then if you look at what actually increases muscle protein synthesis, it's right at

1166
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:53,420
where amino acids start getting oxidized. And do you think that that's just an association?

1167
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:57,820
Or do you think I think it's an association, you don't think that that's causative? No,

1168
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:01,980
I don't think it's causative. I think it's more if you think about it from a teleological perspective

1169
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:08,140
of evolution, it would, to me, and this is one thing Don Lehman was great about, he would always

1170
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:12,300
ask me, why do you think this is happening? You know, from an evolutionary perspective,

1171
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:18,460
it would make sense that at the same amount of protein that you can start using it for energy,

1172
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:25,100
that you can also start building extra tissue. To me, that actually kind of makes sense. You've got

1173
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:30,940
such a surplus that now you can begin to build more lean tissue. And did you say that on average,

1174
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:37,420
that was going to occur at roughly two grams per kilo? Well, that's that's going to be the like,

1175
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:40,780
the higher end of that linear bar, I'd say, so maybe you're probably gonna have,

1176
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:47,100
you're probably going to see amino acid oxidation. I don't know the exact number I could find it if

1177
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,220
I dug through enough stuff, but you know, probably around one gram per kilogram of body weight protein

1178
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:57,820
intake, something around there. Oh, I see. So you even start to see that at such a low level. Oh,

1179
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:03,500
yeah. Basically, at the RD, once you pass the RDA, you'll probably just start to oxidize amino acids.

1180
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:09,580
Right. So you really got to think about protein as you've got to throw in a lot more to get out

1181
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:14,460
what you want. It's kind of like so it's just a very inefficient system. Correct. Which works to

1182
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:19,980
your advantage because again, like that wasteful feudal cycle is wasting energy, you know, you're

1183
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:24,540
spending more energy and is that all through gluconeogenesis lane? All of that oxidation is

1184
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:31,180
it going to the liver to make glucose? It's been a while. So forgive me, I could be wrong. There is,

1185
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:38,220
I believe, some direct amino acid oxidation in terms of you have to deaminate it first. But after

1186
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:44,700
that, there's some pretty quick ways to oxidize some of those intermediates. And some of them can

1187
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:51,660
enter the Krebs cycle directly. That's right. Yes, yes, yes. I we do see some paths for amino acids.

1188
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:57,180
Yeah, think about alpha. Yeah. Think about ketoglutarate. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So that's a direct,

1189
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:04,700
I believe, from glutamate. Yeah. So yeah, there are these places. And I think it's like 60% of

1190
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:09,980
protein is gluconeogenic. That's right. Not all of it is. Yeah. Right. And there is some specific

1191
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:17,420
ketogenic amino acids. See, this is like, if I was still in grad school, I would know this.

1192
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:21,900
This is a Dom Dagestino question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think one of the branch chains is actually

1193
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:28,700
ketogenic. So, so you can there are pathways to both. But that's the beautiful thing about

1194
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:33,900
metabolism is like nothing is actually wasted, you know, if it's given off as heat or something

1195
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:38,220
like that, it's because there was a reason for it. You know, if it's, if it's metabolized in the

1196
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:41,580
glucose, it's because there was a reason for it. It's one of the beautiful things. In fact,

1197
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:46,060
one of the pieces of artwork I want to get in my office is the chart of metabolism. You know,

1198
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:50,940
it's just such a cool thing to look at. And, you know, you almost as a scientist, I can look at

1199
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:57,580
that and go, you know, I could believe there's a God. Just from like how beautiful that is.

1200
01:53:57,580 --> 01:54:01,420
You know what I mean? Sorry, I realize I'm digressing here. But no, no, no, this is actually

1201
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:06,780
great background. So let's go back to our woman. She is now, you got her in the gym. She's there

1202
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:11,420
three days a week, 45 minutes at a time. We're doing kind of two days lower body, one day upper

1203
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:17,580
body to start for the first six weeks. The goal is don't, don't get hurt. Don't get too sore. Build

1204
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:23,500
up the, build up the habit of doing this thing. Find some resilience, get the tissue resilience.

1205
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:28,060
You're probably overly degrading muscle and not so much synthesizing. So don't expect to actually

1206
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:34,060
add lean mass. When you do your intake assessment on her, you find out she, so let's say she weighs

1207
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:44,380
135 pounds. So that's what 60 ish kilos. And you find out she's eating 50 grams of protein a day.

1208
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:52,460
So she says, and I don't know, you can probably think better through how many calories she's

1209
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:59,020
probably getting on average, but let's say she's getting 2300 calories per day of which only 200

1210
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:04,620
is coming from her protein. How do you change her macros with obviously the most important being the

1211
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:12,140
protein? Yeah. So I think the, one of the biggest things that I really work on people who they say,

1212
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:16,460
well, you know, I, you know, if I can't, I, especially with like our, our, our app carbon

1213
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:20,940
diet coach, um, a lot of people are like, man, these protein, again, I've seen it on Instagram.

1214
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:27,340
Yeah. It's called carbon diet coach. So basically it's, it's for, if people feel like they have a

1215
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:32,300
little bit more independence or, uh, they can't afford a one-on-one coach. So basically the app

1216
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:37,500
is a nutrition coaching app. If you put in your metrics, it will give you macros to follow,

1217
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:41,900
has a food tracker. And then every week you check in with the coach, which is an algorithm

1218
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:49,820
and it will adjust your macros based on your progress. So we have like, we've had thousands

1219
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:53,420
of awesome testimonials. So it's pretty cool to see, but one of the big things we'll get,

1220
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:58,940
especially from like gen pop is how do I hit these protein recommendations? And when I go in,

1221
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:03,500
most of their protein sources are really fatty cuts of meat. That's, that's one thing. And so

1222
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:09,500
I'll say, okay, one pump up your portion size, but let's select leaner cuts of meat, right?

1223
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:14,220
Because you're not necessarily trying to increase their calories. You're trying to basically keep

1224
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:20,540
them almost isocaloric, but shift more to protein. Absolutely. And, and sometimes even like in her

1225
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:25,340
case, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because she's already kind of small, but if people do have

1226
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:30,140
a little bit of excess body fat, especially if they're new to training, they can recomp. They

1227
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:34,860
actually absolutely can recomp, lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. And in that case, that

1228
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:38,780
might be a place where I would do it just because it sounds like she has a little bit more body fat

1229
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:43,420
than she probably should for her body weight. That's right. She's probably by BMI. Let's

1230
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:48,220
assume her height is such that by BMI, she's totally fine. She's at BMI of 25.

1231
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:58,300
But we would love to see her be at 22% body fat in two years instead of 35% body fat. And we would,

1232
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:03,180
in two years, I'd like to see her have, you know, 10 more pounds of muscle. Yep. And that's pretty

1233
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:09,100
reasonable goals. And so one of the things I would say is, okay, let's look at the portions of,

1234
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:12,940
if you are eating meat, let's look at the portions of meat you are eating. And, and sorry, what's

1235
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:18,220
your protein target for her? You know, a lot of it's going to be one, what can I get her to eat?

1236
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:23,500
Right? Like if I can throw it starting from starting from theoretically exceptional. And then

1237
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:30,620
yeah, I would probably say if we could get you at like 120 grams. Okay. So about a gram per pound,

1238
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:36,540
almost. Yeah. And it probably could be a little bit less 110, you know, because she doesn't have

1239
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:40,620
a lot of lean body mass. So probably 110 is going to be just fine anywhere in that range,

1240
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:47,580
it can be just fine. Okay. And then your strategy is what, how do you, how much in shake, how much in?

1241
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:53,180
Yeah. First thing is breakfast. Okay. So breakfast is where most Americans are very low in protein,

1242
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:57,820
because most breakfast foods either don't eat breakfast, or it's a banana or it's cereal or

1243
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:02,940
it's oatmeal or whatever. Oh, and so I'm going to just keep making shit up to be funny. She says,

1244
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:08,700
but lane, the thing that has been so helpful for me is I do time restricted eating. So I,

1245
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:15,340
do just two meals a day, lunch and dinner. First thing I would say is, okay, why are you doing time

1246
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:19,980
restricted eating? And she'll say, because it really helps me maintain my weight. This thing,

1247
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:25,020
I would say is, okay, you can probably still get the vast majority of the benefits of time

1248
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:29,900
restricted eating, just throwing down a lean protein source or a shake in the morning. Right?

1249
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:33,820
And now you're, you're getting in, boom, another 25 or 30 grams of protein. You're stimulating

1250
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:40,700
protein synthesis and protein itself. I mean, high protein diets actually mimic some of the,

1251
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:46,300
the things that go up during fasting. So I would say that protein acts a little bit differently.

1252
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:51,660
And one of the things I said to people, if they are trying to increase or maximize lean body mass,

1253
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:57,340
but they want to do, you know, time restricted eating for the benefits of satiety and like

1254
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:03,100
lifestyle, cool, do that, but throw in a protein shake in the morning, just because it's, it's not

1255
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:07,900
going to mess up, you know, many of those things. And it's going to help with lean body mass.

1256
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:12,860
What about mTOR, right? I mean, mTOR is responsive to amino acids. And of course,

1257
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:16,700
I'm going to argue you're not getting much mTOR suppression with an overnight fast and skipping

1258
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:22,140
breakfast, but you know, where it is, you know, but what about low IGF and all of these other

1259
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:26,460
things that are, aren't these the important pillars of longevity? Isn't all this extra protein

1260
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:30,620
you're making me eat at odds with that? Let me answer that question after I get to how I'd

1261
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:33,500
add more protein. Okay. Okay. Because that's really, really, I was talking about somebody

1262
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:37,500
about this the other day and it's a great question and so many people mess it up.

1263
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:42,860
So the next thing I would do is, okay, let's look at lunch. Where can we get more protein?

1264
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:47,660
If it's not a, if it's not a shake or anything like that, let's pump up, you know, some lean

1265
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:53,100
protein in the sandwich or, or let's add it to your salad or, you know, whatever it is, whatever,

1266
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:59,020
I don't want to like fundamentally change how she's eating. If the calorie amount is okay,

1267
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:03,020
I want to make small changes that aren't going to feel disruptive to our current lifestyle,

1268
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:06,940
the minimal disruption of the current lifestyle. In fact, the research shows that in terms of

1269
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:11,740
dietary adherence, the less you can change, the better they will do because it's already

1270
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:16,460
close to their current lifestyle. So then if we get to dinner, which is where most people get about

1271
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:22,140
65% of their protein, again, assuming we've gotten, you know, 20, 30 grams of breakfast,

1272
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:27,500
20, 30 grams at lunch. And again, people say, well, how many shakes can I have? Hey, if you like

1273
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:32,940
having shakes, there's nothing wrong with shakes. Absolutely nothing wrong. Go, go ham. Like,

1274
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:37,740
there's nothing wrong with it. I want to make sure we come back and talk about shakes and proteins

1275
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:41,020
and the different types. So between the two of us, let's remember that because that's,

1276
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:47,100
I think that's another question. Shakes. And then we got to talk about mTOR first. And then at

1277
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:50,780
dinner, obviously, okay, if they've been having fattier cuts of meat, which a lot of people,

1278
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:54,860
they have a rib eye, they have, and again, I'm not saying you can't have those things,

1279
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:59,420
but again, if calories are consideration rib eye, T-bone, those sorts of things, okay,

1280
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:04,940
well, let's move to like a sirloin or a filet or chicken breast, or like, even like you can get

1281
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:11,420
pork chops that are really lean too, that are very tasty. So, or, you know, venison or just,

1282
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:16,460
just some sort of, by the way, I had a, I was in a place called Steelbok here in Tampa and they had

1283
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:24,380
a venison rib eye or something like that. I think it was a venison rib eye. Amazing. It was like four

1284
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:31,900
grams of fat per serving. Amazing. So you can really just by simply changing the cuts of meat,

1285
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:36,060
you can pump up the protein, reduce the fat, your calories kind of stay about the same.

1286
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:41,020
And then again, I like to use shakes wherever somebody just says, Hey, I just don't have,

1287
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:46,460
especially as people get older, they, they tend to consume less protein and have less of an appetite

1288
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:51,100
for protein, especially like the mastication is, as people get older, they, they just don't like

1289
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:56,700
having to chew as much. And so shakes can be a really, really useful tool. And even if like

1290
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:59,900
somebody's having a carb heavy breakfast, typically like a cereal or something like that,

1291
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:07,180
there's such good, like ready to drink shakes out there right now, instead of milk on your cereal,

1292
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:12,300
just put a protein shake, a vanilla protein shake, and boom, you've got 30 grams of protein instead

1293
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:17,100
of eight, you know? So the really, I mean, now, I mean, Peter, I'm sure you can speak to this

1294
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:21,980
compared to what I started like in the late nineties, early 2000s. I mean, literally,

1295
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:27,580
I got a can of unflavored protein from GNC one time. I was like, Oh, I can do this, you know,

1296
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:31,740
because it was cheap and I was a college student and I could not do it. It was like chalk. It was

1297
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:36,700
literally like chalk. My first, when I was in high school, there was this brand called Sheckley,

1298
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:42,300
I think. Um, yeah, it was, it was pretty bad, but boy, we would, and the protein bars,

1299
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:48,300
which again, not the best tool, but again, what are we replacing it with? Right? So if you're

1300
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:52,860
having a protein bar instead of like a really, you know, a burger or something like that, great,

1301
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:57,420
great alternate substitute. And there's some great tasting ones out there now.

1302
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:03,340
Now your question about Mtor and IGF one. Oh, sorry. Just going before we wrap up her.

1303
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:08,060
So the biggest change you've made is you've doubled her protein intake, which in reality

1304
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:12,860
is almost an isocaloric switch. Like you're, it's a rounding error in terms of how many

1305
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:18,460
additional calories you've had. Are you paying attention to what percentage carb versus fat in

1306
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,660
this woman, given that our primary goal is going to be hypertrophy over the next couple of years?

1307
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:28,620
So the research on hypertrophy leads me to think as far as carbs and fats go,

1308
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:34,780
it mostly doesn't matter as long as you're not at the extreme of either. So if you are very,

1309
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:41,740
very low fat, it can impair testosterone levels. Now they've never, not really shown like an

1310
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:45,500
impairment of lean mass accrual, but they haven't really measured it either. And I would say that

1311
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:50,540
if it impairs testosterone enough, you may get an impairment of lean body mass. As far as how much

1312
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:54,380
as far as how much fat that is, it's very difficult question. Cause they've done it as a percentage

1313
02:03:54,380 --> 02:04:00,300
of calories, which to me is almost useless because obviously if you know, 10% of calories,

1314
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:05,740
if you're eating 5,000 calories is still probably enough fat. And as you have more calories, you

1315
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:11,820
can also create fat or spare fat from oxidation by using more carbohydrates. So first off, it's,

1316
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:16,300
it's a calorie amount issue as well. But I would say if you're going to get at least 20% of your

1317
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:21,660
calories from fat, you're probably safe. And as an absolute floor, you know, like 40 grams of fat,

1318
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:27,340
again, I'm guessing. So please don't be dogmatic about these numbers to those who are listening.

1319
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:33,100
But then also like a ketogenic diet does appear to impair lean body mass accrual probably through

1320
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:38,220
a few different mechanisms. Even though carbohydrates aren't stimulatory for muscle protein

1321
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:44,380
synthesis, they do inhibit muscle protein degradation. And fat doesn't appear to have

1322
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:48,940
the same effect. It's probably an insulin effect. Insulin doesn't inhibit muscle protein degradation.

1323
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:54,460
And it's also a bit of a, it's almost impossible to be on a ketogenic diet. If you're actually

1324
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:59,100
generating sufficient ketones, and that's your metric for saying you're ketogenic with the amount

1325
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:04,780
of protein that we were talking about anyway, because for someone your size, it would be very

1326
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:08,700
difficult for you to get high levels of beta hydroxybutyrate with the amount of protein that

1327
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:13,580
you would need to be in that positive nitrogen balance anyway. So correct. So I think

1328
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:23,580
the, the other way that it probably impairs lean body mass accrual is through just effect on

1329
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:29,020
training because you know, resistance training is anaerobic for the most part, right? So her

1330
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:36,460
glycolytic capacity goes down. Yeah. And that requires glucose. Yeah, yeah. So it's, you know,

1331
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:41,100
the research shows that if we're talking about ultra endurance or even endurance in terms of like

1332
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:48,300
under 65 70% of a VO two max ketogenic compares to be just fine. But once you start getting over

1333
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:56,060
that 65% VO two max, there does seem to be a significant impairment in performance. And that

1334
02:05:56,060 --> 02:06:00,620
could also be so there was a couple of 12 week studies looking at lean body mass accrual and

1335
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:05,020
showing an impairment with the ketogenic diet. My guess is it's one through not inhibiting muscle

1336
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:10,620
protein degradation as much and two just through not performing as well. And they do they did show

1337
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:15,740
lower strength accrual as well in the ketogenic diet group. So so your fat to carb ratio in her

1338
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:22,380
given that we're not going to go to any extreme. And I noticed in your programming, because I,

1339
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:26,140
you know, some of the stuff that you've written about you talk about, look, here is where you

1340
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:32,380
kind of customize it based on how you respond to carbs. So some people, carbs really increase their

1341
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:37,340
appetite, they, you know, create brain fog, all sorts of things. If you're in that camp, you're

1342
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:41,580
going to push to a lower carb variant here. If you're someone who tolerates carbohydrates very

1343
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:47,900
well, you could easily be on a higher version there. And that becomes the secondary fill after

1344
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:52,700
the primary bucket of protein is established. Absolutely. Protein and calories most important

1345
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:56,780
two things, how you distribute your carbohydrates and fats should be based on what you could adhere

1346
02:06:56,780 --> 02:07:02,540
to and what you enjoy. And you know, whether it's I could argue that like brain fog or appetite that

1347
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:07,740
it depends on the type of carbohydrate, a lot of it might be possibly placebo as well, just based on

1348
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:13,580
things that have been said in the media. Regardless, if you know that you just prefer a lower carb diet,

1349
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:16,860
then there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing it as long as you're not getting to the extreme

1350
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:22,460
end of a low carb diet. And even then it's a it's a it's a balancing act, right? It's it's okay,

1351
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:27,580
you know what, I really, really enjoy the ketogenic diet. I understood, but my goal isn't to be the

1352
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:32,780
biggest, most muscular person I could possibly can be, but you can still gain lean body mass on the

1353
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:37,180
ketogenic diet. And so this is where like nutrition communication really requires nuance.

1354
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:41,580
Because what somebody might hear what I just said is like saying, you can't gain muscle on

1355
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:47,500
the ketogenic diet. No, I'm just saying you can't gain as much, but you can absolutely gain muscle.

1356
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:51,020
Same thing with intermittent fasting, you can absolutely gain muscle and intermittent fasting.

1357
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:56,780
Are you going to build as much? Probably not quite. But again, it depends on what your goal is. If your

1358
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:03,500
goal is my primary focus is muscle mass, then I would say, okay, protein, calories and making

1359
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:08,300
sure you have enough carbohydrate as well. But if your primary goal is maintaining body composition,

1360
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:12,940
if you put a little bit less muscle mass, but you like being low carb, then then do it right.

1361
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:17,740
So it's really going to boil down to for this individual lady, hey, what do you what do you

1362
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:21,980
what do you like best? And then even for some people when you know, if they get overwhelmed

1363
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:26,620
by like protein, carbs and fats, I'll say, hey, hey, just track your calories and track your protein.

1364
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:31,740
That that's it, right? Like those are the big buckets. And then if you want to get more granular,

1365
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:35,980
you can write like I get granular because I want to make sure I'm kind of getting a consistent

1366
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:40,060
amount of carbohydrates and fats because I don't want my performance to fluctuate very much. I also

1367
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:44,300
don't want my body weight to fluctuate a ton because I use that to track various metrics in our app.

1368
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:50,700
But I you know, for most people, calories and protein, two huge buckets, and you're getting

1369
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:57,500
9099% of the benefits. Now I want to come back to your your what this person might say about mTOR

1370
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:02,380
and IGF one, I've heard these things are bad. You know, what would you say? And there's been a lot of

1371
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:06,460
I know, David Sinclair has brought a lot of stuff and saying, you know, I'm really trying to limit

1372
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:14,540
mTOR and IGF one. And it will never cease to amaze me. How many scientists do not understand the

1373
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:24,300
difference between a short term truncated acute response to a stressor versus dysregulated

1374
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:32,780
signaling that persists indefinitely. And what I mean is, when you look at mTOR elevations that

1375
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:39,580
that lead to cancer and whatnot, those originate at what I would say mostly insulin resistance.

1376
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:44,620
So you're having elevations in insulin, you're having elevations in insulin signaling through

1377
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:52,860
AKT, which which can then transmit to mTOR. And so it's like this chronic kind of low level pushing

1378
02:09:52,860 --> 02:10:00,140
that button, right? As opposed to a pulsatile. That is a big difference between a dose of protein

1379
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:07,980
that causes mTOR to rise go back down in a natural rhythm. Okay. Also tissue specific,

1380
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:12,460
we're talking about in skeletal muscle, not liver, not brain, necessarily those sorts of things.

1381
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:20,700
IGF one, same deal. And what I will say is, where are all the resistance trained people

1382
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:26,940
that are getting cancer by the droves? Because if you want to talk about amplitude of response

1383
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:34,460
from mTOR resistance training, dwarfs what protein does. If we look at the meta-analyses on cancer

1384
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:39,260
incidents amongst resistance trainers, and there's getting to be some now, we see lower levels of

1385
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:45,340
cancer in people who resistance train. So what that tells me is there's a difference between

1386
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:48,940
these two signals. And I want to point out something there, because I think it would be

1387
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:53,420
very quick to say, but Lane, there's a healthy user bias there, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1388
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:58,380
I don't think what you're saying is that that proves that lifting makes you live longer.

1389
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:03,420
I think what you're actually saying is no, it's the contra-positive. It demonstrates that lifting

1390
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:10,060
doesn't increase mTOR to the point of it being detrimental to your health. That can be asserted,

1391
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:15,660
I think from that observation. Or that it's tissue, also tissue specific. That's part of it.

1392
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:22,780
Let's use a different example. So let's look at exercise in general. So if you were, Peter,

1393
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:26,220
if you got educated in medical school but knew nothing about exercise.

1394
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:28,940
Yeah, I love this. This is one of my favorite discussions.

1395
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:33,420
You know where I'm going with this. And I told you, I'm going to do something that's going to

1396
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:39,340
elevate your heart rate, elevate your inflammatory markers, elevate your reactive oxygen species,

1397
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:40,300
increase your blood pressure.

1398
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:41,580
Increase hepatic glucose output.

1399
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,060
Yep.

1400
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:42,540
Yeah.

1401
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:44,380
What would you say to me about that?

1402
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,860
Of course, I'd say, yeah, this can't be good for you.

1403
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:50,620
Don't do that. And what is exercise? It does all those things.

1404
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:51,100
Sure.

1405
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:58,620
Right? So why is exercise good for us? Because that is a short-term stressor. I mean, we use

1406
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:05,340
the term hormesis if you want, that the body responds to and it actually acts kind of like

1407
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:09,260
a vaccine. I realize that's like a really triggering term for a lot of people right now,

1408
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:13,580
but it's like a vaccine, right? It's a controlled dose of a stressor that your body can handle.

1409
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:19,740
And I kind of look at protein, this, I wouldn't say protein is a stressor necessarily, but again,

1410
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:26,380
it's this acute response versus a chronic hum, right? Your inflammatory markers,

1411
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:34,860
like people who deal with elevated inflammation, it's not actually super high elevations,

1412
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:44,300
but it's just all the time. That chronic pulse on that, that is the problem. That is the issue.

1413
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:49,580
And again, you said they might say, well, there's health and user bias there. And I would say,

1414
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:58,780
well, so what? Okay. So you're saying that people who have high rates of IGF-1 and mTOR who are

1415
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:02,540
healthy, okay, well, show me them getting higher incidence of cancer.

1416
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:08,060
You can't, you can't because all these things are tied together because people who have high

1417
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:15,100
levels of mTOR activation and IGF-1 typically have insulin resistance. They have poor dietary habits

1418
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:21,340
and poor lifestyle habits. So I would say that it, okay, that's a fair point. There's confounding

1419
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:24,940
variables, but all these things are tied up together. You can't really separate them.

1420
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:33,340
And again, am I saying that mTOR plays absolutely no role? No. But, you know, you're cut, again,

1421
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:37,580
it can be cart before the horse sort of thing. Like people say, well, rapamycin

1422
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:45,260
is an mTOR inhibitor and that's a cancer treatment drug. And I would say, yes. But do you think it's

1423
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:51,900
a good idea to take, do chemotherapy to prevent cancer? I don't think so. I don't think radiation

1424
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:57,340
is a good idea to get into it. It's not even really true because rapamycin is not really,

1425
02:13:57,340 --> 02:14:02,300
I mean, it's never really been a particularly successful cancer therapeutic. It used

1426
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:09,180
constitutively, which is how it would be used. Obviously, I think rapamycin does have significant

1427
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:15,100
longevity benefits in basically all models that aren't humans. So the extrapolation would be

1428
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:23,100
pulsatile rapamycin is probably beneficial, but it's in that application, it's not really

1429
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:28,140
being taken to constantly suppress mTOR. Because remember, if you took it all the time, you're

1430
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:34,540
suppressing mTOR complex two and mTOR complex one. So yeah, no, I agree with that point actually

1431
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:42,780
completely, which is that tissue specificity and time course are very difficult things to

1432
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:53,260
infer from the outside, which is sort of the meta view of all things equal, IGF levels have a J

1433
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:59,420
curve with mortality and therefore very, very high levels of IGF must be problematic and high protein

1434
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:04,300
increases IGF and therefore must be bad. And I think it's important to also understand the

1435
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:09,020
following and that is, I think we have this idea, I think I might have missed this on the last show,

1436
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:12,140
but I think we have this idea that there's this perfect diet out there.

1437
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:17,580
It's going to be the one diet that's going to help reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease

1438
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:23,100
and mortality and all and the fact is that there's probably trade-offs for everything.

1439
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:30,540
I know there's people out there that will say that protein increases cancer. Well,

1440
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:34,540
there's a ton of confounders to that. Like somebody saying, well, there's healthy user bias, sure,

1441
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:39,660
but there's ton of confounders to people who eat high protein. Most protein in these meta analyses

1442
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:45,420
looking at cancer, I mean, you're talking about high protein is above 70 grams of protein per day

1443
02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:51,340
or 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. Okay, well, where do most people, most Americans eat

1444
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:58,380
high protein by definition of the RDA, but where is it from? It's from burgers and hot dogs and

1445
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:04,860
like a bunch of processed meat. So what does the cancer incidence say about people who have high

1446
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:10,140
protein but an overall healthy diet? And there was a really interesting cohort study out of

1447
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:16,220
Alberto and 100,000 people where they said, okay, we're going to look at meat intake and I think

1448
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:23,100
even red meat intake specifically. We're going to look at low, medium and high levels of red meat

1449
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:30,540
intake, but also with low, medium and high levels of fruit and vegetable intake. And because here's

1450
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:36,380
the big thing is most people who eat high levels of meat and protein eat low levels of fruits and

1451
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:43,420
vegetables. What they found was that at the highest levels of meat intake, but also with the highest

1452
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:49,260
levels of fruit and vegetable intake, there was no difference in cancer incidence between the lowest

1453
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:54,860
level of fruit or the lowest level of meat intake. And even with the highest level of fruit and

1454
02:16:54,860 --> 02:17:02,700
vegetable intake, it's not an issue. So what that seems. It's a marker for overall diet quality is.

1455
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:07,580
Bingo. So and I, again, I don't want to extrapolate too much out of one study,

1456
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:16,060
even though it was a large study. But what that would seem to suggest is that overall diet quality

1457
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:22,220
is the big rock that we're looking at here. And you can achieve good diet quality on a whole host

1458
02:17:22,220 --> 02:17:25,820
of different diets. I mean, you can have a ketogenic diet. That's very poor quality diet.

1459
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:29,820
You can have a ketogenic diet. It's very high quality diet. You can have a plant-based diet.

1460
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:34,060
It's very low quality and you can have a plant-based. It's very high quality. You can have

1461
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:39,100
intermittent fasting, this low quality and so on and so forth. A lot of it boils down to like,

1462
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:44,220
what are the food choices you're making on balance? Are you getting enough fruits and

1463
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:50,140
vegetables and minerals and, and, and micronutrients? And even then, you know, it's so interesting.

1464
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:55,820
Every time we try to say, okay, well, fruits and vegetables have these, you know, these benefits

1465
02:17:55,820 --> 02:18:00,540
on health that we see pretty consistently. So let's try and take out these isolated micronutrients

1466
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:04,940
and give them in a supplement. We just, we're always disappointed with the results. And it

1467
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:10,540
just seems to be a little bit of mother nature's kitchen. You know what I mean? That you kind of

1468
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:18,460
have to eat the whole food to really get those benefits. But yeah, I think, again, if the mTOR

1469
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:26,700
story were true in terms of dietary protein, we would have expected in that study to see a linear

1470
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:34,060
increase in cancer, especially at each level of fruit and vegetable intake. But we didn't. What

1471
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:39,420
we saw was more of a linear inverse association with fruit and vegetable intake is what we saw.

1472
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:46,380
So let's not talk about a different example of a person who comes to you. So now let's just use a

1473
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:53,900
male instead of a female last one. And let's talk about kind of a 40, 50 year old male who's trained.

1474
02:18:53,900 --> 02:19:02,060
So they have a training background, but, you know, they are also realizing what you said earlier,

1475
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:07,660
which is, hey, I'm going to start losing muscle mass as a, at a pretty good clip once I'm in my

1476
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:14,300
50s. And certainly by the time I'm 65, it really starts to nosedive. So the aha moment is I need

1477
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:18,620
to build up as much of a reservoir as possible. So there's a person who says, look, I've always

1478
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:22,620
been an athlete. I've always done X, Y, and Z, but I've never really thought about muscle mass.

1479
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:27,420
I want to start thinking about it now. Maybe I've got a decade to pack as much on as possible

1480
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:32,860
before I'll go into that. Just maintain it as long as I can mode. Okay. So this is a person who

1481
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:39,580
they're lifting weights three days a week, an hour at a time. They even do some, you know,

1482
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:44,220
they squat, they deadlift, they do a whole body sort of, let's say they do a whole body split

1483
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:53,100
every day for those three days. And let's say their DEXA scan is 20% fat. So they're probably

1484
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:57,740
middle of the pack. Maybe they're probably 20% fat would probably be 25th percentile actually

1485
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:03,900
for a 50 year old. And now they come to you and they say, Lane, okay, I want to go all in. Like,

1486
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:08,300
I want to know, can I be 10% body fat? So they're not trying to be a bodybuilder,

1487
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:20,860
but they want to be 10% body fat in two years. And let's just assume that their BMI is 25 as well.

1488
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:25,100
No, let's say it's not. Let's actually, they say their BMI is 27. So they're technically a little

1489
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:31,020
bit overweight and they've got a little extra body fat. How are you going to change their training?

1490
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:37,340
How are you going to prescribe nutrition? Yeah. So let me ask a question back. Yeah.

1491
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:39,980
Have they been training consistently up to this point?

1492
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:45,100
Yeah, they've been training relatively consistently. But when you look at it, you realize

1493
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:51,340
they're not really in a progressive overload mindset, right? Like they've become a little

1494
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:58,860
comfortable in their training. If you dig under, you'll notice that they haven't really

1495
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:02,860
increased the weight in anything they're doing in five years.

1496
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:06,780
The first thing is looking at the resistance training is, okay, just what you said. All right,

1497
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:10,860
you're doing three sets of 10 on everything. That's right. And you slap a plate on, you slap

1498
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:16,380
two plates on and you do the same thing you've been doing. Adaptation is never comfortable.

1499
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:19,420
So what you're trying to do to grow muscle, you're trying to induce adaptation.

1500
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:26,860
Muscular hypertrophy is an adaptation to a stressor placed on the body. In this case,

1501
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:34,140
the stressor is volume and mechanical load, right? So either you need to increase the weight,

1502
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:41,500
the repetitions, or the number of sets. And doing so is going to be uncomfortable.

1503
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:49,660
Your body is going to tell you it's uncomfortable. And I've had this, even my own coach, who I know

1504
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:54,300
is coaching me for nationals this year for powerlifting. It's so funny, I was like,

1505
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:59,500
you know, starting to kind of have this linear effect coming back from these injuries I've had.

1506
02:22:00,220 --> 02:22:06,860
And then one week, you know, I kind of had a dip in performance. And I also was feeling really beat

1507
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:12,860
up. And he just responded one line said, adaptation is never comfortable. And it's so true. It really

1508
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:18,700
is. And we talked about this sort of thing. So just mentally gearing this person up for the idea

1509
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:23,020
that, hey, you know, you've been comfortable, we're going to go start doing some things that are

1510
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:29,100
uncomfortable. And whether it's those particular exercises he's been doing, it sounds like he's

1511
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:34,780
been doing big compound movements. So probably going to keep him on that. I would like to get,

1512
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:38,460
you know, video feedback to see what his form is like, especially with, you know, injury

1513
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:45,420
considerations as we age and pain. So getting some feedback on those, making sure that, you know,

1514
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:52,060
he is getting the requisite amount of load, aggressive overload. And also at this age,

1515
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:58,220
and we're trying to push now, it's also about knowing when do we build in some tapers

1516
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:03,900
so that he can actualize those gains and recover as well. Because here's the thing about adaptation

1517
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:09,820
at a certain point, if you've been training for long enough, and you're old enough,

1518
02:23:11,020 --> 02:23:15,980
the amount that you need to cause adaptation versus what is going to cause you to overreach is going

1519
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:21,100
to become closer and closer and closer, right? When you first start, when you first get into

1520
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:27,100
training, you need almost nothing to adapt, right? Like you come in and do one set of leg extensions,

1521
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:31,020
you will get an adaptation from that, right? If you do it consistently for several weeks,

1522
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:36,220
been training five years, one set of leg extension is going to do absolutely nothing.

1523
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:43,020
It might maintain what you have. That's it. And so if you want to push adaptation,

1524
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:49,820
you have to push harder, which is going to create more of a recovery deficit. And so while your

1525
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:54,220
recovery is going, your recovery recovery capacity is going to increase as you get older and have a

1526
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:58,540
greater training experience, it's not going to increase as much as the amount of stress that

1527
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:04,540
you're going to have to apply to adapt. So again, I think having built in tapers is really important.

1528
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:11,260
And whether you do them responsibly in terms of, okay, this person is beginning week to week,

1529
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:16,700
we've seen he's adding five pounds, oh, this week we had a dip in performance. Now maybe we

1530
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:22,620
reactively do a taper, that's possible. Or whether you build them in systematically to try and get

1531
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:28,620
ahead of that curve, either way can work. In the latter lane, what is the typical

1532
02:24:29,420 --> 02:24:35,020
duration of a build cycle taper cycle? It's probably going to get progressively closer

1533
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:39,820
together the more advanced you get. So I'll give you my situation is kind of unique. So

1534
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:46,540
I get my kids week on, week off. And we have noticed that the weeks I get my kids, I get less

1535
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:51,740
sleep, I have a little more stress, and my performance goes down a little bit. And we

1536
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:57,660
see that and I also I track bar velocity as well. So how do you do that? What equipment do you use

1537
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:05,420
for that? I use a device called rep one, which is a accelerometer. It's available for purchase by

1538
02:25:05,420 --> 02:25:10,460
private individuals, it's about $400. So it's really honestly, it's nerd stuff, if you're really

1539
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:16,940
dialed in. But I like to use it because I if I don't push the weight, I can try and look at the

1540
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:21,980
speed and see, you know, comparatively, okay, compared to last time, did I move the same weight

1541
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:29,500
faster or slower. And so when we look at my performance in terms of strength, RPE, speed,

1542
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:34,540
all those measures consistently show them typically on weeks that the kids are with me.

1543
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:42,380
I'm just not quite as good. I'm about 90 to 95% as good. So we've actually built in micro cycles

1544
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:48,140
of tapering. So it's sort of a push week, a slightly back off week, and one week at a time.

1545
02:25:48,140 --> 02:25:53,020
Yeah, now overall, through these micro cycles, we're trying to walk up the volume and the

1546
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:58,620
progressive overload. And then after, you know, probably four to eight weeks, we'll do a much

1547
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:06,140
bigger taper where we pull back on everything. But we do micro tapers in between now. So for this guy,

1548
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:11,820
for this guy, probably for it. Yeah, 48 weeks. Okay, so you'd say, look, I'm going to guesstimate

1549
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:17,260
split the difference. For six weeks, I'm going to push you. And then you're going to back off how

1550
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:24,860
much and for how long? So I like to back off the volume and also the intensity a little bit.

1551
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:32,540
So whereas maybe we're up to, you know, a 789 RPE on most sets. And when I say RPE,

1552
02:26:32,540 --> 02:26:37,260
we're talking about rate of perceived exertion. And an easy way to think about it is if it's a 7RPE

1553
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:43,260
on a set, then that person could have done three more reps before they hit absolute failure.

1554
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:52,540
So most RPEs to me for advanced people should be close to seven or eight with a few sets pushing

1555
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:57,500
into a nine and very rarely should you push to a 10. There's quite a bit of literature out there

1556
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:04,300
to show that you get a you get basically the same hypertrophy training close to failure that you do

1557
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:11,660
going to absolute failure. And the it's not necessarily that failure is bad. It's just the

1558
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:21,180
amount of recovery deficit it creates, the amount of taxation it creates is disproportionate to the

1559
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:29,660
stimulus. So what we really want to do is maximize hypertrophy while in stimulus while minimizing

1560
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:36,140
fatigue. Because if you're, yes, sure, you can get a similar stimulus by going to failure and

1561
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:42,060
maybe even just a little bit more. But if it then causes you to have performance decrements the

1562
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:48,700
following week, or not be able to push as hard overall, we have to think about this as an overall

1563
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:54,540
training program and not just isolated workouts. And that's I'm very purposeful when I tell people,

1564
02:27:54,540 --> 02:28:00,540
I go into train, I don't go into workout, right? Like working out is just an isolated workout.

1565
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:06,940
And I've had so many people with big egos who say, well, I couldn't possibly not train to failure.

1566
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:12,060
First of all, I've watched them, they're not actually training to failure. Like I know what

1567
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:20,220
actual muscular failure feels like on a squat, for example, a free bar squat. So people I've seen this

1568
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:25,420
on Dr. Mike Israel's Instagram too, because he talks about training shy of failure a lot as well.

1569
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:29,820
And people will say something like, oh, you train like a wuss, you know, this isn't that hard.

1570
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:35,020
And what I want to say to them is I have done, so probably one of my most impressive squat sets is

1571
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:44,860
I did 480 pounds for 14 reps. And I've done 405 pounds for 21 reps before I couldn't move.

1572
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:50,140
Afterwards, it probably took me first off, it probably took me five minutes just to get my

1573
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:57,740
breath back, just to breathe enough to like be a functional human after that. Then as far as like

1574
02:28:57,740 --> 02:29:04,860
going to do another set, first off, when I hit that 480 and I grinded out that last rep, that 14th

1575
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:12,860
rep, I was so fatigued. I couldn't rack the right side of the barbell because for whatever reason,

1576
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:18,620
I'm a little bit lopsided and it sits just a hair lower there. I could not fully lock out my glutes

1577
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:22,940
and lower back and I couldn't rack it. And there was actually somebody had to run over from across

1578
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:28,540
the gym to help me rack it, even though normally it's no problem. And then I laid down for five

1579
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:34,540
minutes just trying to get my breath back. And then when I got up, if you told me I had to go

1580
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:40,620
squat 480 again, I'm telling you I couldn't have gotten a single rep, even after resting 10, 15

1581
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:46,140
minutes, there's not a chance in hell. So this idea, so you're telling me if I stopped two reps

1582
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:52,460
shy of that, that that would have felt easy. Or that it would have failed to produce benefit.

1583
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:59,580
And actually with compound movements specifically, you don't have to get as close to failure to get

1584
02:29:59,580 --> 02:30:03,420
the benefits with compound movements. By the way, I feel so much better hearing this today.

1585
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:10,060
Today was a deadlift day and this cycle I'm doing trap bar, which I actually don't like very much,

1586
02:30:10,060 --> 02:30:13,900
but I did sort of my trap bars. And then I was supposed to go to hip thrusters after and I was

1587
02:30:13,900 --> 02:30:17,980
not feeling great on it in a really, it just didn't feel like it was going to, so I was like,

1588
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:21,660
you know what, I really missed doing sumo deadlifts. So I went and did sumo deadlifts and they felt

1589
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:28,140
great. But on the very last set, I added a bunch more weight on. And at the sixth rep or eighth rep,

1590
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:33,820
I was like, I feel really good, but something tells me if I try to get to 10 today,

1591
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:38,620
I'm going to push just a little too much. So I sort of bagged it at eight. And afterwards,

1592
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:42,620
I was like, I'm really proud of myself. Like I didn't do something stupid because today's one

1593
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:47,100
of those days, because, you know, to deadlift two different deadlifts on one day and it's at the end

1594
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:53,420
of the workout, like that's, those are the moments when you make mistakes. But, but I like knowing

1595
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:57,980
that, and that was probably truthfully, I think I probably had four reps in me left. So that might

1596
02:30:57,980 --> 02:31:05,100
have only been a six or a seven RPE, but you still get benefit. Absolutely. And the research shows

1597
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:10,220
that. So what was popular a few years ago was kind of the effective reps hypothesis. I don't know if

1598
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:16,620
you've heard of this. What's that? So basically the idea is that the majority of the stimulus that

1599
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:22,300
you get for muscle growth is in the last five reps before failure. So what I'm going to do is

1600
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:27,500
I'm going to do 20 reps before failure. So whether you're doing 20 reps means you need to get to at

1601
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:32,940
least 15 reps to really get a similar stimulus. And in terms of volume and progressive overload,

1602
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:37,820
you really need to think about volume in terms of just number of hard sets within like a five RPE.

1603
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:43,580
But the research shows that that's much more accurate for isolation stuff than it is for

1604
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:51,100
compound. So compound lifts are kind of their own beast. You can train at a sub five RPE and still

1605
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:58,940
maximal EMG recruitment and quite a bit of hypertrophy. Whereas with isolation, you pretty

1606
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:03,900
much have to take it close to failure. And then the other thing I would say is that exercises are not

1607
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:10,700
equivalent. That's a big thing. It's like, all right, let's do a five RPE on a squat and then a

1608
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:16,140
nine RPE on a leg extension. I'll tell you the nine RPE on a leg extension. I can do that all day.

1609
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:21,420
I'll take that. I was just about to say that is infinitely less painful.

1610
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:28,300
Exactly. Versus a big compound movement that requires core and stabilization and breathing

1611
02:32:28,300 --> 02:32:33,420
and creating intra abdominal pressure. You know, all that kind of stuff, you know, factors into

1612
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:40,860
fatigue. So, you know, for this individual. Yeah. So tell me about sets and reps here. So

1613
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:49,660
again, let's assume he's much more interested in hypertrophy than strength. He's not going to

1614
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:55,660
power lift. What's the rep range you're going to keep him in for compound movements and for

1615
02:32:55,660 --> 02:33:04,220
isolated movements? Variety is the spice of life. And the research shows that from one rep to 30

1616
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:09,580
reps, you can build very similar amounts of muscle. So this is amazing, right? Because the

1617
02:33:09,580 --> 02:33:14,300
conventional wisdom says, oh, my God, if you're doing fewer than I don't know what the number is

1618
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:17,500
that they would say if you're doing fewer than six reps, there's no hypertrophy. It's all strength.

1619
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:21,260
Right. That's what that's what conventional thinking would say. And what I will say is there,

1620
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:25,900
you know, there are benefits to being in that hypertrophy rep range of, you know,

1621
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:33,180
six to 15 reps. That's kind of like traditional. So here's the benefits and downsides. One of the

1622
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:39,900
nice things about the six to 15 reps is you can accumulate quite a bit of metabolic fatigue,

1623
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:48,620
you can use relatively heavy loads, and you can get quite a bit of volume in that rep range.

1624
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:55,260
If you're doing like really heavy weights for low reps, say under five reps,

1625
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:58,540
you functionally would have to double your number of sets just to get the volume, right?

1626
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:01,340
Probably not because it's more about the number of hard sets. Okay.

1627
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:05,660
But doing a hard set of five is not the same thing as doing a hard set of 10.

1628
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:08,220
You have fewer of them in you, presumably, right?

1629
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:13,100
Probably. There's probably a greater fatigue effect. But some people, again, like me,

1630
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:17,500
if you told me I couldn't train, you know, under five reps, I'd be like, I'm just gonna be bored,

1631
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:25,180
you know, I don't like doing high reps. It's just I get bored. So for me, and the same thing with

1632
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:29,500
clients, again, adherence is number one, right? So if he says, Oh, I'm not worried about creating

1633
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:34,620
strength, but I really like lifting heavy weights. Okay, we're going to find a way to incorporate

1634
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:39,020
that. But it might be where, hey, we're touching one set that's under five reps, and the rest are

1635
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:43,580
going to be, you know, six to 10 on these compound exercises, then on the isolation exercises, you

1636
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:50,140
know, we'll go 1520, you know, just for some variety and whatnot. But really, the research,

1637
02:34:50,140 --> 02:34:53,980
at least in the short term, and when I say short term, I mean, like 12 weeks,

1638
02:34:54,940 --> 02:35:02,220
we don't see differences in hypertrophy between anywhere from, you know, low reps to 30 up to 30

1639
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:07,740
reps, as long as the number of hard sets are equated. So really, it says do what you like,

1640
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:13,980
do what you enjoy. And what is that? What is that sweet spot for hard sets, if we just pick 10 reps,

1641
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:22,380
so then we can do the math and go up or down. So the sweet spot is what maximizes per body part

1642
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:30,300
is probably about six to 10 sets in a session. Okay, so they don't really,

1643
02:35:31,580 --> 02:35:38,700
they don't really see, you know, improvements above 10 sets. Now, here's where this gets a little

1644
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:45,740
bit complicated, because if you rest longer, each set actually becomes more effective as a stimulus

1645
02:35:45,740 --> 02:35:49,980
for hypertrophy, presumably because you perform better, and you can use more weight and do more

1646
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:55,980
reps on that individual set. So the number based on the meta regressions out there, and I think

1647
02:35:55,980 --> 02:36:02,540
James Krieger did a really good one. The number seems to be like if you're resting kind of like,

1648
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:09,340
you know, more than three minutes between sets, six sets, if you're resting like one to two minutes,

1649
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:14,620
it might be more like 10 sets. But again, the other thing to keep in mind is you don't have to

1650
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:20,380
just jump to like 10 sets immediately, you know, per body part, you know, whatnot, that's a lot of

1651
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:27,580
sets. You should probably use what is ever allowing you to adapt at the time, if you're somebody who

1652
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:31,660
is, you know, relatively new to training, you start doing 10 sets per body part,

1653
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:35,900
like one, what's going to happen once you plateau, that's a lot more sets you're going to have to add

1654
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:43,020
on top of that. And two, you're probably going to outpace your recovery capabilities, right? You

1655
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:47,900
like, when people tell me they're going to do, I know you you talked about covering squatting and

1656
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:54,700
deadlifting every day. What I would say is you better be in a real you better be in very good

1657
02:36:55,820 --> 02:37:03,820
physical condition to do that. And even then there is a expiry date on that.

1658
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:09,340
And I've talked to people who have done this, to be clear, I've never done this, I look at the

1659
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:14,220
people who have tried it in awe, but I just I'm not willing to give up so many other things I do

1660
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:20,140
exercise wise to just make sure I squat and deadlift every single day. But what I notice that they're

1661
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:25,660
doing is they're being very clever in that they're not every day is not a crushing set of that,

1662
02:37:25,660 --> 02:37:33,180
right? I mean, yeah, some of those days, it's a very, very low volume, low intensity that functions

1663
02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:37,820
effectively as a recovery day where they're basically working on the muscle memory in the form.

1664
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:44,620
Yep. But so for example, in the case of this guy, if he says, Lane, I'm willing to train as

1665
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:49,100
much as you need to tell me to. So even though currently I'm doing 360 minute workouts a week,

1666
02:37:50,380 --> 02:37:54,780
if you tell me I need to be in there five days a week with two rest days, and that should be two

1667
02:37:54,780 --> 02:38:02,140
hours a day, I'm willing to do it. Where would you say again, let's assume that his form is decent,

1668
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:06,780
you're not concerned about overuse. Where would you want to put him? If he's not looking to

1669
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:12,300
powerlift, and he says, I don't really care about exercise selection, just pick whatever.

1670
02:38:13,180 --> 02:38:17,020
I'm probably not going to be doing a lot of free squatting and deadlifting,

1671
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:23,020
even though that's my personal love. Because those do create a very high recovery debt.

1672
02:38:23,820 --> 02:38:29,260
And not just that, it's very mentally taxing. I remember when my wife Holly moved over,

1673
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:34,620
and she's a phenomenal athlete, like went to the Junior World Games as a track athlete,

1674
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:41,900
like won the natural Olympia two years after she started lifting weights. I mean, just incredibly

1675
02:38:41,900 --> 02:38:47,420
genetically gifted and hardworking person. But she would look at me doing like triples on squats,

1676
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:53,180
and then resting 10 minutes between sets and say, why are you resting so long? That can't possibly

1677
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:58,060
be that difficult. Meanwhile, she's over there doing sets of 10 resting, you know, she's slapping

1678
02:38:58,060 --> 02:39:03,340
a plate on each side doing sets of 10 and resting, you know, a couple minutes. And I said, well,

1679
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:09,180
you'd have to really do a powerlifting me to understand. And then she did one. And then she

1680
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:17,180
was like, Yeah, the amount of intense mental focus it requires when you have that much weight on your

1681
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:23,660
back and you know, like this could literally kill you. Obviously, you have safeties and spotters and

1682
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:28,940
whatnot. But just, you know, strapping 600 pounds across your back. I mean, there's a reason you're

1683
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:38,940
adrenaline spikes. So after that, she understood, but that's a lot of recovery debt to create for

1684
02:39:38,940 --> 02:39:44,220
something that you could get a similar stimulus by doing a hack squad or a leg press or that sort of

1685
02:39:44,220 --> 02:39:48,620
thing, as long as you're working through a full range of motion. That's the other thing, very

1686
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:55,500
important to work a muscle and a long muscle length. In fact, there was actually a recent

1687
02:39:55,500 --> 02:40:01,500
meta-analysis that came out looking at partial range of motion, but partial range of motion at

1688
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:07,580
different muscle lengths and found that while partial range of motion at shortened muscle lengths

1689
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:14,300
does not produce the same hypertrophy as full range of motion, partial range of motion at

1690
02:40:14,300 --> 02:40:20,060
length and muscle lengths produce similar hypertrophy as full range of motion. So let

1691
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:23,420
me make sure I understand that lane. So let's just use a bicep because it's easy.

1692
02:40:24,060 --> 02:40:29,500
At the lengthened part of the bicep, when you are straight armed, you're saying a partial rep from

1693
02:40:29,500 --> 02:40:36,780
straight to say 90 degrees is more effective than if you just do the top of the bicep. So

1694
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:43,180
and let's assume you do the same range, but because at the shorter range, you're not seeing

1695
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:47,180
presumably as much adaptation or recruitment by the muscle.

1696
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:52,460
Presumably, although the bicep might be a little bit different because you would actually have to

1697
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:56,940
be on like an incline bench to truly get the stretched range of motion because otherwise,

1698
02:40:56,940 --> 02:41:02,860
in a traditional dumbbell curl, that the top end is actually the more difficult component of the rep.

1699
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:08,700
Whereas if you kind of pre-stretch it, now you can make that bottom part a little more difficult.

1700
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:13,500
So but if we think about something like a squat, right, like a partial range of motion, squat,

1701
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:18,620
if you're doing a partial range of motion in the bottom half, that is not going to be easy.

1702
02:41:18,940 --> 02:41:22,700
Right. So I think it's more about working the muscle in the difficult

1703
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:28,540
regions, but the stretch component does seem to be important. So what I would say is like,

1704
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:34,860
I would really, I really am a big fan of like something like a hack squat for leg development

1705
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:40,860
if you don't care about, you know, being strong on free squats. Because if you get a good machine,

1706
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:46,140
you can take it through a really full range of motion. You can really get a good stimulus for

1707
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:52,620
the quadriceps and some of the rest of the leg muscles. And it's not crazy fatiguing. So

1708
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:56,940
something like that, a leg press, there's also like really good pendulum squats. I really like

1709
02:41:56,940 --> 02:42:03,980
a good pendulum squat if you guys ever tried that. So it's kind of like you sit in a seat and it's on

1710
02:42:03,980 --> 02:42:11,580
an arm. So where you're kind of going, so if there's a pivot here, and the weight is loaded here,

1711
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:18,620
and you get in here, hopefully I'm just displaying this. And then as you go down, the weight's here.

1712
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:26,220
Basically, as you get lower, are your hands loading in front or are you loading? Yeah, yeah.

1713
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:32,380
They're right here. So as you're getting lower, it gets a little bit easier because of the pendulum.

1714
02:42:32,380 --> 02:42:37,020
And then as you get higher, it gets harder, which actually works on your strength curve,

1715
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:40,620
because the hardest part of the squat is near the bottom and the easiest parts near the top.

1716
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:46,220
So I really like those two, because those are exercises that you can really work through a nice

1717
02:42:46,220 --> 02:42:53,260
full range of motion and create a lot of stimulus. And like I said, I think full range of motion

1718
02:42:53,260 --> 02:43:00,220
or training in that stretched position is very, very important. And so, you know, I usually like

1719
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:06,780
to have kind of like two main exercises for a big muscle group like that. You probably don't need it.

1720
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:11,900
You probably could just do hack squats for five or six sets, you know, that sort of thing. But

1721
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:17,180
people like variety. And then I would do, you know, and I would keep those between, you know,

1722
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:22,220
a six and an eight RPE most likely, and then, you know, go to a leg extension and leg curl and those

1723
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:28,460
sorts of things. And or, well, I'd probably do an RDL, some sort of RDL, because it's not as fatiguing

1724
02:43:28,460 --> 02:43:33,260
as a deadlift, but you're still activating similar muscles. Once again, keeping that between a six

1725
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:38,780
eight RPE. And are you going to are you going to coach that with like, obviously one leg? Are you

1726
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:44,460
going to do Ipsy or ISO grab on the kettlebell? I would probably do a barbell, honestly, and do

1727
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:48,460
both legs. And then if, you know, if we felt like there was some imbalance or something like that,

1728
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:54,380
or they just wanted some variety, you could do single leg. It is going to if muscular hypertrophy

1729
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:59,420
is the primary goal, you can create more stimulus using, you know, both legs at the same time.

1730
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:09,340
And then with then doing some like isolation stuff, low rest periods, higher reps, you know,

1731
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:14,940
10 to 20 repetitions, going to a little bit higher RPE, you know, like a nine, an eight or nine RPE,

1732
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:20,140
I think those are fine. And then if somebody said, you know, I just I've got to take a set to failure.

1733
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:25,260
It's, you know, part of my credo. I came from the 80s bodybuilding. I said, great, take the last

1734
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:31,820
take the last exit, last set of the last exercise of an isolation to failure and go nuts, right?

1735
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:35,900
Like do something like that. And that might be how I build out a leg session, you know,

1736
02:44:35,900 --> 02:44:40,860
like the the bigger compound exercise is a little bit lower reps, you know, maybe five to 10.

1737
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:46,300
Then as we progress through, you know, more isolation going into the higher end of the

1738
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:50,060
rep range and maybe taking some a little bit closer to failure. And is he going to do this

1739
02:44:50,220 --> 02:44:53,980
two or three times a week? So frequency, interestingly,

1740
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:59,820
I think that the men analysis so far haven't been sensitive enough to pick it up. But

1741
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:05,820
what it says is that for legs, it doesn't matter. One time a week is enough. But for upper body,

1742
02:45:05,820 --> 02:45:10,220
two times a week, I think probably multiple times a week for both is beneficial. Your

1743
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:15,660
pH three program is about five days a week, right of total, but it was five days, it was five days a

1744
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:22,700
week, three days of lower body, three days of three days of squatting, two days of deadlifting,

1745
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:29,260
three days of bench pressing, and also accessory on those days as well. What I will say is for the

1746
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:34,940
most part, frequency is more of a tool to distribute volume than it is an individual

1747
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:41,500
hypertrophy stimulus. But it does seem to me that it would make sense. And again, a lot of people,

1748
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:46,300
scientists have gotten in trouble saying, well, this just makes sense. But it would seem to me

1749
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:50,220
that if you have a muscle protein synthesis response, especially in trained individuals,

1750
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:57,420
that's only, you know, 16, 20, 24 hours, that multiple doses of that are probably better than

1751
02:45:57,420 --> 02:46:03,820
just doing one dose and thinking you've got it all. So again, I think part of that's just we don't

1752
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:08,860
have enough studies yet. And we don't have the sensitivity to detect that. And also, the studies

1753
02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:14,540
are so heterogeneous in terms of the population that's used, their training status, the type of

1754
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:20,620
exercises that are used, how RPE is measured, how intensity is measured, how volume is measured.

1755
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:25,420
It's really hard to get good meta-analyses of these sorts of things. I do think in the next five

1756
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:29,900
to 10 years, there's going to be like, the amount of hypertrophy research that's come out in the

1757
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:38,460
last five to 10 years is literally an explosion compared to pre-2010. I think I read one meta-analysis

1758
02:46:38,460 --> 02:46:43,580
on hypertrophy from resistance training in the entire time I was in graduate school.

1759
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:46,780
Are there a couple that we should link to in the show notes here that are just,

1760
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:52,060
if someone's going to say, like, I'm willing to wade through two meta-analyses on this,

1761
02:46:52,060 --> 02:46:53,340
are there a couple you'd recommend?

1762
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:56,860
Yeah, there's a few I'd recommend. And I'll send an email to you guys.

1763
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,340
Perfect.

1764
02:46:57,340 --> 02:47:02,380
Yeah. So some of that would be some of the stuff that's been done by James Krieger and some other

1765
02:47:02,380 --> 02:47:07,740
folks that really kind of looks at, all right, like set number and volume and those sorts of things.

1766
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:13,500
But for this guy, I mean, really, if I had to, putting out like an actual program

1767
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:18,620
day-to-day is difficult just because a lot of it boils down to personal preference in terms of how

1768
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:19,580
I'm going to program it.

1769
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:23,820
And presumably, you'll get feedback, right? So you might say, like, this is what we'll start with,

1770
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:28,300
but we're going to modify it after this first cycle. So let's talk about his nutrition now.

1771
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:35,580
Let's pretend that you assess him. So I forget what I said he weighs. Let's make up a weight.

1772
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:40,460
He's 175 pounds. He's 180 pounds. I don't know, whatever. And I think we said he's

1773
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:47,900
20-ish percent by DEXA, low 20s. And let's say he's eating 120 grams of protein a day.

1774
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:50,620
So right off the bat, you're going to say, hey, you're a little light on protein.

1775
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:55,900
This guy is going to be willing to eat anything you say. So where do you want him?

1776
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:59,020
Do you want this guy at 180 grams a day, 200 grams a day?

1777
02:47:59,020 --> 02:47:59,980
What was his body weight again?

1778
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:01,180
Let's say 180.

1779
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:05,260
Yeah. I mean, if he likes protein, I would say, you know, you're not having

1780
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:09,660
any downsides to having 200 grams a day. And that's a nice number to shoot for. So I would

1781
02:48:09,660 --> 02:48:14,460
probably start somewhere around there, making sure his calories are adequate as well for

1782
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:17,900
facilitating recovery and enough carbohydrate and whatnot.

1783
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:23,260
So in this guy's case, because he really wants to gain lean mass,

1784
02:48:24,060 --> 02:48:28,060
how do you think about cycling him in terms of making him hypercaloric? I mean,

1785
02:48:28,060 --> 02:48:31,660
where are you trying to put his energy balance? How much weight do you want him gaining?

1786
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:35,420
Since he's been training for a long time and he's older,

1787
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:41,340
the likelihood that he's going to be able to gain lean mass without at least some body fat is

1788
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:47,900
probably pretty low. And I get this all the time for people. I want to gain muscle and lose fat at

1789
02:48:47,900 --> 02:48:54,060
the same time. Well, if you are our subject, a, the lady who'd never trained before, absolutely.

1790
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:57,660
I mean, you heard me. I was like, yeah, we can recomp her. No problem. She's going to gain some

1791
02:48:57,660 --> 02:49:02,940
muscle and lose some, some body fat. When you've been training for a long period of time,

1792
02:49:04,860 --> 02:49:09,500
you have to have everything lined up just to gain ounces of lean body mass.

1793
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:19,660
And so part of lining that up is also a slight caloric surplus. There is a new meta analysis

1794
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:24,860
that came out that showed that an energy deficit, it's not quite the same thing, but they did show

1795
02:49:24,860 --> 02:49:31,020
an energy deficit in pairs, lean body mass accrual. So it's not enough just to eat protein.

1796
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:37,900
It makes sense because we do see in an energy deficit, decreased rates of basal protein synthesis.

1797
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:43,180
So it makes sense. I mean, if you earn an energy deficit from mechanistic perspective,

1798
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:48,780
it activates AMP kinase, which had hit, which is an inhibitor rim tour. So it makes sense.

1799
02:49:48,780 --> 02:49:53,420
It also makes sense from a teleological perspective that if you don't have excess energy,

1800
02:49:54,300 --> 02:50:01,260
you know, this remodeling is extremely energy expensive. Why would we want to create more of

1801
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:07,820
it if we don't have the energy to support it? So a protein sparing fast isn't necessarily

1802
02:50:07,820 --> 02:50:14,380
going to save you from losing lean mass. If it, because again, if it's, it's, it's, I mean,

1803
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:19,500
it might be better than a carb fast. You know, in other words, if you're going to eat a thousand

1804
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:23,900
calories a day, you're probably better off having them be as much protein as possible.

1805
02:50:23,900 --> 02:50:29,100
But just because you have 200 grams of protein in your diet, if the calories are exceptionally low,

1806
02:50:29,100 --> 02:50:32,700
you're, you're probably losing lean mass. Is that my, is that how I'm hearing?

1807
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:37,820
What I would say is a day of an energy deficit is not something I'd really be worried about.

1808
02:50:37,820 --> 02:50:41,340
No, no, but I'm saying, let's say somebody took this approach and said, look, for two weeks,

1809
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:46,620
I'm going to go a thousand calories a day, virtually all protein in an effort to get as

1810
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:51,500
lean as possible without losing lean mass. You might be able to not lose lean mass,

1811
02:50:51,500 --> 02:50:56,300
but the likelihood you would gain lean mass is very, very low for somebody who's been training

1812
02:50:56,300 --> 02:51:03,180
for a while. And so yeah, it's, it's one of those things that the more advanced you get,

1813
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:09,900
the more things you have to have lined up correctly to continue to push, especially if

1814
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:17,740
you're drug free. So yeah, for me, like I've, and you can do it in sprints. You can do it in,

1815
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:24,780
in, in different sections, you know? So I'll like I've, I went from, I was in the 230 pound class

1816
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:30,700
back in 2019. And then I just started to drop back down to my original weight class of 205 pounds.

1817
02:51:30,700 --> 02:51:37,820
I did that over the course of about a year, but that was taken in sprints. So I would do

1818
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:42,780
fat loss sprints, for example. So I would do like two or three weeks of like a pretty aggressive

1819
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:47,820
deficit, like 750 to a thousand calories a day. This is for powerlifting. Yeah, that was for

1820
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:51,820
powerlifting. And what body fat is your performance at its best? How, because you obviously don't want

1821
02:51:51,820 --> 02:51:56,060
to be powerlifting at 7% body fat. I'm still pretty good at seven. Really? I still maintain

1822
02:51:56,060 --> 02:52:01,260
pretty well. Yeah. I still maintain pretty well. Maybe not quite as good. I will, let me put it

1823
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:07,180
this way. I can still perform well at seven, but if I have a couple of days where I'm not dialed in,

1824
02:52:07,180 --> 02:52:12,060
I'll start to feel it. So I've got, I've got, I'm right on that edge. I'm teetering on that edge at

1825
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:16,780
seven on calipers, that is. So I did it over the course of the year and I did it in sprints. So I

1826
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:21,180
would do three weeks, lose like target, trying to lose five, six pounds. And then I would go to

1827
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:26,300
maintenance for like at least as long. And I kind of built that into my lifestyle. You know,

1828
02:52:26,860 --> 02:52:30,540
I really liked that for a lot of clients. Actually a lot of our team, violin coaches

1829
02:52:30,540 --> 02:52:34,220
use a lot of what we call diet breaks where the people were eating at maintenance. So it's like,

1830
02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:38,940
okay, vacation coming up, diet break for two weeks. Everything looks like it's going to be

1831
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:44,060
normal for three, four weeks. Boom. Let's do a fat loss sprint. So coming back to building muscle,

1832
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:49,900
I'll do sections of, okay, I'm overfeeding in this slight caloric surplus for about eight weeks.

1833
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:56,140
Okay. We gained, you know, three pounds of body weight. I'm going to maintain for a little while

1834
02:52:56,140 --> 02:53:00,940
just to make sure it doesn't get too out of hand in terms of body fat level. Now I've kind of got

1835
02:53:00,940 --> 02:53:05,340
adjusted this. Now I'm going to do another, you know, six to eight weeks. What I'll tell people

1836
02:53:05,340 --> 02:53:11,900
is if fat loss should be slow, at least for people who are well-trained, if fat loss should be slow

1837
02:53:12,540 --> 02:53:18,700
to retain lean body mass, then weight gain should be snail's pace.

1838
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:23,820
So what's the rule of thumb for this guy then? If you, if he's going to gain

1839
02:53:24,060 --> 02:53:29,900
five pounds of total body weight, of which we're going to hope three is lean, two is fat. Is that

1840
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:35,660
a good goal? How long would you want him to take to gain five pounds? Probably at least 12 weeks.

1841
02:53:35,660 --> 02:53:41,260
Okay. So he's doing that once a quarter. But it might be something more like where it's six months,

1842
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:47,820
but there's, you know, 12 weeks where we get them up five pounds and then we say, okay, let's trim

1843
02:53:47,820 --> 02:53:54,780
a little bit of this fat back off that we put on. We lose three pounds. Then we do another

1844
02:53:54,780 --> 02:54:01,100
gaining cycle, put on five pounds. And what tends to happen is the composition gets a little better

1845
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:06,620
each time. And again, this is now, this is completely anecdotal, my coaching experience.

1846
02:54:06,620 --> 02:54:15,820
But when you put on weight, and we see this in studies, it's for trained people

1847
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:23,180
for trained people, it really depends. But it's somewhere around 50, 50 lean mass to fat mass,

1848
02:54:23,180 --> 02:54:29,660
sometimes even 40, 60, if you're really well trained. So 40 lean, 60 fat. Wow. So the implication,

1849
02:54:29,660 --> 02:54:34,140
by the way, is when you're gaining weight, you're getting fatter by body composition,

1850
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:39,180
because you're presumably starting out at less than 50% body fat. Well, it depends on the training

1851
02:54:39,180 --> 02:54:43,660
status and a whole host of other factors. So that's an important thing for you to tell this guy,

1852
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:49,260
which is, hey, if you're going to be rigorously following body comp, don't be disappointed if

1853
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:56,220
your body fat goes up in that cycle. We're playing the long game here, right? It's like investing,

1854
02:54:56,220 --> 02:55:00,380
we put it that way. So it's like investing, you're taking money away from you now in this immediate

1855
02:55:00,380 --> 02:55:07,180
moment that you could have. So hopefully you have more money later. Right. So the good thing is that

1856
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:14,300
when we lose body fat, we tend to lose, for resistance training, we tend to lose mostly from

1857
02:55:14,300 --> 02:55:21,020
body fat. Right? So if we're doing this cycle over time, hopefully each time it gets a little better.

1858
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:26,460
Now, there are limits to this. Eventually you bought up against your genetic limit of,

1859
02:55:27,740 --> 02:55:31,020
or probably your genetic limit. What I always say is you never really know if you're at your genetic

1860
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:36,780
limit. And what I always tell people is I show them this picture of me at 21 years old, where

1861
02:55:36,780 --> 02:55:41,660
I'd been resistance training hard for three and a half, four years, where most people say you hit

1862
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:46,940
your genetic limit, you know, somewhere around there. And I show that picture and I show a picture

1863
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:54,300
of me now at age 40. And I mean, the difference in my leg musculature and my overall musculature

1864
02:55:54,860 --> 02:56:01,260
is enormous. But if you had just gone year by year, you would have seen very little difference.

1865
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:05,820
Right. And so what I'll tell people is, you know, you might think you're at your genetic limit,

1866
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:12,380
but you're probably not. And it's probably more like an asymptote. Yeah. Yeah. So you never,

1867
02:56:12,380 --> 02:56:20,620
you never really hit like a hard cap limit, but the gains become so minimal that it's almost not

1868
02:56:20,620 --> 02:56:28,140
measurable. So yeah, I think when it comes to, you know, these, like this kind of person,

1869
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:33,580
one really focusing on, okay, making sure that they can do a lot of resistance training,

1870
02:56:33,580 --> 02:56:37,820
because it is going to take quite a bit of a stimulus to get in there, focusing on stimulus

1871
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:42,300
versus fatigue. So doing high stimulus, low fatigue movements so that they can accumulate enough volume

1872
02:56:42,300 --> 02:56:47,740
without overreaching all the time. Because if they can train for 12 weeks without needing a taper

1873
02:56:47,740 --> 02:56:52,060
versus six weeks, I mean, that's more stimulus, right? And then putting them in a very slight

1874
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:55,980
caloric surplus. And when I say slight caloric surplus, I'm talking about 100 to 200 calories

1875
02:56:55,980 --> 02:57:00,940
a day and over their maintenance. And now what does that look like? Well, that means that you're

1876
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:04,780
going to have weeks where you don't gain anything. Anybody, I don't know if you've ever done this,

1877
02:57:04,780 --> 02:57:09,260
Peter, like doing, where people have like tried to do a super lean gaining phase. What tends to

1878
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:13,260
happen is people get really frustrated because the weight comes on so slow that they end up just

1879
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:17,580
throwing down a bunch of calories so that they can say they gain the weight and it doesn't go well.

1880
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:23,500
And what tends to happen is weight gain comes on in chunks, just like weight loss tends to happen

1881
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:28,460
in chunks. Weight gain tends to happen in chunks. You can be stable, stable, stable, even though

1882
02:57:28,460 --> 02:57:33,500
you're in a calorie surplus. And all of a sudden, boom, your weight's up two pounds, you know, just

1883
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:39,420
randomly and it sticks. And we don't have all the explanations for why it happens that way, but

1884
02:57:40,060 --> 02:57:46,940
just know that that's normal for those listening. And again, don't look at, oh, I gained two pounds

1885
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:53,660
from the past three days and it's not going down, it's staying. Look at the fact that you've been

1886
02:57:53,660 --> 02:58:00,860
doing this for four weeks now and you gain two pounds on average. So you're right in line with

1887
02:58:00,860 --> 02:58:05,980
kind of what the goal was. So you want to look at that monthly, that really that monthly month

1888
02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:11,660
to month average in a gaining phase and say, okay, am I hitting my milestones in terms of like the

1889
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:17,020
overall rate of progress and try to not worry too much about those little things?

1890
02:58:17,740 --> 02:58:21,980
So, Lane, I don't know how we did this again. We're at this point where I've got through about

1891
02:58:22,060 --> 02:58:26,380
a third of what I wanted to talk about. But nevertheless, there is one other thing I wanted

1892
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:31,180
to kind of talk about and it actually feeds really nicely into this sort of case study of this man

1893
02:58:31,180 --> 02:58:35,420
and this woman, which is that of like kind of the most important supplements or the supplements we

1894
02:58:35,420 --> 02:58:43,820
most hear about and what is their utility for the purpose of hypertrophy training? So let's start

1895
02:58:43,820 --> 02:58:48,300
with the most common of these, which is protein. We talked about it already. You alluded to the fact

1896
02:58:48,380 --> 02:58:52,620
that this woman might not be able to get enough protein in actual food. So you might talk about

1897
02:58:52,620 --> 02:59:00,300
shakes. So where does whey protein stack up in the hierarchy of proteins and should we be looking

1898
02:59:00,300 --> 02:59:06,380
at other sources? Top of the list, whey protein, high in leucine, high in branched amino acids,

1899
02:59:06,380 --> 02:59:13,980
high in essential amino acids generally tastes good, generally well tolerated. I will say if it's

1900
02:59:13,980 --> 02:59:18,700
a straight whey concentrate, a lot of people have difficulty tolerating a straight whey concentrate,

1901
02:59:18,700 --> 02:59:24,300
but a blend of concentrate and isolate is what most proteins out there are and most people can

1902
02:59:24,300 --> 02:59:29,180
tolerate them well. What's the source of protein and whey? Where does it actually come from in

1903
02:59:29,180 --> 02:59:36,300
terms of? So basically from cow's milk, if you centrifuge off the fat, so if you centrifuge off

1904
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:45,900
the fat and then you take that what's left over and you add, you precipitate out the casein,

1905
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:52,940
which is the non-soluble fraction of cow's milk, the soluble portion that's left over is whey.

1906
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:57,180
It's what's called whey and mostly consists of proteins called lactylbiumens.

1907
02:59:57,900 --> 03:00:03,340
And it's just a very high quality, easy digestible, very bioavailable source of protein.

1908
03:00:04,140 --> 03:00:08,700
In terms of muscle protein synthesis, it's the tip tops. It always scores the highest.

1909
03:00:09,420 --> 03:00:14,620
In our research, it was always the highest. It was no statistical difference from egg,

1910
03:00:14,620 --> 03:00:19,580
but when we did it versus egg, it was always just like a little bit better. So my guess is if you

1911
03:00:19,580 --> 03:00:24,460
had a high enough subject number, you could maybe pick out some statistical difference.

1912
03:00:24,460 --> 03:00:30,140
Is there a brand that you favor or are there brands that you think are the best brands to go for?

1913
03:00:30,860 --> 03:00:35,340
Incoming shameless plug. So I actually have my own supplement line called Outwork Nutrition.

1914
03:00:35,340 --> 03:00:36,140
And we have a...

1915
03:00:36,140 --> 03:00:37,100
What's it called?

1916
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:38,220
Outwork Nutrition.

1917
03:00:38,220 --> 03:00:39,180
Outwork.

1918
03:00:39,180 --> 03:00:39,660
Outwork.

1919
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:39,900
Okay.

1920
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:45,420
Yep. And we have a whey protein isolate. The reason we did an isolate, isolates are a little

1921
03:00:45,420 --> 03:00:52,140
bit more expensive than a concentrate isolate blend, but there are people with lactose

1922
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:59,500
intolerance. There are people with a sensitivity to the lactylbiumens. And so an isolate is

1923
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:04,620
generally well tolerated. Some people with really high sensitivities to the lactylbiumens

1924
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:08,460
can't tolerate an isolate. And if that's the case, they could probably do a hydrolysate,

1925
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:14,220
which is a little more expensive and doesn't taste as good, but still a good option for those that

1926
03:01:14,220 --> 03:01:20,940
have really sensitive GI's. But like I said, an isolate is generally tolerated well by people.

1927
03:01:20,940 --> 03:01:25,900
And ours is called Outwork Nutrition Build. So it's just low carbohydrate, low lactose,

1928
03:01:25,900 --> 03:01:31,020
low fat, high protein, high leucine. So I think our leucine contents over 11%. I think it's

1929
03:01:31,020 --> 03:01:37,740
actually 12%, which is very high. And then the carbohydrate content, depending on vanilla or

1930
03:01:37,740 --> 03:01:43,500
chocolate, is like one to four grams. And then the fat content is less than a gram of fat. In fact,

1931
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:48,220
the vanilla is zero. Are there any other brands that you would say, hey, I trust that brand?

1932
03:01:48,220 --> 03:01:51,020
Because one of the things that I think, as we talk about supplements, you always got to be

1933
03:01:51,020 --> 03:01:55,020
careful. Yeah. What would be three other brands that you would put in your body?

1934
03:01:55,020 --> 03:02:00,620
Yeah. I mean, Legion, they make good stuff. And I think some of the big companies,

1935
03:02:01,980 --> 03:02:08,940
Optimum has been doing protein for years. And most companies are sourcing the same stuff. To me,

1936
03:02:08,940 --> 03:02:13,740
a good company is somebody that markets responsibly. But then another one, EAS has

1937
03:02:13,740 --> 03:02:20,220
been making stuff for years and they make stuff that's very, very third party tested,

1938
03:02:20,220 --> 03:02:23,820
all that kind of stuff. There's a bunch of good companies out there. What I would say is make

1939
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:28,220
sure nobody's using a proprietary blend. Proprietary blends are usually just a way

1940
03:02:28,220 --> 03:02:33,820
for people to hide stuff. Two, make sure that nobody is doing what's called nitrogen spiking.

1941
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:39,660
So what you can do to pump up the protein and nitrogen content of some of these proteins

1942
03:02:39,660 --> 03:02:47,020
is add individual amino acids that have nitrogen that are actually lower cost than just the protein

1943
03:02:47,020 --> 03:02:52,620
itself. And actually creatine is like they actually put creatine in some of these, not that

1944
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:57,020
creatine isn't good. Creatine does work, but you're not taking away protein that's not a good

1945
03:02:57,020 --> 03:03:02,220
creatine. You take creatine to get creatine. And they do that because it's actually cheaper

1946
03:03:02,220 --> 03:03:07,500
and it pumps up the protein content. And how would you know that when looking at the label?

1947
03:03:07,500 --> 03:03:08,700
Oh, it's on the label. Oh, it'll say it.

1948
03:03:09,900 --> 03:03:13,820
For example, I think they spike with glycine too. So if you look on the label,

1949
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:19,660
they might say whey protein and then sweeteners, preservatives, oh, glycine.

1950
03:03:20,140 --> 03:03:26,060
That's nitrogen spiking. So I would make sure that companies aren't doing that.

1951
03:03:26,060 --> 03:03:30,780
And to me personally, I mean, even if a company makes a good product, if they make insane claims,

1952
03:03:30,780 --> 03:03:35,260
I mean, listen, I would love to say that our protein is the most anabolic protein on the

1953
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:40,620
market. But the fact of the matter is it's a high quality whey protein isolate at a competitive

1954
03:03:40,620 --> 03:03:45,180
price point that tastes really good. And you can get another whey protein isolate that would build

1955
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:51,260
just as much muscle. So I'm not going to claim that. So I would say just the ethical side of me

1956
03:03:51,260 --> 03:03:56,940
says just look for something that's promoted responsibly. So yeah, those other companies

1957
03:03:56,940 --> 03:04:01,260
are just fine and I would recommend them. All right. So let's look at a subset of that.

1958
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:07,580
Is there utility in using branched chain amino acids specifically in workouts where these are

1959
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:12,860
typically coming as far lower doses? There's only three branched-chain amino acids and they're

1960
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:18,460
typically giving you five grams per serving. Any utility in the in-workout BCAA?

1961
03:04:18,460 --> 03:04:22,940
So this was something that I've changed my mind on. And I will tell people like I'm a BCAA,

1962
03:04:23,820 --> 03:04:31,020
my PhD specifically is on leucine. I mean, it's right back there. He says leucine right on the

1963
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:38,460
cover is one of the words. And I used to say, hey, I think supplemental branched chains are useful.

1964
03:04:38,460 --> 03:04:43,900
And I just I can't support that anymore. If you're getting enough total protein in,

1965
03:04:43,900 --> 03:04:48,060
it doesn't seem to be a benefit to supplemental branched-chain amino acids. The only thing I would

1966
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:53,420
say that there might be something is they may reduce muscle soreness, but it's never been

1967
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:58,220
compared straight up with like a comparable amount of whey protein. So it's possible that that's just

1968
03:04:58,220 --> 03:05:07,820
like a total protein effect. And the only case I could really make besides maybe soreness is also

1969
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:16,140
for people who just cannot get high quality protein. And so for example, if you're a vegan

1970
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:21,180
and you say, you know, I don't want to take whey protein and I can't take XYZ and my stomach

1971
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:26,860
doesn't tolerate these proteins and I want to pump up the quality of my meal, then supplemental

1972
03:05:26,860 --> 03:05:31,100
branched chains could make it an impact. And we actually did a study in our lab where we looked

1973
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:36,220
at whey protein versus wheat protein. We saw that whey protein obviously had a much bigger response

1974
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:37,980
than muscle protein synthesis compared to wheat.

1975
03:05:37,980 --> 03:05:40,220
Sorry. And that's obviously gram per gram, right?

1976
03:05:40,220 --> 03:05:47,740
Gram per gram. Yeah. We, isonitrogenous. But when we added leucine to match the leucine content of

1977
03:05:47,740 --> 03:05:52,540
the whey, we actually got the exact same response. So if you're somebody who's plant-based and you're

1978
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:57,180
concerned that you're not getting enough high quality protein, you could actually add supplemental

1979
03:05:57,180 --> 03:06:01,980
branched-chain amino acids to your meals or your protein and you would pump up the protein quality

1980
03:06:01,980 --> 03:06:06,700
doing that. But obviously the best outcome is just getting it through diet or shakes. And then

1981
03:06:06,700 --> 03:06:09,260
if you have to add supplemental branched-chain, you can't. But-

1982
03:06:09,260 --> 03:06:13,740
Any role for supplementing leucine specifically? So if someone says,

1983
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:20,140
Lane, I'm buying your brand, I'm consuming it, I'm just going to add five grams of leucine every

1984
03:06:20,140 --> 03:06:25,020
time. And by the way, leucine tastes horrible. Horrible. It's literally one of the worst

1985
03:06:25,020 --> 03:06:29,260
tasting things on the planet. Yeah. No, I just don't think there's a benefit to it.

1986
03:06:29,260 --> 03:06:34,140
I wish there was. I mean, I went into, I did my PhD thinking I'm going to find the secret

1987
03:06:34,140 --> 03:06:40,220
anabolic trigger and just get enough protein. Okay. Let's talk. You mentioned it already,

1988
03:06:40,220 --> 03:06:47,020
creatine monohydrate. Yeah. Very popular. Back in the day when I was a kid, it was 30 grams a day

1989
03:06:47,020 --> 03:06:50,540
loading and then a maintenance phase. I think these days people are just doing five grams a day

1990
03:06:50,540 --> 03:06:55,500
every day, right? Yeah. I mean, loading will get you... So really what you're looking to do is

1991
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:59,980
saturate your phosphocreatin stores in your muscle cell. And you can do that through loading

1992
03:06:59,980 --> 03:07:03,420
or you can do it through maintenance phase. If you do it through loading, it'll saturate in five to

1993
03:07:03,420 --> 03:07:08,700
seven days. If you do it through maintenance, it'll take about three to four weeks. Downside to

1994
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:16,940
loading, more GI discomfort, more bloating, more just overall discomfort, but you get saturated

1995
03:07:16,940 --> 03:07:23,100
faster. Downside to maintenance just takes a little bit longer to get the benefits. That's all.

1996
03:07:23,180 --> 03:07:27,500
What are the main benefits of creatine? Are they on the strength side, the hypertrophy side,

1997
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:35,020
the recovery side? All above. So yeah, it increases lean body mass, increases strength, exercise

1998
03:07:35,020 --> 03:07:38,380
performance, and we're actually... There's possibility that there's cognitive benefits as

1999
03:07:38,380 --> 03:07:43,980
well. Interestingly, we're finding out, but I would tell people do not get caught up in the hype

2000
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:49,340
of these other forms of creatine. Creatine monohydrate has been shown to saturate the

2001
03:07:49,340 --> 03:07:57,260
muscle cell 100%. You cannot get more than 100%. And the other forms of creatine are simply

2002
03:07:58,140 --> 03:08:02,620
in existence to remove more money from your wallet. And here's... This is kind of like I

2003
03:08:02,620 --> 03:08:07,500
use the comparison of big screen TVs, right? Remember when my first big screen TV I bought,

2004
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:14,060
it was 42 inches, big screen, LCD screen. I bought it in 2008 and it was $1,000, right?

2005
03:08:14,780 --> 03:08:17,900
What would that go for now? You could probably get it for 200 bucks.

2006
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:22,780
Yeah. Yeah. Like here, here's a stick of gum. Can I have that 42 inch screen TV? Sure.

2007
03:08:23,660 --> 03:08:30,380
Why? Because everyone makes them and there's such a competitive market that the margins are

2008
03:08:31,020 --> 03:08:36,460
this big, right? So what does everybody have? Everybody has creatine in their supplement line.

2009
03:08:37,180 --> 03:08:44,060
So the margins are so thin, nobody makes money on straight creatine. So they have to come up with

2010
03:08:44,060 --> 03:08:48,540
other forms of it to justify charging you more. And you hear things like, well, our creatine

2011
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:52,380
doesn't bloat you or our creatine doesn't cause water retention. Well, I would tell you that the

2012
03:08:52,380 --> 03:08:56,540
water retention, hydrated cells and anabolic procell, the water retention from creatine is

2013
03:08:56,540 --> 03:09:00,380
inside the muscle cell, which is a good thing. And there's research studies to show this that

2014
03:09:00,380 --> 03:09:05,020
it does not increase extracellular water. That's actually intracellular water. So are you saying

2015
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:10,700
that your creatine is not anabolic then? And then you have things like buffered creatine.

2016
03:09:10,700 --> 03:09:15,020
You don't need to buffer creatine. Creatine is stable in stomach acid. And then there's

2017
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:19,580
creatine ethyl ester, which has actually been shown. So there's just a ton of marketing nonsense.

2018
03:09:19,580 --> 03:09:22,620
Yeah. Creatine, trimalate. Do you make a creatine supplement?

2019
03:09:23,260 --> 03:09:28,700
Yeah. So our recovery supplement, so we have a supplement called recovery and creatine is one

2020
03:09:28,700 --> 03:09:32,540
of the ingredients there. So there's five grams of creatine monohydrate. And do you think that,

2021
03:09:32,540 --> 03:09:35,900
is that a daily thing someone should have even on their nonlifting days?

2022
03:09:36,460 --> 03:09:39,260
Probably don't need to take it on your off days from lifting.

2023
03:09:40,140 --> 03:09:44,780
If you're doing cardio on a nonlifting day, do you benefit at all from creatine there?

2024
03:09:44,780 --> 03:09:50,060
There's no rule studies to know. What I would say is it's very cheap. You're not really missing out

2025
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:56,540
on anything by having an extra dose. So I would say take it daily. If your budget is really real

2026
03:09:56,540 --> 03:10:01,900
thin, then take it on the days you train. Any other brands that you respect and just trust that

2027
03:10:01,900 --> 03:10:06,460
they're not doing any nonsense, which is basically the same. Look for the no claims and the trusted

2028
03:10:06,460 --> 03:10:15,180
brands. Yeah. And no crazy claims, no pushing other forms of creatine is better and no

2029
03:10:15,180 --> 03:10:20,060
proprietary blends. That's one of the best ways to know. But the great thing is there are a lot

2030
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:26,060
of good companies out there that are marketing more responsibly now. Okay. Last one, nitric oxide

2031
03:10:26,060 --> 03:10:32,380
or these nitric oxide boosters. I remember this was one of the things that got so much attention.

2032
03:10:33,020 --> 03:10:36,780
I want to say like 10, 15 years ago. Truthfully, I don't know how much attention it's gotten now,

2033
03:10:36,780 --> 03:10:40,620
but I did see a paper about it recently, which is what made me think about it again.

2034
03:10:40,620 --> 03:10:48,700
Yeah. So nitrates and nitrites do appear to enhance exercise performance. So like beetroot

2035
03:10:48,700 --> 03:10:55,020
juice and those sorts of things and sources of nitrite. So there was a recent meta-analyses

2036
03:10:55,020 --> 03:10:58,460
looking at this and the effect size was actually pretty impressive for power.

2037
03:10:58,460 --> 03:11:01,660
There was like 5% or something. It was huge, wasn't it?

2038
03:11:01,660 --> 03:11:05,900
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really impressive. 5%, which I mean, like that's the difference between

2039
03:11:05,900 --> 03:11:10,860
first and last, if you're talking about the Olympics, you know. And the effect size was

2040
03:11:10,860 --> 03:11:15,900
a 0.42, which isn't considered a large effect size, but it's approaching a modest effect size,

2041
03:11:15,900 --> 03:11:20,460
which for supplements is really impressive. I mean, that's on the order. I don't know off

2042
03:11:20,460 --> 03:11:28,220
hand creatine effect size in the meta-analysis, but it's got to be close to that. And what I will

2043
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:34,220
say is a lot of supplements appear to not have in them what they say they have in them in terms

2044
03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:39,420
of these nitrates. The other thing I will say is like something like citrulline malate, which is a,

2045
03:11:40,780 --> 03:11:48,140
it can be recycled into arginine and then into nitric oxide. So citrulline malate or citrulline

2046
03:11:48,140 --> 03:11:58,060
specifically actually increases blood nitrate levels more than arginine itself. So it actually

2047
03:11:58,060 --> 03:12:02,860
increases nitric oxide more than arginine. Arginine is the direct substrate. That's because

2048
03:12:02,860 --> 03:12:07,500
citrulline is actually much more bioavailable, whereas arginine is mostly extracted by the

2049
03:12:07,500 --> 03:12:13,180
splanknic tissues, the gut and liver. So you're actually better off taking citrulline, which is

2050
03:12:13,820 --> 03:12:19,820
in our pre-workout, of course. So there's another shameless plug. But really, if you're looking at

2051
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:26,460
citrulline specifically, like six to eight grams, you know, at a dose. And this is more to increase

2052
03:12:26,460 --> 03:12:31,020
performance than hypertrophy. Is this going to? Yeah. I mean, presumably if your performance goes

2053
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:34,860
up, you have more stimulus, you might see the gains there. Yeah. There is some evidence that

2054
03:12:34,860 --> 03:12:38,860
citrulline can actually stimulate mTOR, but I'm not sure it's enough to actually create like

2055
03:12:38,860 --> 03:12:44,300
hypertrophy on its own. So were you consuming something besides water or electrolytes in the

2056
03:12:44,300 --> 03:12:48,620
workout? You've obviously got a pre-workout. Are you drinking your, sort of the citrulline would

2057
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:53,500
be before? Obviously the whey would probably be after. Where's the creatine falling post or pre?

2058
03:12:54,380 --> 03:13:01,260
So the timing doesn't seem to be real important. There does seem to be a little bit better response

2059
03:13:01,260 --> 03:13:06,780
to after. Not sure why, because it really, to me with the mechanism, it shouldn't matter because

2060
03:13:06,780 --> 03:13:11,900
it's a long-term thing. But that's actually why we included the creatine in our recovery product

2061
03:13:11,900 --> 03:13:17,340
and not the pre-workout for a couple of reasons. One, it doesn't seem to matter when you take it,

2062
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:21,420
or it doesn't, you don't, it's not an immediate effect from creatine. So you might as well take

2063
03:13:21,500 --> 03:13:26,940
it post. Might be a little bit better effect post. So, you know, there you go. And then in

2064
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:32,220
the pre-workout specifically, there's a couple of things in there that are already semi-gut irritants

2065
03:13:32,220 --> 03:13:36,940
for some people. And creatine can be a gut irritant for people. We didn't want to compound those too

2066
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:42,140
much. So that's why we kind of separated it from our pre-workout. But there's a lot of pre-workouts

2067
03:13:42,140 --> 03:13:46,060
that do have creatine in it. And especially when you pair it with a large dose of caffeine,

2068
03:13:46,060 --> 03:13:50,140
it can just really give people a lot of GI discomfort if you're not careful.

2069
03:13:50,140 --> 03:13:52,060
So then in workout, are you drinking something?

2070
03:13:52,700 --> 03:13:57,660
I usually just, like people are going to laugh, but I'll like a Gatorade Zero or something like

2071
03:13:57,660 --> 03:14:02,700
that, you know, in water. I just, you know, I've looked at the intro workout stuff. I mean,

2072
03:14:03,420 --> 03:14:08,940
you know, if you're working out for two, three hours at a time, maybe it's useful to get some

2073
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:14,620
glucose and carbohydrate in to maintain performance. But, you know, I think bodybuilders

2074
03:14:14,620 --> 03:14:18,780
or weightlifters tend to overestimate like how difficult their workouts actually are.

2075
03:14:19,340 --> 03:14:24,860
You know, really, you only need to worry about glycogen, resynthesis, you know, the speed of which

2076
03:14:25,500 --> 03:14:29,420
if you're somebody doing multiple events per day, like if you're a bodybuilder, you're going to be

2077
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:33,820
24 hours to your training in any way. Like you're going to resynthesize that glycogen as long as you

2078
03:14:33,820 --> 03:14:40,540
get enough total carbohydrates. So I'm not real huge on intro workout nutrition, as long as we're

2079
03:14:40,540 --> 03:14:43,900
not talking about really long workouts, or we're not talking about multiple sessions per day.

2080
03:14:44,460 --> 03:14:50,220
Well, Lane, I've taken us way past our time. But as always, super enjoyable. Can't wait to do it

2081
03:14:50,220 --> 03:14:55,580
again. There's a lot of stuff to follow up on here. So the show notes will have a ton of the

2082
03:14:55,580 --> 03:15:00,060
detail we've talked about an offline you and I can connect and make sure we've got the links to some

2083
03:15:00,060 --> 03:15:05,260
of the things we spoke about. So thanks again, man. Appreciate it. And congrats on being by the water.

2084
03:15:05,260 --> 03:15:07,420
Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it, man. Really enjoyed it.
