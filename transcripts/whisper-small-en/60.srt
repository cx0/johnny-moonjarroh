00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,440
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Annie Duke. Annie is the

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,080
author of the bestselling book, Thinking in Bets, Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All

47
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,680
the Facts. And some of you may recall a few months ago, I talked about this book a little bit in my

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,400
Sunday morning newsletter because it was just one of those books where even halfway through it,

49
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,840
I realized this was a book everybody needed to read and I couldn't get enough of it. And I

50
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,000
immediately reached out to Annie and said, I'd love to have you on the podcast. And what follows is

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,720
that discussion. But for those of you who may have not got that or missed that, Annie was one of the

52
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,920
top poker players in the world. She played professionally for about 20 years. In 2004,

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,960
she won her first World Series of Poker bracelet. That same year, she won $2 million in a winner

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,920
take all invitation only World Series Poker Tournament of Champions. In 2010, she won the

55
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,440
prestigious NBC National Heads Up Poker Championship. Prior to all of that, by the way, and we talk a

56
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,760
little bit about this, she was actually awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship to study

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,360
cognitive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. So poker actually is something

58
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,760
that kind of came later to her in life. She now spends her time writing, coaching and speaking

59
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,960
on a wide range of topics from decision fitness, emotional control, productive decision groups,

60
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,680
embracing uncertainty. She's also done a lot of work in charity. And unfortunately, we don't get

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,520
into any of that. I had planned to, but as is often the case, we get so far into something in

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,360
this case, obviously poker and uncertainty and decision making that after three hours or so,

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,040
we hadn't even got to some of the other things that she's done. We talk a lot about how she got

64
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,160
into this. And of course, we do spend some time defining poker because if you're not a poker

65
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,560
player, and I'm not a poker player, I mean, I sort of know the rules, but I think it is important to

66
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,720
understand the nuances of the game, at least as far as the rules go and the different types of

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,280
poker. So even if you've never played a hand of poker in your life and don't know the difference

68
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,000
between Texas Holdem and Blackjack, for that matter, you'll still get a ton out of this

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,400
because we really explain that stuff. And we contrast poker with other things like chess,

70
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,200
where clearly you have to have a lot of skill to play them, but luck is not an element. And we talk

71
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,960
about why poker is in some ways the model system for decision making in the real world. We talk

72
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,040
about backcasting, which is something that I believe I alluded to in my newsletter that

73
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,680
is what really got me excited about the way she described this. And we talk about doing

74
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,560
pre-mortem exams versus just post-mortem exams. We go through the decision matrix, meaning how do

75
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,000
you look and evaluate decisions after the fact when you have to be critical of both the decision

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,040
making process and the outcome. And I have to tell you, this is just yet another example of a

77
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,600
podcast where I came away learning so much. And in preparing for this, I obviously have read the

78
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,840
books and I've thought a lot about decision making and I know quite a bit about probability theory.

79
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,200
It didn't matter. Annie still took my understanding of this to another level. And in the process,

80
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,280
I realized she is working on another book, which is a workbook to help with decision making. That's

81
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,000
going to be out next year. So one, I can't wait to get that. And two, we're going to have to have

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,840
Annie back when that book comes out and do a real deep dive on how to implement that workbook. So

83
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,000
I can go on for a lot on this, but you don't want to hear me talk. You want to hear Annie talk. So

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,560
without further delay, here is my guest, Annie Duke.

85
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,600
Annie, thanks so much for coming all the way up to New York. I'd like to say just to see me,

86
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,840
but now you've let the cat out of the bag that I'm the second excuse to be here today.

87
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,560
Yes. When I get requests, I try to pack them into the same day for efficiency purposes.

88
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Are you from Philly originally?

89
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm not from Philly, but my father is from Philly originally. So yeah, my dad grew up in Philadelphia

90
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,560
graduated from West Philly High, actually. So he's born and bred. And I live in Philadelphia now.

91
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,640
It's actually my third time through. So there's clearly some kind of magnetic center to Philadelphia

92
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,160
for me. Are you an Eagles fan?

93
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,640
I am.

94
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm sorry. I can't, I'm so angry about them beating the Patriots two years ago.

95
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm just so upset about it.

96
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,080
Oh, please. Oh, I'm so sorry for you that they didn't get their sixth Super Bowl that day and

97
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
they had to wait two more years.

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,200
I don't know. It just bothered me.

99
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,080
All right. So wait, are you a Patriots fan?

100
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,480
I am.

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,320
Okay. So interestingly enough, I am a Red Sox fan because I grew up in New England

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,600
and it's kind of just an accident of sort of the timing of my own life that I'm an Eagles fan,

103
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,200
which has to do with, I was never much interested in football when I was growing up,

104
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,080
which isn't that crazy for when I was growing up in terms of the Patriots because they were awful.

105
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,400
Horrible.

106
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Oh, just horrible. It was horrible. So I liked the Celtics because Larry Bird and Kevin McHale

107
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,400
and obviously the Red Sox, it was like Fred Lynn and Carl Eustrumski and Carl Fisk and like

108
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,480
that amazing team. So, and we used to go like once a year. So I would like to remind you as

109
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,960
you're so upset that they didn't get number six on that day of what it was like to be a Red Sox

110
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,160
fan. I know. I know. Well, you brought up Fisk, right? So it's like, yeah.

111
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,120
Was it the 79 team or the 70s 16?

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,840
I think it was 76, but someone's going to correct me. But yeah,

113
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,960
where it's like, oh, no, I know that's, it's hard to watch. You know what it is? I'm a Belichick fan.

114
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,280
So people sort of say, oh, you're a Patriots fan. Like, wow, wow, wow. But it's not that I

115
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,320
disproportionately like anyone on that team. Although I think Tom Brady is, I think unequivocally the

116
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,360
greatest quarterback of all time at this point. But to me, it's just, it's Belichick. Like I'm

117
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,320
obsessed with the way this guy operates. Like you always get asked the question, like if you could

118
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,120
meet anybody famous, who would it be? I mean, at the top of my list would have to be him like,

119
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,680
and again, it wouldn't be in the setting of him giving glib answers in a news conference,

120
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,680
because that wouldn't be that much fun. Although it's funny as hell to watch. If I could spend a

121
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,800
day on his boat with him, really understanding the discipline that he brings to what he does,

122
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,960
it would just, it would just amaze me. There's a beautiful article that was written probably

123
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,680
five years ago. It was just told in a really funny way, because it was the gist of the article was

124
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,120
everybody's got a Belichick story. And it's players, coaches, all telling these stories of him

125
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,800
that really highlight this single-minded focus of winning that is kind of amazing to me. Even

126
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,440
though from a life ethos standpoint, I don't really care that much about sports anymore. I've sort of,

127
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,600
there was a day when it really upset me if my team lost. Now it's sort of, oh, that sucks.

128
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,360
It's good that you've managed to come to that point. Oh my God. I could tell you stories about

129
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,600
when I was in high school. If my team lost, it was like, if you want to get at least one degree,

130
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,960
just one degree from Bill Belichick, you should have Michael Lombardi on, who wrote Gridiron

131
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,600
Genius. It's a great book about leadership. He worked with Bill Walsh, worked with Belichick.

132
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,440
He really kind of talks about what the leadership qualities of those two particular coaches. He's

133
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,280
really great. You should look him up. Do you know him? I do. Yeah. Well, then I'm going to ask you

134
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,360
to make that introduction. I will make that introduction. I met Bill Walsh about a month

135
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,200
before he died and it was the most sort of simple, he was at Stanford and I guess he was getting some

136
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,400
medical care and I was there. I lived in the Bay Area at the time, but I still swim at the Stanford

137
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,600
pool. And one day I was just finishing a swim and I was walking back to the parking lot and I can't

138
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,320
believe it, but Bill Walsh is like walking alone, like on this part of the campus. I normally would

139
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,800
never interrupt somebody to be the fanboy because I just feel like it's sort of, I don't know, I just,

140
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,280
that's not my style to do it, but I couldn't help it. And I was, oh my God, I just want to shake

141
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,240
your hand. And, and of course, like a total idiot, I just started telling him all of my favorite

142
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,320
moments of his coaching career as though he doesn't remember them. Like, do you remember the drive

143
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,440
at the end of the second Bengal Super Bowl when there were only two minutes and four seconds left

144
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,280
and remember when Taylor comes and he was just the kindest. He totally entertained all of my nonsense.

145
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,840
Like, yeah, those were some great times. Those are some great memories. And sadly he died like a

146
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,400
month later. I mean, he was sick in that moment. He was totally able to, anyway, so, but that said,

147
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,560
I'm not happy about the Eagles and we'll just let that slide. Literally, it was like two years later.

148
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,280
Here's the thing. Belichick is in no danger of not getting into all the fame. Neither is Tom Brady.

149
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,040
This is what I'm trying to remind you of, the Red Sox, letting the Eagles have their one moment. Yeah,

150
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,960
well now the Red Sox can't stop doing it. It's also sort of. Yeah, cause I'd like to remind you

151
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,520
that the Eagles did get their first try and like ever at the Super Bowl against the Patriots in

152
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,840
the first place in law. So like, come on, it's like crumbs, crumbs for the peasants.

153
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
So first of all, I read your book. I don't know how long ago it's been, but I mean, it was probably

154
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,640
10 minutes before I reached out to you on Twitter. I loved it. And I think we all sort of read books

155
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,680
and apply our own filter to them. And of course, one of the filters is on this business of decision

156
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,200
making. And in medicine, we make decisions all the time and we make decisions within complete

157
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,080
information. And I remember explaining to somebody once something that I think I either heard you

158
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,240
talk about on a podcast after the fact and describe it more eloquently. And I think you also alluded

159
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,080
to it in the book, which is people always think of chess as this perfect game for decision making.

160
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,920
So actually my wife, I was having this discussion and I said, no, actually chess is not a great

161
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,720
example because everybody has perfect knowledge at every moment in the game. So it's not to discount

162
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,840
the importance of strategy in chess. People who are brilliant at chess are brilliant, but it's not

163
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,840
the perfect analog for decision making in life. For that poker is much better because you have

164
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,440
incomplete information and that tends to mimic what we see in life. And in medicine, I think

165
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,760
you almost never have complete information. And that's sort of one of the things that

166
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,640
is both frustrating because how can you make a serious decision when you don't know all of the

167
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,680
facts, but at the same time, I think makes it intriguing and interesting and gives you this

168
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,360
sense of there's a craft that can be mastered here that is less sort of amenable to robotic

169
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,200
decision making. Chess is missing this particular element, which decision making in general has,

170
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,560
which has to do with incomplete information. So in chess, I can see the player's whole position.

171
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,040
And what that means is that I should be able to calculate out if I'm considering a move,

172
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I know what all the possible moves are that the player can make. And then I can think of what all

173
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,960
the possible moves are that I can make a response and so on and so forth. So that I should be able

174
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,480
to calculate out with absolute perfect knowledge here what the right move is at any given time.

175
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,960
It's missing another element though, that I think is really important to think about, which is a very

176
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:43,240
strong influence of luck. So in chess, the pieces stay where they are. Nobody takes dice,

177
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,000
you roll an 11 and two pawns come off the board, or if it's snake guys, checkmate,

178
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,160
or maybe something good happens, you roll a six and you get an extra queen. That doesn't happen in

179
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,320
chess so that there's this, we know that the pieces are only ever going to move through an

180
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,800
active skill. And this idea of the strong influence of luck is really, really important. Meaning,

181
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,200
if I were to do the same thing in the same situation, and then post decision, are there

182
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,840
other things that could reasonably happen that I don't have control over, I don't have control

183
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,320
over which thing is actually going to occur. It's actually a really important element to the way we

184
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,080
make decisions. If you think about it in poker, if I put my money in with aces, and you put your

185
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,440
money in with fives, you know, 80 ish percent to win, they're slightly better. That means 80% of

186
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,720
the time I'm going to win. But that doesn't mean that you can't win 20% of the time you can win.

187
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,680
And I have no control either way. I don't know if on that particular iteration, I'm going to see

188
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,840
the 80% or the 20%. That really crosses all decision making. So you can tell me this would be my

189
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,720
intuition is not a medical practitioner. But not only are you dealing with incomplete information

190
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,280
in medicine, but even if you did have complete information, if you apply a treatment in a

191
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,200
situation, and it happens to work, there's all sorts of stuff going on, I assume that's relatively

192
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,680
stochastic that we don't really understand, where if we were to do that same thing again,

193
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,840
it may not work in the next situation. So we always want to think about that, because that

194
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,240
has a very big effect on our decision making. Yeah, you're absolutely correct. And just to

195
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,640
hear you explain it that way, that might even be the more important factor actually than the

196
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,920
absence of complete information. Now the definition of a chaotic system versus just a stochastic

197
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,800
system is even more profound, where even a slight change in the initial condition can produce a

198
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,920
profound change in the outcome. We don't even have to posit that we can just leave it at the

199
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,640
same initial conditions can produce different outcomes. Right. We can kind of appeal it in this

200
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,160
particular way. Let's say that we're dealing in a world where we had perfect information. I think

201
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,960
it's important to think about this to understand why chess is really so bad in terms of thinking

202
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,920
about these kinds of decisions. It's an interesting decision making problem. I'm not trying to slam

203
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,840
chess. I think it's a great game and it teaches critical thinking skills and it teaches you to

204
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,480
think many moves ahead and to think about what other people know. And there's all sorts of great

205
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,960
benefits that it has. It just happens to be missing a couple things that I think are really important.

206
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,120
But let's say that we had perfect information. For example, if I have a coin and I've weighed it,

207
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:25,080
so that I know that the weight is correct, I've examined it and I can see that it's too sighted,

208
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,560
then I now have perfect information. I know exactly what I need to know about the coin

209
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,840
to understand how often it's going to flip heads and how often it's going to land on tails. But

210
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,480
what I can't know is what it will land on the next try. So that's that issue of luck. So if you flip

211
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,240
and it lands heads, it's reasonable for me to say it could have landed tails. And if we did that

212
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,920
again, that tails is totally a possibility regardless of what I happen to have seen on this particular

213
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,760
flip. So and then what we can do is say, okay, so even in conditions of perfect information,

214
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,640
we don't really know which outcome we're going to get. We might know the frequency, how often that

215
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,960
might occur, how often we could expect it to occur, but we don't know for sure what will happen this

216
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,400
time. And then you can take it further and say, but what if you haven't examined the coin? And

217
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,760
based on some set of outcomes, you're now trying to derive what the coin looks like. Now that

218
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,600
becomes even harder. And that's where you get into something that looks very little like chess.

219
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,560
Why is it, do you think that as humans, we, at least most people, most of us don't seem

220
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,480
innately wired to understand probability theory? Because I studied math as an undergrad and I

221
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,840
spent so much time in it, I think I take for granted now how easy it is for me to think

222
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,040
probabilistically. I sort of view the world as a stochastic map, but I'm pretty sure I wasn't

223
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,320
born that way. And I'm pretty sure that nothing, maybe this isn't correct, but I doubt that we were

224
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,200
evolutionarily wired to do that. Or I feel like we would see it more often in the way people

225
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,480
behave. And I feel like the absence of that in the general person's point of view, who hasn't been

226
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,200
forced to be trained in that way, speaks to that. This strikes me as one of the more difficult things

227
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,120
in explaining anything. This touches everything from politics to business to science, because it's

228
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,760
too easy to say, well, that didn't happen, therefore, that couldn't have happened, as opposed to

229
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,960
describing it the way you did, which is, no, actually it could have happened. And if the same

230
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,600
initial circumstance happens again, by the way, this thing could happen. I would imagine if we were

231
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,480
to take the distribution of how naturally probabilistic thinking comes to somebody, I'm guessing

232
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,920
that you were probably born closer to the right tail. That being said, I guarantee you that if I

233
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,600
followed you around for a day, I could find all sorts of spots where you're not thinking probabilistically.

234
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,840
And I could, in particular, find all sorts of spots where your initial gut reaction is not

235
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,480
probabilistic and you have to stop yourself. I'm positive. I'll give you an example of a game I

236
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,120
played that's not an exact example of this, but it humbled the hell out of me. And I always go back

237
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,160
and play this with other people. So the idea of the game was to teach people what a 95% confidence

238
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,000
interval looks like. And this is back when I was at a consulting firm called McKinsey and Company,

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,840
and I was a part of the risk practice. Our whole job was walking around and helping companies

240
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,320
manage risk. So we did this at an offsite one day to help us kind of figure this out. So the

241
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,120
moderator goes up with 20 questions. Have you played this game? So I have, and this is one of

242
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,960
Phil Tetlock's favorite who wrote expert political judgment and super forecasting, which I highly

243
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,960
recommend anybody interested in probabilistic thinking. I ended up reading super forecasting

244
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,480
years after this experiment. Yeah, so you know he's got this in there. Yeah. So I'll tell it

245
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,840
just for the listeners. So you take, and I still have it, by the way. I still have the 20 questions.

246
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,520
I was terrible at this. I'll tell you what my score was after I was so pissed about it too.

247
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,200
Like how bad I was. Mine was like zero. So go ahead. And I've really tried. It's just like the

248
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,800
questions that I got were really out of my knowledge base. And it was like, I was trying it.

249
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm really wide. It was a disaster. Okay. So what the moderator does is they give you 20

250
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,760
questions. Each one has a quantitative answer that is known. That is known. Yeah. And the question

251
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,800
for you, the participant is, for each question, give me a bracket that contains the answer. So

252
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,160
for example, what is the average height of a male in the United States? An appropriate answer would

253
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,760
be somewhere between four foot six and six foot one, because that would be a reasonable guess at

254
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,720
a bracket that contains the average height of a male. Right. So the way that I've heard is that

255
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,120
you want a bracket to contain it 95% of the time. Which means after you've done all 20,

256
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:53,480
you should have exactly one incorrect and 19 correct. And the purpose of saying 95% confidence

257
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,680
is if they said to you, you have to have 100% confidence, you can sandbag it. One inch tall.

258
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,320
Yeah. They're somewhere from one inch tall to a million miles tall. And the questions, in fairness

259
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,480
to people like you and I who have flunked the test, the questions are hard. So did you get,

260
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,880
how many votes did Abraham Lincoln receive? I didn't get that one. I got like, what is the

261
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,760
distance between Jupiter and its nearest moon? I know. It's like, I don't have any goddamn clue.

262
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,720
But how many people were voting during Lincoln's, I don't know. And I had this really wide range.

263
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,240
And now it's green. But it's such a great exercise because you think, okay, I've got this under

264
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,720
control. I'm going to just try my best to get everyone correct with a reasonable guess. And

265
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,680
I'll probably get one wrong. And I think in the end, I got 12 right and eight wrong, which of

266
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:47,240
course is like a 60% confidence interval on things that are perfectly knowable. And so yes,

267
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I completely agree with you. And of course, your initial example is a better one, which is how many

268
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:59,000
times do I make either a decision or have a gut reaction that I have to actively talk myself out

269
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,240
of? The reason why I bring that up is that I think that there's a couple of things that we want to

270
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,800
sort of keep in mind. And then if you want to talk about sort of like from a, like an evolutionary

271
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,600
story, why it is that we're not particularly wired to think probabilistically, we can get into that.

272
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,200
But what I want to get across is this that, first of all, we're all sort of like sitting, we have

273
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,080
proclivities, you know, where we're sitting on a distribution somewhere on the distribution in terms

274
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,960
of sort of how we're born, how we're wired to think probabilistically. And that doesn't mean

275
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,160
that we should say either we're there or we're not. I mean, the idea is that wherever we sit on

276
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,640
the distribution, or whatever our personal distribution looks like, we just want to shift

277
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,280
it to the right. So wherever you are, you want to accomplish two things. One is, it would be really

278
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:54,280
good if you thought probabilistically a little bit more. Why? Because the world is probabilistic. And

279
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,520
so the more accurately you can think about what the outcomes of your decisions might be, because

280
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,400
they're not deterministic. When you make a decision, there's many, many things that could occur with

281
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,320
some likelihood of each of those things occurring. And understanding that particular fact is

282
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,560
incredibly important to the decision making. So the more that you can shift yourself a little bit,

283
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,160
more on the side of probabilistic thinking, the better off you are, no matter where you started.

284
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,760
And then the second thing we want to accomplish, which is what I was trying to get at the catching

285
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:28,280
yourself part, is to understand that we are wired this way. So it's really hard at all times

286
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,480
to think that you don't know things for certain, to sort of live in this counterfactual world. And

287
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,800
it's frankly kind of impractical, it would be hard to like drive, for example, if we were

288
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:46,200
living counterfactually all the time. So the idea is that when we do make an error to catch it faster,

289
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,120
because for most things, when we make an error and we have too much confidence, or we're thinking

290
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,080
about something as deterministic, when we should be thinking about it as probabilistic, for most

291
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,080
things we don't catch it at all. So if we can just catch it a little bit more often, and if we can

292
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,320
catch it a little bit more quickly, we're a lot better off. And these small shifts, if you can get

293
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,400
a couple percentage points better, you're way better off in your decision making. So let's go back to

294
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,880
kind of where you started thinking about this, which was through the lens of playing competitive

295
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,960
poker. How did you end up playing poker? Chaos theory. So let me just say that when I started

296
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,160
playing poker, it wasn't all over television, because I think that otherwise that would be a

297
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,440
really simple answer. Like I was in college, and I wanted to make money, and I saw poker on TV,

298
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,560
and I started playing online. I think would be the origin story of the majority of poker players

299
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,040
today, not my origin story, because I'm way too old for that. Where did you go to college?

300
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,120
Columbia. So you're here in the city. So I'm here in the city, and there's no internet. I mean,

301
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,040
I think there's some sort of, I don't know, Al Gore was inventing it, or something. I don't know,

302
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,680
but it didn't exist. So the first thing that happens on my way to becoming a professional

303
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:05,560
poker player is that my brother, when he was in high school, got very, very interested in chess,

304
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,880
started really studying it, became incredibly good at the game. He got accepted to Columbia,

305
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,520
decided to take a year deferment to live in New York and study with a grandmaster. During that

306
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,280
year, he started playing poker. All sorts of things happened. He lost his college nest egg.

307
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,360
He eventually did very well, but in this particular year, he was learning, let's say,

308
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,600
and he was he was learning maybe off the money that had been saved for college. It was a little

309
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,640
bit of money. It wasn't a lot. Anyway, he had started playing, and then I followed to New York

310
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,840
to go to Columbia a year later. I actually went. I didn't defer, and by the end of that year,

311
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,960
my brother was very good. So now we're both living in New York at the same time. He actually doesn't

312
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,440
end up going much later. He ended up going, I think, for like six months, but he ends up never

313
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,240
finishing college, and he's playing poker professionally, and I'm going and watching

314
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,320
him sometimes. So I'm just sort of sitting behind him. What does that mean at this era of time?

315
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,200
These are like smoky rooms in New York City? Yeah, there was a place called the Mayfair,

316
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:15,880
which had a game, and they had poker, and they had backgammon. Before that, my brother was playing

317
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,720
at a place called the Bar Point. For people who don't know, that's a backgammon term. And it was

318
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,840
like a backgammon club. People also played gin there. It was on 14th and 6th. And in the back room,

319
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,080
there was a poker game. This was before I came around. He was sort of already out of this place

320
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,480
by the time that I came around, although I did spend a summer here where I got to see him sort

321
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,840
of playing in that particular place. So he found out about that through his interest in chess,

322
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,640
ends up there in the back room. There's a game that starts on Friday night and ends on Monday

323
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,640
morning. And by that, I mean, that's how long the people played. They didn't get up and leave and

324
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,720
come back. We can have a whole other discussion about sleep deprivation and decision making,

325
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,880
but we'll save that for another time. Yeah, this was in the early 80s, so I believe there was

326
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,080
cocaine involved. Yeah, I'm sure. But at any rate, so he starts playing in that game, and that's

327
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,360
actually where he... So he cuts his teeth. That's where he's cutting his teeth. That's where he's

328
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,960
sort of learning how to play. That's where he's losing this college money. And eventually,

329
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,960
so he's playing in that game. He's not doing very well. And he starts figuring out, oh,

330
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,920
actually, it's sort of in the same way he approached chess. He sort of found whatever

331
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,160
books he could find. And he found a few other people who were kind of really interested in

332
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,640
learning the game. And he sort of starts working the game. And eventually, he basically sort of

333
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,840
breaks that game. Like he becomes so good that I can't remember whether they kicked him out or not.

334
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,400
But in the meantime, when he had lost his college money, what he starts doing, because now he needs

335
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:52,680
money to be able to play, is he became like the errand person for the game. And so they'd be like,

336
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,640
hey, Howard, will you go get me a sandwich, like at the deli downstairs, or go get me some pizza,

337
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,200
or go get me cigarettes, or go whatever. And he'd go into an errand, and then he'd get a tip.

338
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,600
And then he'd save his tips up and then get into the game. Eventually, he didn't need to be the

339
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,240
errand person anymore, because he turned the tip money into enough money for him to eventually

340
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,880
send himself to college for that brief period. But so he moved from there to the Mayfair,

341
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,920
which was sitting Gramercy Park near there. It's either Gramercy or Chelsea, I think it's

342
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,080
Gramercy Park. I think it's near Gramercy Park. It's a nice place. Then he was playing there for

343
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,600
a while, and he falls in at that point with a group that really becomes very famous, Dan

344
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,960
Harrington, main event champion, Eric Seidel, who I think has nine World Championship bracelets from

345
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,800
the World Series of Poker, might be more than that now. But he's won, I think, like $40 million

346
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,440
playing poker. I mean, he's amazing. Steve Zolotow, also bracelet holder, was in that group. Jason

347
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,160
Lester. And these guys are all coming out of this one group. So this is sort of like Daniel Coyle

348
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,840
writes about these centers of excellence, or I forget what his term is for them, but these

349
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,960
little places that just produce so much greatness, like all these soccer players that come out of

350
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,640
this place in Brazil and all these tennis players that come out of this place in Russia,

351
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,000
this became the place where everybody's sharpening everybody in this one place.

352
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,520
Exactly. If you're a tourist and you hear about this game, you don't get to go and play,

353
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,760
obviously, right? Like they'll take your money if you want. But yeah, anybody can play. And

354
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,240
anybody does play. The thing about poker that's part of this stuff about like the hidden

355
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,760
information in luck, is that that kind of uncertainty leaves open the array of explanations

356
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,560
for why you might not be doing well. So if I play chess against you a few times, it becomes very

357
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,120
clear to me why I'm losing. I'm losing because you're better than I am. I have nothing else to

358
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,680
protect my ego. Like I can't put a hat on it and say, no, it's because of something else.

359
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,920
See, that's such a great point that's worth pausing on it as well for a moment.

360
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:58,760
There are very few sports or activities that we play that are as pure as something like chess,

361
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,200
where as you said, there is zero excuse. Whereas I can't think of another activity,

362
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,480
I'm sure there are several, where if you really want to, you can't, oh, the ref screwed me or,

363
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,080
oh, the wind. I mean, did you see that? Or like I'm into archery, right? It's like, oh,

364
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,160
did you see that animal move out of the way at the last second he heard the arrow coming or

365
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,080
whereas in reality, no, you took a lousy shot. Right. I mean, they're all on a spectrum. And

366
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,440
one thing that we forget is that there's an equanimity to luck. So if you're playing tennis

367
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,720
and there's wind, your opponent is also playing with that wind. If you're in a game, although we

368
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,080
like to think so, the refs generally are making bad calls, just sort of period, some good, some

369
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:46,440
bad. And they're not like screwing a particular team, systematically going against a particular

370
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,680
team, although it sort of feels like that. But what we notice is the wind blew our ball.

371
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,480
An interesting thing that happens in sports that are one in one, like I play tennis is that you

372
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,160
can blame it on the style matchup. That it's not that like, you're not particularly good.

373
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,800
That's a great new excuse. I hadn't even really thought of that.

374
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,560
Like, oh, that was a bad style for me. I mean, I'm actually better than them, but they're

375
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,280
lobbing. They were doing a lot of lobbing and my high balls weren't really on that day,

376
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,760
but I would crush anybody else. So yeah, exactly. So poker basically is just a fertile ground for

377
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,320
that thinking. Right. Which means that it doesn't cause you to kind of self-select out. It's,

378
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,120
as you said, this was like a nest of what was going to become the best players in the world.

379
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,120
And of course people were still coming back. So he ends up at the Mayfair Wall in the park.

380
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,280
And I guess there's another element here, which is the variable reinforcement of winning.

381
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,640
Wow.

382
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,400
So then you've got the whole dopamine side of this coupled with this psychology of I can

383
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:48,200
post hoc rationalize my way all day long. I can rationalize my losses, pump up my winnings from

384
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,040
an ego standpoint. And the next win is coming at a point I can't predict. I mean, that is a recipe

385
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,400
for getting me into this. Actually, let me just bite into that for a second. So this is actually

386
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,200
really interesting. So let me just say I didn't play poker at all in college. Like I never played

387
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,440
it. It wasn't until graduate school that I played three times or something. So I go to graduate

388
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,160
school at Penn. I'm studying cognitive science. This becomes important to me later as I'm thinking

389
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,640
about the game of poker, this issue that you just brought up the difference between a variable

390
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:24,200
reinforcement schedule and a fixed reinforcement schedule. What we can think about is we can talk

391
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,480
about ratio or interval schedule. So ratio schedule would be by number. So if you put a rat in a

392
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,120
Skinner box, and for those who don't know Skinner boxes, it's got the lever, and then either there's

393
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,680
positive reinforcement, like a food pellet comes out or maybe negative reinforcement like a shock.

394
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,680
So let's make it positive and say it's appellate ratio schedule is by number. So it would be like

395
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:53,400
every fifth press, the rat gets appellate and an interval schedule is by time every five minutes,

396
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:00,440
the rat gets appellate. And if it's fixed, what it means is it's actually every five presses or

397
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,760
every five minutes. And depending on whether it's ratio or interval, you get different behaviors

398
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:14,040
from the rat. So what happens on the ratio schedule is that the rat has this very even

399
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,400
pressing that goes on this very even somewhat quick, but not mad. Press, press, press, press,

400
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,560
food, press, press, press, press. And then if it's every five minutes, the rat twiddles its thumbs

401
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,400
until it's almost five minutes, and then it goes crazy. So you get this burst of activity,

402
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,520
it's almost like they don't want to miss a second. They want to make sure that they get that food

403
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,000
exactly, they don't want to give up one second where they could have had food. And so you get

404
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,480
this big burst of activity, then you can also take a ratio or interval schedule, and instead of it

405
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,200
being fixed, you can make it variable. And what that means is it's now on average is the way that

406
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,520
you can think about that. So let's say on average, every 20 lever presses, you'll get food, or on

407
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,880
average, every five minutes, you'll get food. So now, instead of this big burst of activity

408
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,440
on the interval schedule, on average, every five minutes, because they're not sort of waiting, and

409
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,480
then, oh, I think it's about five minutes and they go, now they're pressing pretty steadily

410
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,880
the whole time because they're not sure anymore, right? Is it going to be the second or not?

411
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,920
And then on the variable ratio schedule, you get the same thing, you get a lot of pressing very

412
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,760
quickly, because they don't know is it the next press or not. So that's all kind of interesting.

413
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,160
And you'll see different activity depending on whether it's variable or not. What's interesting

414
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,600
is when you try to extinguish the behavior, this is what's really key. So when you extinguish a

415
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,480
behavior, what you do is you just withdraw the reward. So now you've trained the rat,

416
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,360
it's pressing the lever, and then you just stop giving the rat food and the question what does

417
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,920
it do? When it's fixed, it stops doing the thing super fast. It's like, hey, wait a minute,

418
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,760
like I've been pressing 100 presses of this stupid lever, you haven't given me any food,

419
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,120
I give up, I have figured this out, there's no food coming my way. Same thing if you're doing

420
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,960
it by time. But when you make it variable, they just don't stop. And it's particularly bad when

421
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,160
it's a variable ratio schedule. So I think about it like this. So anybody who's ever watched people

422
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,520
sitting at a bank of slot machines in Las Vegas, those are on a variable ratio schedule, that

423
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,520
you'll get a reward, it's going to be on average, a certain number of plays, you could get a reward

424
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,680
five plays in a row, you could go 80 plays without really getting much in return. And you kind of

425
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,960
don't know because it's on average. And what happens to people sitting at those slot machines

426
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,280
is that they'll be going along and there'll be no reward. And you'll hear them say a thing. I'm do,

427
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,560
I'm do. And what that means is that it doesn't matter what you do to that machine, you could

428
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,800
just turn it off. What they think is no, it must be the next press, it must be the next press. And

429
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,400
this is exactly what happens to the rats in the Skinner box, you train them that on average,

430
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,280
every 20 presses, they get food. And that means sometimes they're getting three pellets in a row.

431
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,720
And sometimes they're going 80 presses without getting food. That's obviously out at the tail,

432
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,600
no pun intended, but it's just an average. And now you would draw it and they just never stop

433
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,800
pressing the lever. And it looks just like what humans do. And I sort of always imagine the little

434
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,880
rats in the cage is saying I'm do. So this is exactly the way that something like poker works.

435
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:41,240
If we're thinking about sort of an edge, what that means is that over time, I'm going to get a certain

436
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,880
percentage of your money. But in a particular moment, you could win a lot of hands in a row.

437
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,560
In a particular moment, you could not win so many hands in a row. And unless you're a really good

438
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,080
statistical aggregator, right, unless you're sort of stepping back and really looking at what does

439
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,560
this look like over the long run, it's really hard to see what the underlying distribution is. It's

440
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,160
hard to see whether you're winning or losing to that situation. Well, there's a slight difference,

441
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,680
right? Because if I understand correctly, the slot machine is driven by an underlying

442
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,520
probability distribution curve. So the person sitting there playing it like the Skinner rat

443
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,760
is kind of right in that they are do, they just don't know when. Whereas the person playing poker,

444
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,160
there is no certainty that they will ever win again necessarily. In other words, it's both luck

445
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:39,400
and some skill. So they could take probabilistic good hands and misplay them and lose on a potential

446
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,800
hand that could have been their do, right? Yes, I'm thinking about that. Yeah. Yeah. So it's sort of

447
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,680
like in some ways, the person at the poker table has an even harder problem than the person at the

448
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,440
slot machine. Yes. Because the slot machine is pure luck. So the slot machine simplifies the problem

449
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,560
because the machine is set to a particular distribution and the probability is set about

450
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:12,360
how much you're losing per dollar. And so if I sit down, the underlying probability is knowable.

451
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,280
That's right. And your only task is to pull the lever or push the button. Whereas in poker,

452
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,400
I have to still actually have to do what we're going to get to, which is the skill of this game.

453
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,120
Right. And what you're trying to figure out is, I mean, obviously this isn't true of everybody,

454
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,760
but when people sit down at a slot machine, people aren't thinking I won because I'm so skillful. I

455
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,120
mean, occasionally they are if they think they have a system. I don't think that's true. Most

456
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,200
people are saying like, I'm doing this because I'm going to get lucky and maybe I'm do and whatnot.

457
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,000
So I think that you have less illusion about it. So now in poker, you lay on top of the fact that

458
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,880
it's stochastic, that obviously it's a skill game. And in the long run with enough iterations,

459
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,960
your results will be solely determined by skill. Right. Because the probability starts to approach

460
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,520
equal distribution for everybody, assuming there's no cheating. Well, it would be true even if there's

461
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,160
cheating for this reason, that what that would mean is that whatever skill elements that you

462
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,200
were applying, you wouldn't be able to overcome the situation. So all I mean by this is that you

463
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:20,040
have an expected value. That expected value is determined by your play compared to your

464
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:27,880
opponent's play. And when you say skill, do you mean two skills? The first being the ability to

465
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,920
look at all the cards that are available and calculate the probability of cards that are not

466
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,400
being shown and the skill of being able to bluff or are you referring more to the latter than the

467
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,920
former? Skill would be the umbrella of all the things that are within your control in the game

468
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,080
that have an effect on the outcome. So first of all, let me just step back a second. Sometimes

469
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,800
people think that a game isn't skill. If in the short run, there's a really strong influence of

470
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,960
luck. So people will say, well, baseball is a game of skill, but poker isn't a game of skill,

471
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:12,520
because they're looking at, well, but in poker, I could have the best hand, I could play it perfectly,

472
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,880
and I can lose to you because of the turn of a card. So therefore, isn't it just luck? And how can

473
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,880
you tell if something is a game of skill? Because I'm obviously making the assertion that in the long

474
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,440
run, your results are going to be solely determined by skill. I think the way you said it actually is

475
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,480
probably the best definition I've ever heard, which is in the long run, if two different people can

476
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,120
play the exact same game over and over and over again, and have dramatically different results

477
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,560
under the same stochastic input, doesn't that imply that there is a difference that is in the

478
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,400
control of the player? And isn't that the definition of skill? Yes, because of actions that they take,

479
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,080
their distribution is different. Right. So for example, if you and I made up a new game,

480
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,440
which would be a really boring game called toss two dice, and the person who gets the higher number

481
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:05,160
wins, if you and I played this game for the next week, we sat here at my table and we played over

482
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,920
and over and over again, in the end, we would end up the same. There'd be nothing that we could do

483
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,680
that would change the outcome. And therefore, there is no skill in that game. There's no skill in that

484
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,680
game. But if we can bet on it. That's right. And baseball, of course, is such an obvious example

485
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,360
of skill, because while there is luck involved, within a matter of minutes, you would tell the

486
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,240
difference between me and a professional baseball player doing anything. Right. There's a really

487
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,040
great test that you can do to figure out if something is skill. And then, and then let me

488
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,800
just get back to baseball for a second to show what's happening, why people are sort of misperceiving

489
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,040
with poker, whether it's a skill game or a luck game. So the first thing is you just want to apply

490
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,600
a test, can you lose on purpose, assuming you followed the rules of the game. Now, it's not

491
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,200
symmetric. I cannot apply a test of can I win on purpose, but I can apply a test of can I lose on

492
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,960
purpose. And I'll tell you why. So tic-tac-toe, let's agree that that's a skill game.

493
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,600
Bottom feeding skill game, but it is right. But if you and I play, neither of us can win on purpose,

494
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,600
assuming that we both know how to play the game, because we're going to tie every single time,

495
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,320
but one of us can lose on purpose, very easy to lose on purpose at that game. So we don't want to

496
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,000
apply the win on purpose, because that's hard, particularly as you narrow the skill gap, then

497
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
you can't do that. But I can lose on purpose. And in a game like baseball, you can lose on purpose

498
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,920
in a game like basketball in a game like chess, and any of these games, you can lose on purpose,

499
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,560
we can think of other acts of skill, like if you're a salesperson, you could make it so that

500
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,920
on purpose, you never close to sale. As an example, it's a game of skill. If you were a lawyer,

501
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,400
you could probably make sure you lost every case. I mean, hopefully you don't do this. But

502
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,520
and in poker, you can indeed, I can lose on purpose very easily, I can't win on purpose,

503
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,680
but I can lose on purpose. And that's true of baseball as well, somebody can lose on purpose,

504
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,920
but they cannot win on purpose that you do not control. That at a basic level, is a really good

505
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,000
test of whether something is a skill game or something is a luck game. Where I think the

506
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,280
confusion comes in is that as you narrow the skill gap, luck starts to play a much bigger role,

507
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,120
it starts to kind of show itself that influence of, hey, there's different ways that this could

508
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,520
turn out. And sometimes you're going to see one thing, and sometimes you're going to see another

509
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,840
thing. And you kind of don't have control over which thing you happen to see a lot of the time,

510
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,480
we start to see that influence as we narrow the skill gap. So that's a great point, right? That's

511
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,800
why you look at virtually every Super Bowl these days, most of them come down to the last series,

512
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,760
the last possession, I don't remember the stats, but it could be as high as like two thirds of Super

513
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,760
Bowls come down to the last possession. And if you think about that, you could easily do what I do

514
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,040
when looking at the Eagles beating the Patriots and say it came down to that one stupid play when

515
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,720
Brady went back for the pass and boom, the ball gets stripped out of his hand. And it's like,

516
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,120
if that didn't happen, he absolutely would have connected with Gronk. They absolutely would have

517
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,760
won. And whether or not I'm being delusional or not, you can't deny the point that those teams

518
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,880
were so damn near perfect. If you took the Red Sox, and you had them play a little league team,

519
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,440
there'd be basically no influence of luck, right? Like what luck is going to go the way

520
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,520
of the little league team? I mean, with the Red Sox, what luck is going to go against them aside

521
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,520
from all their players all at once, get injured and can't play anymore, they could put in their

522
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:33,640
third stringers and the little league team is crushed. But if you put the Red Sox against

523
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,360
the Yankees, this is why we have to have seven games. And it's probably still not enough

524
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,440
to try to figure out who's supposed to advance to the next round. And in fact, we know it's very rare

525
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,920
in a series that a team wins for nothing. It's very often going to the sixth or seventh game.

526
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,360
Why? Because it's very narrow. And it's very often things like you just said, who wins the coin toss

527
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,440
in a football game that has a huge effect on what the outcome is, who just gets to go first,

528
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,080
especially over time. Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's a huge influence of luck. Why? Because you've

529
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:13,320
narrowed the skill gap so much. But if you took that NFL football team and you put them against

530
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,160
Pee Wee players or even a college team or even a college team, it's unbelievable that

531
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,720
the coin toss would have no effect. No one would care who won the coin toss in overtime. The NFL

532
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,360
team, I mean, I don't know how they would get to overtime, but you just magically make overtime

533
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,880
appear. You put them in there and the coin toss will have no effect whatsoever. So I think this

534
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,600
is something for people to really understand. And so if we think about a game like poker and a lot

535
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,760
of these decision making processes that we do in life, the skill gap is actually quite narrow.

536
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,160
So once I've taught you in poker, things like you know the ranking of the hands, like a flush beats

537
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,840
a straight at you, you know, you can bluff, you know, sort of about betting, you can read your hand,

538
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,160
all these things. That's so much of the building blocks of the game in terms of the skill. And how

539
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,800
long does it take? Let's hit pause for one second. And just for the person listening to this, who

540
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,600
maybe doesn't know the ins and outs of poker. When we're talking about poker, you're talking about a

541
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,880
variant of poker called Texas Hold'em, correct? Not necessarily. Okay, that's what you played,

542
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,160
correct. And that's what most of the pros are playing when we turn TV on and stuff like that.

543
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,040
So what you see most of the pros playing when you turn the television on is Texas Hold'em. In terms

544
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,360
of what most of them are playing, it's not necessarily that game. That's one of the games

545
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,920
that they play. So give us the brief overview of how that game works so that we can understand

546
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,600
what those building blocks are that you're talking about, which is everybody within a day

547
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:40,280
could know in detail what you're explained quickly about how this game works. So this isn't true of

548
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,120
all poker games, but it's true of almost all poker games enough that we can pretend that it's kind of

549
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,080
true across the board, that the goal is to make a five card hand. Again, there are some exceptions

550
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,920
to this. I just want to make that clear. But I'm capturing most of poker. If I say you want to make

551
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,880
a five card hand, those five card hands range from none of the five cards match up. And so all

552
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:10,440
you care about is the top card and the hand in most poker games, aces are high. In some poker

553
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,160
games, they're low, but mostly they're high, sometimes they're high and low, it depends.

554
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,600
So you're trying to make a five card hand, those five card hands range from very bad,

555
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:26,360
meaning none of the cards match up to each other in any way to really, really good. And really,

556
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:34,600
really good would be a straight, which would be five cards in rank order 56789. That would be a

557
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:40,120
straight 10 Jack, Queen, King, East, that would be a straight, you can have a flush, that's when all

558
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,080
five of the cards are of the same suit. So you have five hearts or five spades or whatever full

559
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:51,160
houses where you have three of one rank, King, King, King, and then two of another rank, 10, 10.

560
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,600
So your five cards would be King, King, King, 10, 10. So anyway, people can go and look up the hand

561
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,480
rankings. The highest rank is a straight flush. Is a royal straight flush. So that would be an Ace,

562
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,920
King, Queen, Jack, 10, all of the same suit. All the same suit. Probability of that hand.

563
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,400
I'm not sure what it is, but a straight flush is one in 6,000 something that hardly ever happens.

564
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,800
So let's start there. So basically almost any poker game you play, you're trying to make a five

565
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,840
card hand. And there's a very clear set of rules about what the hierarchy and ranking are. There

566
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,320
is no ambiguity. There's no ambiguity when you're playing. Now, different games have different

567
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,240
rankings because you can play low. So in low, you're actually trying to make sort of wet and

568
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:37,080
high would be a bad hand. Okay. So then the other thing about most poker games is for most poker

569
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:43,320
games, you're trying to make a five card hand out of either seven or nine possible cards. That

570
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:50,120
just is also true of most poker games, not all. So in Texas Hold'em, it's a particular form of

571
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:55,720
poker where you have seven cards to work with to try to make your best five. So you're sort of like

572
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:04,120
tossing two of them, but some of the cards everybody gets to use. They're called community cards.

573
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:10,360
So we can think about the variants of poker. So when you watch something like the Cincinnati Kid,

574
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:17,720
for example, Steve McQueen, in that particular game, people are dealt their own five cards.

575
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,000
And so you don't get to use any of the five cards that I have. So our cards are unique from each

576
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,840
other and you don't get to see any of my cards. Then you can have variants which are called stud

577
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:35,800
games where all of our cards are private, but you get to see some of my cards. So in a stud game,

578
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:42,440
at the end of the hand, I'll have three cards that are face down and four cards that are face up to

579
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,080
you. And I'm still making my best five of those seven, but you can see- And I don't get to use

580
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:51,960
yours. It just gives me more information. It just gives you more information. So once you can see

581
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,280
the four cards that are up, that gives you some definition to the kinds of hands that I can have.

582
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:03,960
So as an example, because I only have three down, if my four up cards are a spade, a club, a heart,

583
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:10,360
and a diamond, I can't possibly have a flush because the most I could have of any suit now

584
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,120
is only four. So you get certain information about the possibilities for what I could be holding

585
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,720
because you get to see some of my cards. But yet you still don't get to use any of my cards.

586
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,840
Whereas in Texas hold them- Now that's a stud game.

587
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,720
But it's common.

588
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,200
But it's common. So what happens is you get dealt two cards that are private to you. So these are

589
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:35,080
face down. You don't get to see those particular cards. And then in a particular way, five cards

590
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,640
eventually will end up in the middle. So notice that that's seven, but those five cards that are

591
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:45,640
sitting in the middle, both of us get to use. Now, what that means is that these five cards in the

592
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:53,800
middle define for me what your possible holdings are. So that now changes for me, what I think that

593
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,240
the strength of my hand is, I'll give you a simple example. It just turns out, if you have two private

594
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:04,520
cards, the most of a suit that I could have in my hand would be two. So I could have like two hearts,

595
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,120
which means that in order for me to ever make a flush, which is five of the same suit, like five

596
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:15,960
hearts, I need to have three more of those out on the board. So if I look on the board and you look

597
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,920
on the board, and we both see that there aren't three of a suit that's on the board, it eliminates

598
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,760
the possibility of a flush from the other person's hand. That becomes important because if I have a

599
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:33,880
hand that is vulnerable to a flush, like if I have three of a kind or two pair or something like that,

600
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,840
that now increases how I think about the strength of my own hand. And you get to look at your cards

601
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,280
as soon as they're dealt the two as soon as they're dealt, you get to see your private cards, right?

602
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,320
So you know what your private cards are the whole time. And then these community cards are coming

603
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,520
down in the middle and those community cards are defining for you what you think the other player

604
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,160
might have. Now, this is a lot of where the skill and poker comes from is understanding what those

605
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:08,040
community cards mean. Understanding how they define what the other player has, how they might

606
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,560
relate in a logical way to what the other player has, what the probability is that the other player's

607
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,680
cards match up in some way to those five cards in the middle. Yeah, it's both, right? It's what do

608
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,360
those cards mean about what you have? And what do they not mean about what other players have? Right.

609
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,560
And it's interesting because depending on how many players are at the table, and what's the

610
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,440
typical number of players that are at the table? And hold them? Yeah. It's generally nine, sometimes

611
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,560
it's eight, the higher the limit, they tend to limit the number of players more. So if you're

612
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:45,400
playing in a much lower limit game, you might see 10 people at a table. If you're playing in a much

613
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:51,080
higher limit game, it's more likely to be eight, which is still kind of staggering to me because

614
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:57,720
now, so you have this math of, here's what I have, here's what's common. Based on what's common,

615
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,840
what can I impute about everybody else? But now I actually have to pay attention to the behavior

616
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:09,480
of the other people. So I can do the probabilistic calculation broadly. I'm doing two probabilistic

617
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,600
calculations, the implications of these cards on me, the implications of these cards on people

618
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:20,280
for whom I don't know the other two cards. But now I have to do eight different behavioral checks.

619
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,520
Right. So one thing about the way they relate to your own hand is probabilistic and one is it.

620
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,280
So the thing that isn't probabilistic is these relate to my cards, my hand in a certain way.

621
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,680
So if I'm looking at the middle hand, like I know what I have, hopefully. But what is probabilistic,

622
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,400
and this is what's really important is, what does that mean for whether I have the best hand or not?

623
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,200
So that I don't know, because that's relative to your hand, because there isn't an absolute ranking,

624
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:53,000
it's not like, oh, I have a flush, I get to win automatically. Now, that comes up, like sometimes

625
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,200
if I look at the center of the board, I have the very best possible hand that a person could hold.

626
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,920
That's very rare that that occurs. Most of the time, I'm somewhere in between the worst possible

627
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,160
hand that a person could hold, and the best possible hand that a person can hold. So I have

628
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,120
to figure out where I'm sitting on that spectrum, right. And it's probabilistic in nature, whether

629
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,800
I'm likely to be beating you or not. And I can think about that in the sense of sort of just base

630
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,320
rates, like if I'm holding this strength hand, how often would I be winning, but then I also have

631
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:31,080
to adjust those probabilities for what you're doing and how you're acting. And how you're acting

632
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,960
is going to tell me something, two people could act in the exact same way. But depending on

633
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,240
my model of who they are, it could mean very different things. So I could bet strongly with

634
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:49,160
a hand. And if you call, that could mean that you have a particular range of hands. That's X.

635
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,040
And if another person calls their range of hands that they might call with could be narrower or

636
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,440
wider, they could be willing to call with either a hand that's much worse than the bottom end of

637
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,320
the range of hands that you'd be willing to call there with, or they could actually be calling with

638
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:09,160
a where their bottom range is better than what your bottom ranges as a general person,

639
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,840
does a newcomer to a game have an advantage or a disadvantage? Let's say you and six of your

640
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:20,520
friends have a regular game going, and I show up as a first timer, you guys have never played with

641
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,400
me. Does that give me an advantage or disadvantage in terms of the point you just made about ranging

642
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,440
me all things being equal. So let's pretend you know nothing about this until we play enough,

643
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,520
you don't know if I'm good or not. So let's assume I know the fundamentals of the game,

644
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:40,280
all things being equal against the game, you're at a disadvantage because you don't know how to

645
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,920
range six people. But me personally, I would prefer to play in terms of my ability to range you,

646
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,600
I'm going to be better with somebody I've already played with before. It depends on what question

647
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:57,080
you're asking. And in fact, there's actually been many, many cases in poker, where someone has come

648
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:05,560
in, and they're doing something that's just really unusual, that is not something that would

649
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:12,120
be expected. And they do really well a certain period of time. And then the market basically

650
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,920
kind of figures out what they're doing, either they adjust or they don't. But I've seen a lot

651
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:22,520
of players come in and win a lot, in some cases, it's just attributable to like their short term

652
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,480
bursts of luck. But in some cases, they're actually doing something really unexpected,

653
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,320
and people are actually misranging them. This usually is because they're playing more aggressively

654
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,720
with hands that people normally wouldn't play that aggressively with. And then people sort of

655
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,600
figure it out and they adjust and very often that person starts losing after that. Sometimes they

656
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,880
adjust and they do other things. But often it has to do with this problem of sort of what do you have?

657
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,800
For example, like in cycling, a totally unknown cyclist can win a stage of a race because they

658
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:59,240
lead out, they break out and the palatone sort of says, well, there's no way this person can do such

659
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,640
and such because we don't know anything about them. And all of a sudden they let them get away. Now,

660
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,520
they're not going to be able to do that the next day, because all of a sudden the palatone's gonna

661
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,040
say, wait a minute, wait a minute. Now we're going to treat you like we would treat anybody who has

662
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,480
the potential to win. And your moves now fit into a different frame. Right, exactly. That's exactly

663
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:21,080
what happens in poker. The first thing that you're trying to do is figure out, I know sort of in an

664
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:27,480
absolute sense what I have, but I don't know where that sits relative to what you have. And then once

665
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:33,080
I sort of figure that out, and that's probabilistic in nature, I now have to figure out for you what's

666
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,640
the best line of play for me. And tell me how the flow of the game goes from here. So the five cards

667
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:43,880
common, we each have our two, how does the betting work and what changes with the showing of cards

668
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,400
or movement of common cards? So you start off, you get dealt two cards, and there's a round of

669
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,520
betting. And you can choose at that point. And this is actually a really important concept in poker.

670
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,880
I actually tweeted about a little while ago, because I think people should be talking about

671
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,680
it more, which is you're totally allowed to fold. Remember when Steve Dubner and Stephen Levitt wrote

672
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,920
about this in for economics, like the benefit of quitting, we do not spend enough time encouraging

673
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,200
people to quit. No, we spend a lot of time encouraging people to stick to it. And it's

674
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,440
actually for everything that you stick to, there's huge opportunity costs involved, right? There's

675
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,360
all the other things that you could have done. And if you're sticking to something that you're

676
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,840
negative expectancy to, and I'm not saying money, I mean, I'm saying you might be negative expected

677
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:30,360
happiness to it, or negative expected health to it, or negative expected whatever, that in your

678
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,720
giving up the opportunity to go do something, I mean, I'm a big fan of quit fast. So what I like

679
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,520
my theory is do lots and lots of things that are basically a free roll where there's very little

680
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,640
downside to it. Go try out piano, right? It's like a little bit of your time. You can't die doing it,

681
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,160
just go see if you like it, but then quit fast. Just quit fast and move on to something else.

682
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,160
And then if you find out, Oh, I really love this, I really want to spend my time do it now stick to

683
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,440
it. So I'm a huge fan of that. But in poker, this idea is very natural for a poker player,

684
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,960
because you're doing a lot of the quitting part, you're just saying like, No, this isn't a hand

685
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,440
that I mathematically want to play. I don't think I realized that and that actually might answer

686
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,160
this question, which is one of the things I've never understood about gambling in general is you

687
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,520
lose much more than you win, presumably? No, not in poker. Because of what you just said,

688
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,560
because you can cut your losses. Okay, that answers the question. Because my question was

689
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:30,120
going to be I think it answers my question. Given the power of loss aversion, how the hell do people

690
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:38,200
keep playing? Because you'd think if you only win once out of every 10 hands, that's nine experiences

691
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,760
that are each more painful than the pleasure of the win. But of course, you don't view those nine

692
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:48,440
as losses, you just view them as non wins, you do lose real hands. I mean, you get to the end of a

693
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,760
hand and you lose real money. But a lot of the times if you really feel like you know the table

694
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,200
well, you know the dynamic well, you just cut your losses. And you're like, I'm gonna let these two

695
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,040
guys fight it out over here. But right exactly. And I'm gonna only go to the mat when I really

696
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:06,280
have a shot to win and presumably losing that still falls into the loss aversion pain. By that point,

697
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,040
the pre test probability is such that you have a better shot at winning. So it comes back to this

698
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:16,920
kind of variable ratio reward schedule, you're winning enough big pots. If you're playing this

699
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,480
particular form of poker, which is limit, let me just say something about poker comes in two styles.

700
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,880
One is limited betting. So in limited betting, it means that, for example, we're playing, maybe we

701
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,680
have to bet in like $10 increment. So I can bet $10. And then if you want to raise the bet, you

702
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,680
can make it $20. And then if I want to raise it, I could raise it to 30. In other words,

703
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,160
we're raising in $10 increments. And we can't do anything more than that. What comes along with

704
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,120
that is there's limited exposure to the person, but obviously limits what I can win from you on a

705
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:51,080
particular hand. And then there's no limit, which is what you really see on television, which is the

706
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,360
super exciting someone shoves a million and chips on like when I think of poker, I think of rounders,

707
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,240
I'm sure there's been a million movies, which is no limit, no limit and snapping Oreos. I want to

708
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:07,320
be around John Malkovich. I want Oreos and I want to hear a Russian accent. Like that's all right.

709
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,200
Anytime that movie's on anywhere. Like if I turn on Netflix and somehow it pops up, I'm watching it.

710
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,080
Right. Yeah. That's no limit, which is like that super sexy. Oh my God. It's incredible.

711
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:23,080
I'm going to lay everything on the table. Can I bet my lung? You know, but there's also something

712
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:29,960
called limit. So in limit, a really good limit player at the end of an eight hour session,

713
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,640
a very good limit player is going to have won about 56% of the time. This is a really,

714
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:42,360
really excellent player. Now go talk to anybody on wall street. They can get a hundred billion

715
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:48,120
AUM if they say for every bad has a 56% chance of winning, right? I mean, this is a huge edge.

716
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,440
So I'm saying this is a really, really, really good limit player. What that means though,

717
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,160
is that the person that they're playing against is going to win 44% of the time. So think about how

718
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,840
much reinforcement they're getting. So sometimes they're going to win three sessions in a row,

719
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,960
right? I mean, 44%, that's a lot. This is a great player. That's hard to believe. Even when you

720
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,720
bring it back to the context of what we keep using as a great comparison, which is sports.

721
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,280
Think about this. If the new England Patriots played, let's see who was the worst team in the

722
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,040
league last year? I don't even remember. If you put the best team against the worst team,

723
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:25,240
it would not be 56 44. It wouldn't even be close. It would be 85 15 or 90 10, even in professional

724
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:31,640
sports. So that tells you how much narrower the gap is here in poker. This is specifically in this

725
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:39,320
limit version of poker. Now in no limit, you can get these bigger spreads. Ah, the 56% is dollars,

726
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:45,080
not number of times in which a person wins. 56% of the time is at the end of an eight hour session.

727
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,920
How many times have I won? Have you won? Okay, at the end of that session. So over eight hours now,

728
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,960
just to allow you to understand, it's just a matter of the number of iterations, because

729
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:02,840
sort of in the same way that if the Patriots are 56% against another team, if they play enough times,

730
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,200
they're 100% to have won the series. So a poker player who's going to win 56% of the time at the

731
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,160
end of eight hours at the end of 1500 hours will approach to 100% that they'll be in the money at

732
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,400
the end of the year. And this is in this limit version of poker. Now when we get to no limit,

733
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,840
basically what's happening is that you're realizing, you're more likely to realize you're

734
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,720
you're going to see huge volatility and you have enormously asymmetric outcomes at times. Right. So

735
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,360
here's an interesting thing, actually, because of that, is that when I started playing poker,

736
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,480
I love that we haven't even got to you playing poker yet. But that's okay, because we're going

737
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:42,040
to get there. When I started playing poker, the pool of players was small. So it wasn't on TV,

738
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:47,560
it wasn't on the internet, there just wasn't this huge market of people who were like, Oh,

739
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:54,360
I'm going to go and play poker. So what that meant was that this limit version of poker

740
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:03,320
was really what was being played in casinos by professionals. And the reason was that

741
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,880
when you had someone come in, who was not such a great player, making sure they were getting that

742
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:15,560
frequent reinforcement was really, really, really important. So you can think about it this way,

743
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:21,080
if you have kind of an unlimited supply of new players coming into the game, when you come in,

744
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,920
I should just take all your money right then. Because who cares if you get depressed and go

745
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:32,040
away? Who cares if I hit you over the head? And it plays more like chess. And you're like, well,

746
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,200
I'm not going to play anymore, because it's not even close. It's not even close. That's ridiculous.

747
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:41,560
Because there's literally 17 people standing behind you waiting to take your seat. So now what

748
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,800
I can do is I can just maximize in that moment, I can just take as much of your money as quickly as

749
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,400
possible, because there's going to be somebody else willing to come into the game. When I first

750
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,160
started playing, that was not true. When I first started playing, if someone came in the game,

751
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:58,440
who was really playing at negative expected value, you didn't want to take a sledgehammer to them,

752
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:04,840
you wanted to make sure that they were enjoying themselves, by the way. And so playing these limit

753
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:10,200
games, which were kind of like a softer way that the edge played out over a longer period of time,

754
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,040
was kind of the way to go. Because then they won enough. It was like they want enough of the time

755
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:21,800
to feel pretty good. And the thing is that I think that people focus when they're thinking about poker

756
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:28,920
on the expected value being about money. And when this person came in, and they were losing money,

757
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,720
wasn't that awful for them. When somebody goes to see a sports game, they play money, they get

758
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,680
something in return for it, right? They get to watch a good game. When somebody goes to a

759
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:45,560
restaurant, and they order food, they're giving money. There's guarantee expected loss. Right.

760
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:50,280
But they're getting there for them, what they're getting in return is of value. So generally,

761
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,880
when these people would come into the game, who will be playing at negative expected value,

762
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,280
if you only thought about money, I think that most of them were actually playing at positive

763
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,760
expectancy when you looked overall at what their overall experience was. Now, the thing is that

764
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,840
no matter who you are, it's not fun for somebody to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer.

765
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,560
Like here, just give me all your money. It happened in two seconds now go away. But when

766
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:16,600
they would come in, and they'd get to play with really good players, and they'd be learning the

767
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,960
game, which is exciting, and they'd feel like you know, I'm playing at table one at the Bellagio or

768
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:29,320
Aria or whatever, and they're winning enough to feel good, they're probably learning, and this

769
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:35,640
is entertainment for them. Now, it's no longer zero sum anymore. It's like, is it zero sum as

770
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,960
far as the money is concerned? Sure. But it's not zero sum overall, when you look at like,

771
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,600
what's the scope of what people value, because there's all this entertainment happening as well.

772
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,720
And I remember there was this guy, I won't say his last name, but this guy named Jay,

773
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,760
who came and played he came in the late 90s. And he, you know, he's probably mid to late 70s. He

774
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:02,520
had made a bunch of money on Wall Street, moved to Las Vegas to retire, his health was okay,

775
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:08,440
his mind was super sharp. And I think that he just sort of decided this is what he wanted to do for

776
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,640
his retirement, he had a ton of money. And so he started playing in these high limit games with

777
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,880
the high limit players at that time. And it was a small group. And he'd come in and play. And the

778
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:26,200
whole group would break for dinner. And we'd all go with Jay to go eat at a restaurant in the

779
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:31,080
mirage. It was at this time, this was before the Bellagio was built, we'd all go eat dinner. And he

780
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:35,080
would sometimes have parties at his house. And we'd go over to the party at his house, or he'd get

781
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,280
invited to somebody else's house. And this was his social life. And he was losing a lot of money,

782
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:46,120
but he was happy. He was having fun. He had this whole group of people. And he got to have this

783
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,680
fun conversation. And he got to learn this game and so on and so forth. And I think this is kind

784
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:55,320
of how he spent the last four or five years of his life. And he was for sure winning to that.

785
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,560
So I feel like people sort of think it all sounds very cutthroat. But it's not. And this is something

786
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,760
that certainly I think that the players in the 90s for sure, we're really thinking about, which

787
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,280
is what's the value add? How are you bringing value for this? We know how they're bringing value to us.

788
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,640
Wow, that's so interesting. I wouldn't have guessed that. But that's a nice symbiosis.

789
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:21,160
There's a really, really famous player named Chip Reese. He sadly passed away about very

790
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:26,680
unexpectedly. He was young, passed away probably about 15 years ago now, maybe the greatest poker

791
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:32,440
mind ever. I mean, certainly one of them. And the thing about chip was he just made everybody happy

792
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,960
around him. He made a ton of money playing backgammon. He made lots of money playing poker. And he had

793
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,080
the superpower of these people who were very negative expectancy, if you were thinking about

794
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:48,360
money, would be calling him up like dying to play with him, because he was nice. It was just a really

795
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:53,800
good time. I think about it as the same thing. Why do you go to a movie? Well, okay, if we just think

796
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,840
about it as money, it seems like a losing proposition. But of course, that's not what we should be really

797
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,960
thinking about that as. And so I think that that gets lost a little bit, as the game grows and

798
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:11,240
becomes really, really, really big. And so if you don't have a particularly good time, and you're sad,

799
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:17,640
and you leave, there's somebody else just to take your place. And I think that that interesting

800
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:23,880
aspect of how it really wasn't very zero sum at all, kind of goes away. I think it's come back a

801
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,680
little bit now, because the poker economy has contracted. And I think they're sort of coming

802
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:33,800
back to that idea of how does this become fun for everybody. It's a really interesting aspect of the

803
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,120
game back then. So when did you figure out you had an act for this? It's hard to say, because I feel

804
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:44,280
like it's all relative. You know, I retired in 2012, and pretty much anything else that I can

805
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:50,360
think of that's competitive. Poker's really changed the ability for people to be able to

806
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:56,120
run batches of hands, for example, after the fact is sort of think, Oh, here is the situation that I

807
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,280
was in. Now I'm going to go and I'm going to run this and sort of see what the right answer would

808
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:05,000
have been, so that I can take that into the next time I play the kind of analytics that people have

809
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,440
the ability for them to discover what the equilibrium point is on a particular decision

810
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:16,840
or whatever. It's just beyond what I can even comprehend. So I left before I would have had to

811
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:23,000
put that work in. If I did put the work in under those conditions, I'm not sure that I would do

812
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,920
well. I mean, I know that if I sat down today without doing that work, I would get completely

813
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,880
crushed. So in that sense, you can look at me and say, well, I didn't have a knack for it. If I tried

814
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,920
to play against today's players who know the things that they know and are able to run the

815
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:43,000
kinds of simulations and analytics that they can run now and their understanding the mathematics

816
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,560
of the game are and sort of what the optionality is. And so you're saying that a professional player

817
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:53,240
today will take every hand of a game and they'll have the simulation after the fact of that hand?

818
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,240
Well, not necessarily every hand, but they can pick hands and they can actually run the same

819
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,240
way that you do it in baseball or I was going to say, this sounds a lot like moneyball, which is

820
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,360
the advent of analytics to the game. Right, exactly. So they can sit there and they can say

821
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,560
they can just set the parameters. If I am in a particular situation where I think that I have to

822
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,600
bluff and if I give you this range of hands, how often do you fold? If I give you this range of

823
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:23,240
hands, how often do you fold? And they can figure out exactly at what point, if I bet a particular

824
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:28,920
amount, am I winning enough to that bet that I can now try to bluff in that situation that maybe I

825
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,680
would have never thought in a million years was the situation that I would be winning to if I were

826
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:38,120
to bluff there because I just didn't have the data. So I feel like knack is such a strange

827
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,440
word because I feel like it's knack relative to what? Well, to your peers at the time. Yeah,

828
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:50,200
so those peers change. So I started playing in Montana. What year is this? Oh my gosh, I started

829
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:55,400
playing, I turned professional in 94. So it's right around that time. And I was playing against

830
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:01,480
people in Montana who a lot of them were retirees who were, this is kind of what they did. Some

831
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:06,440
people have their bridge game or some people are playing golf or some people are playing poker and

832
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,080
and that's kind of what they wanted to do. So while I think that pretty much everybody who plays poker

833
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:18,040
would like to get better and enjoys the game more, some people are more hungry to do that than others

834
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,120
and people are getting different things out of the game and the people that I was playing with

835
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:29,880
that were not thinking, let me become a world-class player. At that time, particularly because I had

836
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:34,680
really great mentors, my understanding of the mathematics of that game was so beyond

837
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:40,600
their understanding. I don't think that was part of their enjoyment. So the day that I stepped into

838
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:46,040
that room, I had a knack, certainly compared to the people that I was playing against. I started

839
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,640
playing two years before that in that game. And that was sort of where I was learning. And then in

840
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:55,640
1994, I decided I was a professional poker player and I moved to Las Vegas and I started playing there.

841
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,640
And this is how many years after the game in New York that or was it only your brother that was

842
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,080
playing? Only my brother was playing in that. Yeah, I never played in New York. I don't think I ever

843
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:08,920
played a hand of poker in New York. So you get to Vegas in 96? No, I got to Vegas in 94. Oh, that was

844
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,480
the declaration of playing pro. Okay, got it. Does it become less fun when it's your job now?

845
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,240
Does it amplify the stakes? Eventually, but no, not at this time. Poker is a really complicated

846
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:26,920
game. Very, very complex. And I know that there's just so much that I don't know about the game. And

847
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,480
I'm totally aware that if I tried to sit down and play against today's players that they would bury

848
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:38,520
me. Because there's this whole layer of the game that I haven't discovered. But while I was

849
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:45,080
particularly in those early years in the 90s, I had started off in Montana playing only limit

850
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:50,200
hold them. Now I go and I start to learn more about that game. So I'm starting to sort of peel

851
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:55,320
back the layers of that game. And like most things that you do, as you peel those layers back, what

852
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,680
you start to see is that there was a whole bunch of stuff underneath it that you didn't even know

853
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,960
existed. Right? So you think that the onion is a certain size and you peel a layer back and you

854
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,960
realize, oh, wait, no, there's like so many more layers under there than I ever could have thought.

855
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,960
I was telling this to somebody the other day, my head of research always says it's his I don't know

856
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,240
if he's paraphrasing somebody or if he coined the term, but the further you get from shore,

857
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:19,080
the deeper the water somebody asked me asked me a question about a topic. I don't remember what it

858
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:24,840
was. But I said, and I wasn't being facetious, I really mean it. I know less about this subject

859
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:29,160
today than I did 10 years ago. And they said, how is that possible? And I said, well, to be

860
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,560
completely accurate, I mean on a relative basis, obviously, in an absolute basis, I know more than

861
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:39,160
I did 10 years ago about subject why. But my knowledge of how much broader it is today

862
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:45,880
has dwarfed my absolute knowledge. So on a relative basis, right? Gone backwards. Yeah,

863
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,480
exactly. That's what's happening. So I'm learning this game limit hold them, learning things about

864
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,960
poker in general. And then I started expanding my repertoire of the types of games that I play. So

865
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:01,720
I start to learn the Omaha games, I start to learn the stud games, I start to learn pot limit

866
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:07,160
and no limit. So those are different betting structures. And I'm immersed. It's like I'm living

867
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:16,040
and breathing and talking poker all the time with peers with mentors, so on and so forth. So it's

868
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:22,680
not really like a job in that sense, certainly not during that first eight or 10 years that I'm

869
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:29,720
playing, I'm learning. And every second is learning. So when did you see sort of robots in the book,

870
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:35,320
but you also figure out it seems pretty early that there are at the risk of oversimplifying

871
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:42,360
two different types of players, or the players who when they win, it's because of how well they've

872
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:48,840
done things when they lose, it's because of bad luck. And that's basically the narrative. And you

873
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:53,960
seem and I get I don't know how quickly you came to this understanding. But at some point, you seem

874
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,960
to come to the understanding of wait a minute, sometimes I'm winning when I make the wrong bet.

875
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,440
And sometimes I'm losing when I make the right bet. And that last one, by the way, must be a hard

876
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,600
pill to swallow, you end up sort of in your own mind formulating a very common tool we use today,

877
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:17,400
which is this decision matrix of that I use the right process, yes or no, did I get the right

878
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:23,800
outcome, yes or no, that's a lovely two by two. But it's one that you have two squares of that

879
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:28,600
two by two never get talked about, which are the ones that are at odds with each other.

880
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:34,440
Let me really dig into something you just said. So I agree that we're not seeing the whole two by two.

881
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,760
Where I'm going to quibble is this, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what you said was,

882
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:45,800
you could have made really good decisions, like and had a good situation and ended up having a

883
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,800
bad outcome. And that's the really hard pill to swallow. And I actually think it's the reverse.

884
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,240
To me, I think that's the story you tell when you're opening your book, which bringing it back

885
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:01,000
to the swing on Patriots is when the tables are turned, right? It's the Pete Carroll pass call

886
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:07,480
on the two yard line or whatever in the Super Bowl that gets intercepted, which, again,

887
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:13,480
by all metrics, if you looked at this, like you were a robot looking at reams of data,

888
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,880
the outcome of that call was positive. That should have been a touchdown.

889
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,440
Right. That's a question of resulting. When we're evaluating other people's decisions,

890
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:27,000
particularly people that we don't compare to, particularly in a situation where the decision

891
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:34,040
is complicated, we have this simplifier, the shortcut called resulting. So what we do is we

892
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:39,000
say, if I know what the quality of the outcome is, I can work backwards from that to the quality of

893
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,360
the decision. So this is what happens to Pete Carroll. It's the last play of Super Bowl 2015.

894
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,520
Everybody expects he's down by four to the Patriots as always. It's always the Patriots

895
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,640
back to the beginning of the conversation. At any rate, everybody thinks he's going to

896
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:58,520
hand the ball off to Marshawn Lynch. Instead, he has Russell Wilson, the quarterback pass the ball.

897
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:04,440
This is very unexpected. The math is very, very complicated here. There's some game theory in

898
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,360
there. There's options theory, all sorts of things that people are interested in reading about it.

899
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:13,080
They can go look at Benjamin Morris on 538. Suffice it to say it is a good play. We'll link

900
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,840
to all of this in our show notes, by the way, because we love nerding out on this exact sort

901
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:23,240
of background. So he passes the ball. It's intercepted. They lose the Super Bowl this way.

902
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:29,960
Malcolm Butler, my hero. Just, I mean, I can't imagine. Can you imagine what I was doing to my

903
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:38,520
TV? I remember looking at my daughter going ear muffs and it was like, yeah, I mean, I am

904
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,440
screaming. My wife's like, all right, I'm going to take the kids out. I'm like, yeah, yeah,

905
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:47,000
that's fine. Yeah, exactly. So this is what we do. The thing about understanding the quality

906
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,080
of the decision, it's complex. It's really hard. You need to know a whole bunch of different things.

907
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:59,960
You need to know, given the decision that was made, what were the possible outcomes? How often

908
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:04,840
would those outcomes occur? If you think about what are the consequences of each of those outcomes,

909
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,440
how much do I prefer each of those outcomes? So I can understand what the probability of getting

910
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:13,720
a preferred outcome is. If I have an outcome that I don't prefer, like an interception, like how

911
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:18,920
often does that happen? And then you also have to compare it, do that exact process with the other

912
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,720
possibilities, the other decisions that you could have made. And now actually compare to see how do

913
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:27,080
I get the highest expected value, the highest chance of actually winning the Super Bowl.

914
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,960
And it's all very complicated and involves what's the interception rate, which people don't know

915
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,640
off the top of their head. Or you have to think about if there's only 26 seconds left,

916
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:43,080
how do I get three plays off instead of two? And it's very hard. Suffice it to say, if you pass

917
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:48,440
the ball either on the first or the second play there, because it's second down 26 seconds and 11

918
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:55,480
one time out, if you pass the ball on either the first or second play, it means that you can do that

919
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:00,440
plus hand the ball off to March on Lynch. If all you do is hand the ball off to March on Lynch

920
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:06,120
twice, you don't get that third play. That third play is incredibly valuable. And the cost of the

921
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,960
third play is whatever the interception rate is. And the interception rate there is less than 2%.

922
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,520
And there's a time management piece to it as well. A pass that is not caught is an immediate time

923
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:21,800
stop. You could have a bizarre scenario under which you hand it off to March on Lynch. It turns

924
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,720
into a bit of a scrum. You have to burn one of your timeouts. Well, you're going to have to no

925
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:31,080
matter what. You only have one left if I recall. Right. So you have one left. So that's why if you

926
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:36,760
hand it off to March on Lynch on the first two plays, assuming the first one fails, that's the

927
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:42,360
end of your time out. So because you can get the clock to naturally stop on a pass, that's why

928
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,840
if you pass on the first or second play, you can get three plays instead of two. But that's all

929
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:52,920
very complex. So what we tend to do in those situations is we say that's all really hard.

930
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:58,360
And I don't know what any of that is. And it's all very opaque to me. So if I understand what

931
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:03,080
the quality of the outcome is, was it good or bad in this particular case, it was disastrous.

932
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,920
Then I know what the quality of the decision is. So that's what's happening in that Pete

933
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:12,840
Carroll thing. That's called resulting. Resulting is a heuristics simplifier works really well in

934
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:18,280
chess. If I lose to you in chess, I played worse than you works very poorly in poker. If I lose

935
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:23,960
to you in poker, who knows? And certainly very poorly in football, we don't really know depending

936
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:29,160
on how the play worked out, whether it was a good or bad decision. But what's interesting is that

937
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:36,280
people don't do this resulting thing in situations where they feel like the quality of the decision

938
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:42,440
is known. And I say feel like because in quotes, right, because they don't necessarily know it.

939
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,200
But remember that what I said is resulting is a simplifier, the quality of the decision,

940
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,360
it's complicated, it's hard to figure out. So what happens when we feel like we do know the quality

941
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:57,560
of the decision. So I'll give you an example. If I come home one day, and I say to you,

942
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:04,680
I got in a car accident. Do you know if it's my fault or not? No clue. And you won't use the

943
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:09,960
fact that I got in a car accident to work backwards like you do with Pete Carroll,

944
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:15,080
because you understand that there are certain things that really are knowable about driving.

945
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:20,760
And you can ask me what those are? Did you break the rules of the road? Were you drinking? You can

946
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,640
ask me a whole bunch of things. So there's all sorts of places like that, where we feel like we

947
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:30,680
understand what the decision quality is. And so if we have a bad outcome, we actually tolerate it.

948
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:35,720
This occurs all the time in business as well, right? If somebody makes a decision,

949
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:42,680
let's say they execute on a decision that was made in a committee, where the whole team agreed

950
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:49,560
that this was the right way to go. And then it doesn't work out. People aren't like, idiot,

951
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:56,840
but if they do something on their own, that is not something that everybody always does,

952
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,960
then all of a sudden, if it doesn't work out, they're really under the gun. So we have this

953
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:08,440
issue of transparency that occurs. So now let me get back to this roundabout way. So first of all,

954
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,280
let me just give you a good example of the transparency problem. Okay, bear with me on

955
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:19,080
this thought experiment for a second. You don't have ways it's broken. And you're driving to the

956
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:26,200
airport with your spouse. Obviously, you have to get there in time. And you get in the car and you

957
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:32,440
go the normal way that you go, that you've always gone. And something happens or a big accident on

958
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:38,600
the road. And your car is not moving. And you get to the airport and you just missed your flight.

959
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,240
Are you getting blamed for that? Is that your fault? Is your spouse mad at you? No, not in my

960
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:47,640
case. I can imagine in some people's cases, but mostly, no, it doesn't feel like it. Okay, so now

961
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,720
you get in your car again, you don't have ways, whatever your phone's broken, you get in your car

962
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:59,000
and you announce to your spouse, I have a shortcut. I was just talking to Morgan over there and they

963
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,320
told me about this great shortcut. So I'm going to take the shortcut because I've checked it out.

964
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:08,600
I looked on a map that's better. And now you go to the airport and there is an accident. Car is

965
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:14,520
not moving. You make it to the airport and you've just missed your flight. Is your spouse mad at you?

966
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:20,120
Again, mine would not because she's superhuman. But yes, I think many people in that situation

967
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,520
are absolutely getting yelled at. By the way, that's a superhuman spouse. It's like, I cannot

968
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:29,480
believe your stupid shortcut. So this is one of those cases where, so we have this come up all

969
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:36,360
the time and it comes up in so many different ways. It comes up in medicine all the time.

970
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,720
Because that's such a great example, right? If Marshawn Lynch had been handed the ball and he

971
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:45,720
had fumbled the ball, same exact outcome, people would be pissed at Lynch. Nobody would be pissed

972
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,800
at Pete Carroll. That is exactly right. And they might not even be pissed at Marshawn Lynch. They

973
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,760
might just think that the Patriots line is too good. Yeah, the safety or whoever came and stripped

974
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:59,400
the ball out was just exceptional. Right. And why is that? What's the difference? Because in both

975
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,520
cases, you expected versus not expected. Expected versus not expected. And this comes up, I guarantee

976
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:09,000
this comes up in your business all the time. It comes up in your personal life all the time.

977
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,280
It's one of the reasons why, for example, if someone's really unhappy in their job,

978
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,360
they won't be aggressive enough about going and finding another position. And the reason is that

979
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,560
the unhappiness in their job is now sort of become expected. Like they're not really blaming themselves

980
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,680
for that. But if they go and find a new position, and they're not happy there, they're going to feel

981
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,040
like it's their fault as an example. This happens in business strategy. This is the way that teams

982
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:39,080
end up operating, so on, so forth. Okay, so this becomes a really big problem. So every human being

983
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,960
understands this difference between kind of transparent and opaque decisions. Now, here's my

984
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:51,160
question for you. What decisions do you think are the most transparent to you? Your own. These have

985
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:58,680
the most transparency to us. So what happens with our own decisions is that we allow uncertainty

986
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:05,400
to bubble to the surface as the explanation for a bad outcome more often than we would for somebody

987
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:10,440
else's decisions. Why? Because we feel like we know what the quality of our decision is, number one,

988
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:15,240
and number two, we don't really want to question the quality of our decision. So you can think about

989
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:19,480
that sort of in general, do you hand it off to March on Lynch or do you pass it is a question of

990
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:25,960
when are we allowing uncertainty as the explanation for a poor outcome. So it's innovative, unexpected,

991
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:32,120
opaque, all of those things. We don't allow the uncertainty in the door. But when we feel like we

992
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,800
know, because obviously you're supposed to hand it off to March on Lynch, now we let uncertainty

993
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:41,400
into the door. We do this for ourselves as well. So now this brings me full circle to this thing

994
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:48,040
about when we think about this matrix. And you say, well, you might make a really good decision and

995
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:53,320
have a bad outcome. That's the most painful. You said, by the way, that's just my subjective

996
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:57,800
overlay. I don't know that there's any decision making expert out there that would argue one way

997
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,720
or the other. I think that people do think that so I just want to sort of pick at something. So let's

998
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,440
just start again. So what you said was there are these two quadrants, right? We would think of as

999
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:12,200
discordant. Right. So one of them is you make a bad decision, but you get the right outcome,

1000
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,680
you get the right outcome. And then you said even more painful is you make a good decision,

1001
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:21,960
you get a bad outcome. Now, what I think is interesting is that I would actually argue

1002
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:27,800
that that doesn't have a lot of pain associated with it. And let me explain why. Imagine you're

1003
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:32,280
looking at this in the aftermath of the outcome. Okay, so in one case, you've gotten a good outcome

1004
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,760
in one case, you've gotten a bad outcome. So let me ask you to do the thought experiment. Where do

1005
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:43,160
you want to dig in more? If you get a good outcome, are you looking to dig in to try to find out if

1006
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,400
you made a bad decision that resulted in that good outcome? Or are you just being like, good outcome,

1007
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:53,160
yay me. But if you have a bad outcome, are you eager? Honestly, I think it depends like using

1008
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:59,160
sports as an example, I think is a different example versus in medicine. So I've talked about

1009
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:04,040
this before on the podcast in medicine, there's a, or at least in surgery, there's a conference

1010
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:09,400
that's typically done called the morbidity and mortality conference, where you, as the name

1011
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:14,520
suggests, every week, you discuss all the morbidities and all the mortalities of the previous week.

1012
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:23,720
And so that is an objective definition. A person can basically arrive dead in the hospital from,

1013
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:28,280
let's say a gunshot wound, they still get presented in the conference, even though,

1014
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,520
let's say you did nothing, they literally showed up in the emergency remuted CPR for a minute,

1015
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,880
they were all basically already dead in the call time of death, that still shows up,

1016
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,040
even though there's no blame to be assigned within the confines of how medicine was practiced.

1017
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:44,600
So those ones don't get a lot of discussion. The ones that get a lot of discussion are,

1018
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:50,760
you made a decision that seemed like the right decision at the time, and it seems defensible,

1019
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:56,200
but the outcome was bad. Now, of course, as you've alluded to, these are so complicated,

1020
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:59,880
because there's still the luck component, there's all these other things that go into it.

1021
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,720
So I guess if your question is, where do you learn the most, versus what causes the most

1022
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:09,800
consternation, those aren't necessarily the same, are they? The point that I'm making is not so much

1023
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,640
about where do you learn the most, because I think you learn from all four quadrants.

1024
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,480
And it's really important to learn from all four quadrants, right? I made a good decision,

1025
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:22,040
I got a good outcome, I'd like to understand when I have made a good decision that has

1026
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:27,320
a really good expected value, and I want to be able to see that I want to understand when I made

1027
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,640
a bad decision that had a bad outcome, and where I had negative expected value, and then I can

1028
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:35,320
understand that so I can adjust my decision making going forward. And likewise, I'd like to understand

1029
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,800
when I made a bad decision that had a good outcome and vice versa. What you just described

1030
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:45,640
is actually the whole shebang in terms of the reinforcement of this bad kind of thinking,

1031
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:51,800
because what I'm guessing does not occur every week is the wow, this patient did way better than

1032
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:56,680
expected, but we made the wrong decision. Let's have a conference about that. So let me give you

1033
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,440
a super simple example to try to get at this, because I think that this is actually a really

1034
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:08,600
big problem, particularly as I feel like now people have now understood the importance of

1035
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:14,840
process language. So if we think about any business movie from the 1980s, they're like,

1036
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:19,560
I'm results driven, right? Now, now you sort of look back at that, and you're a little horrified,

1037
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,240
because I think we all understand that we don't want to be results oriented, we kind of get that

1038
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:28,680
that's a problem. And we'd all like to aspire to be Sam Hinkie and trust the process. And we know

1039
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:33,640
we're supposed to say process, process, process. But here's the problem. So now let's do this as a

1040
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:42,840
two by two. Okay, you have a status quo decision, the expected decision, a consensus decision.

1041
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:49,800
And you have a good outcome. Is anybody hailing you as the biggest genius of all time? No,

1042
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:57,160
but they're saying good job. You have a status quo decision that has a bad outcome. Is anybody

1043
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:03,640
excoriating you? No, they're saying tough luck. What could you do? You have an unexpected,

1044
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:12,440
an opaque, a non status quo, a non consensus decision that has a good outcome. And they're

1045
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:18,280
hailing you as the biggest genius of all time. You have a non status quo decision that has a

1046
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,840
bad outcome. And everybody's calling you an idiot. So people understand this. So now let's think about

1047
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:29,880
what does that do to somebody's decision making? Well, first of all, they want to avoid the bad

1048
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:34,040
outcome. This is where loss aversion comes in, right? We don't want to be the idiot. That's the

1049
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:39,560
one quadrant that you want to avoid. Right. Well, in general, we want to avoid the whole right side

1050
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:44,600
of the table because the right side of the table contains the idiot section. So let's think about

1051
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:50,520
how can we avoid the whole right side of the table? Well, one way we can avoid sort of the bad

1052
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:57,640
outcomes altogether is to kind of fall down on the not deciding thing, just sort of not doing

1053
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:04,520
anything that's going to cause a big loss or a big win. Either you could do it by omission, you could

1054
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,960
sort of not act, you could make very, very low volatility choices, there's things that you could

1055
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:16,280
do there to play these strategies. The other thing that you can do, so you can avoid deciding at all,

1056
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:21,320
or you can make sure that you're making things that don't really create big losses. So you're

1057
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:26,920
not going to end up in the room. But the other way to deal with that whole right side is to focus on

1058
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:32,600
the lower right quadrant and say, I never want to be the idiot in the room. And so therefore, I'm

1059
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:38,840
going to make status quo decisions. So let's think about this. For example, it doesn't matter if 80%

1060
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,760
or so of ear infections are viral. If a patient comes into my office, I'm giving them antibiotics,

1061
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,120
I don't want to get yelled at. If this happens to be the time, I want to be able to cover my butt.

1062
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:56,040
And that way, nobody can yell at me. So now let's think about this. So what ends up happening is that

1063
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:02,040
we want people to be thinking, I just want to make the best decisions. And I don't really want to be

1064
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:08,120
afraid of the bad outcomes. I particularly don't want people to be afraid of this idiot quadrant,

1065
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:12,920
because we would like people to be innovative. And we'd like them to be thinking outside the box.

1066
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:17,560
And we'd like them to sort of push against what the status quo is, because that's how, obviously,

1067
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:24,200
we move forward as a society, as a business, as an individual. But this is what happens. Everybody

1068
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:30,200
has a morbidity conference. So even if in the morbidity conference, you're talking about process,

1069
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:35,800
you're in the room because of morbidity. So everybody knows I get in the room because of

1070
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:41,160
something bad. So here's a simple thought experiment that I use. Imagine that we're

1071
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,240
investing in real estate, like we have a real estate investing group. And we have a model of

1072
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:51,080
the market, obviously, and we have limited resources that we can deploy. And so we invest

1073
01:34:51,080 --> 01:35:00,440
in a particular project, and it ends up doing 15% worse than we expected. We're all in a room. Now,

1074
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:06,600
we might be in that room talking about our model. True. We might be in the room talking about our

1075
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:13,240
decision process. But we're having a long meeting in a room about the fact that the project did 15%

1076
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:18,040
worse than we expected. Now we do the exact same thing. We invest in this particular project,

1077
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:24,520
and it does 15% better than expected. Is the same conversation happening? No. So I don't care how

1078
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,600
much the word process comes out of your mouth. Everybody knows they're supposed to be afraid of

1079
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:34,040
bad outcomes, then. And here's the really big problem. And it's true, we can talk about it in

1080
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,800
terms of medicine as well. But this particular thought experiment that has to do with the real

1081
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:42,680
estate, it matters just as much as if you overestimated the market, which is how you'd end up

1082
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:50,120
15% on the downside, than if you've underestimated the market. Because your goal is to efficiently

1083
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:55,960
allocate your resources within the market that you're allocating the resources in. And if your

1084
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:00,280
model is wrong, I don't care if it's wrong, if it's underestimating or overestimating, that's a

1085
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:06,760
problem for efficient allocation of resources. Not only that, but when it's 15% to the good,

1086
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:12,120
it's a signal that there may be risk that you didn't identify. So for example, you could have

1087
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,440
the mean, right? But you may have the variant, that's a really big problem, because that has

1088
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:22,680
really big implications for what percentage of your bankroll, or of the total money that you have,

1089
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,680
the total capital that you have that you're supposed to deploy to that particular project.

1090
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,360
That's a very important point, by the way, which doesn't, I think, get talked about enough, even

1091
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:36,440
in that circle, which is people are very fixated on return on capital, but they generally aren't as

1092
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:42,040
appreciative of risk adjusted return on capital. So Ray Rock versus Rock is this concept that seems to

1093
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,880
be missing from the way a lot of people think about that. So it's good that you brought that

1094
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,520
point up, because there could be a number of problems with that issue. Maybe you didn't

1095
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:55,320
allocate enough, maybe you allocated the right amount or too much, it didn't appreciate what

1096
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,800
was at risk. Right, exactly. So we want to be seeing those signals, right? Because we'd like

1097
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:04,920
to understand if we underestimated the vol. And in both cases, your model could be totally right,

1098
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:09,080
and you can just be a couple standard deviations away, or there's a variety of reasons on that

1099
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:14,280
particular time that it could have come in low or high, that don't have anything to do with your

1100
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:19,000
model. But you kind of want to dig in either way, because it's something unexpected happened.

1101
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,920
The other thing, by the way, that happens is that when you have a downside event, and you do get in

1102
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:29,080
the room, people rarely asked, should we have done worse? They asked, could we have done better?

1103
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:35,000
And now again, you're reinforcing for people, I care when things go badly, when things go badly,

1104
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:41,880
I want to avoid them. Now poker happens to be this very pure place, where should I have done worse,

1105
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,680
regardless of whether I won or lost is actually a very important question. Because sometimes,

1106
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:53,160
you have a hand, I'm thinking about what you have. And let's say that I put you in a range where

1107
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:58,600
you're very weak. And I feel that I'm very strong in comparison to you. So because you're weak,

1108
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:04,200
I'm playing the hand, we would call it slow or small, where I'm you're trying to draw as much

1109
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:08,360
out. Right, which means that I'm not betting really big. Now at the end of the hand, you hit a lucky

1110
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,840
card at the end of the hand, the very last card, I end up losing the hand. But when we turn the

1111
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:18,200
hands over, it turns out that you were much stronger than I thought. In this case, I should

1112
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:24,520
have lost more. Because yes, you hit a lucky card, but I should have been extracting much more money

1113
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,840
from you because you would have tolerated it had I had your hand right. Now it may turn out that

1114
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,640
there was no way for me to get your hand right. But I'm supposed to explore that. Because now what

1115
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:39,000
I know is that if I knew what your cards were, I would have lost a lot more money than I did,

1116
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,800
that I actually played the hand very poorly. For what the hand was that you actually had,

1117
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:48,840
I actually underplayed my hand. And that story, that example you use, I think to me is one of the

1118
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:54,920
best examples of why the title of the book makes sense, which is this isn't a book about poker,

1119
01:38:54,920 --> 01:39:01,000
actually. It's a book that uses poker as a model system. So for example, let's talk about biology.

1120
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:08,200
Why do we do so much biology in C. elegans, a worm, or in this type of a mouse or this yeast? Do we

1121
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:15,800
care that much about mice and yeast and worms? No, they are model systems that allow us to do

1122
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:20,920
things in cleaner ways. And I think that's sort of the beauty of poker, which for the listener,

1123
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:24,920
they might think they're talking about poker so much. Why? Well, I think you have to understand

1124
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:30,760
enough about poker to understand what you just said. Because what you just said is it's not often

1125
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:37,400
in life we will get that much clarity after the fact, but we can still bring that level of critical

1126
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:43,240
thought to our decisions. To me, that is the, if you remember nothing else from this podcast,

1127
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:47,960
this is the part I'd want someone to remember. I think of poker as the C. elegans of decision

1128
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:52,440
making in life. That's going to be my... I love that. That's great. And we can think about this

1129
01:39:52,440 --> 01:40:01,000
on the winning side as well, right? Like I could win a hand from you where I really should have won

1130
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:07,320
a lot less. Again, if I had had perfect information, I shouldn't have actually won as much as I did.

1131
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,520
Because for example, I could misread your hand and I could play a hand really strongly. And then I

1132
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:19,080
can be the one who hits a lucky card. And actually, if I had perfect information, I would not have ever

1133
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:25,000
put that much money at risk. So we want to explore whether the outcome is good or bad, we want to have

1134
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,720
equanimity toward the direction that we're exploring. Could I have gotten even more out of you?

1135
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:33,320
Could I have done even better? Could I have done worse? And the other thing that besides that

1136
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:36,760
direction, by the way, is we want to think orthogonally, like maybe you lost for reasons

1137
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:41,080
that had nothing to do with your decision process, or maybe you won for reasons that you

1138
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:47,240
totally didn't predict. This happens in financial markets all the time, you invest in a say a company,

1139
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,640
because you think that a particular product of theirs is going to do gangbusters or something.

1140
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,960
And then that product fails, but they happen to acquire another company. By the way, don't take

1141
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:02,360
credit for that, if that wasn't in your model, but you happen to have won. So we want to be thinking

1142
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:09,480
up down orthogonal in all these directions. So now here becomes the problem. We know that people

1143
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:14,440
don't like to be in this bottom white crunch. They don't like to be in this place of, okay,

1144
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:19,160
something really bad happened. And if they do get in that something really bad happened place,

1145
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:25,000
they want to be able to say, but it's not my fault. It's a bad luck situation. It's like,

1146
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,400
well, my decision process was good, and everybody had consensus. And I handed the ball off to

1147
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,920
Marshawn Lynch, what could I do? That was what I was supposed to do. So you're driving people into

1148
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:39,160
this place where they're very likely to be trying to build consensus, not necessarily of the good

1149
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:45,000
kind, right of the false kind, they may be using data, not to find the truth, but to tell a data

1150
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,560
story that supports them in case they happen to get into the room. So we really like to say the

1151
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:54,600
data told us so they may just be doing what everybody has always done. They may be slow to

1152
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:59,880
decide because they need buy-in or the right kind of sign off too often, or they need a higher level

1153
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:03,800
of certainty than they really should in order to make the decision. All sorts of bad things come

1154
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:08,840
out of this. And what really ends up coming out of it is that people tend to move slowly. They tend

1155
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:14,200
to default toward omissions versus commissions. In other words, not deciding versus deciding.

1156
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:19,560
And they tend not to like to innovate too much. Now, is this my guess is there's a different

1157
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,880
propensity for this across different fields. So for example, have you ever had a chance to talk to

1158
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:28,040
Pete Carroll? I haven't. Just thinking about everything you said, it would be very interesting

1159
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:32,440
to have that discussion with him and say it'd be hard for him to do this, but go back in time to

1160
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:37,000
before you made that decision. I'm pretty sure the only thing Pete Carroll was thinking about was

1161
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:45,000
winning. I can't imagine there was even an ounce of thought in his mind that said, whatever decision

1162
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,600
I make, I want to make sure it's defensible at the press conference. I just can't imagine he would

1163
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:52,440
have thought that, right? I agree. And I think that's what makes Pete Carroll such a great coach.

1164
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:56,920
I was just about to say, but wouldn't you see more Pete Carroll like thinking in something like

1165
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:04,040
sports or is it less about sports and more about being the head coach versus the defensive coordinator

1166
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:09,720
who in the end is still making a very important decision, but answers to a coach. Of course,

1167
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:13,560
the coach answers to the owner, but I'm not sure I'm articulating the question well.

1168
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,040
I actually think that you are. So first of all, we know across the NFL that the slowness to adopt

1169
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:24,120
the analytics has been remarkable. And that's because in this particular case, the people who

1170
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:31,080
are judging you are going to be like the GMs or the fans or that kind of thing. And if they're

1171
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:35,800
judging you, they're going to be judging you for the unusual decisions. So I think actually,

1172
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:41,480
if we go to Bella check, we can kind of see if we go back to this idea of this feeling of

1173
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:47,320
transparency, people are forgiving when there's a feeling of transparency. So if you're Pete Carroll,

1174
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,480
at that point in his career, people are much more likely and remember, even with him,

1175
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:57,640
they really bashed him, but they're much more likely to sort of give you the benefit of the doubt.

1176
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:03,080
So I actually saw a great talk by Toby Moskowitz. He's really interesting guy. There's a lot of

1177
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:08,840
stuff in sports analytics and quant and this kind of thing. And he was talking about Bella check.

1178
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:13,560
And he said, when you look at his decision making, when he was with the Browns, it was dismal compared

1179
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:19,560
to the analytics. And it's not actually until he wins two Super Bowls, that you start to see this

1180
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:25,320
decision making that's really starting to align with the analytics. It's really starting to be like,

1181
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:30,360
I don't care if nobody's going to understand this decision. I'm Bill Belichick, and that's the

1182
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:35,240
decision going to make, but it's after two Super Bowls that he gets there. Why? Because the fans

1183
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,960
are now tolerant of it. They're willing to tolerate the stuff that they don't understand. Why did you

1184
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,960
go out for it? I'm fourth and five there. What would that's insane? No, well, because you're

1185
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:49,800
Bella check. So what we want to think about is when we think about these, what you said,

1186
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:55,880
the morbidity conference, what is that encouraging in the people that you're trying to lead?

1187
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:03,480
You're encouraging the behavior that they naturally bend toward, which is I want to stay out of this

1188
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:10,680
lower right quadrant. So I don't want anything bad to happen to me. But if it does happen to me,

1189
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:15,800
I'm going to make sure there's so much CIA there that it's going to be okay, that nobody's going

1190
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:21,320
to sit there and say, I made a crazy decision. And you're doing that because you're not, you're not

1191
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:25,160
exploring both directions, but particularly because you're not getting in the room when something

1192
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:30,760
unexpectedly good happens. And here's the issue. When something unexpectedly good happens, there's

1193
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:36,200
so much to learn from that. Is that different by the way, than when something good happens

1194
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:41,000
that shouldn't have happened based on what people didn't know. Now I'm getting sort of Rumsfeldian a

1195
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,720
bit, but okay, I'm making this up. So this could be complete nonsense. So I'm hoping you'll be able

1196
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:51,080
to come up with a real example. Remember the whole Y2K thing? Everybody thought, oh my God,

1197
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:54,680
this could be a free for all, but it turned out to be the biggest nothing burger in the history of

1198
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:59,720
civilization. Like I have friends in college whose entire job after college was getting ready for

1199
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:04,920
Y2K. So nothing happened. Fine. Now there's two ways nothing happened. One is nothing happened

1200
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,640
because there was really nothing going on. And we just didn't understand that. And we did a whole

1201
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,320
bunch of stuff to be prepared for it. And in the end, it didn't matter. There's another thing,

1202
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:17,720
which is, Oh no, it was a real problem. And all of that work that was done to make sure airplanes

1203
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:22,520
didn't fall out of the sky, it worked. Those are kind of different. And I'm using the problem there

1204
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:26,120
was there's work involved versus decision being made. So maybe this isn't a great example. I guess

1205
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:32,120
what I'm trying to get at is you can have great outcomes because there was going to be a great

1206
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:37,240
outcome regardless of your decision. And then you can have great outcomes where you actually made

1207
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:41,240
the wrong decision and you got the right outcome. And then there's, you made the right decision and

1208
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,160
the right outcome. I'm almost wondering, like, are there other historical examples in wars? I'm

1209
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:49,880
trying to think of like D-Day was that invasion on that day, the right thing to do? I mean,

1210
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:54,280
history will forever be changed as a result of it in the right direction. But has anyone ever

1211
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:59,000
gone back and said, well, you know what, based on the weather pattern, like Eisenhower got lucky

1212
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,680
that shouldn't have worked that day. And that was the wrong decision. They should have waited a day

1213
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:08,360
or something to that effect. Yes. So number one, with Y2K, there's a fourth thing that you can say.

1214
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:14,040
So I agree with all three things that you pointed out, it could have been good decision, good outcome.

1215
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:19,240
It could have been, it would have happened no matter what we did. And so we were irrelevant.

1216
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,760
It could be that we had a good outcome and it was all sort of a waste of time. So it was a

1217
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:27,160
bad decision to do anything. It could be it doesn't really matter. Because when you sort of

1218
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:32,600
look at what the range of possibilities were given the unknown information, the downside was so bad

1219
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:37,640
that you were actually supposed to protect against that regardless. And were you going to waste a

1220
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:41,480
whole bunch of human productivity doing it? Well, it's not really a waste because it just acts as a

1221
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:45,720
hedge against just in case it's the worst case scenario. And in particular with something like

1222
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:51,320
that, we would want to protect ourselves against that. But unless you dig into the win, you don't

1223
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:57,240
find that stuff out. And I think that that's where the problem is. So with the Eisenhower example,

1224
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:02,840
what you said, it's such a great model for how do we think about our own outcomes in our own lives.

1225
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:08,280
So this is what tends to happen to us. And this is why I was saying, Oh, it's actually not painful

1226
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:13,560
at all when you have a bad outcome to go in and look, it's what we naturally do. Something horrible

1227
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:18,920
happens to me. I'm looking in there, I'm trying to find all the luck in there. I'm exploring what

1228
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:23,880
were my other options? Was there something else that could have worked out better? How often was

1229
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:29,080
that decision going to work out poorly? And I'm so excited. I'm so excited to go in and discover

1230
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:34,520
that I didn't do anything wrong. I'm looking for that when it's a bad outcome, when it's a good

1231
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:41,480
outcome. When we land on the beaches of Normandy, and it's a pivot point in the war, and we win,

1232
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:47,800
people aren't looking as hard to try to figure out to really explore the counterfactuals. Well,

1233
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:52,440
what if I had done this? What if I had done this? What if, what if it had turned out this way?

1234
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:58,520
So one of the first steps to being a really good decision maker, because we have this asymmetry in

1235
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:03,800
how willing we are to explore these outcomes. And it's what you just said, it's we're all living our

1236
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:08,680
lives having a morbidity conference. Now, the morbidity conference that we're having in our

1237
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:13,320
head is specifically to go find the luck in the whole thing. But that's the only conference we're

1238
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:19,000
having. We're never having the my life is great conference, let me go figure out if that's because

1239
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,240
of my own decision making, or because of luck, or if there was a better way, or I could have actually

1240
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:27,640
opened up a whole other set of outcomes. Like nobody's, nobody's doing that. That is such an

1241
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:33,560
interesting point. You are so correct in that. And as you're telling that story, I'm thinking of a

1242
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:37,720
sort of silly example in my life. But it's one that anyone who knows me knows I take very seriously,

1243
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:43,400
which is how much I love archery. And I shoot a lot. So when I am not in New York, obviously,

1244
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:48,760
when I'm back in San Diego, I'm shooting constantly. And I'm always trying to push the limit of my

1245
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:54,680
capabilities, which means you're losing arrows, you're just invariably if you're 60 70 yards away,

1246
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,840
trying to hit something the size of a softball, you're going to miss every once in a while.

1247
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:03,720
I'm generally losing an arrow to the tune of one a day. Now, these arrows are very expensive. So this

1248
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:11,480
is becoming quite a problem. Every one I've missed, I can tell you 100 reasons why. And not bad luck.

1249
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:19,080
I can tell you the mistake I've made. I don't think I've once ever given thought to the perfect shots.

1250
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:27,320
I don't think I've ever spent time thinking about that ever. I think 90% of my energy goes into

1251
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:31,720
thinking about the 10% of the shots I didn't like. And I thought that's the right way to do it. Isn't

1252
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,800
that making me a better shooter? What I'm hearing you say is that's part of making you a better

1253
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:40,120
shooter. It's also going to encourage I mean, if you think about sort of societally, if it's the

1254
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:44,760
bad outcomes that are triggering the dives, first of all, you're losing half of the opportunities

1255
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:49,720
to learn if not more than half because you might even be making more positive outcomes than less.

1256
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:54,920
Right, right. Well, let's assume that the chances of having an unexpectedly good outcome are

1257
01:50:54,920 --> 01:51:01,960
symmetric. And let's make it that the thing that triggers us doing a dive is that it's unexpected.

1258
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:06,760
And you can decide if it's like a one standard deviation away or the standard deviation and a

1259
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:11,080
half or whatever it is, we can decide and that would obviously depend on the uncertainty and how

1260
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:15,240
much ball there is and so on and so forth. But we'd figure that out. And let's assume it's symmetric.

1261
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:19,400
So by only digging into the downside, we're doing two things. One is we're losing half of our

1262
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:24,920
opportunities to learn. And the second thing is that we're reinforcing the risk aversion.

1263
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:29,640
We're saying, hey, what we really care about is downside outcomes, so you better avoid those.

1264
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:35,640
And three is we're completely quashing anybody ever doing anything unexpected, where, because

1265
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:39,400
if you do something unexpected, the chances that somebody is going to allow for luck or that you

1266
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:43,560
yourself are going to allow for luck is the explanation is just going to kind of go poof.

1267
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:47,640
And we don't like that. So there's all sorts of bad stuff that comes out of it. So when we get

1268
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:52,920
an outcome, we want to basically do what you were just doing with the beaches of Normandy,

1269
01:51:52,920 --> 01:52:00,040
which is to say, here's the outcome. Before I make any conclusions about it, let me think about

1270
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,520
what are the other possible things that could have occurred. So I have to think about what are the

1271
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:10,840
things that didn't happen, but could have those counterfactuals. And then I need to think about

1272
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:15,080
what was my preference for those things? How much did I like each of those things? And how often

1273
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:19,240
were those things going to happen? So it's just basically thinking about what was the payoff for

1274
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:24,040
those things, obviously compare those to cost, but let's just simplify it. What were the possibilities?

1275
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:30,040
What were my preferences for those possibilities? And what was the probability of each of those

1276
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:35,640
possibilities occurring? And then, so that's the first step with the beaches of Normandy,

1277
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:40,280
it ended up being a particular way. But given that they decided to do what they did on that

1278
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:44,760
particular day, what are the other ways that it could have turned out with what probability would

1279
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:48,760
have that have turned out and how much would we have liked or those things, depending on what our

1280
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:54,440
goal was, which in this case was to win the war. And then now we can take that and we can iterate

1281
01:52:54,440 --> 01:53:01,240
it and say, what if they had waited two days? What if they had done it two days before? What if they

1282
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:05,640
had done it in a different way, they had gone from land instead of sea? Now we can start thinking

1283
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:12,200
about if they had chosen other options, then how would that have compared in terms of what the

1284
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:17,080
expected value was for the option that they actually chose? And you can do this for anything.

1285
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:21,560
So you can do this for the archery. I assume that a bullseye is pretty unexpected. At certain ranges,

1286
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:25,560
it's more surprising than it is not. Right. What you can say is you could actually go in and start

1287
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:30,680
forecasting it. I'm going in at a particular range, given what I think that my skill level is,

1288
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:34,840
what percentage of the shots do I think I'm going to get a bullseye? So forecast it. Say this is the

1289
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:38,840
percentage of times that I think I'm going to get a bullseye. Now, if it's a particular day and

1290
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:44,280
you're well below that, you would say, hmm, I wonder what happened today. What was the situation

1291
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:49,080
today where I was well below what my expectation was for the number of bulls-eyes? But now,

1292
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:55,800
if you're way above, you do the exact same thing. And this is what we don't do. I can guarantee you

1293
01:53:55,800 --> 01:54:00,360
because I know this is the way that people think. If you think, oh, I don't know how many times you

1294
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:04,280
shoot at the target. I've done so much of the work you're describing without the important piece,

1295
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:11,240
but at 50 yards, for example, I know just based on what I do that I should be able to put eight

1296
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:18,680
out of 10 inside of a certain diameter. So I spend a lot of time thinking about when I'm hitting six

1297
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:22,920
out of 10 inside of that range, what's going on. But there's days I'm hitting 10 out of 10. This is

1298
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:27,160
what you do. You walk off and you dance. You're like, look at me. I don't think about why. You're

1299
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:34,120
like, whoa, check me out. I'm great. And the thing is that, of course, you may have stepped up in

1300
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:38,040
skill, but wouldn't you like to know exactly what the adjustment? What was it that actually clicked

1301
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:42,360
for you that day? What is it that you know, it's not that I stepped up in skill because it can

1302
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:47,320
vanish the next day. So it's clearly something that is transient. Well, one of the reasons why

1303
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:51,880
it may be transient is because I haven't identified it and marked it and incorporated, right? Because

1304
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:56,280
it could be totally transient. It could be that you get to a certain skill level, and this is

1305
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:00,040
going to be your range. It's going to be six to 10. Oh, well, by transient, I just mean what I'm

1306
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:05,080
really saying is I'm sure that I did something better on that day. But it's transient because

1307
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:09,880
I didn't identify it and make it a part of my permanent. It could be that if we could look at

1308
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,400
me under the six out of 10 day versus the 10 out of 10 day. I mean, I'm positive I'm doing something

1309
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:22,040
different. There is no way equipment, wind or any other factor other than me explains that. But by

1310
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:29,400
only comparing eight to six, not six to 10, I'm missing a greater disparity, which in theory

1311
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:34,280
should call out more obvious deltas. It's not just that you're missing half the time, it's you're

1312
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:38,600
using half the discrimination. It's like it's easier to see that there are two lines if they're

1313
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:44,360
a foot apart versus a millimeter apart. So if I had to say, like, if someone asked me, what's the

1314
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:52,920
single biggest factor between a player who doesn't make a ton of progress or makes slower progress,

1315
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:58,440
compared to a player who really, really makes a lot of progress and becomes elite in poker, I would

1316
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:05,880
say that's it. That when you listen to someone like Eric Seidel, talk about poker, you would hardly

1317
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:11,640
know whether they won or lost the hand. All they're doing is exploring what are the counterfactuals,

1318
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:16,280
like what are the other lines that I could have chosen? Did I have the person's hand right? What if

1319
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:20,520
I had bet a little bit more? What if I had bet a little bit less? What if I hadn't played the hand

1320
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:25,080
at all? What would have happened if I played this hand that I didn't play? And you would hardly know,

1321
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:28,760
like if you listened to them, you would have no idea. In fact, probably you would assume they had

1322
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:33,160
lost. Right. Because it's so foreign to hear somebody because they're exploring so much. You'd

1323
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:37,000
be like, whoa, you must have really lost that tournament. And they'd be like, no, I won the

1324
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,120
tournament. And you move on. And what you hear from players who aren't making that kind of

1325
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:46,760
progress is it goes two ways. When they talk about the hands they won, it's just sort of like, I was

1326
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:51,080
great. And they don't really spend a lot of time on it. When they talk about the hands they lost,

1327
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:55,880
it's a lot of exploration of the luck elements. And the thing about poker, because the luck

1328
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:03,800
element in a given instance, like in the short run is so prominent, that it's so easy to focus on

1329
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:10,520
the bad card that came. So you'll have conversations with people where they'll talk about like, oh,

1330
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:16,440
I had this hand. And this person, it's called sucking out, they sucked out on me, meaning that

1331
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:21,640
they happen to hit a good card. And to somebody who's thinking who spent a lot of time around

1332
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:25,960
someone like Eric Seidel, you're looking at it and saying, well, you should have won that hand

1333
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,280
way beforehand. Or maybe you shouldn't have played that hand at all. So for example, like if I have a

1334
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:35,240
particular hand where you end up hitting a really good card, it may be that I should have made you

1335
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:40,040
fold before then. Now sometimes it's you were going to be sticky, you were going to stay around,

1336
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:46,280
I had mathematically weigh the best of it, and whatever bad luck happened. But sometimes it's,

1337
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:51,080
I should have made you fold a lot earlier, I should have made you pay more for the privilege

1338
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:56,920
of hitting that card, that actually the way that I bet the hand meant that you were making money to

1339
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:00,440
my bet when I could have made you lose money to my bet, regardless of whether you were going to

1340
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:05,400
beat me on that particular hand in the long run, I'd like to make you make losing decisions. Maybe

1341
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:10,040
I shouldn't have played the hand at all. There's all sorts of other things that you can be exploring

1342
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:13,640
in those situations, and they're not getting explored. Instead, what's getting focused on

1343
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:18,600
is I can't believe that person sucked out on me. So I have this framework for learning things that

1344
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:23,720
require skill. And I see a parallel now that I've never seen before. So my framework, and I use

1345
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:27,720
swimming as the analogy for this, because I learned to swim as an adult. So this was really

1346
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,600
the first time I explored this framework. But I do think it applies to many things, languages,

1347
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:40,680
you pick it, frankly. So the framework is we start out as unconsciously incompetent. So you take a

1348
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:45,480
person like me at 31 who doesn't know how to swim, you put them in the water, there's no ambiguity

1349
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:50,360
about how bad I am. But I don't know why. All I can tell you is I can't swim, I can't actually

1350
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:55,880
tell you why I can't swim. So the first step of learning how to swim is becoming consciously

1351
01:58:55,880 --> 01:59:01,560
incompetent. You actually have to understand why you're really bad at this. Oh, once you start to

1352
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,080
understand Archimedes principle, that's like a very important part of understanding how to swim.

1353
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:11,880
The more of you that's underwater, the more buoyancy there is to hold you up. Once you start to

1354
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:17,480
understand how Bernoulli works, oh, all of a sudden there's this difference about the velocity

1355
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:22,360
of a fluid over a body, etc. And then by the way, you're no better as a swimmer in those two boxes,

1356
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:26,680
right? The difference between- Right. I just want to know the percentage of people who are learning

1357
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:32,680
swimming who cite Archimedes and Bernoulli. I just love that that's the way that you're-

1358
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:37,320
I don't know if I still have them, but I would love it if I did. I used to journal so relentlessly

1359
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:45,400
about swimming. I had reams of journals that I would write in every single day of my free body

1360
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:50,680
diagrams of my body in different swimming positions and trying to figure out ways to make

1361
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:57,320
this less bad. When I got into this, I became so obsessed that I swam twice a day, every day. This

1362
01:59:57,320 --> 02:00:01,880
model makes so much sense to me. Well, you don't actually start swimming until you reach the third

1363
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:08,200
box, which is now you are consciously competent. Now, the problem is you can't do that for long.

1364
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:14,200
So you tend to vacillate a lot between the second and third box, which is consciously competent,

1365
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:19,240
and then you go back to being consciously incompetent. But as long as you can maintain

1366
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:24,520
focus, you will vacillate between those. And usually it's your physical fatigue that will push

1367
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:30,120
you from the third box back to the second box. Now, when you become a really good swimmer,

1368
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:36,280
like Michael Phelps, you transcend to this fourth box. You are now unconsciously competent.

1369
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:41,080
Everything becomes sort of autonomic at that level. Now, thinking about this through decisions,

1370
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:45,080
as you were telling this story about Eric, I'm thinking about the first level. So let's just

1371
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:51,960
call it four levels. Now, the first level is you only examine losses through the lens of luck.

1372
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:57,080
So that's our default. I would argue that takes no effort, just as being unconsciously

1373
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:05,000
incompetent is our default. Layer two or level two thinking is I only examine my losses

1374
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,040
through the lens of luck and skill. That's great. So you're taking some responsibility.

1375
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:14,520
Taking some responsibility. Only triggered by the loss. Only triggered by the loss. Then you have a level three,

1376
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:21,880
which is I'll do that, but I will also now examine my wins through skill. And then the fourth level,

1377
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:27,320
which I'm guessing is exactly where someone like Eric is, is no, I'm going to look at wins and

1378
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:36,840
losses through luck and skill. Yeah. So what I would say is I think that the thing about examining

1379
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:42,600
wins, I do think that examining wins through the lens of skill is pretty natural. We don't spend a

1380
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:48,360
lot of time on it. It's kind of an assumption of skill. I would put wins down in level one. Let's

1381
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:53,720
put it this way. I would focus more on, I would actually think about it, not just in terms of,

1382
02:01:54,280 --> 02:02:04,200
are you examining the quadrants that are discordant in a symmetric way? So what I would say is that on

1383
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:11,960
the level one thinking is I lean on the discordance on the loss side and I lean on the concordance

1384
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:15,960
on the wind side. And I just kind of do that naturally. And I don't spend a lot of time

1385
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:19,800
thinking about either of them. That makes sense. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about either

1386
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:26,440
of them. Then I think that level two is you're still leaning on concordance on the wind side.

1387
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:31,240
You're not examining those very much, but you do start to examine the discordant losses. Right.

1388
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:36,360
You examine the concordant losses now. So you examine the losses that are actually due to your

1389
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:46,520
own undoing. Then I'll get to the fourth level. Then I think that level three is I'm looking in

1390
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:51,640
all four quadrants. So I'm looking at wins that are due to skill that are due to my good decision

1391
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:56,840
making. I'm looking at wins that are due to my bad decision making. I'm looking at losses that are

1392
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:05,000
due to my good decision making and I'm trying to, I'm really trying to sort of look at those all equally.

1393
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:12,520
Where I think the fourth level comes in is when it's concordant on the wind side

1394
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:20,520
that you don't accept it. In other words, that you say I made good decisions and I won, but it does

1395
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:26,600
not mean there wasn't a better way. So let me actually start to really clean up in there and say

1396
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:33,960
it's not about I made a decision. It was a winning decision. I was positive expected value for it.

1397
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:42,680
And so I'm done. It's now I so care that I got onto what we would call the primary line of play

1398
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:46,440
that I really came up with the best possible solution that I could, given what I knew

1399
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:51,560
that I won't be satisfied with just finding out that there was concordance. Like I want to go

1400
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:55,320
beyond that on the wind side. I think what we're going to do in the show notes is literally take

1401
02:03:55,320 --> 02:04:00,920
everything you just said and turn it into a printable one pager that every one of us should

1402
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:07,080
carry with us because that's that is a very elegant way to think about that. I promise you

1403
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:11,880
I've never done what you just said. Like I've never once had a level four thought in my life.

1404
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:16,680
Well, first of all, let me just say that I only thought about it because you gave me the levels,

1405
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:22,360
but it's that last bit. So right now I'm writing a workbook very close to finished with it,

1406
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:29,960
where in chapter three, I really dig into that piece, which is when you have a good outcome

1407
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:35,240
and it turns out it's from good decisions, what are you doing with that? Are you done? Or are you

1408
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:39,640
trying to figure out if there was even better one beyond that? And here's the reason why we don't

1409
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:47,080
like to do that because when we think about what sort of creates the fabric of our identity,

1410
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:51,480
our beliefs are the threads that our identity is woven out of. By doing a level four thought,

1411
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:56,440
you risk their undermining that. Tearing a hole, tearing a hole in it because one of the things

1412
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:01,960
that we want to do is feel like that fabric is strong. Like our beliefs are good and we're

1413
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:08,840
competent. I mean, this idea of competence and being able to bank credit for the way that things

1414
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:16,280
have turned out in our life is so core to what forms our identity that when you don't stop at,

1415
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,040
my decisions were good and I had a good outcome, when you actually dig around in there,

1416
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:29,320
you're risking now turning something that was a win into a loss. So this is where I love your idea

1417
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:33,800
of the levels. So if we think about that level one, like I want it must be good. Why wouldn't you

1418
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:37,960
go further than that and say, well, maybe I won because of bad luck, you're turning a win into a

1419
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:42,920
loss. And in this particular case, we're taking win as the outcome. I had a good outcome and you

1420
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:47,000
sort of want to just stop there because you don't want to dig down and find out you might have made

1421
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:52,040
a bad decision because now you turned a win into a loss. So that's where when you get to level two,

1422
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:57,320
you're willing to do that. You're willing to say, I want a long run win. And what that means is I

1423
02:05:57,320 --> 02:06:02,120
might have to turn this outcome that was a win into a loss. When you get to level four, what you say is,

1424
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,720
okay, I had a good outcome. I looked and I saw that my decision making was pretty good,

1425
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:12,120
but now I'm willing to turn that win into a loss in order to get long run better.

1426
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:18,280
You're basically completely exposed at that point. I can imagine how your book became immediate

1427
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:24,360
fodder for every hedge fund manager and so forth. Because again, I think the advantage of that type

1428
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:29,960
of investing bears some resemblance to poker, which is you can't really hide your decisions.

1429
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:35,400
Your outcomes are very clear and which is not to say there's not a huge element of luck just as

1430
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:40,600
there is with poker, but it's basically an industry where your decisions are exposed.

1431
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:45,320
Every decision you make, in the end, you're going to be able to trace it to an outcome. And

1432
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:50,840
frankly, unless you're not in the business of making money, you have to be wed to good outcomes.

1433
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:55,160
So the poker player wants to do well, the hedge fund manager wants to do well. There's nowhere to

1434
02:06:55,160 --> 02:07:00,040
hide, I guess is what I'm trying to get at. I agree in theory that there's nowhere to hide.

1435
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:05,960
The interesting thing that I think is how long people can hide from it. That's what I find so

1436
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:12,440
fascinating is you look at poker and you're like, you're getting answers right away. You win or

1437
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:16,680
lose. So here's the problem. It's like, okay, at the end of the year, somebody lost.

1438
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:24,440
Right. But why? How far are you willing to go to say I just got bad luck? That's the question.

1439
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:31,080
That's the question. And I'm just really fascinated that people can go really far.

1440
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:36,440
They can really convince themselves that they just got bad luck. And I think that that's true.

1441
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:41,560
Obviously, if you're running a hedge fund, you have investors that you're accountable to.

1442
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:46,760
But we all know of hedge fund managers where they had a couple of good years and then people are

1443
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:50,600
sticking with them. It's like you have a couple of good years to start. There's this path dependence

1444
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,960
to this. And it's true with poker. Like if a poker player comes out of the gate in the first six

1445
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:58,920
months and loses everything in sight, they're very unlikely. If they continue to lose, they're going

1446
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:03,080
to say, Oh, I must be really bad at this. But for every poker player who comes out of the gate with

1447
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:08,600
a terrible first six months, there's a poker player. I actually remember way back when,

1448
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:15,480
a long time ago, there was a new player who came on the scene and they won a world series of poker

1449
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:19,480
bracelet. I mean, they were really young. I mean, early twenties and nobody had ever heard of them

1450
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:23,800
before and they won. And I thought, Oh, you know, that's nice. Cause that happens, right? Obviously.

1451
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:28,760
Then they won a second one. And I was like, Oh, that might be just the ruin of them. Now,

1452
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:33,080
why would I say that? Like they had won a second world series of poker bracelet because I understood

1453
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:39,240
this path dependence, right? That if you come out of the gate and you do really well, your ability

1454
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:44,120
to fool yourself afterwards for a very long time, it becomes infinite, it becomes almost infinite.

1455
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:48,280
And you see that in the hedge fund world all the time. Obviously, if an investor comes along and

1456
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:53,480
they don't show any results, by the way, sometimes unfairly, it becomes very hard for them to recover

1457
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:57,880
from that sometimes unfairly. Cause maybe they just, it just went against them for that year or

1458
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:03,640
whatever. But when it's the reverse, when they come out of the gate strong, you can fool yourself for

1459
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:08,120
really, really, really, really long time. And that's the thing that I find so fascinating. That's

1460
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:16,280
what really kind of lights me up and trying to figure out the capacity for self-deception is so

1461
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:22,280
bottomless. Well, is there an industry that you look at where you just see on average,

1462
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:29,080
it is more amenable to higher level thinking the way we just described the four levels in poker,

1463
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:34,760
like this framework, is there a place where either through some externality of the way the industry

1464
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:40,120
is set up and the rate of time being short between decision and outcome and some sort of

1465
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:45,640
transparency that we have a space where there's a greater incentive to rise to that level.

1466
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:50,920
First of all, let me just say this that obviously, we're only talking about places where in the

1467
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:57,560
shorter run, luck is going to have a strong influence. So when you look at sports that are

1468
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:02,760
really highly under the influence of skill, people are getting selected out and nobody's fooling

1469
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:08,280
themselves. Well, actually, it was just bad luck that I didn't get to be a professional NFL

1470
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:15,160
linebacker. I mean, it might be if you got an injury, but I'm 5'5 and I weigh 130. Such bad

1471
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:20,040
luck that I wasn't feel or just like, no, I just wasn't good enough. So we know that in cases where

1472
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:26,120
it's very transparent that if you're not doing well, we can trace it back to skill. So the more

1473
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:31,800
chess like we are, the less the capacity for us to fool ourselves. If I lose to you in chess,

1474
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:35,800
it's very hard for me to say that I got bad luck because I don't know where's the luck. I don't

1475
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:40,760
know, go find it for me. There's a little bit of luck, but not much. So the more on the chess

1476
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:45,640
range of things we are, the less the capacity to do that. So first of all, we've got to be in an

1477
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:52,280
environment where there's a strong short run influence of luck. Now, the tighter the feedback

1478
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:57,720
loop, the more feedback you're getting, the more that somebody needs to rise to the occasion. So

1479
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:02,280
if you were to look at what's the capacity, which individuals are going to thrive more in those

1480
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:08,760
systems, definitely the ones who are much more willing to dig in and dig around. So people who

1481
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:13,480
are in higher frequency trading, for example, where those feedback loops of the time horizons

1482
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:19,320
are shorter, I think are going to be more likely to be thinking in this way. And if they're investing

1483
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:24,440
their own money. That's a very interesting point. It's got to seem right, you got to have skin in

1484
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:27,720
the game. Are there poker players, by the way, that play with other people's money? And by that,

1485
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:33,320
I mean not money that they won from somebody else, but I see. Yeah, so there's backing situations.

1486
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:37,000
Yeah, there's the same thing. The less you're trading on sort of reputation and the more that

1487
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,120
you're trading on your own dollars. Also, I think that you're more likely to end up in a spot where

1488
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:46,920
you're thinking that way. So basically, you have tons of skin in the game. There's a high element

1489
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:53,800
of luck and skill, and the feedback loop is short. Those are three situations that will tend to push

1490
02:11:53,800 --> 02:12:00,440
you towards either abject failure or getting better, moving up the ladder of this thinking.

1491
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:06,520
It's a little chicken and egg. So I don't know. Is it the people who succeed or more naturally,

1492
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:12,440
kind of more naturally tend to it that kind of thinking and obviously it gets reinforced or?

1493
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:16,520
What would Eric do if he wasn't the best poker player in the world?

1494
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,920
Well, I know what he would do because he was an options trader.

1495
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:23,800
Okay, so again, options trading, you could argue that it's sort of similar, right?

1496
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:26,360
It's incredibly similar. It's almost the same.

1497
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:32,040
But would he go and be a good CEO of a blue chip company? Like if he all of a sudden tomorrow,

1498
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:37,320
assume he had the domain knowledge. Okay, so he could go in and be the CEO of General Electric

1499
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:42,120
or Home Depot or Exxon Mobil or something where you could put a chip in his head that gives him

1500
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:48,440
the domain expertise to understand exploration and production or whatever. But could you

1501
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:54,840
move that industry or that company within its industry relative to its peers by bringing that

1502
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:59,320
layer of thinking? Yes. So that's what that's, that's kind of why I want to say, is there a little

1503
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:04,760
bit of a chicken and an egg issue? Because I have met people across industries where there are people

1504
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:08,920
who are thinking this way, where there are people who are really hungry for it. Now, in terms of

1505
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:12,840
this idea of like, what are you doing when you find out it was pretty good decisions and good

1506
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:18,520
outcomes? Or are you only doing postmortems and not thinking about it in terms of expectancy?

1507
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:23,000
That's a problem that you see across all industries. But also across industries,

1508
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,840
you see people who are really hungry to try to incorporate that into their solution space. How

1509
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:34,200
am I dealing with this? How am I running my teams? So if you just take the investing world,

1510
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:39,800
I see people who think that way all the way from people who are trading options to people who are

1511
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:45,480
doing seed round venture capital much different than late stage venture capital, where you might

1512
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:51,400
the time horizon now is faster, I mean, not the same speed as options. But if you're like in the

1513
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:56,760
seed round, we're talking horizons, it could be a decade, there are fund managers who are in long

1514
02:13:56,760 --> 02:14:01,880
short funds where they might put on seven positions in a year, you're hardly getting any data. And

1515
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:09,080
they're, they're really looking to think this way. Because what's interesting is that while trading

1516
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:14,600
options might foster this kind of thinking better, because you're getting feedback more quickly,

1517
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:20,920
while you might end up getting sort of selected out by the people who you're accountable to quicker,

1518
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:25,880
while maybe that particular type of mind would tend to get drawn towards say options trading

1519
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:33,240
better. The issue is that in absence of the world telling you quickly, this type of thinking actually

1520
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:37,960
becomes much more important. Yeah, it becomes more important and more difficult. Right. Because when

1521
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:43,720
you spread the feedback loops out now, the way that I always think about it is uncertainty,

1522
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:51,000
gives you the leeway to allow bias to come in. And that's the difference between the chess and poker

1523
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,560
in chess, because you've taken a lot of uncertainty away, you don't have the leeway to fool yourself.

1524
02:14:55,560 --> 02:15:00,200
That is an absolute goal. But in poker, you do. So we can sort of think about if you look at the

1525
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:04,360
difference between say trading options and something that has a much longer time horizon,

1526
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:10,120
the longer the time horizon, the more capacity you have, the more leeway the world is giving you to

1527
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:16,360
fool yourself. So then this kind of thinking really thinking in this systematic way, really

1528
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:22,280
modeling the world in this way becomes much, much, much more important. It becomes a bigger imperative

1529
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:25,880
for you to be poking for you to be thinking counterfactually for you to have people

1530
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:33,320
challenging your ideas for you to be trying to think about am I doing this because it's status

1531
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:39,960
quo. And if it doesn't go well, I won't get blamed. Am I innovating enough? Am I allowing people to

1532
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:47,880
challenge my ideas? Am I challenging ideas myself enough? Am I looking at that discordant box that

1533
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:53,880
has to do with good outcomes? Or am I only willing to look at the discord when it's a bad outcome?

1534
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:58,840
When the bad outcome is concordant, am I like super excited about that? Or am I imagining,

1535
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:04,040
well, maybe there was a better way? How am I digging into all of those spots? And then if you're

1536
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:10,600
in a leadership role, how am I propagating? Or am I not propagating these problems across the team?

1537
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:15,960
Am I telling the team through my actions that they should be terrified of bad results? As I'm

1538
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:20,920
thinking about the way that the world is giving me the leeway to be able to sort of have my beliefs

1539
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:27,640
lead me around on a leash? Am I infecting my team with that same problem? Because now I can be

1540
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:32,280
creating this whole other problem. And it's such a long time horizon that maybe the world's going

1541
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:37,000
to tell me that this was actually problematic. You should be digging into that as if you're

1542
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,160
getting the answer tomorrow, as if you're playing chess and you're going to find out right away.

1543
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:47,320
And you should be doing everything you can to try to make sure that you don't find out you hung your

1544
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:51,640
rook. This to me is why swimming is harder than riding a bike. You can teach anybody to ride a

1545
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:57,240
bike relatively quickly for a couple reasons. One, the feedback loop is very quick. Like anytime

1546
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:02,600
you're out of balance, I mean, we just naturally internally, our inner ears allow us to sense that

1547
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:09,400
disequilibrium instantaneously. So you get the fastest feedback loop imaginable and the consequences

1548
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:13,880
are quite high. It hurts significantly when you're not in balance. Contrary to popular belief,

1549
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:18,280
swimming is about balance. It's the exact same thing. You just happen to be in a medium that is

1550
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:24,040
so much more dense than air that the feedback loop is much slower and the consequences are

1551
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:29,640
much more gentle. It doesn't hurt when you're out of balance. In fact, if you fell every time on a

1552
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:34,360
bicycle that you were out of balance while learning to swim, you'd never ride a bike again. You'd be

1553
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:40,040
so black and blue. So in that sense, swimming is gentler, meaning you have more excuses.

1554
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:46,280
It's longer time horizon, but it's that much more important that you do the examination. So if

1555
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:52,440
anybody can mindlessly ride a bike very soon after being shown how to do it, you can't mindlessly

1556
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:59,720
swim for years after learning how to swim. It's that hard. Swimming then becomes the example of

1557
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:04,840
where it's more important that you bring that level of thinking if you want to make any progress.

1558
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:10,120
I agree. And let me add something to this, which correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is in

1559
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:16,760
the same space as you're thinking. It's sort of thinking about this soft landing issue, the wider

1560
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:24,760
the skill gap between you and the people that you're competing against. There's so much more

1561
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:32,600
cushion for a soft landing. So this is something that I sort of think about is by not exploring

1562
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:38,840
that, sure, I made winning decisions and I won by not willing to go beyond that. Imagine if you're

1563
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:43,960
in a situation where let's say we're in some sort of zero sum game. So we're trading against each

1564
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:52,120
other. And if I were making perfect decisions against you, every time that we put a dollar on

1565
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:57,880
the table, I would get a quarter. But because of the decisions that I'm making, every time we put a

1566
02:18:57,880 --> 02:19:02,360
dollar on the table, I'm getting a nickel. So if we think about those quadrants, right, when I look

1567
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:07,480
at I have a good outcome, I want a nickel. And my decision making was good because I was positive

1568
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:14,520
expectancy, right? I was winning a nickel, I was winning 5%. But by not exploring, I don't see the

1569
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:19,800
20 cents that's sitting there that I could get every single time. And that's the problem with

1570
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:26,360
a soft landing. That's the problem with having that cushion is it doesn't let you know that there's

1571
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:30,440
something better that you could be doing. I know we got a wrap because we both have to get moving,

1572
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:35,480
but there's one topic that you very loosely, I think we were going to go down the path of it

1573
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:40,280
by name. But then we didn't. But I want to bring it up because it's such an important concept

1574
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:46,520
in my world. And it's something I have done for such a long time, but never had a great name for

1575
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:51,880
it. And when I read your book, I was like, Oh, awesome. I'm going to be plagiarizing this all

1576
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:57,320
day long. And it's the idea of backcasting. Oh, yeah. A moment ago, you use the term forecasting,

1577
02:19:57,320 --> 02:20:03,160
right? We're all about forecasting. Well, I want to be doing this in Q4. And therefore, I need to do

1578
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:08,040
this today and this tomorrow and this tomorrow. And I'll tell you how I use it. And then I'll

1579
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:12,840
And let me just say for the record, backcasting is not a word that I coin. Oh, all right. I don't

1580
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:17,240
want to reference you who references someone else. You can say you read about it in my book. I didn't

1581
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:21,640
invent that word. All right, thank you for clarifying that. So prior to reading your book,

1582
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:25,800
I would just refer to it as reverse engineering, but that never really had any resonance with people.

1583
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:30,440
But now when I say backcasting, it forces me to explain the contrast between backcasting and

1584
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:35,960
forecasting, whereas reverse engineering doesn't have a striking of a contrast. So the place that

1585
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:43,880
I use it is in understanding the exoskeleton of the body. So the actual physical structural demise

1586
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:47,720
of ourselves. So we're all sitting here thinking about exercise and everybody knows they should

1587
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:51,560
exercise, but nobody really can give you a great reason for why we've been sitting here talking

1588
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:56,680
about the outliers, professional athletes, but outside of people who get paid to do something

1589
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:00,840
with their body, what are the rest of us doing? It's amazing how often you push people on this.

1590
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:04,600
They can't give you a great answer. And because I ask everybody under the sun this question,

1591
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:08,520
I'll tell you all answers basically fall into these three buckets. So if you're asking someone

1592
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:15,240
who's not getting paid to do a sport, why do you exercise? 90% of the answers are, I like the way

1593
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:22,520
it makes me look. I like the way it makes me feel. And I like the freedom and flexibility it gives me

1594
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:25,960
with what I eat. Some combination of those three. There are other answers that show up a lot less

1595
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:29,640
frequently, such as I love the social interaction that comes with it and things like that. Now I

1596
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:34,120
would argue all of those are fine reasons to exercise, but I don't think they're good enough.

1597
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:39,160
The good enough one only comes when you start thinking about backcasting, which is what do you

1598
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:45,640
want your body to function like the day before you take your last breath? Really think about this.

1599
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:48,920
So I've taken this to an extreme and people have heard me talk about this in the podcast before,

1600
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:54,760
but I come up with this idea of the centenarian Olympics, which is instead of training for like

1601
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:59,240
an Olympics that's now where you would actually have to pole vault and run a hundred meters in

1602
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:03,960
under 10 seconds. Think about what an Olympic games would look like of a hundred year olds

1603
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:09,320
and ask yourself, what do you want to be able to do in that Olympic game? So I have like 18 things

1604
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:13,880
I want to be able to do when I'm a hundred, if I get to be a hundred and they're all quite mundane,

1605
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:18,840
but they're all very pragmatic and practical. One of them is being able to do a 30 pound goblet

1606
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:24,600
squat, which again, I could do today blindfolded on one leg a hundred thousand times, but at a

1607
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:29,000
hundred that's actually going to be quite a task. And it's important because that replicates picking

1608
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,560
up a toddler, which presumably if I'm a hundred, I've got great grandkids. I want to be able to pick

1609
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:39,560
them up. I want to be able to stand up off the floor using no support and only a single point

1610
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:45,080
of my own, meaning one arm and both my legs and get up off the floor without help. Can I do that

1611
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:50,600
today? Of course. Can you do that today with your eyes shut? Very few hundred year olds can do that.

1612
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:56,840
So I've kind of 18 of these things I want to be able to do and that is backcasting. It's going to

1613
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:02,840
the finish line and saying, if I can do that at a hundred, what was I able to do at 90? If I can do

1614
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:08,840
that at 90, but it must have been true at 60 and before you know it, I realize, wow, if I want to do

1615
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:12,760
that at a hundred now that I'm 46, I actually have to be able to do all of these other things. So

1616
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:17,480
there's this whole matrix that comes out of it. That's why that concept for me just resonated so

1617
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:21,960
much because I really, I don't think medicine spends enough time backcasting. Yeah. So let me

1618
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:27,880
try to add another benefit of backcasting. So just to be clear, backcasting is so when we forecast,

1619
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:32,680
what we think is there's a goal that I would like to reach. How do I get there? And in generally

1620
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:36,440
what you're thinking or what are the things that I'm doing in order to get to this goal? When you

1621
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:42,440
back has what you say is it's the day afterwards. So I have some goal. I'd like to be able to do X

1622
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:49,240
in a year and now it's a year and a day and I achieve my goal. And what you ask now is you

1623
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:54,040
look back and you say, how did I actually achieve this? And you can also do something called a

1624
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:59,720
premortem. So a premortem would be, I have this goal that I'd like to achieve. I'd like to achieve

1625
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:04,600
it in a year. It's now a year and a day and I failed. Why did I fail? Why did I fail? Now,

1626
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:10,600
here's an added benefit that I would like to offer to you. When we forecast, when we think about

1627
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:15,560
here's my goal, how do I get there? We're thinking about the things we're doing. Here are

1628
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:20,360
the decisions that I make along the way. So we're thinking about all the things that are within our

1629
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:24,360
decision making power within our control that are in the sort of skill side of the equation.

1630
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:29,720
But what happens when you backcast and you say, I actually succeeded. How did I get here?

1631
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:35,080
But particularly what happens when you do a premortem and you say, I failed, how did I get here?

1632
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:43,720
Now you allow luck into the equation. So as an example, if I'm thinking about when I'm 100,

1633
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:49,160
I would like to be able to do a 30 pound goblet squat, which I've never heard before, but now

1634
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:54,760
we'll say that because anyway, I learned that, but I'm now 100. It's the day I've turned 100 and

1635
02:24:54,760 --> 02:25:00,760
I cannot do that thing. Why? Well, I can think of some things like I didn't actually exercise

1636
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:06,360
enough, but I can also think of I tripped and I fell and I broke my hip. Now tripped and fell,

1637
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:11,800
that can happen to anybody. Probably not a matter of skill. It just something can happen. Like you

1638
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:15,960
could hurt yourself, but the break my hip might have to do with my bone density. That's going to

1639
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:21,480
cause you to explore other things that maybe wouldn't be as obvious because you saw nobody's

1640
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:27,880
thinking you don't see that bad luck can occur if you're not working backwards. And then to your

1641
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:32,440
point, once you work backwards, you can now ask yourself some questions because you see the luck

1642
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:39,160
and you can say, okay, if it's on the good side, can I increase the chances that that thing happens

1643
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:44,040
to me that I see is luck is going to intervene in my way. Can I increase the chances that's going

1644
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:48,120
to happen for me? Okay. So you can ask that, but then on the downside, which is really important

1645
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:53,400
to explore, let's say the breaking the hip thing. Can I decrease the chances that I break my hip?

1646
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:58,280
Yes. What are the things that I could do? If the answer is no, then you can say,

1647
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:03,480
are there any hedges available to me? Can I hedge against this bad luck thing happening to me?

1648
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:10,120
Sometimes the answer to that is also no. Regardless, what you can say is, okay, I've got my hedges set

1649
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:15,160
up. I'm doing what I can to decrease the chances that it occurs, but obviously it still could.

1650
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:20,760
So let me think now, before that bad luck intervenes, what am I going to do in response?

1651
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:26,920
Because if I plan for that in advance, I'm going to be making decisions right now in a

1652
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:33,240
calmer state of mind where I'm not pants on fire, freaking out, rather than being reactive to what

1653
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:37,800
the world might deliver me at the time. So if I've already thought about it, if I already have a plan

1654
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:42,440
in place, I'm not wasting time, I'm going to be much more calm, and I'm going to think about it.

1655
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:45,720
So this is one of the big difference between working forwards and working backwards is that

1656
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:49,240
when we work forwards and we're thinking about how do we execute on any kind of strategic plan,

1657
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:53,640
because we can think about, I want to be able to do this thing when I'm 100, and we're developing

1658
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:58,920
a strategic plan for how we get there. We really focus on what are the things that we're going to

1659
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:04,680
do that are going to get us there. And we don't say what are the ways that luck might intervene,

1660
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:09,400
but when you work backwards, you naturally start to see the luck. And then you can start to explore

1661
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:13,640
all of these questions that then makes your strategic plan much better. It makes you explore

1662
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:18,280
different stuff. Now does your workbook cover exactly this type of decision tree that we just

1663
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:23,880
went through? Yes. When is this coming out? A year from now. So I'm just finishing up the draft now,

1664
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:28,280
and then you have to lay it out, and you know how that goes with books. So basically what I'm doing

1665
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:33,720
with the workbook is I'm taking these concepts that I talk about broadly in sort of bigger idea

1666
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:39,400
way, and thinking in bets, and I'm saying, okay, how do you practically make a decision? How do you

1667
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:44,760
build out a decision tree? How do you think about the way that luck might intervene? How do you think

1668
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:50,120
about your own decision making? How do you see the luck? How do you communicate with other people

1669
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:55,800
such that you're making sure that you're getting the purest feedback from them, that you're not

1670
02:27:55,800 --> 02:28:00,360
biasing their feedback, that you're actually hungry for the information and you're seeking

1671
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:04,440
the feedback, which is by the way, the first step, which most of us don't do. Most of us aren't

1672
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:08,680
seeking the feedback. So when you're hungry for the feedback, you're actually thinking about

1673
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:13,160
what does the future look like? What could the outcomes be? How am I going to react to those

1674
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:18,600
things? How do I understand the sum of my experience and what that's supposed to teach me?

1675
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:23,640
So it was really trying to think about how do I allow people who don't do this for a living,

1676
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:28,360
who don't spend their time building out probabilistic decision trees, and this is not the

1677
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:33,080
way that they look at the world. How do I take somebody like that and show them the value and

1678
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:37,160
teach them how to actually think within this framework? Well, I think that means we're going

1679
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:41,640
to have to sit down and talk in about a year. Yeah, I hope so. I want to also just say one thing

1680
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:44,920
just for the listeners because I would like you to put it in the show notes. So I'm going to say

1681
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:49,400
it right here. A lot of the stuff that we've talked about with luck and skill, I really want

1682
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:53,880
to recommend. Well, first of all, in the forecasting stuff, let me just again recommend super forecasting,

1683
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:58,200
which I know is going to end up in the show notes. But there's a really, really wonderful book by

1684
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:03,320
Michael Malbison that's called the success equation. And it's all about the influence of

1685
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:08,520
luck and skill in our lives. It's got a lot of sports stuff in it, but just a lot of really

1686
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:14,600
digging down and drilling down into understanding luck and skill, and how you sort of understand

1687
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:18,520
what the difference is between the range of activities and sort of where you can see more

1688
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:23,560
influence of skill, where you can see more influence of luck, how you can sort of parse those apart.

1689
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:30,200
That's huge influence on our lives is luck. And he really drills down into that in a way that

1690
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:33,960
if people are really interested in the conversation that we had today,

1691
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:39,960
then I guarantee they would be really interested in the success equation. And Malbison also, I mean,

1692
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:45,080
you can just search him and you can see a whole bunch of videos of his where he talks about luck

1693
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:50,120
and skill. A lot of his writing talks about luck and skill and sort of separating the two and

1694
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:54,600
understanding the different influences. And yeah, I just can't recommend that book more. We'll put

1695
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:58,920
together a pretty robust set of notes here as we always do. And it will point to everything we've

1696
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:03,480
spoken about. Plus, I'm sure after the fact over the next couple of weeks, you and I will have back

1697
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:06,840
you'll think of something else that you want to hear. So I'd love to make this the sort of the

1698
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:09,880
compendium for all these things. And then of course, I can't wait to sort of talk about this

1699
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:14,600
workbook. It sounds like it's kind of an amazing tool. I mean, again, I would say like in the last

1700
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:19,480
few hours, I've realized that I'm not nearly as good a decision maker as even I think I am. And

1701
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:24,520
I don't say that to be sort of arrogant. I just think, look, I understand decisions at least as

1702
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:30,200
well as anybody else has been my bias. And I'm at least as probabilistically savvy. But I realize

1703
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:35,960
like there's tons of blind spots that I'm still experiencing. And I'm not even close to approaching

1704
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:41,640
the potential that that a person would have to make better decisions. So that said, I find myself

1705
02:30:41,640 --> 02:30:47,000
somewhat overwhelmed by how complicated this is. I'm already thinking like Travis is going to put

1706
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:52,200
together some great tearouts that will hold us over until your book comes out. But having a book

1707
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:58,040
that could be sort of a guidepost to a decision matrix would be fantastic. And let me just for

1708
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:02,360
people who have listened to this and felt sort of overwhelmed, it's funny because this happens to

1709
02:31:02,360 --> 02:31:08,040
be the chapter that I'm writing right now, is that it's really, really good to have this framework

1710
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:13,480
to be thinking about decisions and to really recognize the probabilistic nature of the world

1711
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:17,560
and the way that things turn out for you and understanding what the structure of a really good

1712
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:23,480
decision is. That being said, that doesn't mean that you have to sit down with a slide rule for

1713
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:28,280
every decision that you make. And in fact, for the majority of decisions that you make in your

1714
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:35,240
life, you can actually decide quite fast. And what's interesting is that the way to really understand

1715
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:40,280
when can I decide fast is to understand this broader framework. This broader framework that

1716
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:43,960
would allow you to take the bigger decisions in your life and actually start to think about them

1717
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:48,760
in this way where you're really forecasting them is actually the way to understand when can I go

1718
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:55,640
really fast. And what it will allow you to do is stop taking 15 minutes to decide what to order in

1719
02:31:55,640 --> 02:32:00,600
a restaurant, because you have to understand this framework in order to sort of get when you can go

1720
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:04,760
fast and when you can go slow. Because when I do talk to people about this kind of framework,

1721
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:09,240
they do feel a little bit overwhelmed. And they're like, Oh, my gosh, how am I ever going to make a

1722
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:14,040
decision again, like I'm going to need a supercomputer in order to do it. It's very few decisions that

1723
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:20,120
you actually need to take a ton of time on mostly you can decide fast. And on the ones that are

1724
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:26,040
bigger decisions, embracing the probabilistic nature actually gets you out of the analysis

1725
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:30,120
paralysis. Because what you realize is once you've identified your options, and you've got an option

1726
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:36,520
that you see is better relative to the other ones, you stop focusing on achieving absolute certainty,

1727
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:41,240
and start focusing on achieving relative to the other things that I could do, this one definitely

1728
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:46,280
looks better to me. And because I recognize that there's all sorts of stuff I don't know,

1729
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:50,600
and there's all sorts of different ways the world can turn out, and as long as I'm taking the things

1730
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:55,640
that occur in my life, and trying to learn from them in a real way, I'm not going to be so terrified

1731
02:32:55,640 --> 02:33:01,080
of sort of the downside. And that really frees you up. You've said that so, so elegantly. And I think

1732
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:05,880
that reiterates this sort of the notion that intuitively people get it right, you go fast on

1733
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:09,560
the straightaway and slow on the curves, this framework shows you where the curves are. Yeah.

1734
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:14,120
And that frees you up to go faster on the straightaways. Yes, and interestingly enough,

1735
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:19,480
it frees you up relative to what you were doing before to go faster on the curves as well.

1736
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:25,960
Absolutely. To not try to figure out in that moment, if I don't know the exact right path to

1737
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:30,920
take, I'm paralyzed and I just need to slam the brakes on, but to recognize when, well,

1738
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:35,480
this path is going to be good enough. I'll spare all the listeners the race car analogy that is

1739
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:41,960
like zooming into my cortex at the moment, because there is a perfect analogy to driving around a

1740
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:45,560
corner in a race car, but I will spare everybody that. You can put it in the show notes. There we

1741
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:50,120
go. Well, Annie, thanks so much. This was really great. I really appreciate you responding to my

1742
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:53,800
random request to sit down and talk about this. I can't wait to do it again when the new book

1743
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:57,640
comes out. Well, thank you. I'm excited to come back when the workbook is done, but this was like

1744
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:01,880
an amazing conversation, very different than most of the podcasts I've done. So I really appreciate

1745
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:04,120
it. That's the way we do things here. We go deep. Yeah.
