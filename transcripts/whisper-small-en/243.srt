00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Anthony, thank you so much for coming over, not just coming over, coming over on a Sunday.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,560
The reason I'm, we're doing this on a Sunday, I don't normally record podcasts on the weekend,

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,680
but my wife and I saw you speak, actually saw a video of you speaking. We couldn't make

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,640
it to the actual event. And we were both so moved by it and thought, you know, if there's

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,560
anything that I can do to use sort of my platform to get this message out more broadly, basically

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,400
to everybody, because it's hard to say that there's someone who doesn't need to hear what

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,160
we're about to talk about today. And basically, if I had tried to slot this into our normal

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,640
podcast schedule, we wouldn't be having this discussion until about June. And I was just

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,960
like, you know what, honestly, like if it makes the life of one person different by doing it now,

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,480
we're going to record this at the beginning of February and turn this around as quickly as

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,920
possible. So this will probably give listeners a sense of why this is an important episode. But

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,320
let's just start. Who are you, Anthony? What do you do? And why is it we're sitting here today?

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,760
Yeah, well, I appreciate the invite. I'll never say no to talking about Vietnam and talking about

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,120
the dangers it presents to everybody. It's it knows no boundaries, right? It's, it's black,

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,440
white, brown, it's rich, poor, it affects anybody and everybody, not only in Hayes County, not only

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,640
Travis County, Texas, but the entire world. So that's how prevalent this stuff is and scary.

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,680
But again, I appreciate the invite. And I don't care if it's Sunday. So I really appreciate you

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,880
fitness in and getting this getting this going. I've been in law enforcement for 24 years,

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,400
I worked at the Austin police department for 23 years, I retired July of 2021.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,440
I grew up and basically live my entire life out in Hayes County. And I wanted to get out there and

22
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,880
serve in the community that I grew up in, right? So I took the summer off and during the 2021 year

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,520
and started in September. I've been friends with the sheriff out there for a long, long time. And he

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,440
consistently recruited me to get out there. So I got hired by the Hayes County Sheriff's Office

25
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,480
September. And I've been there just, you know, 18 months or so now. I'm currently assigned to the

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,520
community outreach unit. During my time at the eight at APD, I did just APD is a large department,

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,400
right? So you're able to do a variety of assignments. Obviously, you have to start out on patrol,

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,200
but I work patrol certain several stints, I promoted twice. So each time you promote,

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,240
you got to go back to the patrol division and answer 911 calls and all that good stuff. But

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,440
I worked in organized crime. I worked in public affairs. I did internal affairs. I did some

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,480
undercover work. I worked mounted patrol, bike patrol on six streets. So in a larger department,

32
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,920
you're able to specialize a lot. So I was able to experience a lot and learn a lot about the

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,320
department, the inside, what makes it tick and all that good stuff. But it was just time for me to

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,360
move on. And I reached the point where I was able to retire. So I jumped out to Hayes County. And

35
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,080
again, I'm on the side of the community outreach unit. And all we do is get out in the community

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,200
and visit and show the citizens of Hayes County that we're human, right? We're police officers.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,320
Yes. Or sheriff's deputies. Yes. But we're humans, right? And our job is to get out in the community

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,360
and reach people and talk to them. And we do that through a variety of ways. We have a citizens

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,480
police academy. We do junior deputy academies during the summer. We visit HOAs. But obviously

40
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,440
now over the last, since about August, it's all Fentanyl all the time, just because of what's going

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,720
on. So you retired in the summer of 21. And what up until the point of your retirement, how big an

42
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:03,720
issue was Fentanyl making its way into other drugs? Yeah. So at that time, Fentanyl was around

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,640
when I, at the time I retired, I was an organized crime. I was a sergeant over the criminal

44
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,880
interdiction unit. And that's what we did on a daily basis was battle the Mexican cartel.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,160
Obviously I 35 runs up and down through the middle of Hayes County, through the middle of Austin.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,880
So I had about 10, 10 officers that were assigned to me. And we had officers that

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,680
did interdiction work up and down. I 35, we had officers that worked at ABIA. We also had

48
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,880
officers that worked with FedEx, with UPS, with the postal service to try to interdict,

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,680
not only drugs, but money, guns, and any, any, any type of criminal element. So at that time,

50
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,920
I think I did about three, three and a half years in that assignment. And we started seeing Fentanyl

51
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,840
probably 2017, 2018, but it was more on the black market. People would order that in the dark web

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,400
and it would be sent from China. It would be sent FedEx or UPS. And the majority of our seizures at

53
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,120
that time were through FedEx and USPS. We would work with the postal inspectors and security folks

54
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,320
with UPS and FedEx. And we would intercept boxes and boxes of illegal illicit counterfeit pills.

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,600
So that's where we started seeing it. What's going on now is the Mexican cartel,

56
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,640
being that they're very competitive and they want to own the drug market. They have gotten into the

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,080
Fentanyl game and that's why we're seeing it become more and more prevalent over the,

58
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,320
over the last number of years. Now, I kind of been sort of asleep at the wheel here and haven't

59
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,880
paid a lot of attention to this until maybe the past six months. But back when I worked in a

60
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:46,840
hospital, we used Fentanyl all the time. It was a very potent intravenous narcotic. So you had

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,600
morphine, which you would typically give in milligram doses, right? So if a patient was having

62
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,680
a lot of pain, you would use an intravenous infusion of morphine, one, two, three, four,

63
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,040
five milligrams, right? So, you know, thousandths of a gram of morphine. Fentanyl was much more

64
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,600
potent, came on quicker and it was dosed in micrograms, right? So now you're, you're, you're

65
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:20,280
talking about like, it's, it's a lot smaller dose. And, you know, it was a very good drug

66
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,880
for pain and sedation. So, you know, if a patient was having even something like a colonoscopy,

67
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,400
for example, you would use maybe a hundred micrograms of Fentanyl. So that's 0.1 milligram

68
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,640
and say a couple milligrams of another drug called Versed that kind of, you know, makes you drowsy

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,520
and makes you forget what's going on. Anesthesiologists use this all the time in the operating

70
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,240
room. So it's one part of anesthesia is the, is the pain part is the Fentanyl.

71
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,080
But again, I never knew it existed outside of a liquid form. And I had no idea that it was being

72
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,000
put into other drugs. So when did that transition take place? What is it about

73
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,160
this drug? And I guess we could maybe, why don't you explain to people how these drugs work and why

74
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,280
we're even having this discussion. What's the problem with them? Is it just that they make

75
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,480
people high and it's bad to be high? No. So you explained it perfectly. How powerful this

76
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,760
Fentanyl is, right? When you're talking micrograms, and that's the difference between the Fentanyl

77
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,880
that you would get, you, the doctors would prescribe, right? And what the Mexican cartel's

78
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,720
making in their labs in Mexico, right? The difference is what they're making is synthetic

79
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:45,240
opioid, right? So the same molecular, whatever that is, molecular, whatever structures is all

80
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,800
the, is all the same. It's just that they don't need the poppy plant to make it right. So that's,

81
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,800
that's the difference. The big difference is the dosage. They don't know how to control the dosage.

82
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,800
And I don't think they really grasp how powerful Fentanyl is. And when we're talking two milligrams

83
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,440
can kill you, right? So Oh my God, two milligrams would, I mean, that's, that's a beyond lethal

84
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,880
dose, right? Beyond lethal dose. And that's where we're seeing more and more of that as we're

85
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,360
learning as we get more toxicology back from these victims. And tell, tell folks just so they

86
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,760
understand like, why does this drug kill you? Is it giving people heart attacks or what is the

87
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,280
actual thing that's killing people? Yeah. So how it works is when you, when you take the Fentanyl

88
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,640
and it has a lethal dose and it basically attacks your respiratory system, right? It slows everything

89
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,600
down that you get that euphoric high, but you don't realize that it's shutting your body down.

90
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,480
And once your respiratory system starts shutting down, your heart rate starts going down and you're

91
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,400
can be dead in an instant. And that's how powerful and scary this stuff is.

92
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,840
Yeah. And I'll tell you, even in the hospital, we saw that that was not uncommon in a,

93
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,000
in a hospitalized patient that you accidentally gave too much. You know, you, you misjudged a

94
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,800
person's sensitivity and you gave them a hundred milligrams, when a hundred micrograms, I'm sorry,

95
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,480
when they probably should have only had 50 or 75 because you didn't understand some other factor

96
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,840
about them. And all of a sudden they would slow down their breathing rate to the point where

97
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,160
you would either have to put a breathing tube in them to breathe for them,

98
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,120
or you would have to give them something like Narcan to reverse the effect. And again, there

99
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,320
were actually examples in the hospital I trained in where patients had narcotic overdoses completely

100
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,760
by accident, but due to the potency of these drugs, especially to fentanyl, much less common

101
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,080
with morphine, more common with fentanyl. And so you think, gosh, if that can happen in a hospital,

102
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,040
how much more likely is it if you get this dosing schedule wrong outside the hospital? And as we're

103
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,600
about to discuss, they're not off by 10 or 20%. I mean, they're off by an order of magnitude

104
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,440
in this. So, okay, so let's go back in time, right? So, and again, think about this over the

105
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:09,320
course of your career. What was the bread and butter of the DEA and law enforcement when it

106
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,160
came to illicit drugs? Like when I think about this, I'm thinking it's cocaine, it's marijuana,

107
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:24,680
methamphetamines, like heroin, right? Those would be your big four. When did it turn into

108
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:33,880
other drugs like Percocet and legal drugs, but being used illicitly and sold illegally?

109
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,840
When did that transition take place? I think when you look back at it, I think it's 2010, 2011,

110
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,240
when you started seeing the pain management doctors recklessly prescribing the oxycodone,

111
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,960
the Vicodins, the Percocets, and there was no regard for anybody. That's how powerful all these

112
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,280
pills are. People get addicted to it, right? So that's why a lot of people when they have

113
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,200
surgery, they don't like taking these pain pills because they're so addictive. They're afraid they're

114
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,280
getting hooked on them. And once we started seeing that 2010, 2011, people would doctor hop.

115
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,960
One doctor wouldn't prescribe, they'd go find another doctor. And once they found that doctor,

116
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,920
they would continue to go back to them and they would just stockpile the stuff, right? So

117
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,760
we started seeing that probably 2010, 2011, that the opioid addiction was pretty prevalent. And I

118
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:34,680
think this is where this is the fallout of it, right? So the Fentanyl game has just elevated

119
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:42,040
the opioid crisis to a whole just entire new level. And why is it that we think that Fentanyl

120
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,120
is being even put into these things? I mean, I guess one of the things I understood from

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:54,280
your talk was that once the military and police authorities kind of cracked down on Mexican

122
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,000
cartels, the poppy fields are getting harder and harder to grow, but you can now make this stuff

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,360
synthetically, presumably that's cheaper, less labor, easier to do.

124
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,400
Correct. Did that immediately shift production to China?

125
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,240
So when the Mexican cartels, when they found out about what China was doing over there,

126
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,720
they started buying the precursor chemicals from China to start making this, again, it's synthetic.

127
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,080
So it's an illicit pure Fentanyl, right? So they want control of the drug game. They want that.

128
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,240
And it's much cheaper for them to make the Fentanyl than it is to cocaine, the heroin,

129
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,240
the methamphetamines, simply because they don't have to worry about the poppy plants. They don't

130
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,800
have to worry about the weather. They don't have to worry about the labor. They don't have to worry

131
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,520
about a variety of things when they're trying to grow the poppy plants. So when they found out,

132
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,040
they can make it synthetically and make it just with chemicals. That's when they started buying

133
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,360
from India and China. What we're learning now and what I've heard is they're starting to make the

134
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,920
precursor chemicals themselves in Mexico as well, which is obviously making it cheaper. They don't

135
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,080
have to buy it from overseas so they can make it much cheaper and much faster. And once they get

136
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,040
that Fentanyl by the kilo, they just ship it across to the counter ports here in the US. Yeah.

137
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,320
It's the same. Maybe before we go any further, because there's so much more I want to probe on

138
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:23,640
this. Let's kind of bring it back to a story. So we'll show a video now that you shared that

139
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:31,160
night when you gave the presentation here at the school district about the parents of a boy who

140
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:39,000
lost his life. So let's let folks watch that now. Yeah. This is Kevin McConville. He was 17 years old.

141
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,560
And he was my baby boy, my pride and joy. Born May 9th, 2005.

142
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:00,680
Amazing kid, full life and loved the outdoors. Very creative.

143
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,880
Was playing a career in the military and possibly becoming a welder. He would have been a senior

144
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:18,200
this year. He has a little sister that he loves very much. The night of August 2nd,

145
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,120
he asked if there was any more pizza and I told him no, unfortunately, and I could make him his

146
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,480
tuna. And he said no. He said I'm just gonna go upstairs and go to sleep. And I said I love you.

147
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,800
He said I love you too.

148
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:46,600
The following day, I found him in his bed, asleep. What appeared to be asleep.

149
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,960
But he was gone. And I couldn't bring him back.

150
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,720
Later, we found out that after their investigation, they said that there was a pill found next to

151
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:11,480
Kevin in an Altoids tin can with a pill in a bag. It was a light blue colored pill with the M30

152
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,400
logo stamped into it. And they said they're believed to be fentanyl. These are the counterfeit

153
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:27,400
pills that are going around. I contacted one of his friends shortly after he had passed away

154
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:35,400
to let him know that Kevin was gone. He was very heartbroken. And he had told us

155
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,320
that Kevin confided in him that he was taking Percocet and Xanax to help him sleep.

156
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,000
I think one of his, I don't want to call him a friend. I can't call him a friend,

157
00:15:51,800 --> 00:16:01,480
um, was doing it as well. And that friend originally gave him the pills,

158
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:10,120
because he probably confided in that person. And Kevin probably took them before and nothing

159
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:18,040
happened. And so he continued to take them. I can't tell you how many times because I don't know.

160
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,280
But it doesn't matter how many times you could take it. It could be your first time. It could be

161
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:36,680
your last time. And no parent wants to see their child in that position. And that

162
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,680
he looked like he was asleep.

163
00:16:48,040 --> 00:17:03,240
Um, that's it. That's a, that's a hard video to watch. Very hard. That's, and it's powerful,

164
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,560
right? So, um, and that's one of the reasons I put it at the beginning of our presentations,

165
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,800
because I want that to be the attention grabber. I want kids specifically to sit back at their

166
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,000
seats and really bring it home, personalize it a little bit, because that's somebody their age

167
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,400
that has fallen victim. Because not everybody knows somebody that has died from the fit and

168
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,480
all, because it's, although it's very, very prevalent, these deaths really in the kids

169
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,960
hasn't been as prevalent as what we're seeing these days.

170
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,920
I think the other thing that you made a really important point of in your talk is we,

171
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
we really want to talk about these as what they are, right? These are accidental deaths,

172
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:52,120
right? These are not people that are intentionally taking a dose that is so high to end their life.

173
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,000
This is someone who thinks in the case of Kevin, that they're, they're taking something to help

174
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:08,760
them sleep. And then they don't wake up. Right. Um, let's go back to this idea of,

175
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,840
do we know by the way, what dose was in Kevin's system?

176
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,760
I don't, I don't think toxicology has come back on, on, on Kevin's case quite yet. Um,

177
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,440
but as you mentioned, he was taking Xanax, um, or what he believed to be Xanax, um,

178
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,480
because he needed help sleeping. So whatever he was battling personally, um, led him to,

179
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,960
to seek these pills to help them help him sleep. Um, we all battle our own demons. We all have our

180
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,280
own stories, right? So, um, we don't know what Kevin was dealing with, right? Personally, um,

181
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,680
did he have issues at home that he have, um, was he getting bullied at school? Was he,

182
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,800
girlfriend, just break up with him? Um, is he getting bullied on social media? Just the kids

183
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,280
these days battle so much more than what we had to deal with simply because of social media. Right.

184
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,480
So that's what I tried to relay to these kids is I want to get rid of the stigma. Like let's figure

185
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,160
out why you're making that decision. Why did you, why, why, why were you needing Xanax to sleep in

186
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,000
the first place? And why are you, you seeking this thing out? And it doesn't mean you're druggy.

187
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Yeah. Right. And I, I, I preached that over and over because I'm not trying to do a say no to drugs

188
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,000
talk. I'm trying to personalize it. I'm just trying to bring as much awareness to this crisis

189
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,200
and it is a crisis. Um, and what we're dealing with, um, I want to be able to, um, personalize

190
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,760
it and not, we have to get rid of the stigma. We want kids to be able to come forward and ask for

191
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,080
help and whatever Kevin was dealing with, um, he led him to take these pills. His parents had no

192
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,000
idea what was going on, um, until his mom or his dad walked into his room the next morning and he

193
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,640
was lifeless. Um, and they've been very brave. Um, they've joined us in several presentations. Um,

194
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,400
it's very hard for her. Um, but I think it's also good for her and other parents to talk about it.

195
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,680
They're very therapeutic and they're very passionate about saving somebody's life. So, um,

196
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,000
they'll, they'll never know why, right? And that's the hard part for, for, for them. Um,

197
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,040
I still talk to them on a regular basis. Um, and they're actually having the celebration of life

198
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,480
here in May for Kevin back home in Nevada. That's where they moved from. Um, but yeah,

199
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,760
so that's what I really truly want to focus on for not only kids, but adults like why let's figure

200
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,680
out the why, you know, I did the calculation the other day with, I was with my wife and my daughter

201
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,360
and I just did some numbers in the back of it, you know, and does, does my calculation come out

202
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,240
right to you? But by my calculation, every five minutes, someone accidentally overdoses in the

203
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,960
United States, meaning dies as a result of an accidental overdose. Does that sound about right?

204
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,560
Yes. Five minutes sounds pretty accurate. I think I heard that this morning on another,

205
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,160
I just happened to be going to the gym this morning to work out and I popped in my phone and it was a

206
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,040
podcast about fit and all. Like I, I didn't pull it up. I was wicked pretty, it was really being

207
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,200
that I was coming here today to talk about fit and all and that stat was there. So that's it.

208
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I mean, I basically just looked at the last 12 months of CDC data on how many people have

209
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,280
died. And again, it's important to understand this is not including people who overdose as a way to

210
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,560
end their lives. This is people who think they're taking either just a straight up recreational drug,

211
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,240
like cocaine or something that's laced, uh, or two, they take too much of it or they're in the

212
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,400
case of what we're seeing now more and more of those. Do you have a sense of what percentage of

213
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,120
accidental overdose deaths today are attributable to fentanyl directly? Fentanyl is in the drug that

214
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,520
they are taking. Uh, I think two thirds about two thirds. Yeah. And that's what we don't, um,

215
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,960
I catch myself because I, I say overdose a lot, but you, you bring it up again, right? It's a

216
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,040
poisoning. They're not intentionally tried to kill themselves. They're taking a drug for whatever

217
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,040
reason. Um, and they're, they're not waking up. So they're being poisoned, um, by these drug

218
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:17,320
dealers by the Mexican cartel. And that's, um, yeah, it's that, yeah, it's insane. So maybe I'm

219
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,000
silly for trying to apply logic to this, but if I put myself in the hands of, uh, put myself in

220
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,320
the head of the, the drug cartel, the goal is, I mean, they just want to make as much money as

221
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,760
possible. Killing your customers can't be good business. So do they, I mean, I'm asking you a

222
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,520
question you can't possibly answer, but just sort of thinking about this, like, uh, why in the world

223
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,960
haven't they figured out a way to get the doses right? I mean, cause again, they're not off by a

224
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,600
little when they get it wrong, they get it absurdly wrong. As you pointed out, you might as well be

225
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,640
giving these people cyanide pills. If I'm understanding you correctly, there are kids

226
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,080
that are taking two, four, even eight milligrams of fentanyl in a single tablet.

227
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,600
Yeah. Yes. And that's very scary. Just so people understand, like this is a hundred times a lethal

228
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,920
dose that you might as well have cyanide. Yeah. One of our, one of our, uh, 15 year olds that passed

229
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,200
away in August, August 21st, Noah, Noah Rodriguez, um, a sophomore at Johnson high school, um,

230
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,200
was this is Janelle's. This is Janelle's son. Yeah. We're gonna, we're gonna link. We won't

231
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,720
watch that video now cause it's a bit long, but it's, it's very moving. We'll link to Janelle's

232
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:48,280
talk, which we saw at the district there. Yeah. So yeah. He, uh, he took some Percocet,

233
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:55,800
what he believed to be Percocet. Um, and his mom got a call at midnight, August 21st, um,

234
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,080
to someone screaming on the other end of the line, say, Noah, we believe Noah's overdosed. We believe

235
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,120
he overdosed. So I'm doing CPR. Um, Janelle was in Buda. Um, the overdose of the poisoning took place

236
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,600
down in San Marcos. So by the time she got there, her mom and dad had already made it to the scene.

237
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,640
She got out of the car and her mom just shook her head saying he's, he's, he's gone. Um,

238
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:26,600
what she has since learned, as you mentioned, um, Noah had eight milligrams of fentanyl in his,

239
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:33,080
in his system. Um, they got toxicology back just a week or two ago. Um, and it was pure illicit

240
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,760
fentanyl that was in his system. That's four times the amount that, that it takes to kill somebody.

241
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,880
It's insane. It makes no sense. You brought up, why did they, I get, I get that question all the

242
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,520
time. Every press, like why are they killing their customers? And to me,

243
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,640
it's happening so often they don't care what they do. Um, obviously they don't want four kids to

244
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,520
die in a four, in a four week timeframe, because that's when they get the attention of the DEA and

245
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,880
other law enforcement. But if they kill a person here or a person there to me, they don't care

246
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,240
someone. They don't care. I mean, yeah, there's no question that they care, uh, care about the kids.

247
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,600
I just think even if you were thinking about this through the lens of

248
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,840
having a business empire, how about just floating below the radar and not killing anybody? Um,

249
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,560
and as you said, I mean, the numbers are exploding. So

250
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,560
10 years ago, if you said to me, what is the greatest threat to a young person's life?

251
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,760
A young person, I mean under 40. I said, it's two things. It's only two things that matter.

252
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,240
Everything else is noise. Only two things that matter is dying in a car accident and suicide.

253
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,840
You're going to take your own life or you're going to die in a car. And again,

254
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,200
we can get into all the wise. It's alcohol. It's, you know, a whole bunch of reasons.

255
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:02,840
But as you know, today, accidental overdose dominates those two, like they're now the

256
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,080
rounding errors in one decade. Yep. And those numbers have gone up exponentially since about

257
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,760
2010, 20. And I just want to make sure listeners understand you're not using the word exponentially

258
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,720
hyperbolically. No, you are absolutely correct. It is not a line. It's an exponential line. 100%.

259
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,600
I think somewhere here, I even have these numbers because I couldn't, I couldn't believe when I saw

260
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:35,320
it, right? Yeah. We're talking in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, just looking at fentanyl seizures,

261
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,600
you go from 200,000 to 1.5 million to 4.1 million to almost 10 million. I mean,

262
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,800
yeah, and you brought it up in 2020, 2021. If you're between the ages, 18 and 45,

263
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,920
fentanyl was the number one killer. It wasn't gun violence. It wasn't car crashes. It wasn't

264
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,240
suicides. It wasn't COVID. It wasn't any of those things. It was fitting all poisonings.

265
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,480
And unfortunately, I think when we get the 2022 numbers back,

266
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,680
that it's not going to be 18 anymore. It's going to be 13 or 14 to 45. And that's,

267
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,280
that's strictly because I believe, and the DA believes that the Mexican cartel are specifically

268
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,040
targeting our young folks. And that's why that we're seeing. Can you say a bit more about what

269
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:26,200
that looks like? How are they doing that? One of the ways they're doing that is they started making

270
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,880
what they, what we've, what we call in law enforcement and DA calls is a rainbow fentanyl

271
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,960
or candy fentanyl. And it's made to look just like candy. It looks, it looks attractive to the young

272
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,560
folks. It looks pretty, right? So it's, it won't kill me. It won't happen to me. And they're also

273
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,000
targeting young folks because they want to get people addicted a lot younger. So they have that

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,840
customer base a lot longer. Tell me what the chain looks like. So you're saying like if 13 year olds

275
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,720
and 10 year olds are potentially now being targeted, you're going to expand your market, right?

276
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,560
What is the, who's the drug dealer in that situation? How is it getting its way from a

277
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:14,280
Mexican cartel to distribute these, you know, much more friendly looking drugs? It's no longer a shady

278
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,880
looking Percocet with a stamp on it. By the way, I think we're going to link to some photos of these

279
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,640
that you shared because this is the other thing that surprised me is how good the counterfeits are.

280
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,680
You can't tell. They're indistinguishable. Yes. It's, I would assume, I always assumed when people

281
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,760
were getting counterfeit Percocet, I was always like, well, they just don't know what real Percocet

282
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,200
looks like. And that's why they're being fooled. But that's not true. This is color matched,

283
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,520
printed, identical, which by the way, Anthony, you'll have to forgive me. This brings me back

284
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:55,320
to my frustration. You figured out how to color match perfectly stamp and manufacture this. And

285
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,000
yet you're off by a dose of a thousand on the active ingredient. It just boggles my mind.

286
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,800
I'll never understand.

287
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,160
But so back to the question, we're now seeing this in middle school. Is that right?

288
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes. As a matter of fact, our most recent death in Hayes County was a middle school student. She's

289
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,920
13 years old. And it's all related back to fitness.

290
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,280
So how did this drug get into, how did she acquire this drug?

291
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,360
Yeah. So basically, the majority of the time, they'll make the illicit pure fentanyl in Mexico,

292
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,160
smuggle it across the border to their counterparts here in the United States. And then it just gets

293
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,560
distributed through every day.

294
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,720
Tell me how that happens, by the way. I'm so ignorant of this.

295
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,680
So the fentanyl is coming over in a powder form?

296
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,840
For the most part, yes. It comes in and it's blocked in a kilo, just like a brick of cocaine

297
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,600
would come across or a kilo of fentanyl. What is the wholesale price for that?

298
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,440
I'd have to look that up to be honest. I don't know what that price is.

299
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,280
But it's cheap compared to a kilogram of cocaine, a kilogram of heroin, a kilogram of any other drug

300
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,080
based on the fact that you get to make it synthetically.

301
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,360
Correct. And they, okay. Yes.

302
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,320
So your feedstock comes to Mexico now from China. They synthetically manufacture pure fentanyl.

303
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,160
It gets shipped and it's cheap as hell. They get it across the border. Again, walk me through that.

304
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,480
What's the most porous part of the border that brings this stuff into the United States?

305
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,680
Vehicles. I mean, in small batches?

306
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,680
It depends, various ways, right? So they'll load cars up, they'll load semis up,

307
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,240
they'll strap it to people's bodies. They'll send it via airplane. Drones are real big now,

308
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,520
getting it across the border. Drones that fly at what altitude?

309
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,840
High enough to get over the wall, high enough to not be detected. They have grown their business,

310
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,240
their business models. I mean, if they were innovated in other ways, we wouldn't have

311
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,400
traffic problems. I mean, it's insane because they're so ahead of the game of law enforcement.

312
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,120
Like some of the stuff's not even getting detected by X-ray. Some of the stuff's not

313
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,360
being detected by narcotic dogs. They're finding various ways to smuggle it in. So when I talk

314
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,800
about the candy fentanyl or the rainbow fentanyl, they're actually smuggling it into the country

315
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,760
inside Skittles, inside nerd boxes, inside. It doesn't have Skittles in it, but it's full of-

316
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,160
Wait a minute. You mean in Mexico, they make things that look like Skittles or they're just

317
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,040
putting pure fentanyl into a Skittles box and shipping the Skittles box?

318
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,560
They're making the fentanyl pills look like a candy.

319
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,080
And putting them into a real candy box.

320
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,040
Into a real candy box.

321
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,680
And then that just comes over in a regular truck.

322
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,560
You would never even know.

323
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,560
So unless you've got a sniffing dog or if you do a random inspection at the border-

324
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,360
You'll never catch it.

325
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,720
I think I heard a stat to where the folks down at the border party intercept 5 to 10%

326
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,960
of the narcotics that go across the board.

327
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,160
It's-

328
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:57,640
Again, not to get so off on these tangents, but is that a staffing issue? Is it simply

329
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,120
a numbers game where unless you're willing to stop and seize every vehicle crossing,

330
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,920
which would of course make transport over the border impossible, you just, that's all you're

331
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,120
doing. That's all you can get.

332
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,960
There's so much of it. And it is a staffing issue, but it's a variety of things. They're so smart and

333
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,640
how they get it across the border that we're not able to detect it. So I heard a stat this morning,

334
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,560
it was between 5 and 10% that they actually were able to intercept at the border. So that leaves

335
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,600
other law enforcement entities throughout the country to try to intercept it.

336
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,320
And just from a jurisdiction perspective, the border seizure is the responsibility of

337
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,000
border patrol or DEA?

338
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,680
It's the border patrol.

339
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,360
So the second they make it across the border, it's a DEA law enforcement issue.

340
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,960
It's in every law enforcement issue, 100%. Once it gets across the border,

341
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,840
yes, it's a DEA, it's the FBI, it's the ATF, it's local law enforcement, federal law enforcement.

342
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,920
It's anybody and everybody that specializes in tackling this narcotic.

343
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:06,360
And just so I understand the logic, they're going to put these things in Skittles because the idea

344
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,360
is a kid that tries one of these Skittles, even if they're 13, is going to get high and getting

345
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,760
high feels good. And they're going to want more of those Skittles. Is the impression that the

346
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,160
kid thinks it's a Skittle or pretty quickly realizes, this is no Skittle, but whatever it is,

347
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,600
I love it and I just want more of it?

348
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,160
Yeah, no, I think they do that specifically just to smuggle it into the country.

349
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,320
I see. Okay. So it's not that they're selling Skittles.

350
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,880
No.

351
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,640
So they're going to break it apart when it's a Skittle and turn it back into pills.

352
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,040
Yes.

353
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,280
Okay.

354
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,320
It'll be, it's a fit and all pill and that's how they'll sell it.

355
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,760
All right. So let's go back to this girl in seventh grade. How did she come into possession

356
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,960
of this stuff? Was it through an older sibling or was she the direct person who got it from a

357
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,280
dealer?

358
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:58,360
I don't know the specifics on her case, but how it works today in today's world, it's social media.

359
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,360
And that's how a lot of this stuff is sold. It's a lot. It's how it's bought. It's social media.

360
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,440
It's Facebook. It's Snapchat. It's Instagram. They're very blatant about, especially on school

361
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,360
campuses. If they bring it to school, all they have to do is put an emoji up on their

362
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,080
Snapchat and they, all the kids know so and so has pills today or they're downloading these

363
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:27,240
encrypted apps, telegram signal to where once these messages are sent and received,

364
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,120
they disappear. So it's hard for us to go back and try to trace where these pills.

365
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,640
That's kind of an issue with Snapchat as well.

366
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,360
Correct.

367
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Yep. So anytime in Hays County that we have an overdose that's fit and all related,

368
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,040
our narcotic folks actually go and respond to that scene to try to get the phones,

369
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,200
talk to the witnesses, talk to the friends to try to figure out. So their sole goal is to try to

370
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,080
trace back where these pills are coming from and to see if they can find out who specifically sold

371
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,440
these pills to these kids to put them in federal prison.

372
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:05,240
The people who are selling pills to kids, do you have a sense of how many steps they are removed

373
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,640
from the guy that receives the brick of fentanyl? Is that two layers, three layers?

374
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,600
It's multiple. It's not a two or three. It's multiple.

375
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,360
There's different plugs in each city. It's just a whole enterprise on how it's distributed

376
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,840
throughout the country. It's pretty insane.

377
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,840
Let's talk a little bit about what happens to a person when they overdose.

378
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,480
There's another video you shared from an elementary school actually. It was a surveillance camera.

379
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,320
Why don't we have folks watch that now? Let's put that on.

380
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:30,440
So again, Anthony, these are hard videos to watch, but I don't think we're going to shy away

381
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,000
from that. I think it is important that people understand how uncomfortable this is.

382
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,520
There's probably a lot of mixed emotions that are going on around the person who stops breathing.

383
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,400
On the one level, there's the obvious fear and panic and, oh my God, what is happening?

384
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,800
On the other level, is there some sense that you get from talking to people who have been there,

385
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:04,040
that there's a hesitation to call police or paramedics for fear of reprimand? Because,

386
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,960
hey, we're obviously doing something wrong.

387
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,600
Yeah. I think that in this particular video, the passenger that wasn't getting poisoned,

388
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,560
I think it was several, 20, 25 minutes, I believe, before he even called 911.

389
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,040
I think that's specifically attributed to not wanting to get in trouble and not believing

390
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,160
his friend is dead. So I think that's the big...

391
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,680
What is the law with regard to that? How clear is the law on prosecution of people who are...

392
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,320
Let's just say someone calls the police immediately, calls the paramedics, everybody shows up.

393
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,240
Are they going to be prosecuted for drug use?

394
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,680
If they're in possession of it?

395
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,640
Yeah, let's say they are.

396
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,400
So if they are in possession of it, yes. We had a young man who overdosed on one of our

397
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:02,840
high school campuses that had, I want to say three or four illicit counterfeit percocet pills on him

398
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,920
at the time he pretty much died in class. And I think that's still in criminal proceedings.

399
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,920
So there, yes, if you're in possession of it, obviously we want to save your life and we'll

400
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,000
deal with the criminal part later. But when you're in possession of it, yes, you're more

401
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,280
likely going to get charged.

402
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:27,800
I know this is beyond both of our pay grades, but I wonder if that's... Is that the right solution

403
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,960
to the problem in that situation? I don't know if you heard this, I just read it this morning.

404
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,480
British Columbia being the latest example of, at least in this case, a province or a state

405
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,480
is decriminalizing from a personal possession standpoint, any drug. So this is going to be

406
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,360
their attempt to say, how are we going to address this problem? Now, it's not entirely clear to me

407
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,160
how that fixes the problem. I can see scenarios where it makes things better. For example,

408
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,960
it would presumably reduce any friction to someone calling for help the moment someone is down,

409
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,480
because you now don't have to fear that you're going to be prosecuted. But I don't know, what

410
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,280
are your thoughts on that? I mean, if you go back to the case of that kid, right, who basically died

411
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,760
in class, it's a miracle he's alive. Again, just taking off your law enforcement hat, just from a

412
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,760
personal sort of philosophical standpoint, do you think that's the right thing to do?

413
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:31,800
I think it's probably on a case by case scenario, from a law enforcement perspective, and there's

414
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,240
laws that we have to follow. Yep, we do. So if we have to end up putting that young man in jail,

415
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,960
it doesn't mean he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail. It doesn't mean he's going to

416
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,880
be in jail. We have to file the appropriate charges, right? But also our main concern

417
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,240
is to make sure he's alive, make sure he gets the help he's needed. So we don't necessarily arrest

418
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,640
him that day, right? So like that young man went to the hospital and got treated. And then we turn

419
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,080
those pills in, get them tested. If it comes back with an illicit narcotic in it, then we would look

420
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:11,480
at filing charges at that time. But filing charges and putting somebody in jail at that immediate

421
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,760
moment is not a priority. Our priority is obviously his life. Yeah. I mean, again,

422
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:24,520
I don't think I'm close enough to the data because I know that Oregon has done this.

423
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,520
They have. You see it now in British Columbia. Portugal did this 20 years ago, right? So Portugal,

424
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,400
I believe, I think it was Portugal, basically decriminalized for any personal possession,

425
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:44,200
any drug. And interestingly, their accidental overdose rate dropped to lower, I believe,

426
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,960
than any country in Europe. Now that said, it is on the rise again, along with this problem. So in

427
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:56,680
other words, the fentanyl is raising all boats at the moment, including even Portugal. And truthfully,

428
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,440
I just don't know where I stand on it because there's a part of me that still thinks that's a

429
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,520
band-aid. And I think what you said at the outset is the problem, even though it sounds like a cop

430
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:11,400
out, it's not. I think it is the problem, which is why do you need fill in the blank drug? 100%.

431
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:19,640
Why do you need Percocet? Why do you need Xanax? Why do you need whatever it is? And without the

432
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,480
answer to that question, I think it gets very difficult to think about this. 100%. I think,

433
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,160
again, it doesn't make you a bad person. If I have to arrest you today because you have three pills

434
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:40,920
on you, I have a job to do. But I still need to treat you with respect. And I need to try to help

435
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,040
you. I'm going to put you in jail today, but when you get out, let's figure out a way to get you the

436
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,520
help you need or find you someone to talk to you to figure out, again, why? Why are you making that

437
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,760
decision? Because that's without that why that person will never be able to get the help that

438
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,640
they need. Specifically, they don't know the why. Do you see that that side of the equation is getting

439
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,840
as much attention like I would like to believe that with all of the attention this is starting

440
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,360
to get. And once you're at the point where every five minutes one of your citizens of a country this

441
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:21,560
size is killing themselves accidentally with poison, that should be enough to get attention.

442
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:28,440
Do you feel that most of that attention is being channeled into seizure, stopping the cartels,

443
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,560
the law enforcement side of it? And do you feel like enough of it is going into that side of it

444
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:40,760
that you're talking about, which is the mental health side? No, no, I don't think so. I think

445
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,240
it's because it's becoming more and more prevalent and more and more people are starting to ask for

446
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,600
help. And we're starting to learn that there's not enough rehab places for these people to go to.

447
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,640
Several kids have come forward at HACI-SD and asked for help. They've talked to their pediatricians,

448
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,480
they've talked to counselors and teachers. And some of the issues they're running into is they're

449
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,040
being told, well, give me six weeks and I'll have you a bed or give me three months and I'll have you

450
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,800
a bed. That's not acceptable. Yeah. Right. So it's not just a law enforcement thing. It's not a school

451
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,840
district thing. It's a community that needs to collaborate together to try to figure out ways to

452
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,560
help everybody, to help the folks that are struggling, right? We're not going to save everybody.

453
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:29,080
We're just not. I've been a cop for 24 plus years. I've arrested many people that have

454
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:36,920
had drugs or put drug dealers in jail. So we're not going to save everybody. The war on drugs,

455
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,080
we're never going to win. We're just not. But if we can take 10 pills off the street a day,

456
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,640
that's what we're seeing now is probably six people that we've saved because six out of every

457
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,520
10 illicit counterfeit pills have enough fit and all to kill somebody. So if we can take 10 pills

458
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,760
off the street, we're potentially saving six lives. And if I can go talk to a group of 300 students

459
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,520
and I can keep one kid from making that decision to take a drug or if I can get one of those kids

460
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,080
who's struggling with an addiction to say, Hey, I need help. Then I think I can sleep well at night

461
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:17,880
knowing that we're doing something to help. So I want to talk about that because I think that's

462
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,120
sort of why we're sitting down here today, which is what I think one of the things that moved us

463
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,240
about kind of your presentation was just how much you were putting of yourself into this,

464
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,760
like how much you're going around, just talking to random parents like us, going to school meetings,

465
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:41,240
doing all this kind of stuff. But it's so much of what you talked about blew my mind. I want to

466
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,160
get to a few more of those things before I come to the nuts and bolts of it. I have a lot of

467
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:51,800
technical questions about Narcan and all that kind of stuff, but I've been hearing some other really

468
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,520
frightening things. So talk to a friend, I don't know, a couple of weeks ago, I was talking to a

469
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,520
friend of mine who goes to Burning Man every year. As you know, Burning Man is a place where a lot of

470
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:07,560
drugs get done. And he said, and maybe I heard him wrong or maybe he got his facts wrong, so maybe

471
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,760
someone listening to this will correct this. But he said that at Burning Man, there were at least

472
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,640
two deaths attributed to fentanyl in drugs that normally would never have fentanyl in them. One

473
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,480
was cocaine and one was ketamine, ketamine of all things. Ketamine is a perfectly legal drug. Now,

474
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,560
probably was being used off label, so to speak. But clearly this was a person who was using

475
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,800
counterfeit ketamine. What is the breadth of drugs that you're seeing this? So we've already

476
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,720
established it's going into every single counterfeit pill out there potentially. So that's

477
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:51,880
going to be all of your pain meds, of which I'm guessing Percocet, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Dilaudid

478
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:58,600
are your big boys. Then you've got it going into the benzos. That's your Ativan, your Ambien,

479
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,240
probably is it going into sleeping pills and stuff as well? Adderall, stimulants, any pill,

480
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,120
anything that's a pill that kids want, they're going to, it's going to be, it's going to be

481
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:13,240
laced. 100%. Okay. That's frightening because I know that I can hear this from my daughter saying

482
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,320
it's not uncommon for kids to say, I need something to help me study. I need something to help me

483
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:23,400
sleep. 100%. Where else is it going? Has this crept its way into anything that has to do with

484
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:30,120
marijuana? Yes. We're talking every illicit recreational drug that's out there, cocaine,

485
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:37,320
heroin, methamphetamines, Mollie Pills, X, marijuana. We haven't seen this particular

486
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:44,360
here in central Texas yet, but DEA says, you guys know how prevalent vapes are throughout the,

487
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,120
throughout the country and all the schools. It's just a matter of time before we start

488
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,720
seeing it in central Texas, but they're starting to see vape, vape pens that have the THC in it,

489
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,000
also contain fentanyl. So any illicit drug, any vape pen. And again, just to be clear,

490
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
there's no reason to do this unless you're trying to get people higher than

491
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:09,240
normal. That's the only reason. Because there's no cost benefit to putting fentanyl into THC.

492
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,480
They're totally different agents. Correct. So they're basically saying we're going to,

493
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,240
we're betting that you're going to like this THC so much more because somehow it's going to get you

494
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:26,120
the marijuana high, which is totally different, right? Right. From the opioid high. And we're

495
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,200
going to make a more addictive product. And yet again, they screw it up and put too much in.

496
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,440
It's a competitive market, right? So they want people to seek them, them being the drug dealers

497
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,360
out for this particular drug. This drug dealer has the strongest cocaine on the market. Everybody

498
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:49,560
go to him or her. These folks are thinking they're taking cocaine, not realizing that when

499
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,560
the pure fentanyl gets here to the country, that the drug dealers on this side of the border

500
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,440
are starting to get fentanyl in all their drugs. So when they sell it, they want their stuff to be

501
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,240
more powerful. They want that street cred because it goes out on social media. So-and-so has the

502
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,400
strong cocaine, go see him or her. And that's, that's the only reason they do it is they want

503
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,680
to stand out about the rest. So is there any drug this has not made its way into yet? No.

504
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,440
So right now we're sitting here in central Texas and hasn't shown up yet, but do you think that's

505
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,000
just a matter of time? In the vapes it has. In the vapes, yes. But fentanyl has been seized.

506
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,120
Yes, yes, yes. I just mean in vapes. Correct. And it-

507
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,760
Is it showing up in cocaine? Is it showing up in other drugs?

508
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:37,480
100%. It's in, it's in co- to me, if you buy cocaine on the streets today, the chances of

509
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:45,240
fentanyl in it is probably 90 to 99% if I had to bet. And most of the time you probably get away

510
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,720
with it because it's not a lethal dose, but you're playing Russian roulette. And every day,

511
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,720
and I bring that up in my presentations, specifically regarding the pills,

512
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,560
because six out of every 10 illicit counterfeit pills has enough fentanyl to kill you. So I,

513
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,480
stress it to the parents and the kids, you're playing Russian roulette by taking a pill that

514
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,200
you don't know where it came from. And that's how, because we're seeing so many deaths and

515
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:16,840
poisonings throughout central Texas and the country that, yes, you're playing Russian roulette

516
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,440
and there's no other way to put it. It's just be blood. Yeah.

517
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:27,240
So let's talk to, I would guess that the majority of people listening to this podcast

518
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:34,040
are parents. That's kind of the demographic. Are they going to share it with someone who's a parent?

519
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,560
Sure. I got to be honest with you. I don't think there's a 13 year old listening to us right now.

520
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,640
I don't think there's a 19 year old listening to us. They don't like listening to cops either.

521
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah. But there are a lot of parents listening to us. So what can we do? So let's start with,

522
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,200
you're just talking to me and my wife. Okay. We've got a 14 year old daughter,

523
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,760
eight year old and a five year old boy. Yep. So that's one of the reasons I'm pretty passionate

524
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,200
about it. I've got kids, right? I got a freshman in high school and a senior in high school.

525
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,440
And I see, I've seen firsthand how it's affected my community.

526
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,200
But as parents, we have to be nosy, right? We have to take off the blinders and we have to say,

527
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,440
we have to stop saying my kid won't do this. Yep.

528
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:21,320
How many of the parents, Anthony, that you've met who have lost a child were so shocked

529
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,480
that it was, I never even knew this was happening versus I'm sure there are some cases where

530
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,440
my son has struggled with drugs his whole life. Yeah. How many are in that former category where

531
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:39,160
they literally are dealing with two complete shocks, the loss of their child and the fact that

532
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:45,160
they had no idea their child was in need or in use of this. How often is it that case? You hear

533
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:51,720
a lot. I don't have an exact percentage, but you hear it a lot. And it may not be because they

534
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:59,240
don't know. It's that they refuse to believe it. Right. And I get it. And it goes back to the

535
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,240
stigma. Like I don't, I'm embarrassed if my kids are doing drugs or I'm embarrassed if my kids are

536
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:11,240
druggy. So I stress the stigma. Like we have to stop with the stigma, to stop with the judging.

537
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,080
And we have to work together as a community to get this as low as possible. We're not going to

538
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,840
get rid of it. But if we can move it around a little bit, then we're doing what we can.

539
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:31,480
But yeah, I hear too much. And as a parent, I catch myself sometimes like, no, not my kid.

540
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,680
But I have to remind myself because I see it so often, like it could be my kid. So

541
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:47,160
social media, both my kids have phones that have social media. Actually, my freshman no longer has

542
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:55,320
social media. But you have to be nosy. How do you do like so. So luckily, my 14 year old is not on

543
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,280
social media. We're going to try to keep it that way as long as possible. But you mentioned it like

544
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,160
emote, you know, this emoji means this, this emoji means that. Is there any chance a parent

545
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,800
is going to figure that out? So when I when I talk about social media to the parents,

546
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:16,360
when I go talk to the PTAs or go to HOA meetings, I stress, if you're going to give your kid a phone,

547
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,400
and if you're going to give your kid social media, you better learn as much as you can about every

548
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,000
single app that's out there. Because I guarantee you, your kid knows more about that app than you

549
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,960
do. Right. So if you give them Snapchat, you better have it on your phone as well. And you better

550
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,120
learn as much as you possibly can and figure out the tips and tricks that they probably know

551
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:43,080
on how to hire things. They're always going to be more technology savvy, technical savvy than we are.

552
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:49,400
But it's our duty as parents, if we're going to hold them responsible for that we have we have

553
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,520
to learn about it. And I stress that so much. Because there's so many it's not only the apps,

554
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,800
it's the games, the roadblocks, it's the the encrypted app, signal, telegram. So I just I

555
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:04,760
try to put as much information in my presentation in regards to social media, just so it gives

556
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:10,280
parents something to think about. And I showed that and we'll link to a lot of these videos in this

557
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,040
as well. So perfect. We're gonna have people gonna leave all these resources in there for folks to go

558
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:25,240
to. Tell us about Narcan. So, you know, we used to use Narcan in the hospital. Mostly the use was at

559
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:31,080
the end of surgery if a patient needs to be brought back and you mistimed the opioid dose,

560
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,280
you know, you would use it. But sometimes you would, you know, a lot of times you'd use it in

561
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,160
the situation I described earlier, which is, oh, you accidentally gave that person, you know,

562
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,680
120 or 125 micrograms of fentanyl. But in reality, that was a bit too much for them. Their breathing

563
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:51,960
rate is slowing. We got to back that off. I've already forgotten how long Narcan lasts for.

564
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,920
But what is the approximate, like if you if a kid is down and you give them Narcan,

565
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,800
are they out of the woods? Or is there a chance that the drug they have so much drug in them,

566
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,200
that even though they start breathing again, they're going to crash?

567
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,720
Yeah, that's, that's one of the things we try to talk about. Because kids have started going out

568
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,680
and buying Narcan and carrying it with them and saying, hey, I'm going to pop this pill. Can

569
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,640
talk to their friend at home on Narcan. I'm going to snort this pill. If I fall out, can you please

570
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,600
shoot me up? What they're not know what they really don't understand is this fentanyl is so

571
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,680
powerful. It's not one, one injection in Narcan or one nasal spray in Narcan is not helping,

572
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,240
because it's so fast acting. And I don't think there's a set time because everybody's different,

573
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:43,240
right? Everybody, you know, is built differently, metabolism different. So there's not a set,

574
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:48,280
there's not a set time. I try to explain that in my presentation as well. But if you, the quicker

575
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,760
you get Narcan into that person's system, the better chance they have to live. Right. So,

576
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,720
but what we're seeing in a lot of these overdoses and poisonings throughout Hayes County is one,

577
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,440
one injection is not working. We had a kid two weeks ago, they took 15 doses of Narcan.

578
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:08,120
15 doses in the field, in the field before they were.

579
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,760
It's just to play ignorant. I'm sorry. Paramedics are not yet there or they're,

580
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,600
they're there, but they don't want to intubate yet.

581
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,760
Correct. Paramedics are there. They're not deputies throughout Hayes County care Narcan as

582
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,200
well. So usually, if we're first there and we know it's a fit and all related overdose or poisoning.

583
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Presumably you're just giving Narcan no matter what.

584
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,720
Correct. The guy can drunk.

585
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,120
It's so prevalent.

586
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,080
And you're just going to give them.

587
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,240
Yeah. Because it's not going to hurt them if it's right or not. Right. So we, we try to, you know,

588
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,640
play it safe. And if we even suspect there might be some kind of poisoning, we're going to shoot

589
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,240
them up with Narcan. It's very easy.

590
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,880
And how do you do, do you do intramuscular or intranasal?

591
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,760
It's an asyl. Yeah. It's like, just like an afferent. If you have your battle, allergy is

592
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,800
the same thing. And, but the stuff is so powerful. And depending on how long it's been,

593
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,040
their respiratory system could have slowed down to where the Narcan is not going to get through.

594
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,960
So that's where the CPR comes into play. Not only with the Narcan injection, but the CPR just to

595
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,080
get the blood flowing again. And that way the Narcan can get in there and attach to these opioids.

596
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:13,160
So should parents, I mean, lesson number one we're taking away is be, be really hypervigilant

597
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,680
about social media and understand. I mean, I've read horror stories of, you know, yeah,

598
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:24,200
drug dealers on Snapchat are basically offering dropdown menus, right? It's like, do you need

599
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,040
something to make you feel happy? Do you need something to help you sleep? Do you need something

600
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:35,000
to help you study? I mean, it's very banal language. And then, but every one of them is fentanyl.

601
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,400
It's some derivative of fentanyl into some other pill. It's different. It's going to be stamped as

602
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,600
a different pill. And then these kids die. And, you know, the few times that kids have taken

603
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,240
screenshots of their Snapchat is the only way that these stories are coming to light where you're

604
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,680
making the clear link to, Hey, this, this, this innocent little high school kid is sitting there

605
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,760
studying and, you know, wanted something to help them study, you know, wanted Adderall and wanted

606
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:07,880
this thing there. And that's life is over. So that's lesson one. How long does Narcan last?

607
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,720
Does it have any expiration date on it? I don't, I don't, I don't think so. You don't worry about.

608
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,560
So, so is it something parents should have in their house? Is it something kids should be

609
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,400
carrying around with them in case they, if the kids at a party, would you, if your kids are going

610
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,160
to a party, would you, would you tell them to carry Narcan in case something goes wrong with,

611
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,640
with some of the kids there? I have mixed feelings about that. But I tell the parents,

612
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:34,120
if you, if you have kids, middle school or above, have Narcan at home somewhere where you can find

613
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:39,880
it under stress, we all react differently under stress. So it's very important to, to have Narcan

614
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,800
on hand. Don't have it in the box, in the garage, in the top corner where you need the ladder to go

615
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,880
up and get it. Have it somewhere where you know, 100% where it's going to be. And you're able to use

616
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:54,120
it right away because it may not be your kid that's, that's battling whatever they're battling,

617
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,560
but little Johnny could, could be spending the night with you that weekend and hanging out with

618
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:03,080
your son or daughter for the weekend. But you don't know that he or she is battling anxiety.

619
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,120
You don't know that their parents are going through divorce. You don't know if that person

620
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,920
gets bullied or they simply need medication to help them sleep. And they've gotten pills off the

621
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,440
street because they're going to go spend the night at somebody's house and they're battling anxiety.

622
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:19,320
So it may, it may not be your kid, but if somebody's spending the night at your house and they go into,

623
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,240
they start getting poisoned and they start, you know, showing signs over and over dose,

624
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,000
if you don't have Narcan on hand, you know, you're going to feel really bad.

625
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Can Narcan be purchased without a prescription?

626
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,760
Yes. You can go to any, you can go to websites, the federal government will mail it to you.

627
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,440
It's becoming more and more prevalent. You can go to Walgreens and buy CVS.

628
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:36,840
Okay.

629
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,240
CVS 100.

630
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,840
So we should all be just going out buying Narcan, having it in the kitchen drawer where it's

631
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,040
under any situation you can access it.

632
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,920
It's sad that we have to do that, but it's, it's the world we live in.

633
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,240
But it's like, you almost think of this like you, I mean, we have, you know, fire extinguishers and

634
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,160
fire blankets in the house in case one day the grill catches on fire or there's an oil fire.

635
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:01,240
So you just sort of have it. Tell me why you have mixed feelings about if your, if your

636
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:06,440
son is going to a party and let's just assume, even though we should never assume that you feel

637
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,320
very confident that, you know, your son's going to break some rules, but not this rule, right?

638
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,320
Your son's probably going to have a beer, but he's, he's, he's not going to take a pill that

639
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,600
he doesn't know what it is. Do you, do you worry that that's sort of, well, tell me what your

640
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:26,760
reservation is. Yeah. To me, it's almost like you're given permission, right? But in the, in

641
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:32,200
the same hand, it's almost like the designated driver, that, that Narcan is your designated

642
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,560
driver. So I guess if you're going to take drugs, you're doing it responsibly, right? I guess, but

643
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:44,280
they're legal, right? Well, I'm not even thinking, I was just thinking more of, you know,

644
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,280
you're not even saying to your kid, like, it's okay to take drugs. You're saying,

645
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,480
if somebody else does and they get into trouble, you could almost do it through a selfish lens,

646
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:01,160
which is, I don't want you to have to experience this tragedy that will change your life forever.

647
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,520
And it will. You know, you watch a video like that one we saw and you think like,

648
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:10,280
yeah, it's, there's two lives that are lost. There's the kid who dies and there's the kid who

649
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:18,200
watched. 100%. And if you can take that away. Yep. Um, yeah. And that aspect, 100%. Yeah. Um,

650
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,960
completely on board with it. What I have mixed feelings about is.

651
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,280
Yeah. Take the, take your drugs and have your Narcan. Yeah. Hey, hold my Narcan. Like that's

652
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,520
where I have mixed feelings. As do I, because, and my mixed feelings aren't even ethical. They're

653
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,600
practical, which is how do you know your buddy's going to give you the Narcan correctly? How do

654
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,080
you know you have enough? Like there's a whole, I mean, to me that's, you know, that's, that's,

655
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:45,480
you're, you're really playing with fire in a dangerous way there. 100%. Um, Anthony,

656
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,400
anything else parents can be thinking about here to, cause I have to be honest with you,

657
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,480
there's a part of me that's, and maybe this is just the, the skeptic in me that's thinking,

658
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,440
wait, Peter, don't overreact to this. Don't freak out. Don't, you know, cause I mean,

659
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,640
I mean, of course you can believe it. I had a discussion with our eight year old,

660
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,240
right? And I'm like, okay, Reese, if anybody ever gives you candy at school, unless it's in the

661
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,000
wrapper, you don't eat it. You know, I'm going down the path of, I don't know how you're, you,

662
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,960
I don't know if you're as old as I am, Anthony, but I don't know how old are you?

663
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,600
47.

664
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,760
Yes. Yeah. I'm older than you, but I bet you still remember when we were kids,

665
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,920
do you remember all the panic about app? Never eat an apple at Halloween.

666
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,760
100% of razor blades in it.

667
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,400
I talk about that in my presentation because of the, the candy fit and all. Yeah. Right. It was

668
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,720
just right before Halloween, I would get the question all the time at every presentation.

669
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,800
Should I let my kids go trick or treating or can I go trick or treating? And what I told them is

670
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,400
like your neighbor's not trying to poison you. Go out and have a good time. Let your kid go trick

671
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,160
or treating. But then I referenced the eighties when I was trick or treating. Yeah. I had to come

672
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,840
home and dump it out because of the razor blades. Yeah. But yeah.

673
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,920
So you grew up in Texas, I grew up in Canada. It's amazing to think that everybody was putting

674
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,160
razor blades and apples apparently across the globe, right? It probably happened three times,

675
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:06,040
right? And yet it somehow created a moral panic. And I think that I guess I think about this

676
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,120
sometimes, right? Is where, where is the line here? And I think when I look at these stats,

677
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,920
it's hard to say this is a moral panic, right? Like when you think of other examples of moral

678
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,680
panics, things that were like, what was the most common? What was, there was a very prominent one,

679
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,880
right? Which was like all the satanic cults that were like killing babies all over the place.

680
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,000
Remember that whole thing? That was kind of another eighties weird thing along with,

681
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,480
turned out not to even be the case. This is different, right? This is real.

682
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,960
You have the bodies, the body bags there, you've got more than a hundred thousand body bags in

683
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,680
the past 12 months. It'll be very interesting to see what the 2022 numbers are.

684
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:50,680
I keep waiting for those to come and I'm, I don't know if I'm, I'm not looking forward to them

685
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:56,760
because I know they're going to be scary, but they're real. And this is not a panic. This is,

686
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,080
I'm not trying to scare people, right? When I, when I go and talk to them, I just tell them what I,

687
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:07,960
what I know and try to just to, because it's real, it's not going anywhere. It's going to

688
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,720
become more and more prevalent. And unfortunately we're going to start seeing stuff that's stronger

689
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,520
than fentanyl because they're starting to change different structures and the molecule structure to

690
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,640
make stuff stronger than fentanyl. We, we haven't seen it in central Texas,

691
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,120
but up and down the East coast, they've seen like nytosines and I think it's called isotopes or

692
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,280
some other stuff that's, there's another variant of it called Sufentanil that is,

693
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:35,000
Sufentanil, carfentanil. Yeah. Sufentanil is like insanely potent. I was told from somebody

694
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:43,160
on the inside that it's the single greatest regret of the FDA was that they, that they

695
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:51,320
authorized Sufentanil as a, so Sufentanil I think is technically a schedule two drug, meaning it's,

696
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:58,360
you know, highly, highly controlled, but still medically can be used, you know, for like cancer

697
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,000
patients and things like that. But, but I, I've been told that they have enormous buyer's remorse

698
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:10,360
at having authorized it or, or, or allowing it to, to become legal in that setting because it's,

699
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:15,720
you know, it makes fentanyl look weak. Correct. And you've sort of opened up an awful Pandora's box.

700
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,200
Correct. I think in that, in that aspect is they're also trying to create the Narcan,

701
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:26,120
like a super Narcan to try to battle what's coming. And unfortunately,

702
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,280
it's just a matter of time before we start seeing that here in central Texas.

703
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:38,200
Yeah. Anything else, Anthony, that you want to, you want to get across to, I think specifically

704
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:43,080
to parents, either for them directly or things that they can talk with about their kids. I think,

705
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:48,520
you know, obviously the most important lesson I take away from this is being very open with your

706
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:55,000
kids. I mean, the first thing that I think we said to our daughter was like anything you have

707
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,200
a question about, just let's just talk about it. Cause I'm not going to give you sort of like a

708
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,640
legal answer. I'm going to give you a medical answer. Right. Right. I'm not going to tell you

709
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,360
this is right or wrong. I'm just going to give you the medical, like this is the no judgment view of

710
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:14,440
what this is. Correct. I don't know if that's enough. It's something though. And that's what

711
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:20,200
I don't think probably enough parents are doing. So like I said, I have two kids, have two daughters

712
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:26,120
and I, I've seen so much in my 24 years of law enforcement. There's a ton of stuff that I want

713
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:33,000
to unsee. But I've always been upfront with them about the world and what I encounter and what's

714
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,560
out there on the street because I want them to know, and I'm not trying to scare them. I want them

715
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:45,320
to know exactly what's going on and how it affects you. So we need to start in elementary

716
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,480
school. You mentioned talking to your eight year old. It's huge. Like the schools out in Hays

717
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:56,680
County have started hanging signs and posters that are age appropriate, talking about pills,

718
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:01,000
talking about fit and all to where that conversation is starting at a younger and younger and younger

719
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,720
age. We haven't gone into the elementary schools and talk to the kids, but we go and talk to the

720
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:11,400
parents. We go to the PTAs. We hold public presentations because I want those kids,

721
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:17,800
the parents of those elementary school to start having those conversations at that age, because

722
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,920
if that's where we'll start seeing the difference, if the knowledge, the more knowledge they have,

723
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,880
the more right decisions I think will be made. And again, I don't try to scare people. I don't,

724
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,600
I don't, high school kids don't want to want me to go up on stage and preach to them.

725
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:39,240
I just try to humanize the badge as much as I can and just try to show them that I care about

726
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:45,560
you guys. And because it affects first responders too, right? Because we go, we go to these calls

727
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,640
and we can never unhear the mom screaming because they're kids lifeless on the ground.

728
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:57,320
And I can't unsee that, right? And that affects not only officers, but firefighters, paramedics,

729
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,880
doctors. That's the stuff that we don't want to deal with either. We don't, we don't have to

730
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,240
experience that. We sign up for it. Yes. And we're going to try to save everybody. But

731
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,520
yeah, just start, just have those conversations as much as possible. I never,

732
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,640
never not think that your kid won't do that. Right. And just be nosy. Really. You just have to be nosy

733
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:26,280
unfortunately. And never believe your kid won't do it. I just have to stress that a lot because

734
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,720
I've heard it too many times. I can't believe that happened. I never, I never knew my kid would

735
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:36,760
never do that. And as parents, we want to believe that, right? I don't want to believe my kid

736
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:44,280
did, did, did what they did, but they did. Let's figure out why. Right. And just, you know, your

737
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:50,840
kid better than anybody. If you start seeing the different signs, their friend groups are changing,

738
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,000
the grades start suffering. They're losing too much weight. They're gaining too much weight.

739
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:02,520
Um, just, you know, when your kid's off, right? Um, I mentioned my, my freshman not having social

740
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:08,040
media. Like I, I gave her social media at a too young of age because I tried to compare her to

741
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,920
my older daughter who was much more mature and it affected her because she battles anxiety,

742
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,720
depression, some other things. And, um, I took social media away from her. And probably about

743
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,200
a two months ago, she came up to me and she was like, dad, I want to thank you for taking, um,

744
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,400
Tik TOK away from me because I'm so much happier. I didn't realize how much it affected me because

745
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,560
all she would do is sit in her room and scroll. Right. And it's just mindless stuff that, and

746
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:38,360
it's so, it holds so much power over your kids. Just be mindful of that. And, and, you know,

747
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,840
you get to know your kids, you know, it sounds funny to say you should know your kids, but some

748
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,880
parents, they don't, right? Get to know your kids. And when you start seeing something's off,

749
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,960
start having those conversations. You know, the way I think about what you're doing,

750
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:58,040
Anthony is, um, I think of, um, you're a guy walking down a beach and it's not just you,

751
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,720
there are a lot of people doing this, but I think, you know, the, this has become your life's mission

752
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:07,640
now. And you, you're a guy walking down a beach with another guy. I'm borrowing this from a story

753
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:15,560
and there's a hundred thousand starfish washed up on the beach and you're walking with this guy

754
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,880
and you're picking them up and you're every few steps, you pick one up and you throw it back in

755
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:25,640
the ocean. And the other guy says to you, Anthony, what are you doing? And you said, well,

756
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,920
the tide is out and all these hundred thousand starfish on this beach are going to die if they

757
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:36,600
don't get back in the water. You pick one up, throw it in. Guy looks at you funny and he says,

758
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,880
Anthony, you can't possibly save all these starfish out here. You can't possibly make a difference.

759
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,120
You pick up another starfish, you throw it in, you go, made a difference to that one.

760
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:52,680
And so I don't, I don't, I don't know how many you're going to save, but if you save a hundred,

761
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:59,960
right? If, if, if through your work, a hundred lives are saved, that's a hundred lives that are

762
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:06,040
saved. Most people go their whole lives, don't save a life. Yeah. So I want to thank you for what

763
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,800
you're doing. I want to thank you for taking time on a weekend to come here and talk with me about

764
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,200
that. And we're going to put in the show notes for this. We're going to have all sorts of

765
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,360
additional resources based on anything that you, you tell us we should link to for other folks.

766
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,040
So thank you, Anthony. I appreciate you having me. Thank you so much. That means a lot.
