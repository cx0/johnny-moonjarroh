00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Hey, Michael. Thanks for coming all the way out to Austin to work on some DNS for a few

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,840
days with me and Beth.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,280
Thanks for having me. Thank you.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,520
Been wanting to sit down for quite a while. And obviously the events of 2020 kind of got

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,920
in the way of that. But maybe just start for folks by giving a little bit of your background.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,840
You grew up in Northern California, right?

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,400
Yeah, grew up in Northern California and eventually went to school down in San Diego

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
at UC San Diego.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,200
What sports did you play growing up?

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:56,880
My primary sport or the sport that I was most passionate about was tennis. And interested

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,560
in that from an early age and played other sports, other organized sports. But tennis

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,880
was the one that I was drawn to and had the passion for. So early on, specialized in that,

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:21,560
played lots of junior tennis tournaments, trained a lot, eventually played in college.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:33,280
And that obsession or passion kind of drove me to the way that I practice today. I'm a

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,920
chiropractor. I'm based out of San Diego, California, as you know. I kind of specialize

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,880
in rehabilitation, sports medicine. I am also, so I have the private practice there. I'm

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,840
fortunate enough to also be able to spend some time on the PGA Tour and the World Surf

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,360
League Tour as part of their sports medicine crew or team. And also fortunate enough to

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:12,600
be part of USA Surfing Performance Committee, helping with assessing and training the US

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,920
athletes, the surfing athletes for the upcoming Olympics.

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Cool. Today, obviously, the thing we want to talk about is this super kind of deep dive into

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,880
something called dynamic neuromuscular stabilization. Now, folks listening to this have

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,880
probably heard me talk about this in the past. If they follow me on social media, they'll notice

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:41,600
from time to time I'm doing movements that probably look a little silly. Sometimes working

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,480
with you or working with Beth or working with another colleague of ours, Michael Stromsness,

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,320
is actually how we all met. But I think for the purpose of this discussion, let's assume a

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:03:00,720
person has never heard of DNS, has never heard of the Prague School or any of these things. Can you,

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:11,240
in a somewhat succinct but not terribly brief manner, explain to people how all of this school

30
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:18,880
of rehabilitation coalesced around this idea of what we call DNS? So going back to the founding

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,680
fathers of the Prague School and what these various insights were that each of them had and

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,960
how that came together.

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:38,440
Okay, so DNS or dynamic neuromuscular stabilization built on some pioneers of functional

34
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:46,800
rehabilitation. There's many that have been part of the Prague School of Rehabilitation, but I

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:56,040
think talking about the influence on the development of dynamic neuromuscular stabilization by

36
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:05,560
Professor Pavel Kolodz, who runs the rehabilitation department at Prague School at this time. I think

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:18,600
we need to go back post World War II, Cold War era 1950s is where Prague School of Rehabilitation was

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:29,320
really founded. And it was founded as part of the medical faculty of Charles University in Prague, in

39
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Czech Republic, or formerly Czechoslovakia, and now Czech Republic. And being post World War II, Cold

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:51,040
War era, so they were in Eastern Europe behind the wall. That may have been a factor for their, not

41
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:00,880
reliance, but tendency towards the use of observation in both diagnosis, both observation and

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,680
palpation for diagnosis and treatment. All three of these pioneers were neurologists.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,960
And who were the three?

44
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:22,840
So the three of Vladimir Yanda, Karl Levitt and Belklav Vojta. Professor Yanda, he had a keen sense of

45
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:35,680
observation. And he formulated concepts and principles that tied into postural habituation,

46
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,000
specifically the tendency for specific musculature to tend towards tightness and other musculature to

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,960
tend towards weakness. And he termed this upper cross and lower cross syndrome. So for example,

48
00:05:50,960 --> 00:06:01,120
with an upper cross syndrome, meaning the neck and shoulder region with demands of life and the

49
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,840
tendency towards postural habituation, such as with sustained seated postures, there's a tendency

50
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:16,000
towards the muscles in the back of the neck, the occipital muscles, the sternocleidomastoid muscle,

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,040
which is the muscle that also attaches to the skull and down to the sternoclavicular joint,

52
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:31,920
the pec muscles, the upper traps, that musculature would tend towards a tightening or overactivation.

53
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,280
Other musculature in the upper extremity, the serratus, which attaches to the ribs and in the

54
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:47,680
back of the scapula, the deep neck flexors, the middle and lower traps would have a tendency to

55
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:58,080
tend towards a weakness. And with that tendency towards overutilization or hypertonicity and

56
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,880
underutilization, inhibition, weakness, he also recognized that that would affect the

57
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,160
quality of movement throughout the kinematic chain and subsequently would lead to overload

58
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,760
in specific areas throughout that kinematic chain. So that was a big contribution on his part,

59
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,720
his colleague. Where would those places of overload be? So if you have this tightness in

60
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,680
the muscles you've described, the weakness in the muscles you've described, what is the consequence

61
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,960
of that? Where does that load get distributed? Right. So with that imbalance and that postural

62
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,360
tendency towards postural habituation, you would see a tendency to overload in the transitional

63
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:59,040
areas throughout the spine and throughout the extremity. So it didn't go into the specifics for

64
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,840
lower cross syndrome. Lower cross syndrome, you have a tendency for the hip flexor complex to

65
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,280
be overactive, tightened. So the psoas, iliopsoas, rectus femoris, the

66
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,680
back extensor musculature will also tend towards tightness. And then the weakness or the inhibition

67
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,880
will tend to be towards the lower abdominal region and the gluteal region. So looking at it globally,

68
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,600
you would see a tendency to overload again throughout the extremity,

69
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,000
throughout the extremities so that the hip joint, the knee joint,

70
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,080
but also specifically dealing with the spine, the lumbar sacral region, thoracic lumbar region,

71
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,680
and the cervical thoracic region, all the areas where you see the transition of the curvatures,

72
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:08,320
lordosis and kyphosis. And with that tendency for overload, you will get repetitive stresses on

73
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:18,480
the passive structures within that kinematic chain. So as a clinician, we know that if you

74
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,920
tend to image these areas or if you image the spine, these are the areas that tend to have the

75
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,560
most degenerative changes or the most disc pathology. And those changes aren't usually

76
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:46,240
traumatic. They're not acute. They're accumulated over time. So the observation of these postural

77
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:56,000
patterns or postural syndromes, and then the recognition of the dysfunction with movement

78
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,640
efficiency that it caused led him to develop specific treatments, both exercise wise and manual

79
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:15,840
wise to address those issues. His colleague, Carl Levitt. But Yanda also had suffered polio as a

80
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,320
youngster, didn't he? Yeah. So he had suffered the residual effects, the post polio type syndrome.

81
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,800
And that was probably a motivation for his passion for rehabilitation,

82
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:43,520
his passion for the observation of movement. His colleague, Carl Levitt, also a neurologist,

83
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
he shared that observation palpation,

84
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:59,520
not technique, but tendency to utilize that for diagnosis and treatment. He specifically focused

85
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:07,280
on joint dysfunction, soft tissue dysfunction as it related to those upper and lower cross syndromes.

86
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,760
So he developed specific mobilization techniques for both the joint and the soft tissues,

87
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,720
addressing what they were seeing with those postural, postural habituation and movement dysfunction.

88
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:34,240
The third kind of pioneer, also a neurologist, but also a pediatric neurologist was Valcla Vojta.

89
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:46,240
And his observations observing the ontogenesis or the development of motor function after birth

90
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,360
during the first 12 months where the postural or postural foundations are established neurologically,

91
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:09,440
he developed a specific test called postural reactions where he could tell the quality or the

92
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,080
health of the maturation of the central nervous system during that period of time. And by doing

93
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,800
this, he could assess whether there was pathology or a healthy developing central nervous system.

94
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,600
So he developed seven specific postural reaction tests, developed and modified some other ones,

95
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,160
utilized primitive reflexes and just observation, observation of the infant during development

96
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,720
to be able to recognize the biological age, meaning the maturation of that central nervous system

97
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,240
as compared to the chronological age. So for example, if you had a six month old infant

98
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,440
that was moving and reacting like a six week old infant, that would be an indication that there

99
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,840
was some central nervous system pathology. His focus was on treatment of the cerebral palsy,

100
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:20,400
infant and patient. And he was able to utilize that observation, those

101
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,560
observation of the postural reactions, the assessment of the primitive reflexes to

102
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,200
recognize early on before it would manifest clinically so that interventions could be taken

103
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,480
earlier on to take advantage of the neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to

104
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:53,440
form motor engrams more efficiently and work around those central lesions that you see with

105
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:07,760
cerebral palsy. So he, all three of these kind of founding members or founders of Prague School

106
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:19,760
of Rehabilitation were Professor Kolodz, Kolodz's colleagues, mentors in structures, they shared

107
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:33,120
patients, they discussed cases and Pavel Kolodz developed or evolved all that knowledge and

108
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:43,600
experience into what we call dynamic neuromuscular stabilization today. Now before Pavel came along,

109
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,760
what was the, so fast forward this started in the 50s, but fast forward to the 90s.

110
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,080
So the Prague School is well established, you have these sort of founding fathers, so to speak.

111
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,200
What were the applications of the Prague School at that time? How much of it was rehabilitation

112
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:11,440
for kids with cerebral palsy or rehabilitation for people who were injured versus prehabilitation

113
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,440
for athletes? Like what was the breadth of the applicability of the Prague School?

114
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:29,680
Right, so Prague School was, it's a group of clinicians and probably more of the early 90s,

115
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,840
the application was primarily rehabilitation, cerebral palsy, general population,

116
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,760
with Pavel, Professor Kolodz just to go in a little bit of his background.

117
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,960
Again, he's the head of Prague School of Rehabilitation, he's also head clinician

118
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,800
for the Czech Olympic teams and Czech national sports teams, hockey, soccer,

119
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:09,920
men's and women's tennis. He himself was a high level, Olympic level gymnast. So

120
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:23,360
he, his work, he's a pediatric physiotherapist as well. His work with those three pioneers,

121
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,080
his experience as an athlete, his experience treating cerebral palsy and infants,

122
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:44,480
he took that or started to apply that base of knowledge to the athletic population. And the

123
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:52,560
focus of and the thinking of these founders of Prague School and Prague School today is

124
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:02,720
it's the influence of the central nervous system is huge and kind of king as far as the

125
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,520
facilitating the efficiency of transfer of load throughout that kinematic chain.

126
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:18,560
So early on, the focus was more rehabilitation over multiple populations.

127
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:33,200
But maybe late 90s, early 2000s, Pavel started to apply those teachings to that athletic population.

128
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:42,480
And there's meaning to an uninjured athletic population or to an injured athletic population?

129
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:53,520
Probably at that time, more of an injured population to kind of stand out athletes that

130
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,960
he was able to work with and integrate his concepts and principles of dynamic stability

131
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:13,280
were John Lesney. I say that right. He was an Olympic javelin thrower, three time gold

132
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:26,240
medal winner still holds the record for javelin 98.48 meters, I believe. And the other one is

133
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:38,080
Yomir Yager, who hockey player, Czech hockey player. He was able to help and work with them,

134
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,840
help them rehabilitate from injuries, but then also integrate the concepts and principles of

135
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:55,440
dynamic neuromuscular stabilization to one, decrease the risk of re-injury, but two, also

136
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,440
provide the potential for better performance. And we can talk about specifics of those concepts

137
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,320
and principles. Yeah, let's let's so we're into the early 2000s, where now Pavel's basically

138
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,040
taking some of the fundamental principles from the Prague school and creating this

139
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,960
this new discipline. Let's use each of the words to explain to people what this is. So dynamic,

140
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,400
of course, is movement, right? It's not just static. It applies to in motion neuromuscular,

141
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,640
I think explains the connection between the nervous system, both the central nervous system

142
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
and the peripheral nervous system, but really, as you said, an emphasis on the central nervous

143
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,960
system, and how that connects to the muscular system. So a lot of people, I think assume that

144
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,080
acts of strength are purely muscular, and they don't realize the neurologic control of those

145
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,680
things. For me personally, the hardest one to explain to an unsuspecting audience is stabilization.

146
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
Now I have a way that I like to explain it, but I want to hear you go first.

147
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Okay. So I think it's important to talk about the utilization of developmental kinesiology

148
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:28,160
as a way to explain posture and explain dynamic stabilization. When we're first born,

149
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,960
functionally and structurally, we are immature. So our central nervous system is still maturing.

150
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,720
Our bones are still forming. The first weeks of life, first four to six weeks of life,

151
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,440
the lower central nervous system structures, the brainstem level is kind of dominant. So primitive

152
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:56,560
reflexes are dominant. So examples of that suck reflex, gag reflex, grasping,

153
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,320
obviously being able to blink. I mean, the most primitive reflexes that our species, I mean,

154
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,440
we take these for granted. So they help keep us alive during that period of time.

155
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,880
So as that central nervous system matures, and if it's maturing in a healthy way,

156
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:22,160
by a three month period of time, actually, let me go back, usually starting maybe eight weeks,

157
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:31,920
we start to facilitate the synergy, coordination and timing of the deep stabilizing group of

158
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,400
musculature. And that's diaphragm, pelvic floor, the entire dominant wall, the intersegmental spinal

159
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,560
musculature that runs throughout the entire spine. All right, I'm going to stop you right here. We

160
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,040
are going to talk about these things so much that I want to make sure people understand them. So

161
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,200
let's go back to the first one. Everybody's heard of their diaphragm. But let's put some actual

162
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,560
metrics to it. It's a dome shaped muscle, it's a striated muscle, but it has kind of a non muscular

163
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,480
part as well. But I think what most people don't appreciate is how big it is, right? Yeah. And how

164
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,280
I can't even remember, it's been, you know, back when I was, you know, in school, I had to know

165
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:19,280
every attachment of it. But it, did you recall how far it attaches down and up on the on both the

166
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,440
on both the ribs and the vertebral bodies? Yeah, so the diaphragm, just think of it like a big

167
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,920
parachute or a big sheath of muscle that separates the abdominal cavity from the heart and lungs.

168
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:41,120
The attachments, it has attachments on the lower six ribs on the back of the xiphoid process,

169
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,560
which is a little bone at the end of the sternum. And then also attachments on L1, L2,

170
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,040
vertebra. So that's right around the thoracic lumbar junction.

171
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,040
So that's just an enormous expanse of attachment attachments being, you know, where the muscles

172
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,920
attach and anchor, and therefore that gives you a sense of what their lever capacity is, what they

173
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,920
can actually contract. Right. So that there's those attachments, and then there's a central tendon,

174
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,240
that when the diaphragm activates, so one of the primary functions is respiration.

175
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:28,960
So I go to take a breath in, that diaphragm activates, descends, the central tendon drops,

176
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,080
the lungs expand that change in pressure, you're able to draw air into the lungs. And then there's

177
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,600
a recoil of the diaphragm and the air comes out. So there's a primary respiratory function.

178
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,040
During the first weeks of development or ontogenesis, which is the study of motor

179
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,240
development after birth, there's primary respite, it's primary respiratory function.

180
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:01,440
The central nervous system has not matured to the point to create the synergy with within the other

181
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,520
deep stabilizing group of musculatures, musculature, to create that fixed point through the trunk and

182
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,760
the pelvis. So by, by around three months period of time, that central nervous system has matured

183
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:24,400
to the point where now the hardwired genetic ingrained motor programs start to manifest

184
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,760
themselves. So we start to see this coordinated activity of that deep group of musculature.

185
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,440
So what are the other, what are the, what, so we've now, I mean, for me, and I think for many people,

186
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:46,160
a very helpful image is that of a cylinder and the strongest possible cylinder, right, would have

187
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:54,800
a big top, a big bottom, and a beautifully symmetric, you know, side compartment to it,

188
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,840
right? A lousy cylinder would have a tiny little bottom, a big top and a dented middle. So if a

189
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,200
diaphragm formulates the top of that cylinder, what makes up the bottom of that cylinder?

190
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,920
So the bottom of the cylinder, we're looking at the pelvic floor, which is an area of musculature,

191
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:28,320
basically where we, the babies come out and that musculature will coordinate the

192
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,560
regulation or management of intra-abdominal pressure that is created with the descending

193
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,560
of the diaphragm. So the diaphragm, three, three main functions, respiration, but there's also

194
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:49,600
obviously this huge postural function where it descends even more and creates an intra-abdominal

195
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:58,640
pressure so that when that pressure is created, that diaph, the pelvic floor will eccentrically

196
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,120
load, meaning it's active, but musculature is active, but stretches. You can think of it like

197
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,600
wind blowing into a sail where the wind blows into the sail, it opens and activates and then

198
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,200
it holds and maintains the pressure. But then at the same time, we have the entire abdominal wall,

199
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:27,280
which consists of the rectus muscles, our six pack muscles, our oblique musculature, which is

200
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:34,480
musculature that crosses the body, comes up and has attachments under the thoracic cage or the rib cage.

201
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:44,320
And then a big one called transverse abdominis, which wraps around from the back, the thoracolumbar

202
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:53,680
fascia around to the front. So as that diaphragm descends to facilitate a stabilizing function,

203
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,600
that intra-abdominal pressure is created, that musculature reacts to the pressure,

204
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:09,200
there's an eccentric load and then an isometric. And then as we coordinate, so we have respiratory

205
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,880
function, postural function, but we have to now coordinate between both respiratory and postural

206
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,880
functions. So our central nervous system, our brain needs to manage that pressure to provide

207
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,480
enough stability, but also allow the diaphragm to also allow the lungs to expand.

208
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,880
This coordination is usually where we see people kind of falling apart. And if they fall apart,

209
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,560
they'll tend towards what Yanda saw, which is that over-utilization. So in the lower cross syndrome of

210
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:56,320
the extensor musculature and the flexor musculature, because we lose that synergy of that deep

211
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,720
stabilization. And if we lose that synergy and that ability to create that fixed point,

212
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:09,680
then our brains will do their jobs, which is to find a way to still move and do tasks that we need

213
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:17,760
to do. But in doing so, we'll go to more of a high threshold or like I described more of a

214
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:27,920
compensatory pattern. So developmentally, that three month period of time is where we ideally

215
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,640
will have that synergy, coordination and timing of that deep group of musculature that will allow

216
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,560
the infant to create a fixed point through the trunk and the pelvis. And then also with that

217
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:48,160
management of that intrandatal pressure, there's a loading on the front of the spine. And with that

218
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:55,280
loading, we get an uprighting effect throughout the spine. So then the intersegmental spinal

219
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:04,240
musculature are eccentrically loading and managing that pressure against the spine to help with that

220
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,880
uprighting effect and that unloading effect. Let's again make sure people know exactly what

221
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,360
we mean because we're going to use the terms a lot. When you talk about eccentrically versus

222
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,200
concentrically loading, I mean, to me, the easiest way to define is just using the definitions,

223
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,760
right? So a muscle is concentrically loaded when it's getting shorter as it's being loaded,

224
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,840
eccentrically is getting longer as it's being loaded. So for example, a bicep curl, this is the

225
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,640
concentric phase of loading. This is the eccentric phase of loading. And I think what a lot of people

226
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,720
take for granted is both of those are important. But most people when training tend to emphasize

227
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,200
the concentric and don't realize the eccentric. I heard a great story. I think it was actually

228
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,760
from Michael Strom'sness that when a group of US weightlifters visited a group of Eastern European

229
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,680
weightlifters, I don't know, maybe it was even you that told this story, they realized that they were

230
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,320
counting reps differently. So the American lifters would consider a rep one is up and down. So that

231
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,400
was they were putting all their effort into the concentric, but then, you know, more or less dropping

232
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,040
the weight on the way down, not really focusing on the effort to put the weight down. And the

233
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,320
Eastern European lifters were doing the opposite, right? They were counting it as two reps. It's up,

234
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:32,080
one, down, two. So it was just as much effort into that eccentric. And, you know, it's not to say one

235
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,280
is right or wrong because they serve different purposes. Obviously, more emphasis on the eccentric

236
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:44,960
will create more hypertrophy. So there are times that you want both. But again, when you look at,

237
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,600
for example, and we'll get to this, I'm sure, but when you look at hip abduction, the importance of

238
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,440
being able to eccentrically control that is such an important part of injury prevention. And you can

239
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,360
spend all the time in the world working on concentrically doing that. So later today, when

240
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,760
we actually do some stuff on the mat, you'll have some exercises to demonstrate that.

241
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,360
Yeah. Yeah. So what the observation, having knowledge of the developmental kinesiology or

242
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,880
the ontogenesis and watching that maturation of the central nervous system and with that

243
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:32,960
healthy maturation, seeing the synergy of the deep stabilization, providing that fixed point,

244
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,880
and then allowing efficient transfer of force and load throughout that trunk and pelvis area.

245
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:56,160
What these pioneers, Voita, Yanda, Levitt, Colaj, noticed was the importance of the quality,

246
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,600
basically training that central nervous system. Because if you can facilitate that ideal

247
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:13,120
stabilization, stereotype and synergy, then you provide what Professor Colaj calls

248
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,600
centration throughout that chain of movement, throughout that kinematic chain. And what he

249
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:29,040
describes centration as is, for example, let's say you have the hip joint, is the ability to maintain

250
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,720
an ideal position of the femur and the acetabulum, which is the hip joint,

251
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,840
throughout that full range of motion. In order to do that, you need a synergy or a nice interplay

252
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,080
between agonist and antagonist, like you described the biceps curl. So an interplay between

253
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:57,120
concentric, eccentric activity of the opposing musculature around the joint to help maintain

254
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,760
that position. And if that is compromised throughout any part of that kinematic chain,

255
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,720
it's going to affect the quality of centration or transfer of force and load

256
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:18,720
above and below that region. The quality of that synergy coordination timing of that deep

257
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:27,520
stabilization is what Prague school is focusing on with assessment and with their treatment methods.

258
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:36,960
And this is based out of that observation of developmental kinesiology, which is the

259
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,520
neurophysiological aspects of the maturing locomotor system. So that's there. They utilize that as their

260
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:51,440
definition of dynamic movement, dynamic posture, ideal posture.

261
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,160
Let's go back to the three month old infant and start talking about what

262
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,040
normal developmental milestones are through the lens of DNS and

263
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,400
picking it up at three months. So what is a three month old infant starting to demonstrate and how

264
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,680
is that progressing as they become six months, nine months a year, et cetera? Right. So at three

265
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:26,640
months with that ability to create that fixed point, now the larger, longer musculature and larger

266
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,720
muscle groups have something to anchor off of. So creating that fixed point, for example,

267
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:42,240
allows the infant to now turn their head and fix their gaze prior to that during those first weeks

268
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:50,480
of life. You know, there's the ability to fix their gaze is not there by three months providing

269
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,760
that stable point. Now they can turn, fix their gaze. And now they start to get more of the

270
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:05,200
somatosensory input from the environment, which is going to trigger an external cue or a drive to

271
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,600
start to explore. The infant at that period of time can lift their legs out of the base of support.

272
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,560
So they can, you'll see a triple flexion. So 90 degrees at the hip, 90 degrees at the knee,

273
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,280
neutral position of the ankle joint or subtalar joint. They'll be able to bring their hands

274
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:33,040
together and bring their hands to their mouth along. And let's explain what's actually required

275
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,160
to do that because again, most adults would take that for granted. But what is it neuromuscularly

276
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,240
that is being hardwired in that three month old infant that is pretty impressive. And when you

277
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,200
really stop to think about it, that they're able to bring both legs up, coordinate that movement.

278
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:02,720
And by the way, are they necessarily doing that the way, you know, a 50 year old person would do

279
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,320
that if you laid them on their back? Like having now watched a lot of infants, they tend to all

280
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,800
kind of do it in a very similar way, whereas adults tend to not do it in a certain way.

281
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,280
Right. So neurologically, the coordination and timing of that deep stabilization

282
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,840
group of musculature needs to be on point to be able to create a fixed point so that the,

283
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,400
again, the larger muscle groups can anchor off that to bring the legs up. Now, the infant has

284
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,520
different, you know, there's a different thoracic cage size at that point, their head in relation

285
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:51,680
to their body is bigger, their limb length is bigger. They're still growing the, the bones are

286
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,520
still forming. So that's much different than a 50 year old. Our lip proportions are different,

287
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:07,120
our mobility is going to be different. We may have different body proportions, you know, mobility,

288
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,040
but we, we all went through these developmental milestones and

289
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:24,640
most of us develop our central nervous system in a healthy way. So we still have those same motor

290
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:33,760
patterns that our central nervous system is going to want to kick into. Some of the efficiency

291
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,720
of accessing those nice stereotypical motor patterns that we're born with can be compromised

292
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,920
due to soft tissue dysfunction, rigidity, lack of range of motion throughout the, throughout our joints,

293
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:04,720
you know, postural habituation that Yanda described. All that factors into our, can override

294
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:16,640
the access to those ideal patterns. What Prague school tries to do is with the specific assessments,

295
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:24,640
assess that efficiency of that deep stabilization system, whatever age that we're at, and then

296
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,600
utilize specific, what we call active exercises, which are based off of the developmental milestones,

297
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:39,280
which we'll get back to in a second, to utilize specific points of support and positioning

298
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,600
to help wake up or facilitate those patterns that we still have as adults.

299
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,680
So three months of age is the start of that ability to create a sagittal stabilization.

300
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,000
Tell people what sagittal means versus quorum. So sagittal is kind of like straight ahead.

301
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,720
Frontal plane would be if you're on your side or to the side, and then there's transverse plane,

302
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,960
which is, think about rotating in the transverse plane. So what happens now is they approach six

303
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,880
months of age. So three months, you see the start, four months, that coordination is usually complete

304
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,000
for four, four and a half months. Once you, they've completed that, that ideal

305
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,440
facilitation of a fixed point. Now they start to be able to utilize the oblique slings,

306
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:49,040
and you'll start to see some differentiation in the pelvis and the limbs. And as that

307
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,840
synergy gets more and more efficient, which means better, better management of that intra-abdominal

308
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,760
pressure, you'll see the hips coming up into higher position, the legs coming up into,

309
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:12,160
being able to come up into a higher position. The infant's range of reach will improve as well.

310
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,560
At four months, they're able to touch the groin area. At five months, they can reach their knees.

311
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,600
At six months, they can reach their feet. And then by seven months, they're bringing the foot

312
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,880
to the mouth. There's enough synergy.

313
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,240
And just to be clear, most people would say, is that just a result of increasing flexibility?

314
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,360
But really the answer is not so much that they have more flexibility. They are quite flexible

315
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:48,560
at birth. It's more that they now have the motor control and the stability to coordinate something

316
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,680
that is everywhere from shoulder to foot or hand to foot, basically.

317
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:06,960
And do it in an efficient manner. So you're a parent and you remember when the kids were

318
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,520
developing, and I get this all the time. They're like, oh, my son was rolling all the way over at

319
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:23,920
three months. That is possible. They can normally, well, not normally, but ideally at that six month

320
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,680
period of time, there's enough of that synergy and coordination and timing that the infant,

321
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,760
you'll see the infant at that time rolling onto its stomach. Now they could maybe do it at three

322
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,360
months, but they're not going to do it with that coordination and that efficiency of transfer of

323
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:50,960
force and load. You may see them turn and kind of revert back to more of that newborn posture,

324
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,600
meaning they're finding a way to turn. They're using more of a compensatory pattern to make

325
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:06,880
that action happen. Kind of the same thing you see with movement with adults. If the

326
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,760
the synergy, coordination, timing of deep stabilization is not on point, they find a

327
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:23,200
way to move. But when they move, as with the first weeks of life, the newborn infant, you'll see

328
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,560
anterior pelvic tilt. You see a flaring of the rib cage, the shoulders, you'll see elevation,

329
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,280
protraction, and reclamation or extension through the cervical spine. The newborn, when they look

330
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,520
or when they move, the whole body is moving. They don't have that ability to create that fixed point,

331
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:53,120
but they're still able to make movements as they're going through the developmental milestones

332
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:02,080
with that motivation or that drive to move and explore their environment. They may find ways to

333
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,880
reach that toy, but not be creating ideal centration and stabilization.

334
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:18,400
With the central nervous system maturation, it's not like at three months, four months, six months,

335
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,280
boom, they wake up and automatically they're in this perfect synergy, coordination, timing.

336
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,800
As that central nervous system is maturing, there's thousands of trials and errors. They're

337
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,280
forming the brain mapping and motor engrams, finding the right points of support as the

338
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,560
coordination of the central nervous system is kicking in. You may see at the beginning of

339
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:54,320
six months and they're turning, maybe they're not able to keep the alignment of the diaphragms

340
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:02,480
during the turning, but they're still able to do it. Maybe by then three weeks into it, now their

341
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,320
coordination and timing has become more efficient and better and they're able to make that turn

342
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,920
with a better quality of activation. How does it go from there? What gets them to crawling and

343
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:23,440
ultimately standing? What you see with the developmental milestones, at the start of three

344
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,560
months, we talked about with the newborn, you have more of the lower central nervous system

345
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,480
structures are maturing. At three months, we see more maturation in the subcortical region of the

346
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,600
central nervous system and that's where we get the manifestation of these postural foundations.

347
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,440
So as that central nervous system matures, certain milestones, three months, four months,

348
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:59,040
five, six, seven, you'll see the infant starting to be able to attain higher, more unstable positions.

349
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,560
And these developmental milestones are moving towards basically the verticalization process,

350
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:16,400
going from either supine on the back or prone and then working their way up trial and error,

351
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:24,880
learning with that healthy central nervous system maturation where at seven months,

352
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,800
they're able to come to their side. Eight months, they come up into what we call a high oblique sit

353
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:39,200
position. Nine months, they're able to crawl. 10, 11 months, you'll see them being able to attain

354
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:46,800
like a kneeling position. 12 months, they're squatting. 13, 14 months, they're standing.

355
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:55,520
And then 14, 16 months, on average, you see the start of of ambulation. Now this is variable.

356
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,560
Some kids, my son was walking at 10 months. There's maybe 15 months, 16 months. So there's

357
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:12,480
variability within these milestones of where we see the infants. But on average,

358
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:25,280
these specific points, you'll see a specific competency in stability and reaching or moving

359
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:32,640
towards that verticalization process. Now, if you exclude cases of pathology like CP and things

360
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,280
like that, where there are injuries that are preventing the neuromuscular development and

361
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:48,480
the achievement of these milestones, is it more or less the case that all kids who are

362
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,640
given the fair chance to sort of explore and go about these things naturally will reach a certain

363
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:05,120
age, call it two or three. And they'll be quite healthy from a dynamic and movement standpoint.

364
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,760
Like is it, for example, like yesterday we spent a bunch of time looking at my three and a half year

365
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,680
old and frankly, it's a clinic and movement at that age, right? Is it safe to assume basically

366
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,560
all three year olds move really, really well? Like they haven't started to get into the habituated

367
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:34,160
movement patterns that will begin to destroy them, right? Yeah. So, Vojta and others talk about

368
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:44,240
usually what they see is around 70% of new infants are going to have that healthy central

369
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:52,560
nervous system maturation, go through the first weeks of life, the postural foundations,

370
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:00,720
the three to 12 months, the subcortical, and then from two, four, six, six years of age,

371
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:07,360
you have more of the cortical maturation where you see fine motor dexterity and movement,

372
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:14,160
ability to write and you see the language develop and you see motor learning.

373
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,280
So, sorry, the subcortical phase goes till about two?

374
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:36,400
Three to 12 months is where we see these postural foundations. After that, you start to get that

375
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:48,160
cortical integration maturation, but the motor learning and the process, I mean, it's like two

376
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:56,000
to six, but I mean, and beyond. Now, I'm surprised to hear you say only 70%. Right. So, this is,

377
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,040
I don't know if I can say the study, maybe it's their observation.

378
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:12,240
So, they talk about 70% normal maturation. The other 30%, it's a spectrum. So, you'll have on

379
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:23,520
one end, the CP child or the CNS pathology, but then there's this spectrum on the other end of

380
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:32,080
the spectrum. Yanda called it minimal brain dysfunction. I think it's also called central

381
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:45,520
coordination disorder. So, there's maybe not that ideal development, but again, there's a spectrum

382
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:55,280
to that. So, that may manifest during that, when we see the cortical time of central nervous system

383
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:06,160
maturation, maybe there is learning disabilities or not as efficient movement patterns. And this is

384
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:14,560
something that Prague school, as far as a curriculum, there's a whole pediatrics section

385
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:25,440
with their curriculum, which they go deeper into that aspect of observation and specific

386
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:39,360
utilization of treatment options. So, usually with a healthy central nervous system maturation

387
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:47,440
and a good environment for the child to explore movement and the variability of movement and do

388
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,520
the trial and error and find their ideal points of support, you're going to see this nice,

389
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:04,000
healthy maturation. Things that may compromise that, I mean, we see in modern society and culture,

390
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:14,320
a kid who's in their car seat six hours a day or maybe doesn't have that environment where they

391
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:21,680
can explore and crack. I think another one that I remember Michael sharing with me was when kids

392
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:30,640
are sped up on milestones. So, for example, those seats that prematurely prop kids into a seated

393
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:37,680
position, well, even before that little bobby chair, and again, we're all guilty of this. I know we

394
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,080
stuck our kids in these things, at least the first two, because when our third kid came along, I was

395
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:48,480
already interested in DNS, so then he became sort of the observation for DNS. But with our first two,

396
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,000
yeah, you're going to stick them in those silly seated chairs and they don't have the support.

397
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,560
Before they're ready.

398
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,400
Before they're ready, so they can't even support their own weight, so they're in this slouch

399
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,280
position and then you put them in those things. We called it the circle of neglect, so it's like

400
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,520
the thing where they're standing before they should be standing. So all of these things

401
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,640
actually interfere with the normal neuromuscular development. Putting kids in shoes too early

402
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
probably does a tremendous disservice to them.

403
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,160
Right. So ideally, they're going to have an environment where they're going to kind of figure

404
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:31,520
this out themselves. Verse, you know, another one is the little walkers that they'll hold on to and

405
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:43,280
walk. You know, ideally, they're going to play with their environment and with that combination

406
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:50,320
of healthy central nervous system maturation, find those ideal points of support and be able to

407
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:58,240
utilize those motor patterns that are manifested with that healthy central nervous system.

408
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:10,560
So the environment that we have children in is key. And this, I mean, you can take this

409
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,040
and look at, you know, just our society just as adults.

410
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:23,920
Well, yeah, let's go from, okay, so we can put them in shoes too early, put them in silly sit-up

411
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,800
seats in the circle of neglect and give them walkers. And then another huge set of insults

412
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,560
come when they go to school, right? Because now they're sitting in chairs for six or seven hours

413
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:41,920
a day. And what does that do for, you know, a six or seven year old, which is unfortunately,

414
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,080
by the time they're six, they're sort of sitting in chairs six hours a day at least. So what is that

415
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:53,920
doing to interfere with this process? So this is where you start to see the start of that postural

416
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:08,800
syndromes. You know, when we get into those sustained seated postures, one of the main things

417
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,320
that happens during those developmental milestones with healthy central nervous system maturation is

418
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,920
we're able to lie and keep alignment or approximation of the pelvic floor and the

419
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,800
thoracic diaphragm. The more efficiently we do that, the more efficiently we manage

420
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,480
intermodal pressure and uprighting throughout the spine. And then again, transfer of force and load.

421
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:38,640
If we fall into repetitive postures or postural habituation, which as a society is

422
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:48,320
kind of a bit prevalent, gravity is going to win. No matter how nice the chair is,

423
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,960
we're going to start to fall into that slumping posture. And when we get into that slumping

424
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:02,320
posture, the shoulder is coming forward. That is actually going to create an inhibition of the

425
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,400
diaphragm's ability to descend. And again, we need that descending of the healthy

426
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,680
and ideal descending of the diaphragm for both respiration and stabilization. So if we start

427
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:26,640
getting that descending becomes inhibited due to the postural habituation, our brain is going to

428
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:36,080
find a way to get air to the lungs. So it'll start to kick in the accessory breathing musculature,

429
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,000
which is that the sternocleidomastoid, upper traps, muscles called the scalenes,

430
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:50,480
which attached here, cervical spine and the upper two ribs. You'll see the pec minor also

431
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:58,640
start to help to lift the thoracic cage to help get the expansion to get the air. So again,

432
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,880
the brain starts to do its job, which we need air, we're going to use these guys to get the air.

433
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,080
And it's a good short term kind of survival strategy. But if we do it often enough,

434
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:20,000
that becomes the go to pattern. So you'll see a change in respiratory pattern, meaning

435
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:27,840
decreased utilization of full expansion of the diaphragm, and more of a pattern of over utilizing

436
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,520
the accessory breathing musculature, which this can occur quite young. I mean, I think when we,

437
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,200
you know, we were joking about it yesterday, but you look at my youngest, I mean, his abdomen is

438
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:47,520
huge. And that's obviously an enormous asset to him, you can see it when he breathes, it's his

439
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,880
it's abdominal expansion more than it is thoracic expansion, right? These, you know,

440
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,200
a child that age, if doing thing, you know, if developing normally is not using any of these

441
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:04,640
accessory respiratory muscles. And there's something about this anchor point being in

442
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,320
the abdomen, right? I mean, one of the first things I learned in DNS was how to regain

443
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:20,320
intra abdominal pressure through eccentric loading of that cylinder. And I don't think it

444
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,520
had ever been presented to me how important that was, because prior to that, any amount of

445
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,600
perceived intra abdominal pressure had been acquired through concentric loading.

446
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,760
Right. So for example, when trying to pick up something heavy, you can you can take two

447
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,280
strategies to that. I think I think most people would agree, if you want to pick up 300 pounds

448
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,840
right now, you must generate pressure in the abdomen. I don't I don't think anybody would

449
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,960
assume that you could pick up 300 pounds, which is twice your body weight, without generating

450
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,520
pressure here. But how you do it matters. Right. So explain those differences. And again,

451
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,320
either with or without the developmental lens. But I but I think that the developmental lens

452
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:13,280
is always a great way to think about how kids move. Right. So if you think about developmentally,

453
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:22,000
and how that stabilizing stereotype evolves, think of it as a an inside out strategy,

454
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
you're creating an intra abdominal pressure to load the abdominal wall. And then with the loading

455
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,040
of the abdominal wall eccentric isometric. And then there's this interplay of all that activity

456
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:42,320
concentric, eccentric isometric to manage that pressure for whatever task that you need to,

457
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,480
to do. So if I'm sitting here, and I'm going to pick up that pen,

458
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,560
I don't I need some function of stabilization to then, you know, move this limb,

459
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:00,560
try to provide a fixed point for my anterior posterior slings to provide a nice position for

460
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,160
the shoulder girdle to then, again, get that synergy throughout the kinematic chain and pick

461
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:13,360
up the pen. So there's a certain amount of management of that intermural pressure that I

462
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:21,520
need. If I go to like the chairs that we're sitting in that we moved earlier, this is a lot more weight,

463
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,040
I'm going to need a lot more coordination and management and creation of intra abdominal

464
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:35,760
pressure to create the fixed point to transfer the ground reactive forces through my lower

465
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,920
extremities through my trunk and pelvis to you know, my arms holding holding the chair. So there's

466
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:53,760
more facilitation of that intermural pressure. So that's what we see developmentally, that quality

467
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:01,760
of stabilization, and that stabilization, it's not static, it's dynamic, we should be able to

468
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,320
manage that intermural pressure through full extension, full rotation, full flexion. That's

469
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:14,880
the beauty of that dynamic neuromuscular stability. And that's what we see with our

470
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:24,080
that quality we see in the high level athletes. We can also create stability by bracing. And if

471
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:30,080
you think about bracing, if someone's going to punch me in the stomach, I may go for a cone centric.

472
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:38,480
And where the abdominal wall shortens and tightens, I'm still creating a stabilizing function.

473
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:48,080
And I can still use that to, you know, move objects or prepare prepare for for impact. When

474
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:57,840
it comes to dynamic movement, the the inside out strategy in the central nervous system management

475
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:06,640
of that stabilization allows me to create the stability efficiently where I need it,

476
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:18,160
but then also be able to, for example, relaxed my extremity. So with with high level movers athletes,

477
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:26,080
you see they'll have nice postural foundations, they also have very nice cortical function or

478
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:34,720
body awareness. So the fetters, Kelly Slater's and surfing, they have that ability to their

479
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:41,840
movement looks fluid and effortless. So they have that ability to relax and efficiently stabilize

480
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:50,720
where they need to stabilize. Sometimes you need to incorporate that bracing strategy on top of

481
01:01:51,360 --> 01:02:01,680
the the facilitation of intramodal pressure for excessive loads where we go beyond our threshold,

482
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,840
our functional threshold, meaning our ability to keep that quality of stabilization.

483
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:16,880
When we go beyond that ability, we go into what we call the functional gap. And when we go into

484
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:22,800
the functional gap, that's where we see more of that high threshold strategy, maybe bracing

485
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:30,640
strategy to get the job done, to get that weight up, to maybe kick that ball a little extra harder.

486
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:37,760
Training wise and athletics, that's where those athletes spend a lot of time because they're

487
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:47,280
always they're kind of pushing that threshold all the time. So you'll see with athletes,

488
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:55,520
a tendency, if they're spending all their time training, competing in that functional gap beyond

489
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:04,240
the the ability to maintain the more more efficient transfer of force and load, then

490
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,160
that pattern, that high threshold compensatory pattern,

491
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,800
becomes the starts to become the norm with everything picking up the pencil.

492
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:21,600
So one of the things that we try to do, or I try to do as far as with training and rehabilitation,

493
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:29,520
not just with the athletes, but with, you know, a general population is help them facilitate that

494
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,120
quality of stabilization so they can increase that threshold of being able to main, you know,

495
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:41,920
stay within that that functional threshold or that functional capacity. So that when they do

496
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,800
have to go into the functional gap and go to those compensatory patterns, it's not all the time.

497
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,640
Well, let's let's talk about an elite athlete. And again, I think the thing with the really the

498
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,560
most elite is they don't have to train in DNS. A lot of them are just doing this naturally. I mean,

499
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:05,280
that's sort of what makes Roger Federer great. And one of the hallmarks of that greatness is

500
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,200
injury prevention. It's not just the greatness at what they do. It's the longevity with which they

501
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:19,200
can do it. Yes. So when I lecture, I use Federer as an example, you know, you look at his career,

502
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:28,160
just longevity and injury wise, you know, when he has been injured, but usually you see a quick

503
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:36,800
recovery. Going back to Yager and Jalesny, Jalesny had a 20 year career in javelin, which I don't

504
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:46,480
think is very common. Yager is 48. He's still playing the with Yager and Jalesny,

505
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:54,960
Pablo working with them, the emphasis was on the awareness, the facilitation of this ideal

506
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:03,200
stabilizing pattern, the timing of movement, the centration throughout the kinematic chain. And

507
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,600
then with that the ability to we call differentiate, you know, within, for example, the pelvis over that

508
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:17,520
femoral head. So the focus was with them was the quality over quantity, I guess you can say.

509
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:23,680
What percentage of his time do you think, because obviously Federer has just an unbelievable

510
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:30,160
functional capacity. How long how often do you think he is in excess of that in that gap zone

511
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:37,360
where he is using compensatory movements that are putting long term stability at risk?

512
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:46,320
So I think when you see you see those athletes that rise to the top, they have that you watch

513
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Federer, for example, you see the point that the creating the point of support, the positioning,

514
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:57,760
the alignment of everything. He's creating naturally that centration and that transfer

515
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,720
of force and load. There is times maybe he gets out of position or a little extra hardware, he's

516
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,680
going to go into that functional gap. He's naturally has a functional, huge functional

517
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:16,880
capacity where he can maintain that. I think with him, you also and this goes to training,

518
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:27,760
he has a good team. He has trainers that, you know, are programming certain things in a way

519
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:35,120
and giving him certain things so that he can still facilitate that quality of movement and build

520
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:45,440
strength capacity on top of that. One thing that I see, for example, out on the PGA tour,

521
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:56,080
I'll see, you know, players that have good programs, good coaching, you know, they'll tend

522
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:02,080
to stay within that functional capacity. They're still pushing it and still, you know, with them,

523
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:08,160
it's just repetitive motion, which partial habituation, repetitive motion, injury are

524
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,200
things that compromise that synergy and coordination of that dynamic stability.

525
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:23,920
So if you have good programming, dosing, loading, timing, recovery, then and on top of that,

526
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,680
you have amazing, you know, potty awareness and cortical function, you're going to see longevity

527
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:39,600
and you're going to see nice quality of movement. What I see on the other end is players, athletes,

528
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:48,240
poor training programs, over training, you know, spending too much time in the functional gap,

529
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:55,600
you know, falling into what my colleague Rich Ulm talks about, the extensor compression syndrome,

530
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:01,520
which you see a lot with lifting with the power athletes, which he works with a lot of.

531
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:10,480
Then you see, when you have that reliance on that higher threshold, you see more incidence of injury,

532
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:19,120
longer recovery, verse the opposite, the Federer's. Yeah, they get injured, but they recover fairly

533
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:28,240
quickly. And that's what you see again, Jager and Jalesny are nice examples of that both checks

534
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:37,040
and Pavel working with them, you know, over this 20 year period of time, integrating and putting

535
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:46,720
in his ideas and his experience with everything that we talked about with those, you know,

536
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:52,560
rehabilitation pioneers into these athletes, kind of like a little, you know, test subject,

537
01:08:52,560 --> 01:09:03,120
so to speak. So now, you Prague school and DNS practitioners, that's what we're trying to help

538
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:09,440
integrate with our athletes with the general population. So what percentage of people that

539
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:16,640
you work with are coming with an injury, and therefore in need of rehabilitation, where you're

540
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:25,440
now applying DNS to presumably go back to, hey, this is where the breakdown was, let's go back

541
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,920
to where that breakdown would have occurred developmentally and go back and rebuild those

542
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,600
steps. So we're gonna, you're gonna learn how to stabilize your neck or stabilize your head using

543
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,760
the stabilizing muscles appropriately, you're going to learn how to generate concentric

544
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,320
intra abdominal pressure, and you're going to learn how to centrate ipsilaterally and

545
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:50,720
contralaterally and all of these things. And then what percentage of your patients are not coming

546
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:56,000
with an injury, but are coming for performance enhancement and saying, you know, I just can't

547
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,720
throw this fastball any faster than 89 miles per hour. And the only way I'm going to get that

548
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:11,120
faster is if I can create a better whip between my right hand and my left leg and hip, you know,

549
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,360
so those are two ends of the spectrum. And how do you spend your time on those? Right. So

550
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:23,760
majority of people are coming to me because pain and injury, what happens especially with the

551
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:30,640
athletes, once we address that, once we calm down, whether it's if it's acute or chronic injury,

552
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:43,360
we come, we decrease pain and and utilize the the there's different manual methods within DNS and

553
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:49,200
then integrating the exercises that are based off of those developmental milestones. Once they get

554
01:10:49,200 --> 01:11:00,160
to a certain point, ideally, I'm going to work with a trainer or with the coach. And hopefully

555
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:09,600
they're on the same, you know, mindset, so that they can then progress to the strength training to

556
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:18,800
the specific technique. More and more, these athletes are, you know, it's a combination of

557
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:27,120
once they're out of pain, we work with the quality of stabilization and movement and transfer of force

558
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:35,040
and load. Let's take a group of let's say 100 athletes who come to you in pain. Again, just

559
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:42,560
looking for rough numbers, what percentage of them will buy into the thesis of this very

560
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,120
non-traditional way of rehabilitating is going to help what percentage of that what of that 100 will

561
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:56,800
stay with the program to get better? Right? Not enough. So what's the no 10 20%? Maybe that's it?

562
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:04,160
Yeah, what I see happening, you know, for example, Major League Baseball is integrating

563
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:12,480
DNS more and more. So in San Diego, with the Padres, I started to consult with them a bit.

564
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:21,520
There's a hitting coach for the Dodgers that comes in and we kind of workshop ideas

565
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:29,360
where, you know, he's integrating the DNS concepts and principles. So it's starting to get recognized

566
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:37,360
more for that value, as far as the performance enhancement aspects of it.

567
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:47,520
Culturally within sport, what I see, especially in the West, there's, you know, they want numbers,

568
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,120
they want, okay, what's their peak? What's their lift? You know, what's their

569
01:12:51,840 --> 01:13:00,080
their strength capacity, which is important. But I think it's also important to, again,

570
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:07,920
like integrate those to the quality of movement and stability, and then increasing that, you know,

571
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,560
their their strength thresholds. But even just with an injury. So if you let's just say 100

572
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,240
athletes that are, you know, let's say gymnasts and hockey players and football players that

573
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:23,040
come in with lower back pain, you're saying only 20 of those would stick with the program

574
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,240
until they got better. 80 of them would abandon the program before they improved.

575
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,880
A lot of times, and just across the patient population, a lot of times, once people are out

576
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,320
of pain, it's kind of out of sight out of mind, they go back, they go back into their patterns.

577
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,480
That's what I'm trying to differentiate, which is how many of them just stick with it long enough

578
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,680
to get out of pain. The next question I'm going to ask is, once out of pain, how many of them

579
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:57,840
stick with the program and switch basically from rehab to prehab? So going back to that,

580
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,240
one of my goals, especially with the athlete, once they're out of pain, we develop a

581
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:12,960
prehabilitation kind of program. And we utilize those, again, going back to the knowledge of

582
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:19,760
developmental kinesiology and developmental milestones, which later will actually go through.

583
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:27,040
So based on what I'm seeing with their insufficiencies and with the insufficiency of

584
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:34,800
with the insufficiency of that coordination of stabilization, I will give them certain things,

585
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:44,640
certain sequences of movements and exercises that they practice with awareness to facilitate

586
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:52,640
better strategy for stability. And then that's part of their movement preparation,

587
01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:01,200
or prehabilitation before, whether it's their strength training, or their technique training,

588
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:10,560
or going out and performing. And so that's a larger percentage, because that's part of

589
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:23,760
what I kind of program into the rehabilitation. So some athletes will get that and they're okay,

590
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,840
great, this is this is good, I'm going to go do it. And then occasionally, they're coming back

591
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:36,640
and getting maybe we're adding to it based on what how they're functioning. Now,

592
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:44,400
other athletes, they want more. And that's that that's that smaller percentage. Part of it too,

593
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:53,520
probably access, you know, availability. As far as being able to be, you know, in San Diego and

594
01:15:53,520 --> 01:16:01,840
working one on one with me. So, you know, there's, there's different factors that will

595
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:09,360
tie into how much they're they're doing. But within the whole treatment protocol,

596
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:15,680
rehabilitation protocol, I'm giving them things that they should then integrate into their programs.

597
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:21,280
What is the most common chief complaint of a person that walks into your office? Is it lower

598
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:28,720
back pain? That would be my guess. Yeah, majority is low back. Okay, so what are the most common

599
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:39,440
causes of lower back pain that you see? Across the board, if if they're suffering from

600
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:49,120
you know, low back pain, whether it's acute or chronic, usually there's an underlying pattern

601
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:57,920
of that lack of or the inefficient activation of the deep stabilizing system,

602
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:06,400
and more of a tendency towards that extension compression, you know, activation, that over

603
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:12,080
activation of flexor extensor. So you know, you know, you know what that means in a bit more detail,

604
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:18,480
given the ubiquity of this injury, and the probability that 80% of the people listening

605
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,360
to this have already experienced back pain or will experience back pain in their lives. I want

606
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,640
to make sure if people take nothing away from this podcast, they understand the etiology of lower

607
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:38,080
back pain. Yeah. So unless you've had a let's say a car accident or a fall, that's like an acute

608
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:48,000
injury. That can be a cause of low back pain. The majority that I see, it's more of a

609
01:17:49,280 --> 01:18:00,400
chronic overload over time, that if we have that strategy of flex too much flexor extensor activity,

610
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:10,160
which compromises the positioning of the inter segmental, the joints and the transfer

611
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,920
of force and load, then with the compensatory pattern, we'll see more of a hinging in through

612
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:24,320
that lumbar sacral region. And with that hinging, over time, it's like if you keep bending a spoon,

613
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:34,240
you know, it's gonna break, you weaken the structure. So, you know, take a disc.

614
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:39,920
Yeah, let's talk about the actual anatomy. And I yesterday I said I wished I'd brought a skeleton.

615
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:47,200
So the sacrum is basically a single bone, it's actually fused. So at one point, it was multiple

616
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:52,880
sacred with the ilium. Right. So you have this sort of one fused sacrum. And then you have these

617
01:18:52,880 --> 01:19:01,120
five lumbar discs numbered one through five. Now, between each of those lumbar vertebral

618
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:09,280
bodies is a disc. And then there's one between the fifth lumbar vertebral body and the sacrum. So

619
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,560
we refer to them as you know, l3 l4 is the disc between three and four and l5 s1 is the disc

620
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,920
between there, right? Behind each of these vertebral bodies. So these these vertebral bodies are sort

621
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:29,040
of held in place by the discs, but then also by the facet joints that run behind them. And it's

622
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,280
really difficult to show this, we'll probably have to pull up some images to make this easier

623
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:39,440
for people to see. But the the facet joints, and then and then sort of the lamina, which are these

624
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:44,000
those sort of longer bones, hold it all together, but they don't really provide this support. I think

625
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,360
the support is probably at the facet joints and at the disc interfaces. That probably fair?

626
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:55,600
Yeah. And then think of all the musculature as a scaffolding. Yeah. And the you know, the

627
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:03,040
levers and you know, that help with that stabilization and then the activation of

628
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:08,160
that deep stabilization as an uprighting effect. And let's talk about which muscles are on the

629
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:14,560
front of that. So if you were to cut me open here, and let's just say you pull everything out of the

630
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,040
way. So you pull my bow out of the way you pull everything and you go right down onto my

631
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:24,800
spine. What are the muscles you're going to see that are attached to the anterior or front portion

632
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:33,280
of my vertebral bodies? So two two main ones that we can talk about is the psoas, which

633
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:42,080
attaches to those transverse processes of the lumbar spine. And then the quadratus lumborum,

634
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:50,720
which also attaches to those processes. Both of those, they, with those attachments, they

635
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:56,720
also come up and they attach right where the diaphragm attaches the cruor of the diaphragm.

636
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,720
So, you know, if you, again, maybe you can pull up those images and put it on the show notes.

637
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:15,520
So you see the, all those kind of coalescing in that thoracic lumbar region. If, if I have that

638
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,520
ideal activation of that descending of the diaphragm and the facilitation of that inch

639
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:29,600
abdominal pressure, that pressure again loads the abdominal wall and creates that fixed point that

640
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:40,160
the psoas and the quadratus are anchoring off of. If that's compromised, they don't have anything to

641
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:47,360
anchor off of. And then you see that excessive extension and that overload of those facet joints.

642
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:56,000
And with exaggerate what the extension posture looks like so people can see it. So your hips will

643
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:04,480
your hips will move forward. So if you picture your pelvis as a bowl, you're tipping the bowl

644
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,840
forward, tipping the bowl forward. And then if you think of your rib cage, rib cage is coming forward

645
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:18,960
as well. So your spine, which normally has a bend in it, gets more of a bend. Excessive. Yeah. And

646
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:30,800
with that oblique position of the diaphragm and the pelvic floor, now there's a mechanical

647
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,720
disadvantage of the abdominal wall. So we took a cylinder that's supposed to sit like this

648
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:44,640
and we made it go like this. So now the tendency is going to be the extensor over activity

649
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:50,640
and the flexor, the psoas. So now you're just getting this repetitive compression on those

650
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:59,280
facet joints and the disc is getting this repetitive hinging flexion. And then in the

651
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:06,720
center of the disc, we have the fluid or the nucleus working its way through those

652
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:13,680
antiafibers as they weaken. And then that's where you get the disc protrusions or, you know,

653
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:19,520
it's, uh, substance can leak out and the body will, you know, go into that, that spat, that

654
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:27,360
protective spasm also. So you'll, you'll see the disc injury, but then you also see over time,

655
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,440
facet hypertrophy. So the, the degenerative changes and the accumulation of, of bony material,

656
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:46,960
trying to help stabilize. So part of my story and kind of discovering, uh, drove me into,

657
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:54,480
utilizing DNS, discovering Prague school, I developed what was called a spondylolysis,

658
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:03,040
which is a, uh, uh, stress fracture in the spine, part of the, the, the pars, which is kind of

659
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:11,280
that, that arch that attaches the vertebra and then the, to the facet joints. So for me

660
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:23,440
with overtraining, uh, poor recovery, uh, poor postural foundations, um, I was premature and,

661
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:31,600
um, looking back, knowing what I know now, looking at pictures or videos of myself, I could see that,

662
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:38,480
that compensatory pattern. It didn't catch up to me till, till college, you know, especially as

663
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,560
we're younger, we have a huge ability to compensate and we can get away with stuff.

664
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:50,800
But in college it caught up to me with, uh, um, with that, that stress fracture. So, um,

665
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:57,840
I was kind of like the poster boy of upper and lower cross syndrome and lack of efficient, uh,

666
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:05,840
stabilizing strategy. I had plenty of motivation and drive and practice, you know, hour upon hour,

667
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:15,200
but at a certain point, you know, structure overload of, you know, in that, that for me,

668
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:23,920
L4 L5 region that gave way, when that gave way, um, then I went into this whole chronic pain cycle

669
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:31,840
and it wasn't until, uh, you know, I went orthopedist, uh, physical therapists,

670
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:39,520
chiropractic, all of them helped in their own way, but it was, I was missing, I knew there was

671
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:46,800
something missing. So probably for selfish reasons, I went into this profession trying to figure out

672
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:54,960
my own pain and try to figure out how to recover. And, uh, you know, in, in medical school and same

673
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,000
chiropractic school first year, you're just getting bombarded with all anatomy, physiology,

674
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,840
functional biomechanics. All of it was amazing and interesting, but I'm like, this isn't helping me.

675
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:12,320
It wasn't until the second year where I was introduced to, uh, Prague school,

676
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:20,080
Yanda and Levitt and what they were teaching, it was like, oh, finally something made sense. And

677
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:27,440
just intuitively it made sense to, to what I was dealing with. So I started to, you know, learn more

678
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:33,120
and more about that while I was in school, uh, incorporating some of the treatment methods and

679
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:39,840
the exercises and that, that got me, you know, further along of kind of pulling myself out of,

680
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:50,560
my own kind of chronic pain. And then in, once I was out of school, uh, 97, 98,

681
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:59,280
after a few years, there was a clinician, Dr. Leibenson taking small groups over to Prague

682
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:05,520
to learn from those, the, you know, those pioneers and those, those Prague therapists.

683
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:14,000
Um, so I was able to go over there. I believe it was like an eight day, uh, intensive kind of

684
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:21,920
lectures and workshops. Got to see Levitt. Uh, but unfortunately the year before, uh, Yanda had

685
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:32,160
passed away and I believe Vojta passed away, I think early 2000, 2000, 2001. Um, but that's,

686
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:42,080
that was my first introduction to, uh, professor Pablo Colaj. And at that time it was his ideas

687
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:50,160
talking about developmental kinesiology and then utilizing that, that knowledge to develop the

688
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:57,600
assessments and the treatment strategies, not only, you know, to the cerebral palsy population,

689
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:03,280
but then he was talking about the adults and then, and then the sports population. So

690
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:10,880
once I saw that again, that was like another light bulb and another piece of that puzzle for me to,

691
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:18,000
to work my way out of it, out of my own, uh, situation. Um, and then from 2003,

692
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:25,680
basically I've watched this evolution of DNS, the concepts and principles turn into the actual name

693
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:33,040
and then the curriculum of where we're at now. Now you're, you're quite senior within the,

694
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,960
the, the, the sort of international community of DNS. Uh, you're one of only

695
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:44,080
18 international instructors. Isn't that about right? Yeah. What, what are the different levels

696
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:51,680
of certification within DNS, the highest level being where you're at that's can anybody attain

697
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:57,040
that level or do you have to, you know, be a chiropractor, a physician or an osteopathic

698
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:05,760
physician? Like what are the, yeah. So there's, there's three tracks of the dynamic neuromuscular

699
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:14,880
stabilization curriculum. One is a clinical track. It's a DNS, a B and C. And then the fourth course

700
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:20,880
is a D course, which you actually go to Prague and it's like an intensive, uh, with the, with the

701
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:31,840
Prague therapists. Um, there's a specific exercise sport, uh, sequence of courses. There's three

702
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:39,440
courses there. The first one is focused in clinicians only type of thing. The second one

703
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,800
is designed for trainers as well as clinicians because ideally we, we designed that one

704
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:53,760
because we want the two populations working together and on the same page. Um, but it's a

705
01:29:53,760 --> 01:30:00,880
little more focused towards, uh, you know, less manual and more of what, how you can integrate

706
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,480
it into a training program. The third is, uh, pediatrics, where are you going to utilize the

707
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:15,440
DNS handling skills with, with infants? And that's a, uh, series of, um, I believe three courses with

708
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:28,080
a fourth culminating in, in Prague. Um, so that curriculum, I believe started come about 2009.

709
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:38,400
And then off of that, we have specialty courses, uh, where we integrate, you know, um, different

710
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:46,000
things. One of Prague school's goals, it's, you know, they don't want DNS to be a, this is a DNS

711
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:54,000
technique. These are concepts and principles that professor collage, you know, building on those,

712
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:02,800
those founders and his experience and his, his ideas. Um, it's meant to be integrated into

713
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:09,520
everything else because it can, that's one thing I love about it is, um, you can easily integrate

714
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,240
it into the good work that you're already doing, whether you're a trainer, whether you're a clinician

715
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:19,040
and you do a specific technique, you know, for example, the Prague through the school therapists,

716
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:24,800
they did, they do visceral mobilization. They have specific soft tissue and mobilization

717
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:31,600
techniques, and they're constantly exploring and trying to evolve, you know, the, the teaching and

718
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:45,200
the, and the integration. So, um, it's a, a nice knowledge base and skillset to have, uh, again,

719
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:51,520
to enhance what you're already doing. And so, I mean, this afternoon, we're going to go down

720
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,560
and actually demonstrate a lot of this stuff by video, because I think that it's really challenging

721
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:04,480
to talk about this stuff. It's just not that amenable to a discussion. Um, it really has to be shown.

722
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:11,520
Um, and frankly, even showing it as challenging, I think experiencing it is, uh, is the gold standard.

723
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:18,800
That's the, that's the ultimate. Um, it's not just movements. It's not just specific exercises,

724
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:27,440
but it's facilitating the awareness of the, um, the ideal stabilization and the support. Um,

725
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:35,600
and then with that, you know, with, with my patients or whether it's training, um, I want

726
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:44,880
my patients or my athletes to feel the, that synergy and feel that, uh, ability to stabilize

727
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,560
where they need to, but then also relax where they need to. And it's a, there's a little bit of a

728
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:58,880
process. It's not a cookie cutter thing. Like just do this, this, this. Um, you have to put some work

729
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:06,160
into it and you have to practice it both as a patient and as a clinician or trainer. And I guess

730
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:15,920
that would be, you know, maybe, uh, one of the drawbacks for people is, um, you know, everything

731
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:24,240
out there, people are doing, doing good work and trying to help people. Um, and if they have

732
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,240
something that's working for them and we introduce these concepts and principles and they're not

733
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:35,280
easily integrated, then, um, maybe they don't, they don't adapt them or they'll adapt a portion

734
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:43,040
of them, which is fine as well. Um, but it's, it's something that, uh, in the curriculum,

735
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:54,480
uh, you know, we try to emphasize the need for, um, you know, uh, feeling and, and practicing the,

736
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:02,800
the movements that we can show later. I mean, I can only speak for myself, um, but I wonder if

737
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:10,320
my generalization is correct. I think my guess would be that the people who come to DNS late in life

738
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:18,800
with an injury get better, but then stick with it are probably people who like to really tinker,

739
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:24,960
tinker with things and like to toil away and don't necessarily need quick results, but can

740
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:30,080
sort of anchor to a philosophy. They sort of have faith in it and then they can sort of keep

741
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:38,640
pursuing it because, um, it, a, you don't, it, it, it feels a lot of the time like you're not doing

742
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:45,200
much, you know? And I think for someone who's used to, you know, being quite impatient with what they,

743
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:51,520
you know, I want results today and, you know, Hey, I just started CrossFit and two days later I'm

744
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:57,920
doing power cleans. Like this is awesome. Um, and, and if, if that's the, if that's the dopamine surge

745
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,640
that a person needs, they're gonna, I think they're going to struggle with a system where you might

746
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:09,280
spend a week, you know, daily practicing, learning how to breathe again. Um, and you'll never stop

747
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:14,400
practicing that by the way, you'll never stop practicing, you know, a really great breathing

748
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,280
pattern and a really great pattern of accessing these deep stabilizing muscles we've spoken about

749
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:24,240
and practicing all of these infant like movements. And yes, it gets more challenging over time and

750
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:30,160
you do these flows that become quite enjoyable, um, and can be very challenging. I mean, they're,

751
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:36,480
most of these things I still can't even do actually, especially with weight. Um, but I don't know,

752
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:44,000
I guess I would say, I always think of, um, things in medicine through the lens of efficacy

753
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:51,920
and effectiveness. So efficacy is how well does something work if it's adhered to correctly?

754
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:58,240
Effectiveness is if you just throw it out in the real world, how well does it work?

755
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:06,720
To me, DNS might be the single most efficacious thing I have ever come across as far as,

756
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:14,240
you know, healing injury and preventing injury. I'm not sure if it's the most effective thing,

757
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,600
which is not a knock on it, but the point is to your point earlier, a lot of people aren't going

758
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,520
to do it, you know, especially once you get them out of pain, they're not going to want to stay

759
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:30,160
with it. Now, I don't know why that is. Um, but that's the thing that I would hope that DNS can

760
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:36,240
improve upon in the next decade. It's only a decade old, but it's like, how do we take this

761
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:41,680
thing that is so efficacious? Again, meaning if a person actually does it, they're going to get

762
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:49,680
better. It's almost impossible not to fix back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, like all of these

763
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:54,880
injuries, they're going to get better. Where, where we want to do it is make sure that hey,

764
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:59,680
people, you know, we want 90% of people to be able to stick to it once they start.

765
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:06,880
Part of that is with the curriculum, whether you're a clinician or a trainer,

766
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:16,720
the part of the process is with the assessment, you're training your eye just like a good coach

767
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:25,200
will recognize, um, you know, something not right with the runner or the tennis player or the golf

768
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:34,640
swing. Um, you know, you can, uh, DNS will have the specific assessment and those specific exercises

769
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,600
based off of development. Once you develop your eye and recognize where the insufficiencies are,

770
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:48,160
you can recognize that insufficiency of stability within the, the swing within the running within

771
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:56,720
the, the lift. So you can, in my opinion, um, you can get to the point where you can utilize these

772
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:04,560
concepts and principles, communicate them in a way, you know, to the deadlift or, um, to the runner

773
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:11,600
where, uh, you can help them in that manner. Maybe they're not doing the specific developmental

774
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:19,680
movement, but you're giving them ideas as far as loading, queuing that will facilitate that, um,

775
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:26,560
that efficiency. So, um, and that's the challenge you're dealing with in major league baseball is

776
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,880
you know, that there's a way to get an extra four miles an hour out of a pitch,

777
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,920
but you also know that that athlete probably doesn't want to, or doesn't have the time to,

778
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,000
maybe I would argue they should have the time to, but maybe doesn't want to go back and do

779
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:46,240
all of the fundamental movements and master what a, what an infant does. So now your challenge is

780
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:52,560
while you're on the pitching mound, how do I put a principle in you that's going to create

781
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:59,040
a little more whip like stability? Right. Part of that is training up the staff that will be

782
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:07,760
dealing with that athlete full, full time, the more, uh, skilled and, you know, movement towards

783
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:13,840
mastery of that, the better it's going to be for the people that they work with. So part of that is

784
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:21,920
that process, that education, that, that learning process. And, um, that's what I see,

785
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:29,120
you know, people starting to, to ask for, to, to help with, because a lot of people will,

786
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,600
will take the coursework and they're like, Oh man, yeah, that's, that's awesome. How do I

787
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:43,120
integrate it? And that's also, um, part of the curriculum we've created kind of specialty

788
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:49,920
courses. So for example, um, there's certain expertise within Prague school. We have a Prague

789
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:57,280
therapist that, um, focuses on the running athlete. We have one of the instructors dance

790
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:06,480
professionally. So we have, uh, you know, a dance specific exercise sport course we've done golf.

791
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:14,480
We've done, uh, baseball. Uh, Dr. Ohm has a strength specific lifting specific course talking

792
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:24,000
about that integration. So we're, we're trying to create, um, uh, kind of that curriculum to help

793
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,680
with that integration. Cause if we just have the standard courses, you know, more of that's going

794
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:38,560
to tend to be clinical. Um, and, uh, but if we show how to actually do the integration within

795
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:43,360
the specialty course, whoever's working with those athletes or an athlete themselves,

796
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,640
that's going to be, we're going to be able to communicate it better. Cause they understand

797
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:55,840
that, um, you know, that sport we even done, we've done, uh, you know, a hockey specific,

798
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:01,840
um, one of the check therapists works with the national check national hockey team.

799
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,280
So obviously huge, you know, experience. And then we, we show the integration. So

800
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:16,400
that's part of that evolution of trying to communicate these concepts and principles

801
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:22,080
better, help people integrate them better so that we can again, enhance what we're

802
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:26,720
doing with our patients and with our athletes are with our, you know,

803
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,560
people that want to focus on performance. Well, Michael, this has been, this has been

804
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,000
interesting and I think it's going to get a lot more interesting when we, when we go and roll

805
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,360
around in the mats a little bit. And, and, um, I think give a little bit more of a visual explanation

806
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,200
of what a lot of this stuff looks like. So thanks so much for sharing your insights and, uh,

807
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:51,040
keeping up the fight. Thank you. That went faster than I thought. And I just feel like we scratched

808
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:58,400
the surface. So I know, I know. Looking forward to, to showing it, to help people, uh, understand

809
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:03,200
it a little bit better. Thank you. Yeah. And, and hopefully once people see it, they'll want to take

810
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,760
that next step, which is feeling it. And I, I true, I truly think that only when you feel this,

811
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,520
do you, do you understand it? And I think that's true of not just DNS. I think that's true of

812
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:17,040
PRI and FRC and all these other things that we've spoken about that in my mind all have a place in

813
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:22,800
both the world of rehab and a prehab. Yeah. If you, if you can feel it, then you can start to

814
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:29,680
integrate it and, you know, create that, that, uh, new pattern. Awesome. Thank you.

815
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,080
