00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,120
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. I guess this week are Dr. Deborah Kimless and

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,360
Steve Goldner. I'm not going to say much about them by way of background because I opened the

47
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,040
interview by asking them to introduce themselves because their backgrounds are so relevant to the

48
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,040
discussion we have. I sought out both Deb and Steve because I wanted to have a discussion that

49
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,760
would frankly first inform me, but obviously provide the necessary and relevant background

50
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,960
information to all of you as listeners on a topic that frankly it confuses me to no end, which is

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:49,560
the entire morass of THC, CBD, hemp, cannabis, that whole landscape. Truthfully, I've never

52
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,760
fully been able to understand this in part because I think it's just very confusing in part perhaps

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,480
because I haven't put enough effort into it. Preparing for this podcast was a great exercise

54
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,440
in doing just that. In this episode, we talk about a lot of things, but we start frankly with some of

55
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,600
the semantics. What is the difference between THC, CBD? Where do these things work? How do they work

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,720
in the body? What's the difference between what it's doing in the brain and what it's doing

57
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:21,160
elsewhere? How do molecules work that aren't neat and clean like designer drugs where one molecule

58
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,280
hits one receptor? As you'll see, cannabis, it works very different from that. We also then get

59
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,200
into some of the safety issues. At the time of this recording, which was in late October 2019,

60
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,000
there is obviously an epidemic, or at least a perceived epidemic around the dangers of vaping.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,720
We touch on some of the reasons why that may be the case, but really for the past three years,

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,680
we have been witnessing both a market evolution, a scientific evolution, and certainly a policy

63
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,800
evolution, which may be the most important as it pertains to this subject matter. Again, I think

64
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,000
as you'll see in the first few minutes, Deb and Steve are really great people to have this

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,920
discussion with because collectively between them, you have a medical, a pharmacological, and a

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,400
regulatory expertise that is brought to bear. Now, it's worth pointing out that both Steve and Debra

67
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,600
are involved in a company. Steve is the founder and CEO of Pure Green, and Deb is the chief medical

68
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,680
officer. I point that out to say everything must be interpreted with a grain of salt. Obviously,

69
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,560
Steve and Deb have a commercial interest in this space. Now, I will tell you that after spending

70
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,720
two hours with them, or slightly more than two hours during this podcast, also spending another

71
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,360
hour with them off mic, getting into stuff that we just weren't comfortable talking about on mic,

72
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,840
I come away thinking very highly of them, very highly of their work, and believing that their

73
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,760
intentions here go far beyond just the commercial intentions of people involved in this space.

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,120
This is a confusing topic, and I won't represent that this one podcast is going to answer every

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,240
possible question you have. The good news is it might not matter if it did, because frankly,

76
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,720
this is an area that is evolving so much, and I suspect this is a topic that I will need to go

77
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,560
back to probably a year from now. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with

78
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:16,040
Steve Goldner and Debra Kimless. Debra, Steve, thank you so much for making time to come and

79
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,760
talk about this stuff today. This is kind of an unusual podcast in that we weren't introduced

80
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,600
through anybody. I sort of organically reached out to you guys on the basis of so much demand

81
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,360
and so many questions about this topic, which is something, as I've alluded to, I'm completely

82
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,000
ignorant of. So this is a topic I've been really looking forward to learning about because patients

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,080
ask me about it constantly. I think the implications are only becoming more significant as we watch the

84
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,400
evolution of the legal environment. So having a physician and a lawyer to talk about this is

85
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,880
perfect. Deb, can you give me a bit of background on your interest in this? You're an anesthesiologist.

86
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,800
I know you specialize in pain. Tell me what drew you to this specifically. So what drew me to this

87
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,840
is that my mom was dying from a complication from a pharmaceutical drug, and because of that, I

88
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,040
started really thinking about what we learned in medical school, how we were trained, and what else

89
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,160
could there have been for my mom as an option other than a pharmaceutical. And as she lay dying,

90
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,640
my significant others in Israel, he said, you know, they're studying medical cannabis in Israel.

91
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,360
And unfortunately, my mom didn't have an opportunity to try medical cannabis as a pain

92
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:39,640
reliever because she died. But I spent really since 2013, until now, studying and investigating

93
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:47,320
the veracity of whether or not cannabis truly is a medicinal molecules. Steve, how did you guys

94
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,880
meet and how did you get involved in this? Well, I've been involved in pharmaceutical

95
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,520
formulations as a scientist for almost 50 years now. As a forensic toxicologist at the New York

96
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,800
Medical Examiner, I worked on 18,000 autopsies. So I developed and formulated the drug liquid drug

97
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,320
methadone about 47 years ago, because friends of mine were coming back addicted from the Vietnam

98
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,800
War. So that worked out pretty well, developed that formulation methadone has done very well

99
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,560
of helping people around the world. And I went on to become FDA attorney working in the pharmaceutical

100
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,680
industry, but always working in this arena. I became interested in cannabis as a medicine

101
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:41,640
almost 45 years ago. A friend of mine came back from Vietnam War with PTSD. And he asked me to

102
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,200
develop a drug that would help cure him of that. And I noticed that when he smoked marijuana, he

103
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,720
felt much better when he drank or got pills from the VA, he did not. And so I realized that cannabis

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,440
could be a medicine, but it just wasn't legal at the time. And I wasn't that right kind of lawyer

105
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,520
to get that legalized. Now I have that opportunity to be able to do it. That's what brought me into

106
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,120
it. He also, my buddy who's passed away of cirrhosis of the liver about seven years ago,

107
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:21,080
made me vow to do this. So developing methadone at the beginning of my career was a first bookend

108
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,400
and now developing all these formulations to help people with cannabis is the second bookend on my

109
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:34,040
career. And how did the two of you meet? So I lecture around the country and around the world,

110
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,600
and I present studies that I have done on my own. These are case studies. I treat over 400 patients

111
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,640
free of charge, a bad business model, but what I've learned from these patients is tremendous

112
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,480
using diet changing cannabinoid medicines. And I share them with colleagues so that they too can

113
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,920
understand cannabis is a medicine. And Steve and I met two years ago at Cologne, Germany, I think it

114
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:06,040
was at IACM where I was presenting a poster and he tracked me down and we had our first conversation

115
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,000
there. And together you guys are part of a company. We'll probably hear a little bit about that company

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,960
today, but the aim of this company, I assume, is to create sort of what you perceive to be the safest,

117
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,760
most efficacious form of delivery of cannabis. Is that a fair assessment? Yes, that's exactly it.

118
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,680
I think to understand why you guys do what you do, we have to understand a whole bunch of things that

119
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,520
I don't understand right now. So let's just start with some history. How long has cannabis been

120
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,040
consumed by humans to the best of our knowledge? Historically, it's been used as a medicine for

121
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,960
5,000 years. I mean, this is crazy. It's new for us now, but it's not a new medication. In Asia,

122
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,880
the king fancied himself a pharmacist and he was treating people for all sorts of disorders from

123
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,720
gout to absent memory, believe it or not, even though people are like, dude, where's my car?

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,400
Here he was helping people with memory loss with it. The ancient Greeks used it

125
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,560
topically on their horses, which is why I do know that the acid forms of the cannabis medicine

126
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,520
actually work because they love their war horses. They applied the cannabis leaves to the horse's

127
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:29,720
bodies to reduce the swelling, inflammation, and infection after a war or a battle. Historically,

128
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,160
when did it sort of fall out of favor, back in favor, it said, I mean, for most people,

129
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,640
when they think about marijuana, they sort of think of the sixties and seventies as this era

130
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,000
in which the public sort of got to know it and it became then sort of demonized. When was it

131
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,760
actually scheduled, Steve? I think that was the beginning of around 1930 or so. That is, there were

132
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,600
a number of individuals who thought that this was just a completely inappropriate

133
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:07,080
drug to be allowed out, a recreational drug. And there was a lot of movement towards controlling

134
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,280
people's appetites in many ways, including drinking alcohol that have floated in and out through America

135
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:23,080
and across the world. So it began then with an idea of prohibition and it was really given a much

136
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:31,960
more emphatic push under the Nixon administration for it's often said for their own political

137
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:40,440
purposes of being able to disenfranchise people who would utilize marijuana, young people or people

138
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,960
of color. And that became essentially the war on drugs policy that was promulgated through the

139
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,400
United Nations and around the world because the United States often was the funder of those

140
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:00,360
activities. That's continued for quite some time, but is now, as everyone knows, dramatically,

141
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
dramatically changing. Now, unlike the sort of psychedelics, which were actually scheduled

142
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,520
only about 50 years ago, you're saying marijuana was scheduled in the thirties. I mean, this is

143
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:18,040
before the FDA? Well, FDA has been around for at least that long and the originally scheduling

144
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:27,400
of this was under DEA as a narcotic drug and therefore it would not be allowed. And DEA really

145
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,040
had much more of a law enforcement orientation while FDA does have a staff of essentially

146
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,560
policemen working with them. They're not organized in that manner. So they're much more organized

147
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,480
towards what is a medicine, what's a food and how to be able to keep our American health policies

148
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,000
the best possible for people. You talked a moment ago, Deb, about topically applying this. How did

149
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,400
people do that? Was that an oil and what was it? I mean, not that you were there at the time and

150
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,680
we could go back and figure it out, but to the best of our understanding, what is it that was

151
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,640
being applied to, for example, a horse or how was it being used medicinally 5,000 years ago?

152
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,680
It varied depending upon the indication and what they wanted to do. But the horse example was they

153
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,040
were actually applying leaves to these horses, the actual, you know, family is irregular leaves.

154
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,080
There are small amounts of trichomes on those leaves with cannabinoids in them. So of course,

155
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,240
it would work. It was really interesting. In India, they would mix it with heat and milk and make

156
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:40,760
something called bhang, B-H-A-N-G, and they would drink it as an anesthetic for people. So it really

157
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:46,360
did vary. It was very interesting that people apply these things in different ways. So today,

158
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,360
when people think about marijuana, the thing they probably have in the back of their mind is more

159
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,960
related to the properties of THC. Is that correct? Yeah, I think that most people, when they think of

160
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:05,720
cannabis, think about it as THC, intoxication, and smoking. So let's talk a little bit about that.

161
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,560
So you've used the funny reference of Dude Where's My Car? So Jeff Spicoli falling out of the van,

162
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,680
big plume of smoke coming out after him. He is taking a leaf. He is smoking that leaf.

163
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,480
More, I mean, he's with broken pieces of it rolled up into a joint and being smoked.

164
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,720
Right. So cannabis as a plant is very interesting, right? So when it grows in nature,

165
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,120
it grows as a flower. The leaf does have some cannabinoids in it or some of those medicines in

166
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,000
it, but really the most bang for your buck, it comes from the flower where that's what it is.

167
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,120
So Spicoli was probably buying off the street and maybe he's getting some leaf, but he's hoping for

168
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,040
some flower because that's where the majority of the medicine is and, you know, drying it out and

169
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,000
rolling it up and then combusting it. The interesting thing is you can eat the cannabis plant all day

170
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,920
long. You may get a belly ache from all the fiber, but you won't get that intoxicating feeling

171
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,000
because its chemical constituents are not in a way that can get you intoxicated.

172
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,680
I see. Okay. So let's talk about how that intoxication works. What does THC stand for?

173
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,840
Tetrahydrocannabinol. And what does it do in the brain?

174
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:24,040
So our brains have these sort of docking stations called receptors and chemicals act on different

175
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:31,640
docking stations or receptors in order to affect a change. So THC works on these docking stations

176
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,640
in our brain and our peripheral nervous system known as CB1 receptor, cannabinoid 1 receptor,

177
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,200
wasn't very interesting name for it, but that's what they call it. And there are also cannabinoid

178
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,560
2 receptors or CB2 receptors were found purrfully predominantly on immune cells, but also on other

179
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,920
tissue as well and in other organs. And so THC has this really unique ability to activate or sit on

180
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,800
the CB1 and CB2 receptors. And did you say both CB1 and 2 are peripheral?

181
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,560
They can be CB2 predominantly is peripheral. CB1 is predominantly in the brain and then other nerves.

182
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,880
So the peripheral nervous system. And what is the next chain of events? So once THC binds to these

183
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,920
receptors, what happens inside the cells? Oh gosh. So depending upon where in those

184
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:28,760
receptors are located will determine what happens. So for example, if it's in the hippocampus,

185
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:36,200
it may stimulate areas in that area that will help you extinguish memory. So for people with PTSD

186
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,360
who cannot stop thinking about certain things, that area of the brain extinguishes

187
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,760
memory and helps somebody with PTSD maybe to get some sleep.

188
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,400
How do you think it acts with respect to pain?

189
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,040
It's a multimodal different way of doing it. So centrally, it does interfere with periaqueductal

190
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,880
gray areas. These are areas of the brain that conduct pain signaling where a brain actually

191
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,080
understands this also works perfectly on immune cells to decrease inflammation and reduce cytokine

192
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,440
expression. So it works in a whole host of different ways. We're used to thinking in medicine

193
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,720
actually as an alipaf of a single molecule, single target. But what you really learn is that that's a

194
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,120
great way of understanding how a drug could work, but that's not how it works in a biologic system

195
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,080
known as a person or an animal. And so contrasting this with what you talked about with respect to

196
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,400
your mom's care, for example, she was probably being prescribed opiates, I'm assuming.

197
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,760
So my mom actually died from fracturing to death from a pharmaceutical known as a bisphosphonate

198
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,160
from Phosimax. The weird thing about my mom is that she was one of the 20 to 30% of people who

199
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,920
when they took opiates had an enhanced response to pain, not a decreased response to pain.

200
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,960
So basically, she was using acetaminophen and non-steroidals to try to reduce her pain, which

201
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,600
when she spontaneously blew out her pelvis, didn't really help that much. So we were just

202
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,920
hoping that since medical cannabis works in different methods for pain relief, it could have

203
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,640
been an option for her. Wouldn't have cured her, but could have helped her. Now, one of the other

204
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,880
effects of inhaling marijuana for many people seems to be an increase in appetite. Do we have

205
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,560
a sense of why that's the case? And that's, I remember certainly in medical school, that was

206
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,880
even something that we talked about a lot was patients that had wasting syndromes either with

207
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,920
cancer or AIDS. This would be a great way to help them eat. Exactly. So there are areas of the brain

208
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:45,800
that control appetite and nausea and vomiting as well in the area in the medulla. In those areas,

209
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:52,200
is replete with CB1 receptors. So when those areas are stimulated, your appetite is stimulated and

210
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,160
you actually have a desire to eat, which you're right is life-saving for somebody who has wasting

211
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,240
syndrome or who has chemotherapy, induced nausea and vomiting. There's this other thing that now

212
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,880
people talk about a lot called CBD. I probably hadn't even heard of this until maybe four or

213
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,080
five years ago. I mean, Steve, how long has CBD been understood as a distinct part of this equation?

214
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:26,760
So this is a truly revolutionary new molecule to come out into the public consciousness so quickly.

215
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:35,240
It's always been in the plant and available to use, but it's because people were so entranced

216
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:44,360
with the idea of let's get stoned or then let's do some science on this stoning aspect of THC,

217
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:53,400
that that drew most of the attention. It's just really in the last two or three years that CBD,

218
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,640
because of its non-hallucinogenic effects, has become interesting to people because it appears

219
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,600
to have, it does have so many medicinal applications and at the same time, doesn't get a person stoned.

220
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,560
How is that possible? What is it doing chemically to create that distinction?

221
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:20,440
So different than THC, CBD does not sit directly on CB1 receptors or CB2 receptors,

222
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,680
but works either indirectly activating the endocannabinoid system or it works on completely

223
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,680
different receptors. And so together it has a synergistic effect with THC or all the other

224
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,960
molecules that live in the cannabis plant or by itself is pretty effective as a medicine.

225
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,560
Now in nature, do they come lockstep one and one for every molecule of THC is one CBD coming with

226
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,760
it or how does that work? So in nature, it doesn't exist at all, right? It isn't until you apply time

227
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,800
and temperature and get rid of that acid form, that carboxyl group on either THC or CBD or any

228
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,600
of the other cannabinoids. So that's kind of interesting as a baseline anyway, but CBD, there

229
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,680
are cultivars or plant strains as known in the street can grow in higher concentrations in certain

230
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,960
cultivars. It can occur as a one-to-one, one molecule to one molecule. It depends upon the

231
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:26,280
strain that you're growing. The legal definition of hemp is something that's higher in CBD A and

232
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,880
less than 0.3% THC. I'm glad you brought that up. Tell us a little bit more about the difference

233
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,600
between hemp and cannabis specifically and again using the CBD THC delineation. So the legal

234
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:48,440
definition is for a hemp cultivar is to have less than 0.3% by weight of THC or THC actually

235
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,840
compared to the rest of the biomass or the rest of the molecules in the plant.

236
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,360
Technically, that would make anything hemp that doesn't have THC in it, right?

237
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:06,040
Exactly. So people use cannabis plants and just crossbreed so that THC is less than 0.3% so that

238
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:14,040
they can grow it. But the term of industrial hemp back in the day when our constitution was written

239
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,320
and sales were being made out of hemp, it's a totally different plant as it is today,

240
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,800
just because of crossbreeding and farming the way we're doing it.

241
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,200
Steve, the Farm Bill brought this to the forefront recently. Tell us about the Farm Bill and why

242
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,800
that's relevant. I want to come back to this, but just while we're on the topic of hemp,

243
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,640
it's important I think for people to understand this distinction.

244
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:44,040
The Congress decided, pushed forward by several legislators who had large numbers of farmers,

245
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,800
that this would be a really good cash crop for them. When you think of it, these products are

246
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:56,520
selling for thousands of dollars a pound compared to 50 cents or a dollar a pound for lettuce or

247
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,400
tomatoes. So if you're a farmer, you'd much rather grow something that you can get thousands of

248
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,520
dollars for. The idea was put forward that this should be something that's allowed now.

249
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,400
We can see across America that people really are interested in it, that medicine can be developed

250
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,680
from it. So it was with this idea that a number of legislators, particularly Senator McConnell,

251
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:30,680
had a number of farmers in his jurisdiction, wanted to be able to help them in their businesses

252
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:38,440
and in their personal lives to be able to develop this. Otherwise, these products are imported from

253
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,520
overseas, and we'd like the American population to be able to have a good, well-regulated source

254
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,360
of product here. I think that was the entire idea behind it, was that we would bring the U.S.

255
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,280
Department of Agriculture, as well as other scientific bodies like FDA, to be able to begin

256
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:04,200
to study these products and help the growers. All of the growers that have worked on cannabis hemp

257
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,160
products have had to do this for generations without having someone like the USDA around to

258
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,040
tell them what pesticides were appropriate to use, how to grow it, how to have good growing conditions

259
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,920
for it. So this has really helped, I think, to be able to advance it. Was the farm bill basically

260
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,680
just an economic package that made it more attractive, or was there some legalization

261
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:39,400
that was previously not there? The farm bill really provided legal cover for farmers to be able to

262
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:48,840
grow the hemp and then to be able, for processors, then to be able to process it into oil and be able

263
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,880
to turn it on into other products. So it started out as something to just aid farmers, but now it

264
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:04,600
is moving through the economic distribution chain, and that's why we can see it now in nearly every

265
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,920
drug store or big box store as finished goods on the shelf. What are some of the products that come

266
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:17,880
from the hemp plant? There are vape cartridges, certainly, although they're not at the moment,

267
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,960
not all that perhaps professionally done except by those who are licensed to be able to do it.

268
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,600
There's a very large gray or black market in it, but there are lotions, creams, ointments.

269
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:41,800
You can find CBD products in ice cream and tea. Soon it'll be in coffee and nearly every other

270
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,760
consumer product that's available. Is the idea that there are certain hemp products that do not

271
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,920
contain CBD and certain hemp products that do, or is the implication that all hemp products are

272
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,840
containing CBD? So I think what you're asking is about the industrial uses of hemp beyond the

273
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,160
cannabinoid. And so you can put that flower into seed and make hemp seeds from it, which has a

274
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,440
wonderful profile of omega 3 to omega 6, probably better than anything, and a wonderful source of

275
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,000
protein as well. The fiber that it comes from, hempfryer has a tensile strength of steel or greater

276
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,120
than steel. Where you see plastic goods, you can actually substitute for hemp. It's just really

277
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,400
expensive machinery for now until they figure it out.

278
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,680
Meaning it displaces the petroleum in plastic or what is it displacing?

279
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,480
Yes, it displaces the petroleum in plastic. So you can make a credit card out of hempfiber.

280
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,600
You can make hempcrete. So instead of concrete, you can actually use it, make it to make it

281
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:48,440
concrete. There are BMWs right now that are using parts of their door panels and dashboards using

282
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,720
hemp. You can make cloth, you can make clothing, you can make sellers sales.

283
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,200
Do you have a sense of you take all of the biomass that's being produced in the United States from a

284
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,560
hemp crop today, how much of it is being used for all of these industrial uses and how much is being

285
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,280
used just for CBD? I assume the latter is a tiny fraction of it.

286
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,640
Oh no, I think CBD is the lion's share of it because that's where the money is right now.

287
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,320
The de-cortication machine, the machine that is required to break down the stock, which is

288
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,880
incredibly fibrous and tough, is very expensive right now. And I think that there's such a

289
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,600
huge interest, at least in the United, well everywhere, but especially in the United States,

290
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,960
for CBD as a potential medicine or tonic, that's where the money is. So it's a lot easier to extract

291
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,240
and make derivative products than it is to create a lot of these other iterations that I just

292
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,160
described as an industrial use. But let me just interject that some of these other uses are just

293
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:56,920
remarkable and have been around for a long time. Henry Ford personally was very proud of having

294
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:05,480
developed a hemp mobile. And he actually had built a car that ran and its fuel was fueled by

295
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:14,200
hemp oil. So the entire car in the 1930s could have been put out on the road and they had to

296
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,760
shelve that project because suddenly hemp was illegal, because it came from the marijuana

297
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,360
sought marijuana plants. When did CBD become federally legal? I assume it is federally legal

298
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,080
today or is it still state regulated? Well, it certainly is state regulated and each state has

299
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:46,200
its own regulations. The federal regulation of it is continuing to unfold. The farm bill has legalized

300
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:54,280
hemp itself. It has not directly said that CBD is okay to put into products.

301
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,440
Rather, there's been an intense push on the Food and Drug Administration whose responsibility it

302
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:10,600
is to regulate those kinds of consumer products that they should move expeditiously and actually

303
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:20,680
Deb testified before FDA about five months or so ago on the safety and effectiveness of CBD to

304
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,440
help them in their data gathering. So when you spoke to the FDA, Deb, what were the main points

305
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,840
you tried to get across? The main points that we discussed was about a clinical trial that we ran

306
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:42,200
using a water soluble iteration of CBD for mild to moderate pain in a 16 patient cohort and the

307
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,680
results of it. I wanted to share that with safety, efficacy and our results. Let's talk a little bit

308
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,120
about that. So you said 16 patients that had mild to moderate pain, meaning what was the etiology of

309
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,280
their pain? So it was multifactorial. I didn't just stratify to one condition because I just

310
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,240
wanted to see it was a proof of concept trial and I actually didn't think it was going to work.

311
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,680
Steve was kind enough to let me formulate an ultra low dose, five milligrams of CBD with some

312
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:18,600
curated terpenes in a water soluble tablet. I gave it to 16 patients who had mild to moderate pain

313
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,920
for which they were treating their pain with an over the counter medication. And we ran this

314
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:34,040
trial for two weeks and we had statistically significant decrease in pain across all 16

315
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:39,320
patients. How do you control for the placebo effect there? Was there a control in that study?

316
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,160
There was not. Again, it was a proof of concept study to see if this ultra low dose of CBD would

317
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,000
even work and it did. There's no control for placebo for really for anything. I mean, I know

318
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,280
lots of patients I'm sure you do as well that seem to really respond to a whole host of medicines,

319
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:04,360
whether it comes from a double blind randomized trial or not. How does CBD in your mind differ

320
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,560
from THC? We know obviously how it does from an intoxication standpoint. How do you think it

321
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,320
differs in the remainder of the profile? It works in a different mechanisms of action.

322
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:25,080
For example, CBD doesn't sit on a CB1 receptor, but what it does is it interacts with the breakdown

323
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,240
products of our naturally occurring endocannabinoids, which does sit on a CB1 receptor.

324
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,680
So by enhancing that, that's one pain relieving mechanism of action. It interacts with

325
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,880
dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine type receptors and enhances those chemicals as well.

326
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,240
So it works in a multimodal way, just like all of our other medications.

327
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,520
I'm trying to in my mind wrap this idea around a Venn diagram of THC and CBD. Does that make sense

328
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,200
where you have certain things that they both do and then things that are unique to each of them?

329
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,920
Does that make sense to think of it that way? It does and it doesn't. So I understand as an

330
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:15,000
allopathic physician that that's how we like to look at things. That's a very reductionist view

331
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,560
of it. And I think this is really botanical medicine. We really have a lot of different

332
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,080
constituents within it. There's over a hundred different cannabinoids, over 80 plus terpenes,

333
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,760
flavonoids, and probably constituents were not smart enough yet to even have figured out.

334
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,880
What do the terpenes do? Terpenes occur in nature in all kinds of plants and in foods that are

335
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,080
giving the taste and the scent to all kinds of things. And they're anti-inflammatory. They're

336
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,200
actually secondary metabolites like the cannabinoids as well. And it's used for the plant,

337
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,560
not for our benefit, but for its benefit as a natural pesticide, a antioxidant. And it works

338
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,560
that way in our bodies as well. I want to come back to sort of the THC side of the equation.

339
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,840
Let's start talking about some of the health risks and or benefits and let's start with the risks.

340
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,760
What do you think are the most important risks to understand from THC use?

341
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,440
So I think everybody is different. We're all an N of one and we all respond differently

342
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,880
to the same type of thing. So if I give one person an aspirin, their headache may go away.

343
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:35,000
Somebody else may die of an allergic reaction to it. In some people who are very sensitive to THC,

344
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,520
they may not just feel intoxicated, but they may feel so much anxiety and panic that they are

345
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,440
incredibly uncomfortable. And some is dose dependent, but some experience that even with

346
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,000
a small amount. Some people experience a feeling of well-being with a little bit of THC. Some people

347
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,520
have a rapid heartbeat and their blood pressure shoots up and have an uncomfortable experience.

348
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,680
How much of that do we think is setting dependent? So if you took the same person,

349
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,920
administered the exact same dose by the same route, but under different settings, either the

350
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,320
actual physical setting they're in or the emotional state they're in, how much can that impact the

351
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,760
response? I think anytime you're dealing with something that plays around with neurochemistry,

352
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,160
set and setting is always a huge important thing. Same thing with alcohol. I think there's one part

353
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,600
of this is while we're talking about the safety or potential adverse events from this that we

354
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:41,960
should also address. In my experience, this has the lowest toxicity potential of any pharmaceutical

355
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:49,880
nearly of almost any product I've ever seen. That is in the course of history, we really do not have

356
00:36:49,880 --> 00:37:01,800
any deaths or truly serious events that are attributed to THC or CBD at all. It is so less

357
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:11,320
toxic than what are common over the counter drugs, aspirin, Tylenol, etc. and certainly far and away

358
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:19,080
compared to alcohol, which is truly toxic. What is the reported LD50 of THC?

359
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,120
So there really isn't and you cannot dose. Maybe explain to people what LD50 is.

360
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:34,200
Okay. So LD50 is the lethal dose that it takes in order to kill off 50% of a population,

361
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:45,320
usually in mice or rats. With THC and CBD and all of these cannabinoids, it has never been possible

362
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:53,880
to dose them with enough to be able to do it. So that there is just a simple cut off generally

363
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:01,000
that it's something more than five grams per kilogram. So that's a tremendous,

364
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,880
absolutely tremendous amount of cannabis to be able to take on. In the 70s, an attorney for the

365
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:17,160
DEA actually was writing in support of de-scheduling cannabis said that the lethal dose 50 would take

366
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:26,040
a 75 kilogram man to smoke 1500 pounds of cannabis flower in 15 minutes in order to die and he

367
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,920
wouldn't die from a cardi respiratory effect from cannabis. It would be from probably carbon monoxide poisoning.

368
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,600
Did Willie Nelson try this? I think so. Okay. But he wasn't able to do it.

369
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,480
He's still alive, right? So it's interesting what Steve was saying is that the receptors,

370
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,960
those docking stations, there are no CB1 receptors or very few in the cardi respiratory centers of our

371
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,760
brain, different than the opioid receptors, the mu receptors, where you overdose because that docking

372
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:01,400
station gets activated by heroin or Percocet or OxyContin and you slow down your respirations and

373
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,880
you stop breathing and your heart slows down and your heart starts beating and you die.

374
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,360
That doesn't happen with cannabinoids because those receptors don't exist in those areas of

375
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:19,480
the brain where that would happen. And so literally to this day, you can over-consume

376
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:27,080
cannabis and you may feel like you want to die with this incredible anxiety or psychotic event,

377
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,080
but you're not going to. So it's sort of like LSD in that sense where it really

378
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,320
doesn't have a known upper limit of toxicity from a pure cardiorespiratory standpoint.

379
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,720
By comparison, Steve, you worked in the medical examiner's office for so many years.

380
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,240
What's the LD50 of ethanol? That's a great question and I can't remember the answer right off hand.

381
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:57,000
However, I do remember that the level at which people are intoxicated by this, and generally

382
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,200
we all know to be one or two shots of alcohol or wine or beer, and that it very quickly becomes a

383
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:12,920
disorienting drug with just a second one. Particularly the problem is that people don't

384
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,080
think they're disoriented by it and that they are actually under control. It's a very different

385
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,440
situation with cannabis. Usually as people take on these substances within their body,

386
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:35,240
they actually know that they're stoned and have a sense of it and are able to be able to

387
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,680
rectify their own behavior. Usually it's called just sit on the couch and watch TV or something

388
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,760
like that. Yeah, there's another point here I think on the toxicity that probably is worth

389
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,440
mentioning and you could probably speak to this with more accuracy, but it's sort of how I explain

390
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,640
toxicity to people. It's not just what the LD50 is, it's how far the LD50 is from the Eustose.

391
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,560
Consider acetaminophen. You'll very easily go and take a thousand milligrams of acetaminophen.

392
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,560
I don't know what the LD50 is, it's probably between 10 and 20 grams. That's not that far

393
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:15,400
away. That you could only miss the dose by 10x and kill someone is amazing. I'll tell you a

394
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,640
ridiculous story. I don't know why I'm getting it, but it's just an illustrator at this point.

395
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,440
I remember in residency once during our internship, a guy accidentally wrote a prescription for one

396
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:33,720
gram of adavan instead of one milligram of adavan. He wrote for a thousand times more of the dose,

397
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:40,280
which is a clerical error that came from his just being careless. Unfortunately, the nurse working

398
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:49,000
that day was very new and she took the order as one gram of adavan. To make matters worse,

399
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,520
the pharmacist on call that day was also new and realized in the pixus system, we only have 20

400
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:03,320
milligrams here. That's 21 thousandths of what you've ordered. I'll send it up right now and go

401
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,480
and get the remaining 980 milligrams. That patient was actually administered 20 milligrams of adavan

402
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,120
and of course had a respiratory arrest. That's toxicity. That's a lawsuit.

403
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,840
That's a therapeutic index. They say for over the counter drugs, it's like one to 20. You take

404
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,360
two aspirin and your headache goes away 40 and you're going to be in the hospital for something

405
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:37,000
like Valium or adavan. It's usually a one to 10. Look at alcohol. That's really my point I wanted

406
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,760
to make. Look at the therapeutics index of alcohol. Three drinks shouldn't kill anybody.

407
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,600
30 would kill anybody. Right, exactly. They say that for the therapeutic index for cannabis,

408
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:56,200
so one to 20 is over the counter, one to 10 is like adavan or Valium. It's one to 20,000 to one

409
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,040
to 40,000 is a therapeutic index. The greater that second number, the bigger the safety profile.

410
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,120
We call it a therapeutic window. I call that a therapeutic garage door.

411
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,360
Right. There are certain drugs that are simply just narrow therapeutic index drugs and need to

412
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,560
be very, very cautiously prescribed. I should point out for anyone who's listening that there

413
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:24,600
really isn't a therapeutic reason to dose alcohol as far as I know, unless you're rubbing it on an

414
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,160
insect bite or something like that. Alcohol is not really recommended for curing any particular

415
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,440
disease. I want to just kind of go back to something that I forgot to ask you earlier

416
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,680
because I got distracted in my thinking about the next thing I was interested in.

417
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,760
Why do you think during the Prohibition era alcohol was brought back into favor and marijuana

418
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,480
was not? Because I think it would be very difficult to make the case that alcohol is less toxic

419
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,200
than many things. I mean, alcohol is about as toxic as it comes, and yet it is completely

420
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,240
accepted societally. Why do you think it was... I mean, this is again just speculating on...

421
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:12,200
My sense of it was it's the sociology at the time. We live in very difficult times, and certainly

422
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:20,280
they were very difficult at those times. And it seemed that people really need to have a release

423
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:29,400
from the tensions of the day. The idea of creating the prohibition of alcohol was pretty quickly

424
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,680
recognized as not successful. That is, it simply drove it underground. People continued to imbibe it.

425
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,160
What happened was there was no control. There was no tax stamps. There was no health inspections that

426
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:50,120
went along with it. And the people who were utilizing it were demonized even more than

427
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:56,120
they were before. So it was sort of a contraindication for the society, although it certainly

428
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,760
came out of people in their heart thinking they could make their fellow man better by not having

429
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:13,000
them be allowed to drink. Then cannabis was not brought back. I think at the time it was societally,

430
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,200
it was a bridge too far for people to be able to reach. And it was apparently not a plant or an

431
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:28,360
intoxicant that was used by, frankly, the people who were in control of writing the rules and the

432
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:35,160
laws. But the legislators felt pretty comfortable drinking, and they didn't think they knew anyone

433
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,920
who smoked marijuana. A lot of people talk about the idea that marijuana is a gateway drug.

434
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,920
What is the state of the evidence of that argument? In other words, what are the pros and cons of that

435
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,400
argument to the best of our understanding? So it's an interesting question. I always say that

436
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:57,720
cannabis is a gateway more towards health than to other drugs. And in fact, NIDA, the National

437
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,640
Institute of Drug Abuse, on their website has agreed with that statement and no longer considers

438
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:10,360
cannabis as a gateway drug. But I think what people are looking at or concerned about is

439
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:19,800
young people participating in the intoxicating effects of cannabis or alcohol or high fat and

440
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:26,760
sugar foods, just like anything else, can be leading to other addictive behaviors. But there

441
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,160
really isn't anything that proves that cannabis is a gateway drug. We sort of have natural

442
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,280
experiments that have gone on with the legalization in the states that were at the forefront of this.

443
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,760
Are there data that we could take from, I guess, Colorado would be first, Washington State would

444
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:51,720
be second. Are there data we can take from those states that could point to either a rise or fall

445
00:46:52,360 --> 00:47:00,920
in the utilization of drugs beyond marijuana that have either gone up or down since the legalization?

446
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,040
It depends on how you're spinning this question. If you're saying to this question that as a gateway

447
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:14,360
drug, Colorado has shown proof positive that there is not an enhanced utilization, at least of cannabis

448
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,640
from the black market in young people who shouldn't be taking it unless it was for

449
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:27,240
medicinal purposes only. If you're referring to the opioid epidemic, for sure, you know,

450
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:34,280
Bachhuber has looked at states with medical legal programs with patients that have access to

451
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:41,000
dispensaries. There has been a statistically significant reduction in opioid prescriptions

452
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,360
in patients for those for people who have access. Do you think there's an association? I mean,

453
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,800
again, I don't know this literature, so I'm not asking a loaded question. I'm, but I sort of know

454
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,480
these arguments, right, which is nobody takes heroin without first taking marijuana is the

455
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,160
argument. Therefore, heroin, the precursor to utilization of that is taking marijuana,

456
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,400
which of course is a silly argument, even if it were true. I don't know that that's entirely true,

457
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,400
but it's a silly argument because you don't know what the denominator is on the other side of that

458
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,040
equation. How many people would take marijuana and not go on to use cocaine or opiates or other things

459
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:23,640
like that? So A is correlated with B does not mean A causes B and A precedes B does not mean A causes

460
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:30,360
B either. Is there any argument though that one would make from a cautionary perspective about

461
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,800
certain individuals who are predisposed to addiction, who, if in the presence of marijuana,

462
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:45,400
are more likely to take on harmful addictions? I'm not sure that either Deb or I are that well

463
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,840
qualified in figuring out who could potentially have addictive behavior, nor have I really seen

464
00:48:52,840 --> 00:49:02,040
any studies that are able to talk to this. My sense of it though is having grown up here in

465
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,880
America for quite some time with children myself and even growing up here in lovely New York City,

466
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:16,840
is that as people move through their teenage years, they experiment with lots and lots of things,

467
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:23,080
lots of behaviors that are important, interesting, and sometimes risky behaviors.

468
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:31,320
Marijuana is generally more available than any of these other perhaps hardcore drugs,

469
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:38,600
so it may appear that people are starting with marijuana, but frankly you can get cigarettes

470
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:46,200
on every street corner, so therefore I think we should blame cigarettes more for beginning this

471
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:54,120
inappropriate behavior that is sometimes addictive. I don't think that marijuana itself,

472
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:02,280
cannabis in any way, causes or leads people on into, let's call it more hardcore drug addiction,

473
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,440
and I just have not seen data to be able to prove it or disprove it one way or the other.

474
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:15,960
How addictive is THC? Like using formal definitions of rats pressing levers and things like that,

475
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,280
compared to things where the addictive potential seems to be very high, cocaine, opiates seem to

476
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,080
have a very high addictive potential, LSD seems to be the exact opposite, right? They'll never

477
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,120
push that lever again. Where does THC fit on that spectrum? On the low end of the spectrum,

478
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:36,280
for sure. It's below alcohol, I believe. It's below alcohol. Tobacco is probably one of the higher

479
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:42,520
percentages than heroin, believe it or not, below tobacco, and I think they say the studies are 9%.

480
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,880
Remember, these are recreational markets or using animals at high doses, lever pressing,

481
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:56,040
so it doesn't really reflect real world behaviors. To take that a little bit further,

482
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:05,080
there are medical centers right now that are running clinical trials utilizing CBD and sometimes

483
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:13,000
CBD with THC as dosage forms to move people off of other addicted substances.

484
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:21,400
That's to move people off of methadone, to move people off of heroin, so it may very well be that

485
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:29,080
THC and CBD are truly an exit drug, not an entry drug. What do we know about the effect of THC on

486
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:35,480
a developing brain versus a more developed brain? The three of us sitting here presumably have done

487
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,960
most of our brain development, but the 15-year-old is still probably in the throes of developing.

488
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,600
What do we know about differences under those circumstances?

489
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,200
What I say to patients and other physicians is that I don't think we're advocating using any kind

490
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,000
of chemical substance on a developing brain unless they need it.

491
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:03,080
But do we have actual data? I did try to look into this about a year ago, maybe two years ago,

492
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,600
at the request of a patient. What I found difficult at the time, and I'm hoping maybe you have better

493
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,840
data, is that we just didn't have great studies because everything was confounded by recreational

494
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:23,880
use without control. Even though at first principles, it seems illogical that a 15-year-old

495
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,560
is going to benefit from using marijuana, it wasn't really clear from the data what the case was.

496
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:37,320
Two years later with legalization in some states or decriminalization, can we say any more than that?

497
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,760
Not really. Unfortunately, there haven't been the robust double-blind randomized trials in people,

498
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,800
but when you talk about the 15-year-old and should cannabis be used, again, people think of cannabis

499
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,360
as inhalation. Let's take that off the table for a second. Let's think about it as a medicine.

500
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:02,120
This 15-year-old has a seizure disorder and there are constituents in this plant that can help with

501
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:09,720
that. That makes sense to use. If this 15-year-old has attention deficit or anxiety or depression

502
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,800
and other medicines are not working or maybe the risks of those other medicines are a lot greater,

503
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,840
I think these are reasonable tools in our medical toolbox that can be used.

504
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:28,920
People think about just THC as a very high intoxicating chemical. It doesn't have to be.

505
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,160
You have to have the receptor, you have to have the drug that sits on that receptor,

506
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,760
and you have to have enough of that drug to sit on those receptors to get that intoxicating effect.

507
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,440
Let's go back to something we talked about a little while ago, which is the different modes

508
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:49,480
or routes of administration. We talked about the spicoli route. I guess the advantage of that

509
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,440
route is it's relatively quickly. The active ingredients become engaged with the receptors,

510
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,720
both peripherally and within the CNS in a very short period of time. I'm guessing one of the

511
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:07,000
drawbacks of that route of administration is dose-to-dose consistency and presumably you're

512
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,720
inhaling other things that might not be too good for your lungs. Is there data on that?

513
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:18,920
You're correct. Your bioavailability in an inhalational method is fast and furious. You miss

514
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,720
the whole GI tract, which is great. If you're somebody with MS and has muscle spasm that's

515
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,800
acute, inhalation method could be a godsend for them, for sure. You're right that the length or

516
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:36,360
duration of action is a lot shorter than other methods of administration. If you're somebody with

517
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,800
a chronic pain issue, that's probably not your method of administration that you want to employ.

518
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,360
Yes, you get products of combustion. If you're smoking plant material, you have a whole bunch

519
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,320
of other things, no differently than tobacco, that can cause some issues. There have been no

520
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:56,680
studies. In fact, Dr. Tashkin has shown that there has not been an association between

521
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,640
lung cancer and smoking cannabis flowers. Yeah. Why do you think that is, by the way?

522
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm sort of surprised by that. Me too.

523
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,920
Do you think it's a dose effect or?

524
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,680
Or maybe it's the anti-inflammatory effects of the cannabinoids themselves that sort of are

525
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,080
kind of pre-treating it. I don't know. I'm not smart enough to know that. That was one study.

526
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,920
Maybe we need to look at other studies. I can't answer that. What I can say though is we do know

527
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:28,360
that heat does cause cellular change. So for that reason, I'm always concerned about it. And for my

528
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,400
patients that I treat, I don't recommend inhalational method at all.

529
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,600
Any inhalational method.

530
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,280
Only because I don't understand how to help them titrate because inhalation is different. A small

531
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,560
inhalation gives you one dose. A deeper inhalation gives you a different dose. Your inhalation is

532
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,680
different than somebody else's. Thinking about this as an anesthesiologist from a clinical

533
00:55:52,680 --> 00:56:00,360
perspective, outside of anesthesia where we're totally controlled, we don't like to give drugs

534
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:06,920
or we don't know the dose. I think patients who are really sick want their hands held in a way

535
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:13,400
that they can wrap their head around it as much as I can. So if I say use X, Y, and Z and they

536
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,480
come back to me and say it works, then we understand what they should take. If I say take X, Y, and Z

537
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,440
and maybe it doesn't work or it only does part way, then we have an understanding as to how to go,

538
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,280
how to pivot from that point. Inhalation doesn't allow me to do that.

539
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,040
Is there anything else, Steve, from a chemical perspective? So when I think of inhalation,

540
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:41,480
I guess I think of two vehicles. I think of the sort of bong joint method where the temperature

541
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:48,360
is literally from the flame burning the material, combusting it, that then gets inhaled. And then

542
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,320
you think of sort of the vaping method where, well, tell us how vaping works actually.

543
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:03,000
Vaping works at a lower temperature than the pyrolysis that goes on when you use a bong and

544
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,000
some people even take it a little bit further and heat up a substance using an acetylene torch

545
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,800
on a nail and then inhaling it. That's really hot. The vaping goes on at a much lower temperature

546
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:24,520
and there are other dosage forms that are going to come out soon that are simply inhalers like

547
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:32,440
Bronco inhalers where there won't be any temperature gradient at all and the product will be brought

548
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:39,480
into the lungs through an inert carrier gas. So that will allow a much more controlled dose.

549
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,560
Those just aren't really on the market very effectively yet.

550
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:50,280
There's been a lot of talk about vaping lately and this is both from the lens of the use of THC

551
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,120
and nicotine itself totally separately. What do you guys know about this as it pertains to safety?

552
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,640
Let's start with that. That's an interesting question. I don't think anyone really can put

553
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,920
a finger on a specific reason for this problem that these vape partures are causing.

554
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,840
Tell people what the problems are that we're seeing. So it looks like an acute respiratory

555
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:17,240
distress syndrome. So almost looks like a chemical burn to a lung where people have a respiratory

556
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:24,200
failure that requires a huge amount of support in the intensive care unit including intubation

557
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,240
and ventilation and other support measures. So it's pretty severe and pretty significant.

558
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:37,160
When you extract cannabis, it comes out as a thick goopy oil and you need to refine that oil

559
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,880
in order to put it into cartridges. And those methods of getting the right viscosity for that

560
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:50,840
oil to be put in that cartridge is done in a whole host of different ways. And I don't think it was

561
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:56,440
done intentionally to hurt people. I think people thought, oh, let's thin this oil out using PG or

562
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:03,560
PEG because it's a grass ingredient generally guarded is safe. But it's generally regarded

563
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:08,440
as safe if you eat it and no one really understood what happens when you combust it. For those two

564
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:15,880
things, I think it's formaldehyde gets created when you combust or heat up PG or PEG. Other

565
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:21,720
people are using, we're using vitamin E acetate. Again, generally regarded is safe if you ingest

566
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:29,480
it, not if you heat it up to a vapor or steam. Does the FDA not require a reanalysis? So if the

567
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:38,040
FDA says substance A has a grass designation and substance A has historically been consumed at room

568
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,760
temperature and subject to a first pass effect in the liver, can anybody come along and say, I'm

569
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:49,240
going to burn said substance and it still maintains its grass designation? How does the FDA think about

570
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:56,840
that? The FDA allows something to be grass generally recognized as safe for particular uses,

571
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:02,760
either as direct food ingredients, indirect food ingredients, part of packaging. But once the

572
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:09,720
product is out there in the marketplace and available to use, it's America. People will do

573
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:17,560
whatever they wish with it. And that brings us to part of the issue here is that this is,

574
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:25,320
while this is a regulated environment within the states, there are many actors, many producers who

575
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:33,560
are not yet regulated. It's kind of like alcohol was legalized. And then there was still bathtub

576
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:42,920
gin being made for many, many years. There were hundreds, thousands of deaths from it on this

577
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,600
vaping issue. In particular, I had some experiences at the New York medical examiners some years ago

578
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:55,720
on a syndrome that came to be called SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, where we had to look

579
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:03,080
at the lungs of a number of infants that had died in this way. And so something similar is happening

580
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:12,280
here. We're in the midst of a quiet, slow moving epidemic where there are now thousands of people

581
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:19,720
in hospital. I think we have over 34 deaths directly attributed to it. And week by week,

582
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:28,280
the toll continues to mount. It's just not been brought out all that widely. It does look like

583
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:35,720
these are chemical burns within the lungs, but then the lungs seem to be not regenerating

584
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:41,240
themselves, but the wounds are getting worse. So does it behave like ARDS?

585
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,360
That's what it sounds like. It's a lot of cellular recruitment and then oxygenation

586
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,480
doesn't occur, but they're not a hundred percent sure.

587
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,000
Are they getting edema as well?

588
01:01:51,560 --> 01:02:00,680
There's so far been a good deal of a lid kept on a lot of the discussion as both CDC as well as

589
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:09,160
other health organizations are trying to find epidemiologic locuses where events have occurred.

590
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,880
In a couple of cases, they've been able to identify that there were individuals who made

591
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,880
some vape cartridges where there is a higher proportion of people who have been hurt

592
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:28,360
from other vape cartridges, but there is just no clear cut etiology so far.

593
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:35,960
So if I'm understanding you correctly, we have no idea if the uptick in these acute toxicities

594
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:43,880
is potentially manufacturing related, loci related, diffuse. We don't know any of those things yet.

595
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:50,280
That's exactly correct. From having worked in this industry for a long time, I'm very familiar with

596
01:02:50,280 --> 01:03:00,520
every time a new product, even if it's something as innocuous as a lipstick is changed, there is a

597
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:07,320
slight uptick in adverse events, even from just changing the coloration in a lipstick or an eye

598
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:15,240
shadow because there are millions of uses of it. You're able to see what happens in products like

599
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:22,760
that that are where people are using them external to their body is it's a slight irritation.

600
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,400
And the person simply decides, I won't use that eye shadow anymore or that lipstick anymore.

601
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:35,720
And they self-select out of the population. Here, this is a sudden onset of a serious nature,

602
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,960
but even with all of these numbers of, well, a terrible amount, more than 30 deaths and

603
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:50,040
hundreds, thousands in hospital, this is against millions and millions of uses. And it just doesn't

604
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:55,800
seem to be a clear cut cause that we're able to find so far. You said something a moment ago,

605
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:01,080
and I want to make sure I understand it because it seems staggering to me. The FDA, if you go down

606
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:06,440
to the grocery store, the corner store, and you buy a bag of, I don't know, jelly beans, and they

607
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:13,240
come in a plastic container, does the FDA have oversight into the plastic that holds the jelly

608
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:19,800
beans? Yes, yeah, they do. And the FDA says this plastic is grass. Yes, that the individual

609
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:26,600
chemicals that went into making that, they don't look at the overall plastic bag, but rather the

610
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:33,560
individual polymers or monomers or the colorants have all gone through extensive testing. Now,

611
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:40,120
let's say I'm an idiot and I decide to create a new product, which is I'm going to take the plastic,

612
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,320
I'm going to take those constitutive elements in that plastic bag that holds the jelly beans,

613
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:54,040
and I'm going to combust it for inhalational use. So, new use of previously agreed upon grass

614
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:01,080
constituents. Does the FDA say, Peter, you can't do that? Or does the FDA say, well, gee whiz,

615
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,560
each of those things were safe to be touching jelly beans, therefore you can be burning them?

616
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,280
The FDA actually would be very annoyed at you. What's the legal recourse? Oh, the legal

617
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,840
recourse was if you had turned that into a business, is they would come and shut you down.

618
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:23,880
Okay, so the FDA still has their pants on and they would still be looking out to protect people from

619
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:29,480
me doing that. Yes, absolutely. But not in the cannabis world. Why? Because it's federally

620
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:36,120
illegal and the FDA is not a participant. So, you're saying that the fact that cannabis is still

621
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:43,240
illegal federally means this entire discussion is moot and it would be at the state's discretion

622
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:51,240
to police this type of use switching? Exactly. That's exactly correct. And that is part of the

623
01:05:51,240 --> 01:06:00,360
difficulty right now is that state agencies are not used to having the scientific horsepower

624
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:09,080
or the manpower or woman power is much better to be able to figure out what of these ingredients

625
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:19,080
can or cannot be added to it. And on top of that, the producers of the products are not required to

626
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:26,440
test them for safety or efficacy before they start shipping the products, which is very different

627
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:34,440
than products sold under FDA auspices where you have to demonstrate at least safety for foods,

628
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,480
products, and for drugs. You also have to prove efficacy before you can make it and ship it.

629
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:46,840
Prior to the explosion of these acute events of toxicity, I was much more

630
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,800
personally curious about chronic toxicity. Let's take tobacco as an example. Very few people have

631
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:00,360
acute toxicity to tobacco use, but by the middle of the 1960s, it was abundantly clear what the

632
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:07,640
chronic toxicity was from tobacco use. Alcohol is an interesting one. Alcohol has lots of acute

633
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,200
toxicity. You could kill yourself in a moment with alcohol. That's a very easy thing to do.

634
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,480
But I don't know if your friend who died of cirrhosis had complications of alcohol use or

635
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,440
whether it was hepatitis, but certainly the chronic toxicity of alcohol in this country

636
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:28,840
is the longest, fattest, widest tail we see along with tobacco, perhaps. Maybe fatter, actually.

637
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,000
What do we think is the chronic toxicity or do we believe that there's any evidence of or against

638
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,240
chronic toxicity from vaping? Things that we just haven't, it hasn't been around long enough and we

639
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,560
don't know, but you're sort of playing with fire, that logic. I mean, that's a feeling because it

640
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:55,880
really hasn't been available as widespread as it is now. Remember, 2014, 2013 was when really other

641
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,280
states started really coming on board. I mean, California was the first in 2009. There was

642
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:07,800
nobody vaping then. People were using cannabis as a flour to smoke. People were using it in food

643
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:13,640
stuffs to eat, but nobody was using this vaping thing. I don't think it was until the popularity

644
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,560
of the vaping through the e-cigarette market when the cannabis market turned and went,

645
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,920
hmm, this is an interesting business, an interesting mode of administration,

646
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:29,080
no products of combustion. People feel a lot better about it and I think people honestly and

647
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:34,920
truly thought it was a better mousetrap. Do you know what the people who favor that approach will

648
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,960
argue in their defense? There's a couple of arguments. One is it's better than smoking

649
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,320
and getting products of combustion. Two, it's helping me get off nicotine, so I'm vaping instead.

650
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:53,880
So that's better. And three, people who have an acute pain issue or a muscle spasm feel like the

651
01:08:53,880 --> 01:09:01,880
instantaneous nature of the effects of this is what they require. I think that manufacturers

652
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,360
of cannabinoid medicine are looking to do things with the cannabinoids. I know we are and I don't

653
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:13,480
want to push our product, but we are looking at changing the solubility from a fat soluble to the

654
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:19,320
water soluble method of administration makes the bioavailability a heck of a lot faster. It's just

655
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:24,840
not available across the country because we have a state license in Michigan and we can't sell it

656
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:29,240
across state lines. Yeah, I want to come back to talk a lot about your product because when you

657
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,720
said that a moment ago that I couldn't understand how you were talking about water solubility of

658
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,960
this. So let's between the three of us remember to park that and come back to that because I could

659
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:44,840
use the chemistry lesson. Going back to the toxicity point, we talked briefly about edibles

660
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:51,480
earlier. We sort of indirectly did. You said that if Spicoli ate that flower, he might have got a

661
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:57,000
belly upset, but he wouldn't have got high. Why is it that when people consume edibles, they get high?

662
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,960
Because it's a different constituent. They're not using the raw plant. They're heating those

663
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,720
chemicals. So when people are making brownies, yes, the batter's yummy, but they generally bake it at a

664
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:14,600
certain temperature for a certain amount of time. And there are actual curves that show when THC in

665
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:21,400
its acid form, in its raw form, gets converted to or some people call it activated form into THC.

666
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,160
So it takes time and it takes temperature before you make that conversion. And at that point when

667
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:32,920
you eat it, that's when those chemicals can sit on the receptors that make you feel high or

668
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:39,160
intoxicated. So again, it's very unlikely you'll make two batches of brownies identically because

669
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:44,440
time, the area under the curve is almost always going to be different. So everybody gets a different

670
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,880
brownie. Now, when you get the candies or things like that, is it the extraction of the THC required

671
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,600
heating to get the active ingredient into these commercial edible products? So it depends on what

672
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:59,080
you're making. I mean, there are medicinal chocolates and candies and stuff, but there are medicinal

673
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:05,000
properties in the raw form as well as the heated form. So if you're making it for the direct

674
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,640
purpose of intoxication, you're going to heat it, the starting material first, the active ingredient

675
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,440
first, the THC, and then you're going to put it into your chocolate. So this might be a bad analogy,

676
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:22,760
but you know how anytime you make coffee, you're basically running hot water across a bean,

677
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:29,080
but if you're a real coffee snob, you'll do a cold brew so that you can extract the flavor

678
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,040
without the temperature and you avoid the bitterness. It seems to me that whether you're

679
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:39,240
talking about smoking a joint, lighting a bong, vaping, or eating a candy or chocolate or a

680
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:46,200
brownie, heat always seems to be required if you're going to get this active ingredient out.

681
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:51,400
Is that the case? If you're trying to get THC- For intoxication. Right, for intoxication. So the

682
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:58,040
answer is yes. You have to apply time and temperature in order to make THC, and then

683
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:05,240
you put that THC as your starter ingredient into whatever it is. And the variables for the edibles

684
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:14,840
is not just the preparation of the food, but that our digestive process varies hour to hour,

685
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:22,680
person to person, as well as our body mass and how we feel about things and what the time of

686
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:30,360
day is and the circadian rhythm. So it's almost impossible to expect out of eating any food that

687
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:38,200
contains THC or CBD to expect that you will get a reliable, repeatable dosage experience from that,

688
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,760
even if the label is completely correct and completely accurate. And that's a big if.

689
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,920
It's huge. Yes, it is. The legitimate laboratories in cannabis have gotten better and better and

690
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:59,480
better all the time, but still when you make a batch of a thousand brownies and you just sample

691
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,840
one or two of them, there's an awfully good chance that the batter may not have been mixed

692
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:12,840
appropriately. Pharmaceuticals solve that because of the consistency by which we make things in a

693
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:20,520
pharmaceutical way, but foods are not quite that precise. And you can buy a brownie at a store one

694
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:26,120
day and then buy a homemade brownie the next day and it can taste very different. How many strains

695
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,080
are there of cannabis that are commonly used? From what I've heard, there's over 800, but people

696
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,600
are crossing and backcrossing all the time. But back to the edibles thing that I think is even

697
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,000
more important is that when you eat something and it goes through your stomach and it goes to the

698
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,960
liver and gets cleared, it gets chemically converted. And so therefore you're really not

699
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:52,600
even ingesting THC anymore. You're ingesting its metabolite and that metabolite is even more

700
01:13:52,600 --> 01:14:00,680
intoxicating than THC itself. So there are people who are experienced in inhalational methods of THC

701
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:08,520
that do it all the time that say they can't even eat a THC brownie or a gummy bear or drinking a

702
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:14,920
soda with it in because it's far more intoxicating. Do you think there are any, a Priet might be the

703
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:20,280
wrong word, but just call it, what are the best use cases for edibles? I think the best case use

704
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:24,200
edibles are for somebody with a chronic pain. So let's take example, somebody with a chronic pain

705
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,520
that can't sleep at night. Let's take an extreme case, somebody with cancer that's spread to their

706
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:33,320
bones. Right. And they literally can't sleep. So what I would do with a patient is I would trial

707
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:38,360
them on a certain edible or something that I believe is consistent. It wouldn't be held within

708
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:44,280
a food stuff. It would most likely be in a capsule or a tablet because it makes sense. Again, remember

709
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:49,160
we talked about wanting to understand the dose and wanting to understand what it is. We would dose

710
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:54,040
it in a way that it would be the same time every night for this patient. And we would see how they

711
01:14:54,040 --> 01:15:00,280
would sleep. The bioavailability takes about 60 to 90 minutes in the best case scenario. You only

712
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:06,680
get about 8% of whatever it is that you're taking, but it can last up to eight to 10 hours. We haven't

713
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:12,440
talked about tachyflaxis or tolerance. How does the body respond to repeated administration of THC?

714
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:18,360
That's really interesting. THC sits on these docking stations known as receptors, and there

715
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:26,040
are chances of over-consuming THC and down-rate regulating these receptors that actually can be

716
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:31,800
reset very quickly by just stopping for a couple of days. But there's an interesting study out of

717
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:38,200
the Netherlands since they've had a medical program for a very long time, I think since 2012 or

718
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:47,240
something or 10, where they looked at patients, the average patient only takes 750 milligrams of

719
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,880
cannabis a day. And you would imagine if there was so much tachyflaxis, you would have seen an

720
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:57,000
increase or a rise in that, and you didn't. It seemed like they stabilized at 750 milligrams,

721
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,280
and that was it, which is contrary to what I just said. So explain the opposite. Talk about

722
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,400
opiates. You've obviously, as an anesthesiologist, had lots of experience with them. What typically

723
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:12,360
happens to a patient who has prescribed opiates for pain? That's the problem with opiates. Opiates sit

724
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:19,000
on their own docking station, and they do down-regulate very quickly, which means that you require more

725
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,240
and more for the same effect, and then it does something really strange. It flips. And after a

726
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:34,040
certain amount of opiates, your pain gets enhanced, not decreased. And it's called hyperalgesia. It's

727
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,520
a strange phenomenon. And you said 20% to 30% of people experience that? Actually, 20% to 30% of

728
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:44,680
people experience that from the beginning, where they experience an opposite reaction to pain

729
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:48,840
relief. But I'm saying people who traditionally get pain relief, who require more and more and

730
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:55,080
more for the same amount of pain relief, suddenly they are experiencing a hyperalgesia, an increase

731
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:00,600
in pain. Whereas before, a month ago, two months ago, they were actually getting pain relief.

732
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,840
Nobody talks about that. So we don't think that this is necessarily happening

733
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,760
with THC and the CB1 or CB2 receptor. No, we're not saying that yet, as of now.

734
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:21,320
Let's talk a little bit about how THC mixes with other drugs. What happens when THC is combined

735
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,520
with alcohol, for example? Alcohol is a known depressant of the central nervous system.

736
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,880
I still don't really understand what THC is doing in the CNS. I'm still confused by

737
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,440
the intoxicating versus non-intoxicating effects. I know that I can tell what you're thinking,

738
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,960
which is, Peter, that's the point. It's a plant, it's complex, it's doing many things.

739
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,640
But it's multimodal, actually. So a little bit of THC won't cause any intoxication. You need the

740
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:50,520
receptor, you need the drug, and you need enough drugs sitting on all those receptors in order to

741
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,760
express those things. And I joke with Steve and say, I like to be called the queen,

742
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:00,760
basically, but the queen of microdose, which means I like to use very small amounts of

743
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:06,120
cannabinoids to activate things on a cellular level. So you actually don't feel the intoxicating

744
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,520
effects because most patients don't want to be sidelined by their pain, and they don't want to

745
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,760
be sidelined by their pain medicine. So that's kind of off topic.

746
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:20,200
Is that the majority of your personal focus? I mean, I want to come back to, obviously,

747
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:26,520
what your company, Pure, does. That makes sense there. But what about people who actually want

748
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,400
some of the intoxicating effects because, well, let me unpack that a little bit more. I was about

749
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:36,760
to say because of things like anxiety or stress, but you could make the argument that if one has

750
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,880
their anxiety and stress reduced without intoxication, that might be just as beneficial.

751
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:47,480
Have you thought much about the particular demand, the consumer demand? What is it that people

752
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:53,400
actually want from THC? My sense of it is that they would actually like relief. That is,

753
01:18:54,120 --> 01:19:01,720
over and over again, I did an extensive survey of, in Michigan, we have over 400,000 people with

754
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:08,920
medical marijuana cards, and of people who were going into cannabis dispensaries, two-thirds of

755
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:15,720
them were really there for medical reasons, not to get stoned. They had learned over the course of

756
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:24,120
their lives that they could reduce their pain, often chronic pain from very serious accidents

757
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:32,200
or operations. They could reduce their anxiety, and they had learned that they could find strains

758
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:38,920
of marijuana, and they were using them and smoking them because it was all that they had available

759
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:45,480
to them. So these are people generally who were just looking to live happy, normal lives like

760
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:51,240
all the rest of us, and that they have found that this is a relatively inexpensive and pretty

761
01:19:51,240 --> 01:20:00,280
harmless way to manage what are otherwise very, very severe symptoms. So that if, going back to

762
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:08,600
your question about utilizing alcohol at the same time, there are some people who utilize alcohol

763
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:16,280
regularly in order to, frankly, numb the pain, even without listening to any Frank Sinatra songs

764
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,680
about the heartache and why we're all still in a bar at three o'clock in the morning.

765
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:28,200
It's for pain relief, for it's psychological and sometimes straightforward physical pain relief.

766
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:38,440
Once people discover that they can achieve that by using a small, relatively easy titration form,

767
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:46,120
people who utilize cannabis smoking or vaping are readily able to titrate themselves, which is

768
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:52,840
just remarkable to be able to do that. Certainly, I did when I was smoking cigarettes. I could

769
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:58,920
learn how to accelerate my heart rate or relax by just puffing in a different way.

770
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:06,120
I gave up that addiction myself. Interesting. I don't think I appreciated that you could have

771
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,880
that distinction from, presumably from the nicotine, depending on the speed.

772
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:17,000
By the speed at which you take on that nicotine, I could either excite myself to be able to get up

773
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:25,320
for something or you could use it to calm down and relax by just simply dosing in a different manner.

774
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,840
Do you think there are certain medical conditions that are contraindicated from the use of THC?

775
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,960
For example, I'm making this up. I have no idea. Someone with schizophrenia or someone with severe

776
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:41,880
psychiatric illness, can it be exacerbated by THC? The shorter answer is yes, but that doesn't mean

777
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:48,360
that they should not be availed to cannabinoids because again, there's over a hundred different

778
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,520
cannabinoids specific to the cannabis plant that could be and has shown to be incredibly useful.

779
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:03,480
Yes, high dose THC alone could stimulate somebody who has schizophrenia to have an exacerbation of

780
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:10,440
those things, but CBD and maybe even a low level of THC along with it could actually be hugely

781
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:17,800
beneficial. Back to your question about THC and other drugs, THC plus opiates has shown that a

782
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:24,360
reduction in opiates with a greater pain relieving efficacy without that tacky full access or

783
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:31,240
tolerance that we know to be true for opioid use. How much time do you still spend in a hospital

784
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,640
setting or an inpatient setting? Do you have any, you spend any time there? Zero anymore. Do you

785
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:43,400
have any sense of how long it will be before THC and or CBD make their way into the, for example,

786
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:49,080
post-op surgical patient world? Dronabinol, which is a synthetic THC, has been on the market since

787
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:55,640
the 1980s and we as doctors are allowed to write prescriptions for it across the country and patients

788
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:02,440
can travel with it. That's available now and it's being used for chemotherapy induced nausea and

789
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:08,280
vomiting in some settings, not very well because straight up THC is really uncomfortable. It does

790
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:13,560
increase your heart rate, does make your mouth dry, does make you feel agitated and uncomfortable.

791
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:18,040
I mean, the rest of the constituents within the plant sort of modulate all of that. I'm glad you

792
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,640
brought this up because I was going to ask you about the synthetics. The synthetics have a pretty

793
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:27,960
bad rap. There's sort of the teleologic argument of nature always packs the right amount of this

794
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:33,960
antidote versus that antidote. I mean, what is your take on synthetics through that lens in particular?

795
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:39,800
That's a complicated answer. I mean, I think what I'm really wanting to focus more about is a single

796
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:45,800
molecule as opposed to looking at many of the molecules within the cannabis plant and try to

797
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:54,840
find utilization. So a single molecule like CBD from Epidiolex from GW Pharma came from a plant,

798
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:03,320
but it is isolated and purified to 99.99% and it requires a tremendous amount to get the effect

799
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:11,240
that GW Pharma wanted to get on to types of seizures. We formulate using isolated cannabinoids,

800
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:16,280
but we join them together along with other constituents so that we use less and we capitalize

801
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,240
on the synergistic effects of a lot of the molecules. No differently than what we do in

802
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:26,600
medicine as an anesthesiologist, we just don't push one medication. We push a lot of different

803
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:33,000
medications to lower the bad effects of one particular medicine and capitalize on the good

804
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,320
effects of all of them. Say more about the GW CBD for epilepsy. What is the purity of it? You said

805
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:45,000
it's 99. It's pretty high. It's greater than 90%. Tell me about the success and utilization of that.

806
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,680
So it's plant-derived, but it's isolated, so it's purified and they have it for two particular

807
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:57,320
types of seizures. Those kids with these rare seizure forms that are refractory to multiple

808
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:05,320
other traditional pharmaceuticals, I think they have like a 30% reduction in their seizures,

809
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:09,640
but there's side effects. I mean, there's GI effects, there's liver issues. I mean,

810
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:16,520
there's side effects in high, high doses of epidiolex. What do you think is the potential

811
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,800
for CBD and sleep? Something that gets talked about a lot. What is your take on the efficacy

812
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:27,400
of CBD oils? Let's start with the oils, which are very commercially abundant. Well, let me first

813
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:33,480
mention my bias. I took it this morning at one o'clock in the morning because as usual, I'm up

814
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,120
for an hour trying to do something and it's a little noisy in this city and I need you to go

815
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:48,600
back to sleep. So it is in our hands and in our experience, it works. It simply works. That is,

816
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:57,560
people are able to take CBD. We think that taking it as an oil is less effective than taking it in

817
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:06,520
a water-soluble form, but it is certainly effective. We have pharmacovigilance data on

818
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:13,880
several hundred thousand people that demonstrates that they generally go to sleep pretty quickly,

819
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:21,320
have a great night's sleep, and wake up refreshed with no feeling of what other sleep aids give,

820
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:27,800
of grogginess or anything like that. Most people think it is just fabulous.

821
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,400
Do you have any insight into what the mechanism of action is?

822
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:38,600
So remember, multimodal mechanisms of action. So anti-inflammatory, it also activates the GABA

823
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,960
receptor, decreases anxiety, and a lot of people have that three-year-old running around in their

824
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:49,480
head at night and prevents them from going to sleep. So we think it is central activation of

825
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:55,480
GABA that would be one of the more potent mediated. There is a molecule out there called

826
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:01,560
phenibut, which is an oral form of GABA that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Now, the FDA

827
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:08,280
has not designated it grass, so therefore it is no longer available easily. But for something that

828
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:15,000
was for so long over the counter, it was kind of a remarkable sleep aid. So one should not underestimate

829
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:23,000
the potency of CNS GABA activation. Is there any sort of polysom data that talks about staging of

830
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,320
sleep with CBD? In other words, it is one thing to say, great, a person can sleep for this many hours,

831
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:34,360
uninterrupted, but do we have any sense of the impact of CBD on sleep architecture?

832
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:40,280
I have not seen any data like that, and your questions are remarkably and remarkably

833
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:48,520
perceptive. You have to realize that at this current time, because of the still illegality of THC

834
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:58,360
and the confused legality about all of the others, that pretty much every university, especially

835
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:05,960
medical universities, do not allow research to be done on the facility unless someone has a DEA

836
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:14,200
license. And even then, getting the DEA license is a long drawn out process, so that very little

837
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:19,640
work is able to be done. And there are thousands of medical researchers who would love to work on

838
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:25,320
these problems, but they can't, just like they haven't been able to for 50 years. But is CBD

839
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:33,240
not permitted for research if the THC level is low enough? That's only come about in the last few

840
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:41,800
months. So it certainly takes a lot longer for research protocols to be developed, to move through

841
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:50,520
NIH, to move through whatever funding opportunity there is. And I expect that in the next year or

842
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:57,560
two or three, that there'll be much more research done on that. It's still a highly restricted,

843
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:04,680
highly restrained, and frankly, the university administration in almost all of these schools

844
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:11,960
and universities are very, very worried about jeopardizing their federal funding for billions

845
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:16,600
of dollars of other projects. In other words, it's not that there's a dearth of funding. If

846
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:21,960
a philanthropist came along and said to somebody at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, hey,

847
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:29,480
here's $5 million. I want you to study the effect of CBD on sleep duration and architecture.

848
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:33,560
The university would say, well, thank you for that, but I don't want to jeopardize the billion

849
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,240
dollars of NIH funding I have. Am I understanding you correctly?

850
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:42,120
Yeah, well, I wouldn't pick on U of M because my wife works in pathology there. But it's a great

851
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:49,400
school, terrific school, football's coming back, folks, that any university in these stages will

852
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:57,080
move much more carefully to consider what the research is and who is the researcher,

853
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:05,080
simply because of 50, 60 years of illegality. It's just so surprising to see how far behind

854
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:11,480
THC and CBD are when you have a beautiful roadmap from organizations that have been funding so much

855
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:16,360
psychedelic research. I mean, when you look at MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic

856
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:22,920
Studies started by Rick Doblin. I mean, he started this organization in 1986. 33 years later,

857
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:29,400
they are now in phase three studies using MDMA, which is, as you know, obviously, schedule one.

858
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:37,400
I'm kind of amazed. Is there not a comparable group that is advocating for the judicious study

859
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:45,720
of THC and CBD? We are. We run clinical trials regularly. Dr. Kimless here is running clinical

860
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:51,560
trials right now, and there are others, but they're from, let's call it private sources.

861
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:57,080
Is that the business model of your company? Is that you have a product that you sell and the

862
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:02,840
proceeds of that help fund the research? Yeah, that's pretty much it. We came up with

863
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:11,640
formulations that we felt would work, and then we ran pilot clinical trials to see how they would do

864
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:18,920
in a small patient population. And once we saw that that was getting a very good response among

865
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:25,720
people, then we were able to distribute the products within the state because we were state licensed to

866
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:32,040
be able to do that. And now we are taking the funds from essentially from that cash flow and

867
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:38,680
scaling up to be able to do studies under FDA offices, auspices, which are frankly much more

868
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:43,960
expensive to do because of all the controls that go along with it. Talk to me now about this idea

869
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:50,520
that we alluded to twice already, which is the water solubilization of something that I didn't

870
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:55,640
assume could be water-solubilized. We have a number of patents on it, and a number of them

871
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:02,040
are moving through, so you'll have to forgive me for sort of speaking generically about that. We

872
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:08,920
have one issued patent out of the seven that we filed for, and that was to figure out, we figured

873
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:15,800
out how to freeze dry cannabis, and that's an industrial process, and it helps. So that's an

874
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:23,640
awarded patent, and anyone can look that one up. THC and CBD and all of the molecules that are in

875
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:34,520
cannabis that appear to be useful and viable are all oil soluble. They are not water-soluble.

876
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:39,000
So if you put them in a glass of water and stir it, you'll have little oil globules on it.

877
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:48,440
So we figured out how to be able to convert that instantly into a water-soluble molecule

878
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:57,000
so that when a person puts a drop of this or a powder of this on their tongue,

879
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:04,760
it doesn't taste oily, it doesn't feel oily, and it doesn't act like an oil. And as everyone knows,

880
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:10,760
yeah, you can have some oil and vinegar maybe on your salad, but the body doesn't really like to

881
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:17,080
have a lot of oil in it on a regular basis, whereas everybody can drink pints and pints of water,

882
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:25,160
gallons of water perhaps a day. So these molecules are rendered to be water-soluble,

883
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:31,720
and because they're put into very, very fast, rapid-dissolving tablets that disintegrate in

884
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:37,000
about 15 seconds or so. Do they disintegrate under the tongue and therefore escape the

885
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,560
first pass effect of the liver? That's exactly right. Under the tongue, on top of the tongue,

886
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:46,040
mushed around the tongue. But they're not to be swallowed. They're not to be swallowed.

887
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:51,560
They're called sublingual because it's under the tongue, but what happens is as the tablet

888
01:33:51,560 --> 01:34:00,040
disintegrates literally in the mouth, the molecules move towards the tissues of the mouth, the tongue,

889
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:10,120
or throughout the oral cavity. What we see is in about a minute, the molecules have moved into

890
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:17,240
the bloodstream, and for those who are sensitive enough, they can actually feel their toes tingle

891
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:23,720
in two minutes, which teaches us that we have full systemic absorption, frankly, the molecules

892
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:31,240
have reached a person's toes. And then we find following that that people are able to experience

893
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:38,280
whatever effect, medical effect, that we are looking for in about eight to ten minutes.

894
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:43,960
So that's the onset of sleep for sleep formulations, the onset of pain relief for

895
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:52,120
pain relief for anxiety. So that has the advantage. It avoids first pass metabolism. It gets much more

896
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:58,120
of the active drug into the bloodstream and to be distributed throughout the body. So in theory,

897
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:04,040
you could actually lower the levels of drug that are necessary to do which. How potent is this?

898
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:12,040
Is this a millimolar or micromolar drug? I would say that this is closer to micromolar. That is

899
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:22,280
someone who's, we found very effectively that sleep works in someone who takes 10 milligrams

900
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:32,600
of CBD and one milligram of THC, and that's spread across a body that's maybe 70 kilograms,

901
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:38,840
80 kilograms of weight. This is really interesting to me, is that the optimal cocktail

902
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:45,720
for sleep may actually have some THC in it as opposed to just pure CBD. It's our experience

903
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:51,080
over and over again that this concept that's called the entourage effect when it's applied to

904
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:58,840
cannabis, but yet this is used throughout medicine as Deb mentioned as an anesthesiologist. She used

905
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:06,680
a cocktail of medicine. Certainly in oncology, it's very, very common to prescribe multiple

906
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:14,760
drugs at the same time or in some sequence. We found exactly the same effect and did it by

907
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:22,520
clinical trials of seeing how it would be with patients, getting feedback from them, revising

908
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:29,400
the formulations, redosing them, and seeing how those effects changed. Does your company have a

909
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:34,120
501c3 attached to it that allows people to fund research in the way that MAPS works?

910
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,960
No, it doesn't. So far, it's me. I drained my retirement account in order to do this.

911
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:44,680
As you said though, as you move towards the more and more rigorous FDA studies,

912
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:51,320
it's something you should consider. I think the public support for this type of research is

913
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,720
strong. I think the public's appetite for this is strong. If you think about it, you have a

914
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:01,560
harder problem, in my opinion, to solve than the psychedelic community does because at least there,

915
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:07,240
there's no ambiguity about the molecule. We know what psilocybin is. We know what LSD is. We know

916
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:13,160
what MDMA is. There is no purity concern. I mean, there is if you go to a club or a party or

917
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,480
something like that, but from the standpoint of doing clinical research, we know exactly what

918
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:23,240
we're talking about, whereas you're dealing with in many ways a more complicated set of molecules.

919
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:31,480
You have two issues, which is not just the straightforward safety, efficacy, effectiveness

920
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:37,160
chain of phase one, phase two, phase three. You have a problem that lies beneath the surface of

921
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:44,120
that, which is route of administration, cocktail, chemical composition, all of these other things.

922
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:49,560
I mean, I generally try not to give unsolicited advice, but my view is I don't know that you want

923
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:54,120
to go alone at this problem because I think the work you're doing is very important. I was at a

924
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:59,560
dinner the other day and somebody at the dinner table was talking about telling a story and you

925
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:04,120
hear these stories all the time. I think the person is totally well-intentioned, and I just

926
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:09,640
sort of sat there silently because I didn't really feel like debating it. The claim was a friend of

927
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:15,080
my friend's father was in hospice with stage four pancreatic cancer, had weeks to live,

928
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,760
and they put them, you know, the family snuck in CBD oil for him, and two weeks later he was home

929
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:26,840
and cured. And you know, the problem with those types of stories is not only that they're almost

930
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:34,840
assuredly incorrect, it's that they sort of damage the credibility of a body of research because

931
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:41,400
you start to have absurd claims that are thrown in with sort of legitimate claims. How do you

932
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:49,560
think about the sort of stigmatization of this and trying to manage the hype and the potential?

933
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:54,600
That's a really awfully good question. So I should point out while there's only two of us here in the

934
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:01,240
room, this is a research team with a great deal of depth and breadth. That is everyone I've worked

935
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:07,000
with in pharmaceuticals for the last 40 years have said, oh my goodness, please let me work with

936
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:14,120
you on this. And so we have that as well as a number of people who are fairly well to do,

937
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:21,320
who are looking at this as a business opportunity and an investment, which I really appreciate and

938
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:26,360
my wife is especially appreciative of so I can stop draining our own retirement account.

939
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:38,520
Many of these anecdotal experiences are true. I wouldn't have believed it myself, honestly,

940
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:49,160
except for the fact that we have now sold 600,000, 700,000 tablets to tens of thousands of patients

941
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:58,520
repetitively in Michigan and I watched, it sounds funny to say, the week in the lane get up out of

942
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:06,680
their wheelchair and move and say, I don't know how to tell you this, but what the heck is in your

943
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:12,600
tablet? And I just say, well, it's THC or it's CBD in a particular ratio with these terpenes.

944
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:26,440
And families would say, thank God, my husband is living, my mother is living, my child's anxiety

945
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:35,800
is greatly reduced. And I know to classically trained scientists and physicians that in this

946
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:45,080
society at this time, that seems damaging or inappropriate. But in other societies,

947
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:56,520
it is not that way. This is a sociologic event that is just beginning to spread. And I know among

948
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:05,240
many of my friends in police forces who are EMTs and firefighters, first line responders,

949
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:11,240
who frequently have a great deal of anxiety in their life and frequently a great deal of pain,

950
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:18,760
just straightforward physical pain aside from everything else, that their personal experience

951
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:27,160
with selected, extracted, purified cannabis has completely changed their thoughts about what they

952
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:33,960
have for generations thought was completely inappropriate behavior. Now they say, oh, jeez,

953
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:40,200
gets rid of my pain and I don't feel so bad. And they are still able to function perfectly well.

954
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:47,160
They're not stone at all, not in any way at all, partly because the drugs are relatively easy to

955
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:54,600
self titrate. I know I do a lot. No, no, no. I'm not suggesting that one can't see improvements in

956
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:59,080
those things. But I do sort of bristle against the notion that there are people with stage four cancer

957
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:04,600
that are being sold a bill of goods that says, take your metastatic pancreatic cancer and in

958
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:10,680
two weeks you're cured with this. I'm waiting to see the first documented case of that and I'll

959
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:15,480
continue to be an incredible skeptic of that sort of logic, which is not to say that a patient with

960
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:22,200
cancer wouldn't benefit immensely from relief of anxiety or pain, but yeah, I just, I very much

961
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:28,840
struggle to imagine cancer remissions. So THC and other cannabinoids have been shown

962
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:36,680
in the laboratory to have a multimodal effect on cancer. So in apoptosis, which is cell death,

963
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:45,160
in migration or metastasis, in neovascularization, it reduces it. So there are actual reasons and

964
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,360
rationale behind it. You're right. Is there a double-blind randomized trial of people? I think

965
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:56,920
a doctor would go to jail if you had somebody who could have XYZ traditional chemotherapy and,

966
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:04,200
okay, here's a cannabis concoction that we've come up with. I wouldn't have believed it myself. I can

967
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:08,360
show you pictures afterwards. We can't do it on a podcast. The story is an eight year old girl in

968
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:13,880
hospice. She was on methadone and morphine. Our goal was to just treat her to get her off it. So

969
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:20,840
she had a better quality of life before she died. And we transitioned her from hospice to second

970
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:26,440
grade to third grade. What was the underlying pathology? She had a chronic lymphocytic leukemia

971
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,520
and a leptin meningeal spread. She failed chemo radiation in a couple of bone marrow.

972
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:36,920
She sadly died this past summer. Again, this gets back to the broader point, which is I'd like to

973
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:41,960
see this studied more aggressively because my greatest fear is watching patient. I mean,

974
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:46,680
my greatest fear is safety. I think that's followed with predatory behavior. Oh, absolutely.

975
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:54,280
And I just, I can't tell you how frustrated I get when I hear stories about people who

976
01:43:54,280 --> 01:44:00,680
are spending their last dollars on cockamamie schemes that have absolutely no bearing. I mean,

977
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:06,120
and, and, you know, look, there are lots of things that kill cancer in vitro that aren't going to work

978
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:11,160
in vivo. So we just have to be cautious about it. And yet I know I've definitely remember the

979
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:16,680
pathways of even autophagy and apoptosis and all these things where, where the cannabinoids play a

980
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:21,480
role. So again, I think this all just speaks to the idea of kind of loading the boat to, to more

981
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:27,160
effectively study this. And of course, I mean, the criticism is you have a conflict, right? The

982
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:31,400
criticism is how can you be fully objective? And again, this is something that the maps people can

983
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:37,560
get away from because, you know, MDMA has no IP associated with it, right? Merck developed this

984
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:43,080
drug in the twenties. Now there's an interesting business model, which is how would you incentivize

985
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:48,840
people to study something where there is no profit center at the end? My view is you should be able to

986
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:53,640
pursue this. I mean, I want to be clear. I'm not suggesting that you guys aren't sitting here with

987
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:58,120
the purest of intentions. It comes across very clearly. And I hope the listener can tell that I,

988
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:04,520
I can tell how pure your intentions are and that creating a company is just a vehicle through which

989
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:10,360
to pursue more research. But as I think about the broader objective, which is broader than just your

990
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:16,200
company, again, I'll come back to this idea of creating a research initiative around this that

991
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:22,360
even exceeds the reach of your company. Because remember the number of questions here is harder,

992
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:27,160
right? Like I'd like to hear from you guys, what question you're most interested in knowing the

993
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:32,200
answer to in five years. It would be great that the NIH could carry some of that burden, right?

994
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,960
It would be great that independent MROs, medical research organizations could carry some of that

995
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:44,520
burden because no one's retirement account should be depleted in an effort to hold a promise true to

996
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:48,520
a friend, which is a, in some ways a part of what started this for you, what the sort of this journey

997
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:52,840
for you. It is exactly. Tell me a couple of questions. Like what do you not know the answer

998
01:45:52,840 --> 01:46:00,920
to today that you want to know the answer to with respect to THC, CBD and its associated products in

999
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:07,880
five years? What would make the world a better place? For me, I've made a vow that I will find

1000
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:15,960
a formulation that will relieve PTSD. I made a vow to do that for people who were heroin addicts

1001
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:21,400
and you know, methadone may not be the best of all formulations, but that's what I did when I was 23

1002
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:30,520
years old and I got a little better as I went along. So that is the driving force for me to be

1003
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:40,280
able to do this. And then my goal is to be able to discover as many of these disease conditions,

1004
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:48,040
psychological or physical conditions, as we can extract value from these stunningly non-toxic

1005
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:53,080
molecules. Steve, are there INDs affiliated and associated with these molecules? Like are you in

1006
01:46:53,080 --> 01:47:00,360
that phase one pipeline now? Yes, we are. We have three filed. We actually just met with FDA

1007
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:06,200
three weeks or so ago over one of them and we are pursuing that very, very actively.

1008
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:12,920
So each time you reconstitute something, it's a new IND. That's right. Okay. Explain to folks,

1009
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:17,000
because you're the expert on this, explain to folks what an IND is and how important this is

1010
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,600
in this regulatory pathway. In order to sell a drug in the United States, you have to have

1011
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:29,560
an approved new drug application that's called NDA from the Food and Drug Administration. So

1012
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:37,080
what do you do before you get that? You have to go investigate that drug. So that's what an IND

1013
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:43,000
is. It's an investigational new drug exemption from all of the rules that say you have to have

1014
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:49,320
this approved drug. So you go and meet with FDA. We provide them with the data and the documents

1015
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:54,680
that we have available and say, dear FDA, we would like to run the following clinical trial

1016
01:47:54,680 --> 01:48:01,320
and here's all our evidence and do you folks agree with us? And in the course of hashing that out,

1017
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:08,440
they will come back and say we'd like you to do a little more work in with an animal model or we'd

1018
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:14,680
like you to do some additional studies in humans in a particular way. And so we are in the process

1019
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:21,240
of doing that in three different therapeutic indications. What are those three besides PTSD?

1020
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:31,960
One of them is an animal model that is for pet dogs who have pain from osteosarcoma and the other

1021
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:40,600
osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis of the knee and then PTSD. Right. So those are pain in dogs,

1022
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:49,080
pain in people, particularly osteoarthritis pain as well as PTSD, which I think of as a combination

1023
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:56,040
of anxiety and pain. It presents in a number of ways, mild, moderate, severe, et cetera.

1024
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:00,440
Again, for the listener to make sure I understand the distinction, there are currently products you

1025
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:05,800
are legally selling in Michigan that do not require an IND. They're currently grass products.

1026
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:10,040
They're not basically pharma grade products. Is that safe to say or is that a-

1027
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:15,880
No, these are pharma grade products simply because this is the space that I live in. I

1028
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:22,760
have always thought that that was the only appropriate way to make products. It's called

1029
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:29,320
meeting good manufacturing practices. It's a couple levels higher than any of the states require

1030
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:37,320
for safety or efficacy. And so we just make products to meet FDA specifications because

1031
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:43,240
to me that's just easier. In other words, this is going to sound crass, so excuse it and you can

1032
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:48,280
clarify it, but you're like a supplement company that adheres to GMP practice.

1033
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:53,400
I don't think of us as a supplement company. Meaning you make a supplement to a GMP,

1034
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:58,120
this product, for example, like something that you can sell currently today without a prescription.

1035
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:05,880
Right. We work within the medical legal rules in Michigan, but those rules do not mandate

1036
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:10,360
GMP manufacturing. And you hold yourselves to that standard. That's the point I'm trying to make.

1037
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:15,000
Yeah, that's exactly- I'm trying to pay you a compliment. I'm making it sound backwards,

1038
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:23,240
but yes. And this is, as most everyone knows, doing an adequate amount of testing to go through

1039
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:28,760
the FDA process is very expensive and very time consuming. And let's put some numbers to that.

1040
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:33,880
And on average, it's about a decade and a billion dollars to create a new drug. Yes,

1041
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:39,880
that's exactly right. Let's say that again. You want to make a new drug from IND to approval

1042
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:44,440
is order of magnitude 10 years and $1 billion. Yeah, that's right.

1043
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:49,000
I don't think your retirement account is that big. That's correct. So anyone out there who-

1044
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:57,480
This is going to turn into a telethon. Let me ask, why have you not pursued a product yet on sleep?

1045
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:04,760
Because I, again, I think anecdotally what you've said resonates with many people, the power of CBD,

1046
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:09,720
including probably very inferior products compared to what you're capable of making

1047
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:16,280
with your IP. Is the view that you don't need to go down the IND pathway to produce that,

1048
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:20,760
or is it just a matter of resource allocation? It really is resource allocation. Truthfully,

1049
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:28,120
we have 14 indications that we are going for and you have to prioritize, as everyone does with

1050
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:35,800
everything in your life. And we looked at them and said, which ones are easier or faster or less

1051
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:42,600
expensive to test and be able to prove? Sleep studies, frankly, are very expensive and they

1052
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:50,440
are variable just in the methodology of it. Whereas it's a lot easier to be able to measure pain

1053
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:54,840
and there are scoring systems that are more reliable in that way. Tell me a little bit about

1054
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,840
what you can sell in Michigan and how does a business work that can only limit itself to one

1055
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:07,160
state? So it's quite challenging. We drove at getting a license, a first license, and we were

1056
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:14,200
successful in getting the first license in Michigan to be a processor. That is, we can take in cannabis

1057
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:21,320
that's been grown within the state and turn it into an extractive and then turn that into

1058
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:27,880
tablets. That's what the process of processing is. We could also make it into gummy bears and vape

1059
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:35,560
cartridges and we sell those also. And then we are able to ship those to just state authorized

1060
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:43,480
dispensaries. Historically, people in Michigan needed to have medical marijuana licenses in

1061
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:50,680
order to get into those stores. But now, like many states, it's called recreational or adult use.

1062
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:56,440
You only need to show that you are 21 years of age to be able to go into those stores and buy.

1063
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:07,000
So that's how we started. But now we have grown to have, we have liaisons with subsidiary

1064
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:14,200
companies or affiliated companies where we're growing about 5,500 plants, bringing it to our

1065
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:22,200
facilities, doing the extraction. And we have relationships with all of the 70, 80 dispensary

1066
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:29,160
stores throughout Michigan. That's how that business has grown and that's to a large extent

1067
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:35,720
so far what's been able to fund our research studies. But once again, this is a telethon,

1068
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,960
folks. You can call in. How large is your team?

1069
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:47,400
So we have overall about 100 employees working in various aspects of production and sales and

1070
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:56,280
administration for the company. In terms of the research team, Deb is our chief medical officer

1071
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:06,440
and then there are about another 10 or so direct people working on it and then another 30 to 40

1072
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:10,680
consultants who come in and out of the projects to be able to work on those.

1073
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:18,840
What will be required from a legal standpoint for products like this or similar products to be sold

1074
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,680
across state lines? Does that only happen at the federal level?

1075
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:28,360
Yeah, that only happens at the federal level. We think that the first number of indications

1076
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:36,840
that we've picked and worked on with FDA are going to go through fast track approval and that's

1077
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:44,280
without getting down into the weeds of all of the legalities of that. That frequently allows a

1078
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:51,160
product to get through the FDA process in somewhere between two to four years. In the space of drug

1079
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:58,040
development, that's the blink of an eye and at the same time we're beginning our international

1080
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:04,680
aspect. Deb and I will be in Berlin presenting our data at an international meeting of cannabis

1081
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:12,920
physicians so that this activity is very, very quickly spreading not just here but across the

1082
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:20,600
country and across the world. I was lucky enough to be able to be at the United Nations in 2016

1083
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:27,640
testifying and telling the UN that they should change the war on drug policy from incarceration

1084
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:34,840
and retribution to medication and treatment. While things move slowly through the political

1085
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:41,400
process, we see that that is taking hold in country after country that this war on drugs policy is

1086
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:48,840
changing dramatically as countries are able to see the medicine and science for themselves.

1087
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:54,120
It's very, very encouraging. Deb, how often do you get invited to speak at medical conferences

1088
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:59,400
that are not about THC or cannabis? In other words, how often is the anesthesiology society

1089
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:03,320
saying, hey, come and give us a talk on pain and the use of this because as physicians,

1090
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:06,600
we're seeing that our patients are using these things and we're ignorant?

1091
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:13,400
Right. Sadly, not often enough. I do lecture to grand rounds for individual physicians and groups

1092
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:18,920
and departments that have heard me speak or seen me on YouTube and said, wait, we need to have her

1093
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:26,520
come in. I'm actually lecturing in Detroit next month to a group of scientists and engineers and

1094
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:34,360
biopharma developers who are interested in what we do. That's a unique space, but I am actually

1095
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:42,840
hoping to target in California at the end of Q2 for 2020 that I'm going to speak with the

1096
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:47,880
society of pain. So I'm looking forward to that. Now, this might sound like a dumb question,

1097
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:52,760
but if you have a state like Colorado or California in which you have the same legal

1098
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:58,040
framework basically as Michigan, why can your product not ship from one state to another state?

1099
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:04,680
Because I have to leave Michigan and pass into another state before I get to Colorado.

1100
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:15,400
Even if I shipped next door to Illinois or Ohio for a microsecond, it will be in federal land

1101
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:21,400
as it goes from state to state. It's called interstate commerce. And there was a very classic

1102
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:28,440
law case on this 150 years or so ago that defined what is interstate commerce.

1103
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:33,240
And it's essentially just stepping over the border and sometimes even more than that,

1104
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:38,280
just being on a federal highway. What does the, if you had to guess, I know you don't have a crystal

1105
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:42,760
ball, but if you had to sort of think about what the legal framework is going to evolve into,

1106
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:47,320
do you believe that cannabis will always be illegal at the federal level or do you think

1107
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:51,320
that it will have a change in legal status? Oh, it's absolutely going to change. Absolutely

1108
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:58,440
going to change. No question about it. It's so clear. How long do you think this could take?

1109
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:08,760
Well, we see that it is beginning. That is hemp right now is part of that story. It is the nose

1110
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:16,200
of the camel in the tent to be able to move this forward. At this point, we have more than half

1111
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:23,080
the states have said that these products are just fine for their patients, for their population.

1112
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:29,960
And FDA is currently very, very actively involved in this. I was fortunate enough to be part of a

1113
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:37,480
task force that started some years ago to be able to move this forward. FDA is struggling to find

1114
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:43,880
literally a legal pigeonhole to put this into my suggestion for any of the FDA officials who might

1115
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:49,320
be listening to this podcast, and I hope it's all of them, that there's the over-the-counter drug

1116
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:55,320
review that has been used for many, many years to be able to take products onto the shelves of drug

1117
01:58:55,320 --> 01:59:02,040
stores to be able to use this based on the fact that people could self-prescribe some medications

1118
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:08,440
for themselves. They didn't need a physician to write a script. So we think that many of these

1119
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:14,440
products have sufficient safety, that they are self-prescribable, and I think we see that because

1120
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:21,480
frankly, there's about 30 million, 40 million people using these on a regular basis right now.

1121
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:29,480
And other than the vaping crisis, they're not filling up hospital wards due to toxicity from

1122
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:34,680
these products. They're able to use them. Okay. So do you think that the farm bill is really the

1123
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:39,480
single most important thin end of the wedge because it was the first piece of federal

1124
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:44,360
law that decriminalized the first part of the value chain here?

1125
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:50,680
Yes, absolutely. It really was. I think that that will continue actually from many of the

1126
01:59:51,320 --> 02:00:00,120
cannabis business people who are struggling in this area because the tax laws are incredibly

1127
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:07,080
burdensome and require a lot of dancing in order to be able to just simply run a business.

1128
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:16,440
But we see ourselves a year and a half ago, I had to switch bank accounts four times in one year.

1129
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:23,400
If anyone ever tried having to switch your bank account where your bank suddenly closes out on you

1130
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:29,800
every three months, that's terrible, especially as you're just trying to run a business and pay

1131
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:36,680
bills. Now though, we have completely solid, reasonable banking relationships. We're able

1132
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:45,480
to get insurance. Everything is becoming normalized and we do not see patients or consumers

1133
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:53,880
acting foolishly in any way. Quite to the contrary, they often are reducing the amount

1134
02:00:53,880 --> 02:01:02,120
of smoking of cigarettes and alcohol use and are becoming more law abiding citizens than less.

1135
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:08,520
Deb, what concerns, if any, do you have about what this industry looks like? I mean, I can't go

1136
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:16,440
more than a week without getting pitched some CBD, THC, hemp company. I mean, there must be

1137
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:22,680
more companies sprouting up in some part of this value chain than any other industry. I mean,

1138
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:27,400
from an investment standpoint, this is an area where people are very excited.

1139
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:34,120
I just don't imagine most of the people bring the expertise that your team is bringing, which is why

1140
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:39,400
I wanted to talk with you guys as opposed to every other person out there who's peddling a

1141
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:44,680
cause. But do you see that as being a concern? In other words, can a few bad actors set the stage

1142
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:51,000
back? Yes, especially in the stigma area for patients. That's my major concern is patient

1143
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:57,720
safety. There are a lot of people out there that see a gold rush or a green rush and they just want

1144
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:03,080
to make products, sell them to people and get a Dodge and enrich themselves. And that's a concern

1145
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:08,440
to me. When patients unfortunately are not understanding that just because you can buy

1146
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:15,640
something off the shelf of a big box store or from an online source that it's tested and it's safe,

1147
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:21,640
because there's no guarantee to that. And so my recommendation of patients is if you live in a

1148
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:26,760
legal state, you should buy from a legal dispensary, ask for their certificate of analysis, take a look

1149
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:31,960
at it, make sure that there's no adulterants to the best of our knowledge in the science right now.

1150
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:37,320
This is why I'm happy to work with Steve because this is his passion as well because we really

1151
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:42,920
don't want to hurt people. I mean, that's the thing that kills me. That's the reason why actually

1152
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:50,040
it should be de-scheduled. I mean, so it would allow for robust testing, a standardized testing.

1153
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:54,680
I mean, just because there's testing in states doesn't mean they all use the same methods.

1154
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:57,800
That's sort of something you guys brought up today that was news to me, which was

1155
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:03,880
the inability of the states to rise to the level of federal testing. And so in many ways,

1156
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:10,280
the decriminalization state by state is not a great approach. You can't just run that out to

1157
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:16,840
its natural conclusion without decriminalizing it at the federal level to get the full muscle

1158
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:22,200
of the FDA and the protocols behind testing. Absolutely. I mean, from laboratory to laboratory,

1159
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:26,520
there are no standards. And the problem is there's no guidance because it's been illegal.

1160
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:33,000
And so the sources that laboratories would use to go to to say, well, where do we get our standards

1161
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,400
from? And what are the methods of extracting from this gummy bear or this brownie in order to test

1162
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:44,760
the potency or test the microbials or to test any of it don't exist. So look, there are people

1163
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:49,320
listening to this in 49 states that are not in Michigan, not to mention people that are listening

1164
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:54,600
to this outside of this country. What would be your playbook for them to protect themselves as

1165
02:03:54,680 --> 02:04:01,080
they go into their local dispensary or purchase online? You can buy CBD across state lines if

1166
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:06,200
it's pure enough. How would you give people a sort of instruction list of things to do to first and

1167
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:10,840
foremost protect themselves? Right. So this is a human rights issue. You hit the nail on the head.

1168
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:17,400
I mean, that's a huge problem for me as a physician to guide patients, which I do, I guide over 400

1169
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:23,240
patients privately free of charge because I'm a terrible business person. But for me to guide them

1170
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:29,800
and have to understand their state in order to help them access certain medicines is just

1171
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:36,040
horrific to me. But what I would say to them is go to a legal state, become certified as a patient,

1172
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:41,640
meet with a physician there and get the guidance from that and buy from a legal dispensary.

1173
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:46,600
Do you think that's enough? So I mean, a physician in another state, do they have the expertise

1174
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:51,320
to help them navigate through the dispensary? There is a society called Society of Cannabis

1175
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:57,800
Clinicians where they have a list of doctors by state who actually are experts in cannabinoid

1176
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:04,200
medicine for which they can go seek out and help themselves. I mean, this is a nascent industry.

1177
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:09,320
It's still federally illegal, which allows for all of these hoops to have to be jumped through.

1178
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:15,080
I would recommend not buying online. I would recommend not buying off the street. I mean,

1179
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:19,960
we tell our children don't take candy from strangers because you don't know what it is.

1180
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:24,440
Why would our medicine be any different? So I don't know that it's widely known,

1181
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:31,880
but I developed the actual essay methods to detect LSD, marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines,

1182
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:38,600
and I published those results when I was 21 and 22 years old. So I really have a pretty solid

1183
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:45,960
sense of what these laboratories are able to do. That was, well, almost 50 years or so ago,

1184
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:53,480
and it was my first scientific publications. The labs are capable nowadays because I just

1185
02:05:53,480 --> 02:06:02,120
recently set one up a few years ago of doing remarkably accurate and precise work on all of

1186
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:09,480
these cannabinoid products and to be able to do it. But the state rules vary and the states are

1187
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:14,840
still learning. What should the pesticides be that are allowed or allowable? What are the levels

1188
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:22,440
of heavy metals, et cetera? So from state to state, the rules vary and they are getting

1189
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:30,920
more learned as the work is done. So this is a great developing field. Some labs are better than

1190
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:39,000
others to be able to do it. So that's why to echo Deb's recommendation for people who want to

1191
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,720
utilize these products, they really need to ask for the certificate of analysis,

1192
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:51,560
see if they can become educated enough to be able to do that. Certainly physicians should. I know

1193
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:56,520
that these systems, endocannabinoid systems were not taught in medical schools. They certainly

1194
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:05,400
weren't taught in the chemistry schools that I went to. And this is a remarkable societal

1195
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:14,440
experience in allowing non-toxic substances to be used and self-prescribed. I think it's a

1196
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:22,760
challenge for the physicians to catch up because you are a learned intermediary to help patients

1197
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:31,160
be able to do this. And I hope out of this podcast, that's why we're here, is to help encourage all of

1198
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:36,440
these educational programs. Because frankly, our hands are full enough just running the clinical

1199
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:41,560
trials and being able to run a business. So we're going to have to leave that part of it up to you.

1200
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:45,240
Well, on that guys, I want to thank you very much for coming down here today and for making time and

1201
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:48,840
for sharing kind of all your insights and for the work you're doing. I mean, I think this is,

1202
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:53,560
I don't know, I've got to be honest with you. I think I'm still somewhat confused about all

1203
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:59,640
of the different permutations and combinations of these molecules. And it's complicated by the fact

1204
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:09,400
that interstate commerce prevents easy access of higher quality products to individuals. So I guess

1205
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:15,400
the thing we can all hope for is that, and again, I would say this frankly, even if you are still

1206
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:24,040
undecided on the safety or efficacy of these, everyone still seems to benefit from the

1207
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:30,600
decriminalization of this because it allows far more rigorous testing and it de-stigmatizes

1208
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:35,640
so much of the research funding that goes into this. But I think one way or the other, we get

1209
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:39,880
answers quicker. And that's probably what we're kind of missing at the moment.

1210
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:47,000
Right. This is a process that's unfolding in a very, very short length of time. I was at a meeting

1211
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:56,920
with FDA, DEA, and Department of Defense just four and a half years ago and NIH, where I brought up

1212
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:03,560
the idea, hey fellas, you're the federal regulators and it looks like cannabis is going to get approved

1213
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:11,000
state by state. Why don't we try and set some federal health policies here around that? And

1214
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,880
just four and a half years ago, everyone in the room except me said, are you kidding? That's never

1215
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:25,880
going to happen. And now we see it actually has. And so the people who are in a role to be able

1216
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:32,120
to bring these forces to bear are trying to play catch up and do it and more power to them.

1217
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:39,400
And I think that everyone should just try and continue to do just as you are doing here,

1218
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:47,160
allow folks like us to bring our thoughts to bear and happy to hear from anybody. We're not certain

1219
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:54,920
we have all the best right answers. We have a particular predilection towards medicine and the

1220
02:09:54,920 --> 02:10:01,880
idea that above all else, do no harm first. We're kind of pushy about it though.

1221
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:03,800
Thanks very much guys. I really appreciate it.

1222
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,680
Thanks for having us.

02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:05,080
