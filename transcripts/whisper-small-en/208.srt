00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:13,520
Hey Kelsey, thanks so much for making the time to come all the way to Austin. I really appreciate

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,280
it. Although I'm not going to take credit for the fact that you came here for this. I think this was

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,440
an opportunistic time to sit down. For sure. I mean, I definitely did come here for this and

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,280
there are some other great people here that I get to visit. It's perfect. So thank you for having me.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,800
Yeah, I know my wife is really upset that you don't live here.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,080
You know, it's funny because I went out with them last night and there's this draw to this

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,680
place because there's a lot of good people here. And I think during COVID I understood why everybody

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
was leaving and I really couldn't stand LA and there was just a thousand reasons the past couple

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,040
of years have been hard. But all of a sudden suddenly I really love LA again. So I'm going

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,200
to hold on and just visit you guys every month. That's the plan.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,000
So where'd you grow up?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,160
I grew up in Winter Park, Florida.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,040
Got it. Okay. And when did you start swimming?

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,120
I was probably four and I probably raced in my first race at six.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,480
Wow. So when did you realize you were a good enough swimmer to be a collegiate swimmer?

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,360
You know, it's funny. We talk about this with sports and kids these days. It just wasn't on

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,320
our radar the way it is for kids now. I lived in Florida. You wanted to be outside. You wanted to

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,400
be with your friends. So we swam and little by little I, you know, I'd win a few races,

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,160
25 butterfly, something on backstroke and it was just something fun to do with your friends.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,080
So I don't even remember thinking about college until maybe ninth grade when I won. I think we

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,200
got second at state and then my sophomore year I won state and what event? A hundred back and

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,120
hundred fly. Did you swim IM as well? I didn't. I was terrible at breaststroke. Horrible. There's

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,200
a bunch of jokes about that we could go into, but I won't right now. Yeah. I don't, I remember

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,760
thinking like, Oh, wow, that's great. Like I just won Florida's, you know, state championships,

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,640
but I also remember just loving my team and that like winter park high school one. And at that

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,840
point you really didn't talk to coaches that you didn't know recruiting, especially female

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,040
athletes. It wasn't huge back then to get a scholarship title nine. I've got to look that

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
up because I messed that fact up all the time. I feel like there weren't a lot of people I'd

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,320
ever met that had a scholarship that were girls. And so it wasn't until maybe my junior year that

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,560
my coach said, you know, a couple of coaches have called and said that, you know, you could get a

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,120
scholarship. And my family wasn't into sports. They just didn't even, I mean, they came to my

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,360
swim meets, but not really a lot of, um, they just weren't, everybody did their own thing in our

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,360
family. It was not how parents are now that are driving their kids and doing special coaches and

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,160
meets and stuff like that. So how I remember it was just, I had a lot of energy to burn off and

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,920
swimming was the one thing that after I was done, I felt like I burned that jet fuel off. That's all

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,200
I remember really. And then it just got better. And then coaches started to talk to me. Um, and

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,840
then the rest is kind of history. So what do you remember about getting to UNC? You went to a

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,160
basketball game with one of my girlfriends whose dad had gone there. Maybe this was my junior year.

40
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,720
And long story short, but he hits her brother dated the swim coach's daughter. And so at the

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,960
basketball game, which is huge in chapel Hill, it might've been a Duke Carolina game. I don't know,

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,320
but I remember it was a big deal. And someone said, Oh, Carolina is impossible to get in out of state.

43
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,800
And I thought, well, then I'm definitely going to try to get in out of state. Um, and so I,

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,120
I met the swim coach and he said, you know, call me when you're the end of your junior year,

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,080
when you're a senior. And I tried to get in. I don't think I got into Carolina at first. And

46
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,800
they had already given a scholarship to a girl from Ohio. She was going to swim 200 backstroke,

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,080
hundred backstroke. So I got an offer for Miami FSU and I think Florida, but I wanted to get out

48
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
of Florida so badly because everybody I knew was going there. And I was like, I want to have a new

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,760
experience. And so I just held. And then that spring, the girl decided to go somewhere else.

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,720
And so they gave me a, did you turn down those other scholarships? I did. Wow. I did. They were

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,360
in state schools and I, I, I didn't want to, I just didn't want to go there. And if I, I was,

52
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,200
I didn't want to swim. It was all because we were swimming against all the same people I grew up

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,080
with. I just knew I needed a new experience and I was kind of set on chapel Hill and somewhere deep

54
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
in my soul. I knew it would work out, which I have no idea why or how. And I remember coming home and

55
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,320
we had answer machines then and I hit my answer machine and it was coach Frank comfort. And he

56
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,840
was like, girl, we got a spot for you. We'll give you a partial scholarship. And if you make NC two

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,880
A's, we'll give you a full. And so I spent the first two years with just tuition and then my

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,120
parents paid room and board. And then once you made NC two A's, you got a full scholarship. So

59
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,760
my junior and senior year. So you swim fly and back. Yep. Both distances. A hundred back,

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,880
200 back, a hundred fly. Those are where my three. Yeah. Didn't want to do the 200 fly.

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
God, my arms would kill myself. I wanted to carry that third 50. I just be like, why am I doing

62
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,800
this? What did you say? Brutal race. What'd you swim? Well, I just swim like long distance swimming,

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
like ultra distance swimming. Of course. But when I swim in the pool, the only thing I could swim

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,000
was breaststroke. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I was decent breaststroker, right? Horrible. I couldn't

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
swim backstroke if my life depended on it. Funny. And okay. At butterfly. So short axis strokes were

66
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,760
fine. Pretty bad freestyler, despite the fact that I could swim for a long period of time,

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,120
but not fast. Right. Interesting. But I loved I am. That's why you, I bet you would have been

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,920
a decent IM or even if your breaststroke wasn't, no, I would, I would burn it out. Butterfly.

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,040
You didn't have anything left for free. And then they would just pass me. I had something

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,440
left for free, but I wasn't good. I just, I wasn't, I wasn't. I guess that's true. I think with IM,

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
I think having a strong breaststroke is valuable because it's late in the race and everybody's

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
tired and it takes up the most time of the race. So if you can, I remember swimming like at a

73
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,960
master's meet, if I could take six seconds out of somebody in a breaststroke, right? They could be

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,240
faster than me and the other. Nobody's going to take anything out of you on the fly because it's

75
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
the beginning of the race. Like you just, everybody's sort of conserving energy. Yeah. Yeah. That's a

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,640
fair point. But what year did you matriculate? I graduated from high school in 95 and Chapel Hill

77
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:27,040
in 99. Okay. So what year did you meet Nate? So I met Nate in 1998, 98. So the summer. So you were

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:37,120
going into my junior year. I think I, and I, I met him the summer of 1998 and I had just finished

79
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
my sophomore year swimming and I was just kind of a hot mess. I'd gained a ton of weight. I ate like

80
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,840
cream cheese and croissant sandwiches. Cause we were had like, um, what's it called training table.

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,400
I just really let it fly with penny draft and just nights out just my face and my body was just not,

82
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,800
not primed for winning anything. Um, I started dating a guy who had a weed problem and you know,

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,600
I kind of dabbled in that very little, but I, I was, I was running with a crowd that wasn't

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,360
conducive to being excellent. So you didn't hang with most of the swimmers. I did. He was on the

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,640
swim team. Okay. I was going to say, I would assume the swimmers would date a lot each other

86
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,800
because you have the same schedules and training. And at Caroline at the time you couldn't rush a

87
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,600
sorority or fraternity if you're on a swim, if you're on a athletic team. So basically they had

88
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,600
you, that was your group. Um, so I was really kind of insular with the swim team. I didn't love it so

89
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,400
much as I did in high school. I didn't love that. I felt like my, that my scholarship was depending

90
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,560
on it, that all of my friends did the same thing. Cause in high school we all had 12 girlfriends,

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
but everybody was different. I was the swimmer. One was the nerd, one was the smart one. One was

92
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,440
the party one. And once I got to chapel Hill, we were all fighting for NT2As or for the spot on the

93
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
relay. So it was just a different experience. So I dated this guy for awhile. And then

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,760
my summer before my junior year, I met Nate at a bar. And had, was Nate a senior at that point?

95
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,800
He was going into his fifth year senior year. Yeah. Cause he'd redshirted his for a year. Yeah.

96
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,720
Okay. He was going into his fifth year and I met him at a bar and, um, I just remember him walking

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,880
in and just absolute enormous man with more confidence than you've ever seen in your life,

98
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,800
more swagger for a huge fat guy that you couldn't, I mean, unbelievable. And I met him that night

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
and he, he gave me this napkin that said, if you want the best say goodbye to the rest,

100
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,560
go home with me and I'll make you happy. And I mean, I was like, what? But the funny part is

101
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,080
years later I met a girl at a wedding and she's like, you won't believe it. I know you're married

102
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,760
to Nate, how good shit it, but he left me a napkin one time in college. And I was like,

103
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,240
mother of God. Um, but yeah, I met him that night and then we didn't really,

104
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,520
we didn't see each other for a while. Um, but it turned out one of my roommates was dating a guy

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,760
on the offensive line named Ryan. And so a couple months later we had a house party where we watched

106
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,360
X files, which is a great thing. And just everybody partied and got drunk and danced and Nate was there.

107
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,400
And at some point that night a guy called that I was dating and Nate just walked over and took the

108
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,800
phone and was like, she's with me now. And that was it. Wow. So what is it that you liked about

109
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,280
him in that moment? Because on the one hand, it sounds like you were kind of amused, but I mean,

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,920
what did you see at that moment? I mean, from the minute I met him, if I'm honest,

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,040
like I knew there was something and he was nothing. I grew up in my father's a lawyer.

112
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,600
My mom was very politically active, a country club, you know, very kind of rigid, you know,

113
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,760
lots of, um, my town was very Southern and Christian. And, um, when I met Nate, he was so

114
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,680
different. He was like a poor kid from Allen town, just a guy that hustled. And I just felt he was

115
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,120
different. He was connected. Like when he'd sit and listen to you, you felt like you were the most

116
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,440
important person in the world. And he did it with everybody. I could see how he interacted. There was

117
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,800
a way when he walked into a room that you could tell everybody loved him and he loved them. Um,

118
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,160
so I knew that first night something was different about him. And then the night that we kind of

119
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,240
started dating, there was just a joy to Nate that was different and an extreme way of living,

120
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,600
which was concerning then and concerned me my entire life with him. But he was here for the

121
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,600
moment. He was here to have a good time and feel it all experience at all. Um, most loving human

122
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,640
being you'll ever meet truthfully. So I couldn't understand how I was attracted to him because it

123
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,120
just didn't match anything that I had imagined. Um, but when we started talking, the things he

124
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
was talking about were the same thing as me. Like, what do you want to do with your life?

125
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Who do you want to be? What books have you read? Um, what type of spiritual practices do you have?

126
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,880
And we were, you know, 19 and 22. And I remember he was on this deep search for meaning and purpose

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,440
and how do we serve? How do we get the most out of this life? Um, and so we kind of both started on

128
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,720
a spiritual journey at a very young age. And that's what I loved about him always. So married a

129
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,760
really fat, 300 pound, amazing defensive tackle. What year did you guys get married? We got married

130
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,360
in 2002. We got engaged at the world trade center in 2001 in July couple months before 9 11. At the

131
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,080
top of the tower. Yep. And I remember Nate being like, do you think that's a good sign or a bad

132
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,440
sign? And for a long time I was like, I think it's a good sign. And then after everything happened,

133
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,160
I was like, maybe it was a bad sign. But, um, yeah, we loved living in New York. He played for the

134
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Giants. And so we lived there for a while and then we got married in 2002 in Florida. So, you know,

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
Nate was not the guy who was going to get drafted in the first round. So what was your thinking as

136
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,120
you were saying, okay, I'm really serious about this guy and he wanted to play in the NFL. Like,

137
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,280
who doesn't play college football and wants to play in the NFL. So what were you thinking about,

138
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,800
his chances and, you know, obviously he had an amazing work ethic. How far did you think that

139
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
that was, you know, did you actually think that could get him out of college football? I actually

140
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,960
can hear him laughing. I, I was like, you'll never make it, which was always what I'd say to him.

141
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,360
Like the worst. I hope you like, you don't have a shot in hell. Like you haven't started. And he

142
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,400
was like, I'll just work my way. If I can just get a shot. He was always like, I can just get a shot.

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,200
And so truthfully, when the draft came, I had never, I'd seen him play in college, but he wasn't

144
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
a starter. He started almost lost his scholarship. Didn't you? Yeah. He almost lost it. And, uh,

145
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,280
Mack Brown was the coach and he was like, listen, buddy, this isn't going to work for you. He was

146
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,640
like fourth on the depth chart or something. Yeah. He was behind like Vani holiday and some of the,

147
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,840
I can't remember, uh, Dre Bly. It was just a big year at chapel Hill. We'd beat FSU. And I remember

148
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,400
just thinking like it's not going to happen, but we were young and I didn't, you know, I still had

149
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,520
a year and a half of school. And so I remember he went to the combine and he, he had a really fast

150
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,120
40 and he hit, he had a good combine and Caroline had had a great year. So he was back up to some

151
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,680
guys that were going first and second round. Um, but truthfully, the day of the draft,

152
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't even understand it in our families, his family to not into football, my family,

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,280
not into football. I actually thought it was an archaic sport, both sides academics on both sides.

154
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,040
Um, and Nate was like, if I could just get a chance on a practice squad, then I could make it.

155
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,640
And then we could save a little bit of money and then we could maybe buy a house someday. I mean,

156
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,960
that was pretty much the way we thought of it. Um, so when he got called by the giants to be on

157
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,280
the practice squad, everybody was shocked, but also knew that there was nobody that made the

158
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,760
good guys try harder than a guy like Nate, cause he would just literally go until he couldn't.

159
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,480
So I think I was surprised and it was more just, we were young and I was like,

160
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,640
good luck. Like hope you make the team. But we, I wasn't ever that invested in his career. Um,

161
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,680
I just wanted him to do it and get out safe and then make some money so that we could

162
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,880
start our real life. So did you know Jeff Saturday when they were roommates? Oh yeah.

163
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Oh yeah. I mean, Jeff's still one of my best friends and his wife. So we all lived together.

164
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,160
Jeff and Nate lived together from freshman year. And I mean, the story about Jeff is,

165
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,480
yeah, tell that story. I mean, that's just, it's an amazing story, especially in light of what

166
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,400
Jeff Saturday went on to become right. One of the greatest centers of the game. And to think that

167
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,440
he got overlooked and then tell people how that happened. So Jeff and Nate were roommates

168
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,840
freshman year. And Jeff tells this great story about when he first met Nate, um, he, he went to

169
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,760
introduce himself, but Nate was sobbing, hugging his parents. And he was like, wait, I'm, I'm like,

170
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,080
going to be rooming with this like cry baby. Like what's happening? Jeff's a guy from Georgia,

171
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,280
grew up kind of a rough life, very tough. And they ended up being best friends. They played

172
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,640
together along with Chris Kaldorf, who was up for the Heisman. There was a group of them

173
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,640
and when we all were waiting for the draft, Chris had been the quarterback and Jeff was the center

174
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,520
and we were certain they were going to go in fourth round, fifth round. And we all just sat there and

175
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,880
you kind of just sit around back then and just wait for the phone to ring. And there's no cell

176
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,200
phones or anything. And nobody called, nobody called, nobody called. And then the only person

177
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,760
that got called was Nate. So Nate went on to the giants and got on the practice squad and barely

178
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,760
made it through that first cut, but he made it. And then he got released by the giants and the

179
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Colts picked him up right away. So Nate moved to Indianapolis. And at that time, Jeff was,

180
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,080
wasn't sure he, I think he got a shot at Baltimore on a practice squad, but didn't make it. So he

181
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,720
came back to North Carolina and started working at like a pet boys. And they didn't think he had

182
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
a shot. It was kind of over. He was too short. I mean, Nate used to always tell him and Jeff,

183
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,240
if you're listening, they said, you know, he has short arms. He'll never make it as a center. And

184
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,400
they wrote all these awful things about him. And Nate just always went up against him in practice

185
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,640
for four years. And he was like, he's the best guy I've ever played against. So at some point,

186
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,360
Nate was still barely making the Colts trying to just get, you know, you want to get paid week by

187
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,080
week if you make the team and if you play. So it's not how people think. And so at one point,

188
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,480
Nate said he had a really tough practice and the guys that he played against, he's like,

189
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,440
I just walked away being like, those guys don't even close to what Jeff did. So he walked into

190
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,920
Polian's office in like dirty sweats. Polian doesn't even know who he is. He has no clue. He's

191
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,200
like, who is this guy? Cause he's just like a guy trying to make the team. And he said, there's a

192
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,680
guy in Raleigh, North Carolina, that's working at an auto parts store right now. His name's Jeff

193
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,760
Saturday. And he could kick all those guys' asses that I just played. And coach said, well, if you

194
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,720
want him to come live with you, I'll give him a shot. And then that was it. And the rest is history,

195
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,040
six pro bowls or whatever it is. He'll be a Hall of Fame. And I still get mad because Nate and I

196
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
are like, and he got us a comforter for our wedding. Like we're like, Hey buddy,

197
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,840
like we kind of started your whole career and all we got was like, we got this lousy comforter.

198
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah. Just one of the greatest guys, biggest heart. Um, it has gone on to have an exceptional

199
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,680
career for sure. So let's go back to, let's start at 99, right? So you were the Rams,

200
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,920
you're in St. Louis. I remember this year very well because I mean, Kurt Warner, of course,

201
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,280
so at the beginning of that playoff run, did you think this is really going to happen? Were you?

202
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,920
Yeah, it was really fun for the first time. I was like, Oh, this is fun. And we were winning.

203
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,160
I was still in college, so I would fly. Oh, that's right. You, this would have been your senior year.

204
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,640
So I was still in college and it was, it was just fun. And we were winning and we were winning. And

205
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,920
Kurt was an exceptional leader, spiritually, emotionally, everything. And the team just had

206
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,680
a bunch of really good guys on it. And it was fun to be a part of that team. And I think

207
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
I've always felt like the energy matters the most. And there was something that was telling us the

208
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,080
energy on this team is good. So every time they won, you just now it gets more, you're like,

209
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,160
please win, please win. Then you're like, really? Cause you know that this, this may never come

210
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,520
again. And most of the time it doesn't. And we had Dick Vermeel as a coach who's still probably one

211
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,640
of the greatest humans to me and still continues to come to my house twice a year to see the kids

212
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,400
and just have dinner with us. Just an exceptional advocate for his players as human beings,

213
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,560
way past, you know, their football. Nate loved him and he was the one that gave Nate a shot

214
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,080
multiple times just because of his character. Cause it takes like, he's not that good,

215
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,840
but he really makes the other good guys better. So that year was just exceptional and it was fun.

216
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,040
And St. Louis was on fire and that, that city needed it. And I remember when we made it to the

217
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,480
last, I'm the worst about football, the last playoff game, whatever happened last night that

218
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,640
we all just watched the divisional champion. I was like, Oh my God, we could, we could win the

219
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,680
Superbowl, but I was young and I, so I got there and I was wearing some like nerd outfit and all

220
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,800
the other NFL wise were like smoking hot and looking so cool. And I think I had like my backpack,

221
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,320
but I just didn't know we didn't, we weren't into it like that. And I remember the last play came

222
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,760
and it was that big play where Mike Jones was tackled. I forget who I remember. Anyways,

223
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,680
it was that last second. And I remember thinking, and I told Nate this and he was very offended.

224
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,520
I was like, whatever you do, don't put Nate in. Like, please don't put him in because I didn't

225
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,080
want him to be the guy that lost. I was like, I can't live with it, but they tackled the guy

226
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,840
before he got in the end zone and the Rams won. And it was just exceptional. It was an exceptional

227
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,520
experience. And there's, I don't know if you know this, but they have two parties for both the teams.

228
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,560
Just one's a lot more fun. They're identical. So each team has a hotel and each team has the same

229
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,200
exact party ready, but one's just the real, the party. That's the better way.

230
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Because they both have the t-shirts ready as if they're going to use it, right? Yeah.

231
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,360
Yeah. Your NFC champion or not. Yeah, exactly. So I just remember it was fun. We danced. We,

232
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,160
we had a great time. We never took any of it for granted. We loved all of it.

233
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,120
And Nate was in a ton of pain. Always. Yeah. You, you wrote about that a lot in the book and,

234
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
it's sort of interesting when you think about how early in his career he was. I mean, he was in pain

235
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,120
before he made it to the NFL, which is something that we would assume, well, you know, God, if a

236
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,000
guy's been in the NFL for 15 years, I can sort of see why he wouldn't have toes anymore and why he

237
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,160
wouldn't be able to feel his hands. But you don't think of a guy who's 22 trying to get into the

238
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,320
NFL already under that type of discomfort. Yeah. He was banged up because first of all,

239
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,720
when you play on the line, that's a whole nother ball game. And when you are not a starter that

240
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,800
kind of gets to take breaks. So Nate was the workhorse. And so he took so many hits. And

241
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,320
when he got to college, I don't, I don't want to mess up the weight, but he was skinny,

242
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,480
not skinny, but he was a basketball player in high school. And in order to play the position

243
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,800
that he was welcome to play at North Carolina, he had to gain a ton of weight. So he, by the time,

244
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,160
I think when we got married, he was 300 pounds and maybe he was like 220 when he got to Carolina.

245
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,840
So he force fed. So I think the weight he put on his body put to move that amount of weight around

246
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,320
that fast and that often took a toll pretty early. His neck was a 21. Could that be right?

247
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,200
It was enormous. And I remember the first night I slept with him,

248
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,760
not literally, but maybe I don't know, you know, you know what I mean? But I remember being like,

249
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,280
this snoring won't work. This is, this is a game changer. Like we're going to have to make a move.

250
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,600
And when he got to the Giants within a couple of weeks, they gave him a sleep apnea mask at 22.

251
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,240
So for our entire time together for 21 years, I never had slept with a man that didn't have

252
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
a sleep apnea mask, which is awful to look at, but it has this wonderful white noise sound.

253
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,000
And your husband doesn't snore. And it helps him sleep. And I remember he used to say like,

254
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,280
I could die without this. I'm like, no, you couldn't. So early on, I think he was just too

255
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,680
big to do what he was doing without paying a price quite often. And he was, but he wasn't

256
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,320
a complainer. He's like, I choose this, but you could just tell he spent a lot of time just

257
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,200
managing where to put the pain, which was out of his mind and just accepting it's,

258
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,920
it's what it is to get us where we want to get to, which again was always save some money

259
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,680
and then then go start the life that I wanted to do to serve people or do whatever.

260
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,360
What did you think at the time, not knowing necessarily what you know today, because I

261
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,440
think today you have much more perspective on that. But when he was 23, 24 years old,

262
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,400
what did you imagine he was going to be like at 50 as a result of the injuries he already had?

263
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Like, did you think, did you, did you have a vision in your mind of when we're 60,

264
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,600
we're going to be just, we're going to be hiking in Peru, you know, backpacking with our grandkids.

265
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,360
Like, did you, did you think that it was all, this was all going to be okay. And these injuries are

266
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,480
going to go away. Well, he was always into health. He was always into, um, learning about his body.

267
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
He took great care. He had great people, Mike Clark, great, great people that were doing good

268
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,000
things, taking care of his body. He was always very, well, there's double side tonight. He was

269
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,400
always very aware of what he put in his body and taking care of him through PT and ice baths and

270
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,040
all that stuff. But he also loved like wings and beer and partying. So I don't know which is which,

271
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,960
but I definitely thought that when he was done, he would lose the weight

272
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
and he would become hot and skinny and we would live a happy life.

273
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,560
I mean, I never thought that I never thought he would stay so big. And that's kind of a side note.

274
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,960
I think when those guys get really big, it's part of, it's part of what they love about themselves.

275
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
There's a respect that they get when they walk into a room. They don't actually want to get that

276
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,600
much smaller. Um, one of our best friends, Tony is, but he was always fit, but he really, and Jeff,

277
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,560
Jeff did too. They both got really skinny. I think Nate secretly loved being big. Um,

278
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,440
because he would lose weight, but he never really loved himself at two 35. He loved himself around

279
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,320
two 60. And I think that was still too much weight. So as the years went by, that would be a fight

280
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,000
that we had quite often. Like when are you going to start, like when are you going to start doing

281
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,840
what you promised you would do, which was lose all the weight and stop dipping and, you know,

282
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,560
don't drink as many beers and don't eat chicken wings and nachos. And it just, he would have

283
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,000
spurts of it, but the Allentown in him just couldn't, couldn't be stopped. So you guys married in

284
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,320
oh two married in oh two. And then he retired in oh two or oh three. He retired, um, right before

285
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,480
my son was born. So I think oh four. Okay. All right. So was that a happy day for you?

286
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,160
It was mixed. How so, um, well, he didn't have a job. He didn't have a lot of life skills.

287
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,720
Emails had just started. We had just started technology was not Nate's jam. Um, he lived in

288
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,680
in this, in a world way up and way up in the sky. He lived in big dreams and big hopes.

289
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,480
And I was like, we have a baby on the way. And like, what are you going to do for a living?

290
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,920
I was a pharmaceutical sales rep, which was not my ideal job, but it was a great job to have

291
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,280
coming out of college. I didn't know what he was going to do. And I think a lot of guys,

292
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,680
when they transitioned out of football, most of them only play three to four or five years.

293
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
You kind of just get dropped into the world again. And all your friends that you went to college

294
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,400
with, they've been working for five or six years and you now are starting at an entry

295
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,600
lab jobble, like maybe 40,000 a year. You're used to making that a week. You used to everyone

296
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,080
worshiping you. It's a huge transition to for these guys. People, it's very easy.

297
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,000
If you're not mindful of it to lose sight of what the median experience is like in the NFL.

298
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,680
Not the mean, right? Because the mean gets dragged up by the Tom Brady's, Aaron Rodgers,

299
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,240
the guys that have remarkable longevity, remarkable skill, make remarkable money.

300
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
But if you talk median, like what's the guy right in the middle, the 50th percentile guy?

301
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:45,440
Yeah, he might be in the league for three years. He might have made a million or two over three

302
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,160
years before taxes, before paying agents, and then the other thing is what did that do to his

303
00:25:52,160 --> 00:26:00,240
life expectancy statistically? Just how many years did he pay for that? And when you look at it that

304
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,800
way, you know, it's sort of like any sport, right? I mean, I shouldn't say any sport. I think

305
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,640
football is one of the worst boxing would be another example, right? It's very easy to see

306
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,280
the guys at the top of that. But the pyramid that those guys stand on is a base this wide that's

307
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,040
getting crushed. Yeah. And I think, and I mean, obviously, the last four games that we've watched

308
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,560
the past two weeks have given me this dual experience that I continue to have around

309
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:33,920
football, that it is this great unifier and this great community builder and this wonderful thing

310
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,680
that brings people together and brings a bunch of people joy and brings the players a lot of

311
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,280
opportunities and a lot of gifts and gives their families a ton of things. And then there's this

312
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,000
whole other side that we don't see a ton of, which is the guys that played three years and

313
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,840
are still beat up or they don't have any money or they couldn't transition. I don't know. I don't

314
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,960
know how to, especially after the past two weekends, watching these playoff games, they were so fun.

315
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,160
And it made you love football and it made you see this is a great thing. And I would never let my

316
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:15,360
kid play and, you know, I would never have a kid in a helmet, but I don't, I used to think I had all

317
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,120
the answers about certain things and that I had, you know, a really strong opinion one way or the

318
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,800
other. And I'm probably more conflicted about a lot of things in life than I ever was. And maybe

319
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,440
that's a good thing. But I feel conflicted about football and I can't speak for Nate because

320
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
he's not here, but I would love to hear what he has to say, what his perspective was.

321
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,840
I know what his buddy's perspective is. And I do think that it's a great honor to play that sport.

322
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,000
And it's like the, you're like the king of what everybody wants to do. You know, you get this

323
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,160
opportunity that kids dream of, but there is a price and we don't really show that side of it.

324
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:01,120
We don't tell kids like, what's that guy doing 10 years later? Like we don't do ESPN spotlights on

325
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,240
that. Right. Remember when MTV used to always do that? Where are they now? Oh my God.

326
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,920
My roommate in med school, this was our, this is the only thing we would watch on TV. Every single

327
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,600
week we would never miss it. And what we loved about it was it was always the same story. You

328
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,920
could just plug in a new name of a band. Like this week it's Motley Crue. Right. This week's

329
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,160
it's Guns N' Roses, but guess what? It's the same story. That's actually an interesting just idea.

330
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,520
Like where are these people that were so amazing three years ago or five years ago? What do they

331
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,360
do now? Where do they live? What does their crib? What does their crib look like today?

332
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,280
How are they financially? How's their relationship with their children, with their kids?

333
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,320
I have obviously been surrounded by guys like Tony Gonzalez and Jeff Saturday who are exceptional

334
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:54,320
men, husbands, friends. But I know that is not always the case. So I don't know. These discussions

335
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,000
have been had at length. The book has brought out a very strong opinions on both sides.

336
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,160
I'd like to come back to that because I think I too feel conflicted about a lot of this stuff.

337
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,920
So what city were you guys living in when Ned retired?

338
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,960
So basically when he got released by Kansas City we went out to visit a friend that lived in

339
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,640
Manhattan Beach, California and he said you got to come to this little town. It's so great. And so

340
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,240
we went out there and then while we were there he got picked back up by I don't remember what team.

341
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,600
Maybe the Rams again. Vermeel always grabbed him again when he could. He's a good man. And I said

342
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,160
I'm just going to stay. I'm not going to keep bouncing around. I'm going to get a job because

343
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,320
someone's got to get a job. Someone's got to take care of this family. I said he was like police.

344
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,680
So I stayed and he played about another year and a half. And then his last team was the Cardinals.

345
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,240
They gave him a shot. But he was done. I mean he was emotionally done. You have to really want it.

346
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,240
And he was so tired of sitting in the meet. There's a lot of sitting in football. There's a lot of

347
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,760
film and watching. And Nate was like after a while this is just like this cannot be my life.

348
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,400
Can't just be watching like run X and O's. Like he had big dreams to change the world.

349
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,040
And so once he got cut we moved back and we moved into El Segundo. Pretty quickly after that we got

350
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,280
pregnant. And he went back. Both of you? Both of us got pregnant. Nate looked pregnant. I looked

351
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,760
really pregnant. So we lived in El Segundo. He went back and got his master's in social work.

352
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,200
Yeah did that that did that surprise you? That I mean in a way I'm sure it didn't because of

353
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,880
how much he loved the world and wanted to help people. But did it surprise you that that was

354
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,680
the chosen path? So he comes. His dad was a minister at Harvard and his mom was a professor

355
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:40,560
at Holy Cross. So he comes from an academic kind of service oriented family. That was if like some

356
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,760
kids are told to be bankers he was told to serve. So that was pretty much in his soul. So I don't

357
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,520
know. And he didn't have a ton of skill sets. What did he study in college? Like every good

358
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,080
studied football. No he studied communications like we all did along with the help of many people.

359
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,880
That's back in the day. So yeah we didn't he didn't have any he didn't he hadn't had an email

360
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,680
everything when you're in the NFL. That runs with a funny story.

361
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,960
I'm going to try not to name names here because it's not. Please just make up a pseudonym. Yeah

362
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,000
yeah but so so about the I don't know I won't even tell what year because then you could figure out

363
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,080
who it was. But years ago a few years ago I was helping out a buddy who wanted me to come

364
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:30,480
and do some work with the kids who were going to be probably the top 10 picks out of college. So

365
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,480
had the potential to be so I mean they all went in the first two rounds including Heisman trophy

366
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,720
winner. So there's 10 of us there the guy who brings me in to help me and then there's these

367
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,440
10 kids some of whom are playing right now and are the best in the NFL. And so the guy who had

368
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,000
me come in talk to them he's like hey look you know we did some blood work on them we want to

369
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,520
talk about nutrition we want to talk about you know like what can they do to optimize their

370
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,240
performance. So he brings me to this conference room it's beautiful and it's in Petco Park in

371
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,160
San Diego which is where everyone is meeting. And you know I'm starting to try to explain like some

372
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,640
of the biochemistry but and I'm keeping it I'm not believe me I'm not going all in on this right

373
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:18,480
I'm just doing like you know glucose you know glucose right and oh god what did the guy say so one

374
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,400
of the guys goes he's so bad the guy who won the Heisman was like I don't know which I don't

375
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,760
understand any of this and one of the other guys who I think honestly I could probably say is the

376
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,480
single most successful one that came out of that class he's like dude did you not take biology

377
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:47,120
and he goes well I took it yeah I mean what do you what do you call taking what's your

378
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,800
definition of taking yeah I mean I just don't know and this was 25 years ago right am I that old

379
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:00,400
yeah this was it was it was just different it was different back then and he didn't have it I don't

380
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,360
know what a lot of these guys do you know I didn't know so I wasn't surprised I was just glad that he

381
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,080
I thought I remember thinking because I managed a lot of his life because he was up you know in a

382
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,200
marriage they say someone's the balloon and someone's the rock he was like the biggest good year blimp

383
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,480
on the planet earth and I was the most uptight and erotic best rock you can I mean there was no fun

384
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,280
no joy no nothing and he would just float around and so I was I mean I think I probably said like

385
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,960
you need to go back to school because we needed a transition we needed something we're like he

386
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,000
learned how to type because remember we have tutors and stuff in college and so and they we

387
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,040
have lots of practices and we need a lot of help and so I would just remember thinking I don't

388
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,880
think he can go get a job like that would just be a disaster like he'd be like and also your ego has

389
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,800
to adjust to be nothing from being like signing autographs as a Super Bowl champion to being

390
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,800
like an assistant to I don't know whatever you get when you're 24 25 so school seemed like the

391
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,720
best way to slowly modulate back to a normal life like have things responsible and you have

392
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,640
due dates and deadlines so and he had this he had a dream to help people but he had no idea what it

393
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,680
meant to be a social worker how much you made and he couldn't comprehend and I remember when he

394
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,440
finished he graduated valedictorian which was exceptional because he barely got out of Chapel

395
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,160
Hill and he went to an interview and he's like they said it's $50,000 for the year he said I

396
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:30,480
don't even know that is slavery I was like this wrong word he was like he was like and you know

397
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,920
every time I fucking want to take a vacation I have to ask somebody with a sheet and put the

398
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,560
dates down I mean what are they written I mean he was he the TPM forms whatever they're called

399
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,040
yeah he was just like what are you talking about and he's like I get 10 days and I was like welcome

400
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,560
to the world but it but it was so he couldn't believe it he was just that's kind of amazing

401
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,120
isn't it he was floored he's like this is outrageous because football you have like a good four months

402
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,960
to do whatever and you've got money in the bank and your people high-fiving you and life is good

403
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,120
and then you go back to and they're like you could I remember listening him talk to HR and he's like

404
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:11,120
so what if I don't want to what if I want more vacation days and they're like nope he was like

405
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,840
this is he was just blown away by it so he was pretty depressed during that period of our life

406
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:24,880
and I remember I remember early on being like listen I didn't sign up for I need to know can you

407
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,360
do this are we gonna make this because you already had Jack right I had Jack and I said I don't know

408
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,800
what you have to do to make I didn't need him to be happy but I I was like with this transition

409
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,240
we knew going into it that this was a problem most most guys I think 70% end up broken divorced

410
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,160
after they're done that's a really big number that's staggering of people that just fall apart

411
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,960
and the average years you play is three so I mean that's a lot of people that are literally

412
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,720
falling off a cliff after they do professional football in their mid 20s mid 20s within and

413
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,080
they're probably the heroes so they go home and they like work at a bar in their high school

414
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,560
town because they they want to feel good again so we were just determined to find a new way but

415
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:16,400
it was bumpy it was bumpy he was sad he was sad and Nate was always very aware when he I don't know

416
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,720
if he had anxiety but I know he had depression and I know that he didn't want to feel bad and

417
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,760
he hated that he didn't he didn't know why and he worked really hard I mean he was well read

418
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,480
and he would try everything and so after a while once he kind of started to find some purpose

419
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
in the social work it got better and then at a certain point he's like I can't live on the

420
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,480
salary and like every good athlete does he decided to go into financial advising because there's

421
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,960
nobody you want to manage your money more than a football player no but he was great and he really

422
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,560
he felt that he'd seen so many guys lose a bunch of money to the wrong people so he

423
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,360
financed he loved investments he's he loved gambling so that's kind of what the stock market

424
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,840
is in its own way and so he moved into that at Morgan Stanley and loved it and ended up starting

425
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,160
helping guys that were in unions like just line workers and Verizon guys just like blue-class

426
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,000
blue-collar guys that just needed help with the money that they'd saved making sure it was

427
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,120
invested well so he kind of felt like he got the allen town and the finance stuff and was able to

428
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,480
serve and so that ended up being his career that he took on for the rest of his life and when did

429
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,360
you guys start to have those discussions about hey where's the 230 pound version of you who's

430
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,800
kind of getting back into what you know you had sort of imagined life post NFL would look like

431
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,520
I mean day one I mean I rode that man so hard for his whole life he could take more beatings

432
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,840
from me verbally and from coaches and teams I just I was tough I was like you you're this is

433
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,480
not going to work you you don't look good you're not healthy and he would he was always he wanted

434
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,400
to be better and so he would have times when he would get really in shape and he was probably the

435
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,160
guy in our neighborhood that everybody listened to health-wise because he had all the information

436
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,280
there was just certain things he he you know he would he would always do like sober January

437
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,400
February and then he was when the sun would come out again get a little dicey March April by the

438
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,120
summer he was full board just having a ball and then forget about it once the Yankees started

439
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,800
wheels were off and we would cycle through that did he ever go visit a doctor during this period

440
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,160
of time so the NFL has a program where you go once a year so I don't know the details on this

441
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,120
don't hold me on this but you either you sign something where you they say you'll never sue

442
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:38,960
them again and we'll give you care like you go every year to an NFL some type of physical

443
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,400
or you can do your own thing but we're not going to take care I don't know the details but we

444
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,000
chose the one where we we took some money you take a lump sum of something and then you can't

445
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,840
ever sue them about certain things and then they kind of put you in a program where they check in

446
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,320
with you every year mentally physically and so he would do that but I now looking back I actually

447
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,840
found his records from his last year and he had told me like everything was fine and then I

448
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,520
everything was fine except for this one page that was so not fine which was his heart and his

449
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,360
cholesterol and his weight and we didn't really talk about that I mean one thing I think if I

450
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,880
could go back and do different things in my marriage I would have had a different tactic

451
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,840
because I think I was so scared that I was mean and then it didn't feel safe for him to tell me

452
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,240
the truth so he just put it aside and was like I'll deal with that I'll take care of it but I'm

453
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,320
not going to get into it with her but I always wanted him to be skinnier and his mom I mean it

454
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,880
was the biggest thing that his mom used to say to him was like please lose the weight please lose

455
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,720
the weight but it was really hard for him was he still exercising lifting weights and things like

456
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,000
that he always worked out very physical very athletic I mean he was he was still really good

457
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,320
we played football every Thanksgiving in El Segundo and he was great fast talented strong yeah people

458
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
don't appreciate that you'd think well what's a defensive lineman or defensive tackle like

459
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,280
they're so big but they can't be that fast they are so fast the most athletic man I've ever seen

460
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,120
he could he was the strongest man I've ever seen and he had a work ethic physically that he would

461
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:18,720
just he could go forever he could also rest forever too he was extreme in every in every way good and

462
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:32,560
bad so your daughter was born in what year 2008 got it okay so fast forward to November of 2017

463
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:41,600
yeah you had some premonitions that something wasn't right I mean how how much of that do you

464
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,360
think you now look back at and think I can only appreciate this now through the retrospectoscope

465
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:54,080
versus at the time did you think there's something wrong with me like I'm really losing it

466
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,280
well there's two parts that my friends will tell you you were very vocal something was wrong

467
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,000
so I have witnesses that remember for about two or three years like something's wrong with her

468
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,160
she can't settle she's anxious and I would say I don't know what's wrong something's not right

469
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,880
and I was so scared I was nervous travel had become just really what were you doing the time

470
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,600
were you still working so I was working in Chapel Hill okay no I was working in recruiting

471
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,040
and medical recruiting and so the the team that I had in Chapel Hill was a group of guys that I'd

472
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,480
gone to college with that played football and so I would go back every month because my team was

473
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:40,400
there and for years I started in 2012 it was fine but then around 2014-15 I started just

474
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,240
dreading leaving the family but it made no sense the kids were in a great age Nate was doing great

475
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,360
but my anxiety was through the roof I'd wake up sweating I'd wake up and how long each month would

476
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,440
you have to be gone maybe three or four days do you think you were anxious that Nate couldn't

477
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,040
handle getting them to school on time or what do you think was upsetting you I mean I don't know

478
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,280
how spiritual I can get here but I I felt like something was coming it's the best way I can

479
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,240
describe it something's coming and the message to me was prepare like somehow something's coming

480
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,360
that's big you don't know what it is I can't explain it but and there was something about Nate

481
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,120
that was floating away and I was trying to get to him and I was also trying to manage this

482
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,720
unexplained anxiety that had you ever experienced anxiety growing up like were you an anxious person

483
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,440
by nature not I mean I wonder what my friends would say I wasn't anxious but I I needed to swim

484
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,160
six hours a day so I don't know I don't know what that means I've always you know energy yeah a lot

485
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,320
of energy but I don't remember being nervous or fearful I wasn't a lot of fun like I wasn't the

486
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,160
party girl I didn't do drugs I wasn't like let's stay out all night I was always like we need to

487
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,680
get home and very responsible but I wasn't anxious but I never was I never was a let go I was never

488
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,720
like let's just see where where the wind takes us but I didn't have panic attacks and those you

489
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,480
know the nights the nights that are just you can't stop your brain going those became more and more

490
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,320
and more the two years before he died and I had this sensation did you ever talk with him about

491
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,320
it all the time what would you say please don't die what would he say I promise I'm not going to

492
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,200
I won't leave you don't worry I'm here I'm something I would say like I can't live without

493
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,800
you like you're my best friend you're like the only person I know like you're the best dad in

494
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,200
the world okay I'm thinking about it and he would be like I'm right here I'm never gonna leave you

495
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,400
and fast forward I don't think he has but in many ways but yeah and I just was like Nate I can't I

496
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,000
don't know what's wrong with me and he's like you just need to calm down and his big thing was just

497
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
stop being afraid what are you so afraid of you're so you just say like you walk around so afraid

498
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,280
of everything like what if you just knew everything was okay like he's like everything's okay babe

499
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,160
like you're okay we're okay the kids are okay and that was always his message and there was

500
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,760
nights that I would go to bed and he would be watching a show and he was always watching

501
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,800
something really masculine like Oprah's you know final show and he'd just be sobbing you know and

502
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,440
or Mr. Holland's opus or some like show that just like you just and he would just cry and and I

503
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
would say what I'd come out and say like what's wrong he's like I just hope I I hope I have enough

504
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,760
time I hope that I can make a difference in this world and there there came a point where I would

505
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,000
wake up and I couldn't find him and I felt like he was gone and I'd scream for him and he would

506
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,840
be like I'm right here I'm in the other room but you'd literally scream I literally would and the

507
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,120
only reason I know this is all true is because I would tell my friends you guys I wake up and I

508
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,440
scream and I feel like Nate's gone and he always comes in and he says I'm right here don't worry

509
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,960
about it but so those things started to happen and in conjunction with that I said well I need help

510
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,840
so that's when I started to really dig into self-help and spiritual books and I was like where is

511
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,840
there's got to be an answer here and it turns out there wasn't an answer but there was a huge

512
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,840
toolkit I was about to be given for what I think I knew was coming and tell me more about that

513
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,000
so I feel like every when I started reading obviously Vishon's book The Code of the

514
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,680
Extraordinary Mind and that's kind of a book that I talk about because it it was pivotal for Nate

515
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,280
and I we read it together and then we gave it to Tony and when we gave it to Tony he loved it so

516
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:34,160
much and he's a big seeker of information and he then contacted Vishon who wrote the book and

517
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:42,480
through a bunch of beautiful synchronicities I got an opportunity to go to this event in Jamaica

518
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,560
and it was I grew up in a spiritual family everybody you know Wayne Dyer, Esther Perel

519
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,840
we did A Course in Miracles very open-minded religiously everybody could believe what they

520
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,800
wanted the idea was about love and God and being fearless I come from a very fear-based family but

521
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,680
we really believed in being fearless just no one had mastered it quite yet and so Nate kept saying

522
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,600
like I don't you got to fix this I don't know what's going on with you but you can't keep living

523
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,000
like this meanwhile Nate was just crushing life at this point he was starting a non-profit in Watts

524
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,480
and he was doing great in his career and he was just really happy but there was something about

525
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,280
him that I felt like he was I mean this is so cheesy but floating away I couldn't get to him

526
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,320
the way I couldn't his eyes didn't seem he seemed far away he would forget things

527
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,000
he like he was we were barbecuing and he put all the lighter fluid on the fence

528
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,400
and then lit lit the match and the whole fence lit up. That's not like where are my keys so what

529
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,000
did you think about that? I just thought like I don't I don't I don't remember do you think he

530
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,120
was being funny no because he felt terrible after he hated himself after he'd berate himself like

531
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,440
I don't know what's wrong with me I can't remember and he would forget his keys always and he would

532
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,120
he would make little mistakes so I don't know that he knew something was wrong with him too

533
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,320
and I can tell because he started doing like mind exercises and he was trying to get going

534
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:17,840
or he would just say like I don't know why I feel so down he felt really sad the last year

535
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:23,840
of his life he was just and it wasn't depression as much as it was just it wasn't him I don't I

536
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,960
it's hard to describe but besides Tony and Jeff who else was he still in touch with regularly

537
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,360
closely from the NFL all of them all most I mean all the guys that coach for meal so they were

538
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:42,240
retired by then as well how many of these guys could understand what he was talking about I don't

539
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,120
know that he talked about it with a lot of people his best friend Chris in the neighborhood was like

540
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,920
he just won't share anything anymore it doesn't seem himself Tony will say that Nate was always Nate

541
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,480
and I do think when Nate would get around his buddies and they're all drinking he would be

542
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,360
much more normal it was more when we were at home and that the hard part is Nate was always

543
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:08,320
different so but he wasn't always so sad there was a sadness to Nate did the kids appreciate this

544
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,840
they'll tell they don't remember this at all it was subtle and it was subtle in a way that

545
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,160
sometimes I don't even know if it was I don't know what it was it was just everything in me

546
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,680
said something's wrong and I know everything in him I got his like I found his journals after he

547
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,480
passed and a lot of them were like you've got to be more connected you're gonna find joy again

548
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:37,040
there's nothing wrong with you keep going you know just try harder like very much self-talk

549
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,880
trying to get out of whatever he was in how long after he died did you find the journal

550
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:50,080
very soon did you read it right away did you hesitate for a moment were you worried about

551
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,520
what you would find no the one thing about Nate and I was like I never I didn't feel like he hit

552
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,200
anything from no not not that he was hiding anything from you but were you afraid that you

553
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,120
might see that he was in a pain that you didn't appreciate I feel that I didn't I wasn't worried

554
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:14,000
about that then because I didn't know what I know now I honestly didn't know how sick he was

555
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,600
once I found out I was devastated because I was so mean I was mean I was I did I didn't know what

556
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,800
was wrong with him and so I wish I could and I wish I could go back and be kinder but I had no

557
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,720
clue and he was somebody who just was like he wouldn't put it on me he would just deal with it

558
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,920
on his own so I wish I could have if I had known he was so sick I would have been much kinder much

559
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:46,160
kinder so no I didn't I don't I don't really know what I felt at the time I would be making it up

560
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,960
if I said it just felt like I was losing my husband and he seemed different from all the other husbands

561
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,120
he seemed older and tireder quickly that's the thing like I remember Tony and he were it was

562
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,600
Halloween right before he died and I remember thinking like why does Tony look so young and

563
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:08,320
vibrant and Nate looks so tired and exhausted and there's a thousand reasons why now that now we

564
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,920
know but so you're going to keep going with the Jamaica story yeah so it's it's so it's early

565
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,120
November of 2017 and you don't want to go on this trip right so we go to New York about a month before

566
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,680
for a birthday and I have probably the biggest and the last panic one of the last panic attacks that

567
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,680
I've had of my life and I just said Nate I can't go to Jamaica and and he takes his sleep at me a

568
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,640
mask off and we're in midtown you know and he's like listen you lunatic you're going on this trip

569
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,600
you need to live you need to learn to live fearlessly like you have all these gifts and you are

570
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,800
trapped in our house and in all this fear and it's time for you to go and I want you to go on that

571
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,320
trip and I want you to come back changed and and and he's and he never told me what to do he was

572
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,040
very supportive but he was like this is a non-negotiable if we're gonna make it I cannot

573
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:05,040
live with this anymore you are fine we are good I promise you everything's okay and he was serious

574
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,520
like I he was very rarely serious but he was like you're going like I'm not we're not doing this

575
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,760
and so the weekend of November 8th I he took me to the airport and he never took me to the airport

576
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,440
because the guy loved to sleep and so it was an early flight but he's like I want to drive you

577
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,520
which was very out of character for him he don't he had no problem putting his wife in an uber

578
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:32,160
zero zero he'd be like good luck you're good so I remember we could even call the uber right yeah

579
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,320
he would do everything jerk um so we were driving to the airport and I remember I was texting with

580
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,200
Toby because she was we got so long story short we got invited to go to this event in Jamaica it

581
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,520
was like a spiritual retreat Wim Hof Steven Cutler um Marissa Peers Jim Quick great speakers people

582
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,480
doing great things and Toby through their relationship Tony and Toby's with Vision we got

583
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,240
to go to this event called a fest and it's a it's a three or four day event twice a year where you

584
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,320
go and you just talk to people that are doing great things and look into your stuff and hear

585
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:10,480
great speakers so I I'm texting Toby and Nate grabs my hand and he never did this and he was

586
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:17,120
like can you put your phone down can you just put your phone down this will break me and he said

587
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,880
just I just want to be with you I just want to be with you for this next five minutes until we get

588
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,840
out and then you can text her and so we just held hands and he drove you know he drove me to the

589
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,160
terminal and he just said like you're the most amazing woman I've ever met in my life he's like

590
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,080
I've never met anybody like you wow I'm really crying um he said but I just want you to know I

591
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:41,360
love you more than anything and I hope you go have fun and that you come back a better person and

592
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,920
ready to do what I know you're meant to do and I don't want you to worry about anything because we

593
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:53,120
are going to be fine and you know I just I love you so much so go have fun and we kissed and I

594
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,760
went on and of course because I've always been very cheap I decided not to get the talk plan

595
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,880
in Jamaica so we just texted for four days the most beautiful text you could ever imagine

596
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,560
just about what I was learning and how supportive he was and he was like you're doing so great this

597
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,000
is awesome I was like I'm going to be different I'm going to move more during sex it's going to

598
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,040
be great like you're going to love this and then it was the last day and I remember Wim Hof had

599
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,840
just spoken and his wife had died when she was young and he was left with four kids and I remember

600
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,120
thinking like that would suck that would suck so bad if your spouse left especially a good one you

601
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,960
know so I went and I got in the water and I was swimming because we had one more event it was like

602
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,040
a bike a boat a boat excursion I remember I was swimming in the water and I felt like I felt the

603
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,920
divine all around me and I remember thinking like everything's changed like everything's changed

604
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,120
like I get it now like I don't need to be afraid I could breathe and I thought to myself I can't

605
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,440
wait to tell Nate he's going to be so happy and if you knew the time I was swimming in the water

606
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,640
and you knew what was happening in Los Angeles it would blow your mind so I got out of the water

607
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,200
and I was still in my suit put on some jean shorts and I was getting ready to go smoke some

608
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,160
Jamaican weed and get on a boat and just you know be the new Kelsey just like in the moment

609
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,200
and my phone rang a couple times and it was a number I didn't know and I was like not today

610
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:23,840
you know I'm in Jamaica doing the thing and then my best friend called and she said listen

611
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,160
I don't want you to do the Kelsey I don't want you to freak out and she said but Nate was at

612
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:37,520
Skyzone Trampoline Park and he fell and we don't really know what happened we're gonna go your

613
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,960
your brother-in-law's gonna go get the kids and your mom's heading over to UCLA but everything's

614
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,040
fine go on to the boat and I remember I just took a breath and I was like he's dead and she's like

615
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:56,880
he's not dead and everything Peter in my body knew that man was gone like everything and so I

616
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,040
felt like I was just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to what I already knew which

617
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,240
was this was the thing because I also when I got to Jamaica all my anxiety went away it was almost

618
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,240
like sliding doors and once I made the decision to go on that trip this was this was what was

619
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,480
going to happen and I assumed that if Nate was smart he knows if I'd been there I'd have been

620
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:22,800
like you don't die on me like I would have been crazy so on some level I think he waited till the

621
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,360
last day because I had gotten all the information and I'd met all the people and so many of the

622
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,280
people from Jamaica have been super influential in my recovery and my grief work and some of the

623
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,320
psychedelic things and so I told Toby I was like we're going to the airport she's like this is

624
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,400
ridiculous everything's fine and I was like I didn't even I wasn't even talking I was just like

625
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,880
packing and I was like get me there was one one flight and I was like get us to the airport and

626
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:55,200
so we were driving down this Jamaican road with like potholes and I was in a taxi and the phone

627
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,040
rang and I knew it it was my mom and she said the doctor would like to speak with you and I took the

628
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,920
phone and he said I'm so sorry Mrs. Chittick we tried everything we worked on him for 50 minutes

629
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:12,960
because he looks so young but he didn't make it and I remember I said you know is he dead and he

630
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,640
said your husband had a heart attack and I said is my husband dead and he said yes Nate is dead

631
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,560
and then I just said to them with no emotion he's dead and Toby was like who's dead and I was like

632
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:33,760
Nate's dead and she screamed and and then began what would be the most transformative painful

633
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:40,240
and probably beautiful last four and a half years of my life. So how long did it take you to get back

634
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,320
to LA? So there was one plane going back to the US that day so it was late Saturday night and I

635
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,160
knew I had to get home to my kids because they didn't know and I really didn't even know what

636
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,480
they'd seen and that's another discussion we'll get into because I didn't really know there's a

637
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,200
million things around that but they thought that he had fallen but as they now we I know more about

638
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,440
what they thought but there was one seat left and when I got to the airport they were like you

639
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,640
there's not enough time it was like 20 minutes the door was shut and through a thousand miracles and

640
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,200
I will say and I tell this to people all the time in your biggest challenges and crises there are

641
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,960
angels literally all around you I mean I've envisioned them just God gives you or whatever

642
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:30,320
you believe that the people show up for you and it is miraculous so this one baggage claim guy

643
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,520
was like just hold on and somehow he talked to them and it's in Jamaica two people a little more

644
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,080
laid back and they opened the door which I really didn't think was ever humanly possible I think

645
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:44,720
it's like the one thing I've never seen happen in life like they're like nope it's an FAA command

646
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:53,600
exactly so I got on the plane and I had the last seat I was in an aisle and I went into shock and

647
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,200
you know much more about the brain than I do but I remember thinking oh shit this is like what you

648
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,320
see on tv when the woman's kid dies and she like just falls apart and I felt like I was having a

649
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,400
break with reality so I started throwing up in a little white bag and I was hyperventilating I

650
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,520
couldn't I couldn't come back to I couldn't integrate it I'd never had had an experience

651
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,640
where you you thought you were going crazy and so nobody talked to me at all which I wouldn't

652
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,600
have talked to me now I always talk to people when I see them like that but I think they were like

653
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:26,080
enjoying their honeymoon or their girl strip and they're like lunatic you know in aisle seven like

654
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:34,240
get away from her so I just I panicked for about 20 minutes and then the um the seat belt sign went

655
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,360
and all of a sudden there's this beautiful Jamaican woman in this gorgeous dress and she's

656
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,000
standing next to me in the row in the aisle and she puts her hand on my shoulder and she puts a

657
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,360
hand on my forehead and she says baby girl I don't know what you're going through or what awaits you

658
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,640
on the other side of this plane but I want you to know that there are so many people praying for you

659
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,840
and God loves you and I love you and you are stronger than you think and she said um

660
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,920
she said slow your breathing down baby girl and decide who you want to be when you land

661
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:16,080
when this plane lands and I don't know what it was but I it recalibrated my breathing

662
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:22,800
and she kind of just patted my shoulder she left and then I actually spent the next four hours on

663
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:28,080
that flight the layover in Texas and then the flight home deciding hopefully who I would be

664
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,680
you know a week from now a month from now five years from now ten years from now because

665
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,960
on that plane ride I would got really clear that they had just lost their dad but they

666
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:48,560
weren't going to lose me and that kind of became my north star from then on and I got home

667
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,800
I went to my mother-in-law my mom picked me up probably the worst drive you could ever imagine

668
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,160
from LAX at about midnight and I went to my friend's house and do you want me to go into

669
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,560
this part yeah this is the part that you just you can't make it better but I got to my friend's

670
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,720
house where my kids were they were nine and twelve at the time and they had been waiting all day and

671
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,200
I had lied to them and they said is dad okay and I had said over facetime you know he's not doing

672
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,720
well but you know let's just keep praying for him and I because I couldn't bear to tell them over

673
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,800
the phone I had to be there and so now it's funny because we joke about that like you lied about

674
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:31,120
really big things I'm like I know I did but I I've admitted to it so I got there and I gave them

675
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,520
both a hug and I asked everybody to leave and I just said I said three things I said

676
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,280
your father would have never left us if we weren't going to be okay it just wasn't his style

677
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,080
do you understand me and they nodded no yes mom and then I said um I need you to know that I'm

678
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,800
enough I have no idea how I'm going to do this I don't know how to live life without your father

679
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,480
I don't know how to raise you guys without your father but I'm certain I'm going to figure it out

680
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,440
and we're going to have a great life and you guys need to stay being nine and twelve and don't need

681
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:12,160
to worry about anything because I've got this do you understand I said yes mom and then I said the

682
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,280
most important thing I need you to know is that you are not victims that you had the best father

683
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,320
for nine and twelve years and he focused all of his energy on you he loved you with everything he

684
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,680
had he was the kindest most patient amazing human being I've ever met and some kids don't get that

685
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,520
for a day so just always remember that you're the lucky ones do you understand they were like

686
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,880
yes mom and then I asked them both and they were tiny and I said what do you guys need

687
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,640
from me and they said if you're okay we're okay and so I mean I tell every mother like you would

688
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:51,440
become okay too um and that's what we've done we kind of from that point on fought for joy

689
01:01:52,480 --> 01:02:01,760
while acknowledging excruciating pain and doing it at the same time now the days got pretty dark

690
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:09,200
oh yeah the first two years were just brutal brutal tell me about the lowest lows

691
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,680
I think the first night if you've ever lost someone suddenly you feel like you've been set on fire

692
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:21,280
I can't explain the physical pain of grief I always thought it was mental but um grief is

693
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:27,120
grief and trauma is very physical um you want to get out of your body you know I never understood

694
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:33,200
why people cut I never understood why you I never understood suicide I never understood

695
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:41,360
you know drive people driving into trees when the pain is so big you have no way to describe it and

696
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,880
I had tons of resources and love and support and I still thought like this isn't going to work

697
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,840
um the beginning was surreal and I just it's it's hard to imagine how you're going to live in a

698
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:57,760
world that so quickly becomes a planet you've never been on um he was everything to us like he

699
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:06,240
was he was he was the guy um I didn't even know an adult life without him in it and he was a much

700
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,960
better parent than me in a thousand ways so I knew early on like we had a huge deficit when it came

701
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:17,680
to honesty spirituality kindness service he was just exceptional I was great at like scheduling

702
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,440
carpools and I was like well shit that's not going to lead to like a good kid you know that

703
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:29,840
we've got problems here um and I think when the numbness wore off of like the the memorials over

704
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:37,760
and there was a thousand hard times I think the morgue was exceptionally awful to go see him and

705
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:44,160
see him dead which you didn't want to do at all you fought like hell not to yeah I mean I remember

706
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,960
thinking like what are you fucking kidding me I'm not going to go see I'm not going to say goodbye

707
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:53,200
to my husband dead like I thought it was insane that someone would offer that um by the grace of

708
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,760
god and I this is I don't have much advice about anything but if people have been through it trust

709
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:02,400
them they know this and I had another angel that was like you have to go say goodbye to your husband

710
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:09,600
and I had probably one of the most beautiful experiences um because I I got some closure that

711
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:15,040
I never thought I would get and I have a great story of when I went to the morgue and and I

712
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:21,200
was an awful experience and there was police and there's nurses and they pulled him out of a freezer

713
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,680
and he's just laying there and he has he's still intubated but somehow all that fades away and I

714
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,440
just started to talk to him and my best friend was there and I talked to him for about 10 or 15

715
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,600
minutes just told him how much I loved him and how grateful I was and how you know I would do the

716
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:40,800
best for him and the kids and then when I got up my I asked my best friend like how'd it go and she's

717
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,600
like reminded me a lot of real life you just talked at him for a long time and he just stared

718
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:51,920
at you kindly and it's like that's so true um so the morgue was tough the corners was awful

719
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,920
death is such a business and there's the legality and the do they ask you if you would like an

720
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:04,640
autopsy given that no foul play it's so when you know when you die in a public place in LA you have

721
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:12,000
to do it I see you have to do a autopsy so that was on the books from the beginning um I think the

722
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,600
at about six months I thought this won't work and I've never had when you say this life yeah I've

723
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,400
never had suicidal thoughts I've been depressed I've been down I've been anxious but I never thought

724
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:32,480
like how do we get out of here did you ever find yourself thinking like these kids now are the

725
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,320
greatest thing I have and they're my anchor to him but they're also kind of the anchor that's

726
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:41,440
holding me to this earth like it's a very different calculation to think about ending your life with

727
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,440
kids versus without well my mom used to always tell you the one thing you lose once you have

728
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,520
kids is the right to kill yourself she used to say that all the time she's like you know what else

729
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,040
you can't even kill yourself once you have them because it wouldn't be fair to them and I remember

730
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,400
thinking that but I also remember thinking I want to take them with me I remember thinking like we

731
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,840
got to get to him there was this a couple nights where I thought so this isn't going to work I've

732
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:12,560
tried everything this doesn't work I feel lost I'm I'm so broken I'm so scared emotionally spiritually

733
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:20,720
physically financially I didn't know how we were going to do it and so I I ended up I mean I people

734
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,720
talk about this in the chapter but I ended up just saying like I'm going to talk to my son because I

735
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,720
knew he was 12 and I knew he was in a bad spot so why don't tell me about that tell me about like

736
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:38,480
what you saw in both of them over that six month period of time just like I mean if you have kids

737
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,480
just especially I'm guessing like after Christmas right so it was my guess is it's a blur through

738
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,720
Thanksgiving and Christmas hell yeah and then January so dark dark in every way like it's

739
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:54,640
January is dark to begin with but when you've lost the person that you worshiped and the person that

740
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:01,680
kind of was the light in our family like he was just he was great he was a great dad they were so

741
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:09,360
sad and confused and just a different level of sad like the saddest like they just got screwed

742
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,120
for their whole lives and they'll never be normal again and kids just want to be normal and they

743
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,360
want to go to school and they don't want to be the person that's dealing with the great tragedy

744
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,680
they were embarrassed they were how do you know that they would say it's just like the worst to

745
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:29,680
not have a dad it's so embarrassing not to have a dad you know like it's just awful and like

746
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,120
nobody will talk to me Jack says no one he says no one makes fun of me anymore no one jokes with me

747
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:40,800
parents look down when I walk past them he said everyone avoids me so because you don't know what

748
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,840
to say and then there's always the kids who the parent was like you go say something to them and

749
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:48,640
they're like sorry your dad died you know or something like that but we just I couldn't we'd

750
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,040
done a bunch of counseling wasn't working at the time we couldn't find the right fit for everybody

751
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,600
and I've learned a lot about trauma since then but I think it was a little early for the kids to

752
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:02,080
be forced to talk about it and I don't know if you've read what happened to you the Oprah Winfrey

753
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:08,080
book with Bruce I don't know who I don't know but she talks about like kids it takes a while for them

754
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,480
to even be able to process what they saw and felt whereas adults we have enough life experience to

755
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,200
to be able to talk about it but watching their dad die it wasn't something they could talk about but

756
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,280
I kept trying to force them to do counseling and be like tell us about the day your dad died and

757
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,760
they would just you know they would close their ears literally physically and rock and I'd be like

758
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,920
I am we are gonna talk about this so I did a lot of things that I thought it's really interesting

759
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,000
they would literally react that way like a baby like they would go like like I can't hear you I

760
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,960
can't hear you and what did the therapist think of that did they recognize that as a sign that they

761
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,040
just weren't ready to talk about this yeah yeah I mean eventually eventually but they would do

762
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,320
things like and I don't want to say stupid things but like my daughter didn't want to draw about it

763
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:54,000
she didn't want to like take a crayon and show her dad dying at Skyzone she really needed to

764
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:00,000
forget about it for a bit to integrate what she saw my son's a little more mature and he really

765
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,680
needed someone to talk to other than me like he needed someone who didn't have a dog in the fight

766
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,240
to talk about what it felt like to lose his dad so he actually over time had a great relationship

767
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:15,040
with a therapist for a year and then as the 40 year old that he is inside at the end he was like

768
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,600
I think I'm done for now thank you so much for helping I'll call you if I need you again but Jack

769
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,160
really had a clear intention at that age of what he needed through this and he said it's just nice

770
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,720
to go talk to a woman that will listen to me and that was a dig at me because he's like all you do

771
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:36,400
is talk to me but there was just a night that I thought like we gotta go Jack like we gotta we

772
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,720
gotta get to dad and so I said you know Jack I'm thinking about killing all of us in tongue and

773
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,600
cheek which we use a lot of laughter and Jack was like tell me how we're gonna die mom and I

774
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,280
was like well there's so many different ways but I think the best one is that I'm gonna drown you

775
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:54,880
guys in the tub he's a great he's how old at this point he's 13 and he's like four inches taller

776
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,600
than me um he's like but you only let us fill that you know there's a drought in LA so you only let

777
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,520
us fill it up like two inches and he's like I'm so much stronger than you I'm like I know but it's

778
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:09,200
I'm gonna do the best I can he's like okay good luck and it the more we talked about the stuff

779
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,520
and the more we laughed the better it got and then a couple weeks later Jack said you know mom I

780
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:20,080
I if I had a gun I would kill myself and I said you know I totally get it I didn't say like that's

781
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:26,640
awful don't do it because I understood and I just remember thinking was well we just won't have guns

782
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,080
in our house that's what we never did but I I remember thinking I know how to avoid this

783
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,840
and I said just hang on for today and then tomorrow and little by little like he's like

784
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:42,800
I don't think I want to kill myself anymore um so we navigated through that the first year was just

785
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:49,120
the crying at night and the nights are really dark when you have grief and when you have little kids

786
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,520
because they need so much because they are at night is when everybody whether you're an adult

787
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,440
I don't know I mean I wake up in the middle of the night or I used to quite a bit with just terrible

788
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:02,880
anxiety and their fear was so big and I just didn't think I had enough energy to be there for them

789
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:10,320
on my own how were you sleeping I mean I don't remember I don't remember sleeping the first

790
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,720
year very much because I was always somebody always needed something the first year at nights

791
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,680
such as meeting the kids themselves somebody somebody would be crying somebody would be

792
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:26,560
losing it someone would be um not well and you slept in three different rooms well a lot many

793
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:34,240
times we slept together um my daughter slept with me for a long time after he died and just she

794
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,480
wanted to crawl back in my uterus like I thought to myself like I'll never be able to leave the house

795
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,960
again like my life's over I'll never be able to have fun again I'll never be happy again

796
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:50,720
but amongst all of that I also thought we're gonna be okay like there wasn't it was it under

797
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,760
there was a knowing somewhere that like this was just part of it but it wasn't always going to be

798
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,440
this way but it felt like it was always going to be this way so I toggled through hopefulness and

799
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:08,240
just devastation but I knew we needed to hold on to the fact that this was appropriate and it

800
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:14,080
wouldn't last forever like there we were built to last like humans are built to last we aren't the

801
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,520
first people who lost their father I think our generation hasn't lost as many people as generations

802
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,240
before so it's just much more rare for us and it's more shocking but this has been happening

803
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,280
yeah it's interesting you say that like you sort of imagine

804
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,640
let's just go back in time 10,000 years not that far but just 10,000 years perfect and it's

805
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,800
basically the same thing it's you and Nate and the kids um you know you're hunter gatherers so

806
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,800
it's a little different you don't have electricity and all that stuff but there's certainly a scenario

807
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,000
in which Nate gets an infection and dies there's a scenario in which an animal attacks him I mean

808
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,640
like as you said it's not that uncommon that this would happen knowing what you know now I mean I've

809
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:58,240
ever thought about it this way but do you get the sense that the the calcium 10,000 years ago would

810
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,040
have had an easier time with this and if so would it have been because of expectations or would it

811
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,080
been have been because of the community that you would have been stuck with like you wouldn't have

812
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:13,360
had your own house for example both I think the expectation that now everybody lives till they're

813
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,760
90 happily ever after married with two kids and a mom and a dad that expectation has set us up to

814
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:26,960
be much much less resilient because there's this like one way and it's um it's all about joy and

815
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:34,480
fun whereas I think 10,000 years ago you saw people recover all the time from awful things babies died

816
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:41,760
and people went to war and there was famine we have so much now that our anxiety is higher than

817
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,080
ever before and I I felt that way before he died because when everything as opposed to being really

818
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,720
joyful when you have so counterintuitive isn't it yeah yeah because now you have everything you

819
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,240
don't want it to you don't want to fall apart whereas back then they were like well shit this

820
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,280
is this isn't that good so whatever I can handle things we just don't handle things and we don't

821
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,920
we're not used to feeling extremely uncomfortable anymore life is so comfortable things are so easy

822
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,920
not for everybody obviously for people with resources well I mean I think for everybody

823
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,760
compared to 10,000 years ago 100 percent yeah and this idea that pain is bad and death is bad and

824
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,400
that's a whole discussion you know now I have a completely different relationship with death

825
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,760
I have a completely different relationship with what it means for the physical body to leave

826
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:31,840
and that Nate isn't gone and we didn't get screwed and there wasn't a right time for him to leave or

827
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:37,200
not so there's so many nuances that through the last four and a half years have changed the way I

828
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:42,880
feel I'm still toggling between all the different ideas around grief you know there's a whole like

829
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,200
my mother-in-law believes like I will grieve forever I will grieve forever and that's just

830
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,320
how it is and our country wants everyone to be happy and I'm not happy and I'm like that's fine

831
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:58,560
and that's a choice I personally now believe again I'm back to this the football analogy holding

832
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:06,000
two beliefs at the same time I can be grieving very deeply and very grateful at the same time

833
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,080
they don't have to be one you don't go through one stage at the other I miss Nate terribly and I am

834
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:19,760
so happy I don't know what to tell you I'm happier than I've ever been in my life and I've been

835
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,280
through the worst thing ever and then I had some medical stuff just I think that came up from grief

836
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:31,600
and all the things that I was most afraid of I've made it through and I am so excited about life

837
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:39,360
so I don't know so how long after Nate died did you get the autopsy results back

838
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,760
so we got the heart part which is so he died of cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle

839
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,160
and the doctor called and just said we could tell right away he was a football player

840
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:57,360
his heart was so stretched out it was so big and he said listen mrs cheddar you you want all big

841
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,640
muscles just not a big heart nobody needs to have a big heart physically you can have it spiritually

842
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,480
but you don't want a huge heart and he said when big men move that much weight around at that speed

843
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:15,440
it just it's it overuses it and the muscle just gives out he said big men and big animals die

844
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:25,680
early and he said he was 98% blocked in all of his arteries and basically his left ventricle just

845
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:30,400
had no more give so he explained it to me as a water balloon that had just been stretched out

846
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,600
and there was just no pump anymore and he said big fat people can live a long time if they sit

847
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:41,120
all day and watch tv but if you're out playing football at thanksgiving and you know on the

848
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:45,680
treadmill yeah and Ronnie he would run the beach and jump on the trampoline he's like your heart

849
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:49,760
doesn't do that he said your your husband had a huge i mean i love on his autopsy it said he died

850
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,920
of a enlarged heart which i just think is beautiful because he had a really big heart

851
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,120
put that on the tombstone exactly yeah that's true that's true so that was um about three months

852
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:05,520
after he died and then and did they also look at his brain presumably they didn't they did

853
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,480
but they didn't have the right tools so they're like i don't we didn't see anything i'm like well

854
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,320
what did you do i mean it's la county morgue or corners i don't they don't think they have the

855
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,240
equipment so when did it first occur to you to maybe get the people at boston university involved

856
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,480
we had just started to talk about this a couple years before and i'd gotten like the pamphlet from

857
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:30,160
the nfl that said you know whatever the players benefits and there'd been a lot of talk i hadn't

858
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:38,720
watched um concussion yet with will smith i have since then but i i knew and i if i'm being

859
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,560
completely honest i thought oh well maybe there'll be some compensation financially if he did have

860
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,360
ct but i'm sure i don't know if he did or i don't know but i want to make sure because it would

861
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:54,320
depend on whether i'd let jack play because he was going to loyola and he was gonna play football

862
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,280
most likely so i said i need to know if football had anything to do with it the heart thing pretty

863
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,160
much sealed the deal but i was like i wonder what was going on with nate's brain so boston

864
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:11,200
university was exceptional dr maki was exceptional lisa the whole group there is phenomenal and so uh

865
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:16,800
la corners sent his brain tissue and they coordinated it with boston and they went they

866
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,320
said it'll be about a year because we're gonna do a um we're gonna i don't i'm using the wrong words

867
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,760
we're like pathological and do interviews yeah the clinical clinical yep and so we're gonna

868
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,880
interview everybody and talk about it and his parents had an even more feeling of him

869
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,120
floating away and being different as did his brother and i think i lived day to day with

870
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,280
him so it's harder to tell the the changes because they were so gradual where did his brother live

871
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:47,440
he lives in l.a so we saw him a lot and the irony is his brother is just an exceptional been sober

872
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:53,200
14 years but for so long we were trying to keep luke alive and it was just the way that it switched

873
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:58,320
and nate was gone and luke is still here in a huge huge part of our life but luke said he felt

874
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,720
the same way like there was a floating away and his mom especially was like he is not the son

875
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:10,400
i knew five years how long did she feel that five years five years five years and his dad his dad

876
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:15,840
just a kind man he teaches he he said um he doesn't really know how he felt or he doesn't remember

877
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,360
but he knew that something was different about his son but he can't put his finger on it

878
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:28,800
um so about a year later um a little bit no maybe like nine months we got a call and um

879
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,800
honestly i didn't know i didn't know what they were going to say but i didn't think they were

880
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,680
going to say what they said and uh dr maki got on the phone and just said i'm i'm sorry to tell you

881
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:45,120
but you know nate had stage two almost stage three uh cte he has lesions all over his brain and um

882
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,880
i just want you to know that that would have been a really hard life

883
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,600
so you know part of my ability to be in gratitude where a lot of other families that have football

884
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,240
players aren't is that i don't have to live with a man that's slowly deteriorating before my eyes

885
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:06,800
there are tons of people who have husbands that are healthy heart-wise but not brain-wise

886
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,760
so that's where it gets tricky and that's where i continue to talk about it but again

887
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,880
and you know for people to sort of understand what stage two and stage three is i mean junior say

888
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,400
i was stage two when he killed himself erin hernandez was stage three when he killed himself

889
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,960
and you know if you looked at them from the outside notwithstanding sort of the criminal

890
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,200
side of what was going on with erin you know they could tie their shoes and walk around so you

891
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,560
wouldn't look at them and say well they're you know they don't look like someone who's in the

892
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,600
last stages of alzheimer's disease but if you understand their behavior their moods and what

893
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,880
people who are around them would say and of course in the case of hernandez his behaviors

894
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:52,880
leading up to everything um they weren't you know they were clearly not behaving the way they

895
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,600
would have behaved if everything was totally normal yeah i had seen junior say i had a party

896
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:04,080
about um because we used to live in san diego and um there's a good friend of ours who's a

897
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,200
very close friend of his and it was his 70th birthday and this was about a month before he

898
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:12,320
killed himself and i remember like just he looked perfectly normal like everything was perfectly

899
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:18,160
you know it's just great to see him and everything seemed totally fine and i couldn't

900
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,760
believe it a month later yeah that's the thing about this disease and i think it's why it causes

901
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:27,360
so much um discussion and disagreements and i mean i debate this with football guys all the time

902
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,680
and then i debate it with the other side which is my mother and mother-in-law they're like it's

903
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:35,360
football is the devil and then all the people that we love that are like listen it's the name of the

904
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:41,440
game you know signing up for it um i don't it's again so at times although you know you could

905
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:46,320
push back on that and say maybe that's true today was it true when they signed up for it

906
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,680
yeah meaning nate's generation yeah i don't think anybody talked about it i don't think everybody

907
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:56,240
was lying about it for a really long time and and now it's interesting i mean just to fast forward

908
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:01,440
there is no compensation anymore for cde and i'm i'm making this up so don't see me but i i would

909
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:07,120
think it's because anybody that dies that's played in the nfl probably has some level after the number

910
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:14,560
of hits you take um i don't know what to do i i cannot imagine living with nate the greatest man

911
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:20,160
i ever knew with a severe brain disease that would either put us at risk or him at risk

912
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:28,080
or at at 42 i mean that's young that's very young i mean did the folks at bu i don't know much about

913
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:35,840
cte um did the folks there say based on what we saw pathologically this was what the next 10 years

914
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,080
would have looked like i mean or this was the next five like could they tell you this is the rate at

915
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,360
which this progresses and this is what you were in store for the next five years we never got into

916
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,440
that but they said they would give you the list of symptoms of what it would look like and a lot of

917
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:56,720
it was already there with nate depression um increased drinking wanting to be alone fatigue

918
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:04,240
big outbursts you know anger i mean nate never yelled at me in 21 years i mean he we we got after

919
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:09,360
it in arguments but he never was mean and i remember i messed up like the internet or some

920
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,680
spectrum thing and he was like what the hell's wrong with you like i told you to fix internet

921
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,360
and i remember we both looked at each other and he was like sorry and i was like whoa

922
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:25,440
i just had never heard him snap and that stuff i think what dr maki was saying is that would have

923
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,880
increased because if you look at their brain scans they're just dead spots or like the lesions look

924
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,920
like they're just like sitting on that brain and nothing's firing there or it's firing incorrectly

925
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,760
it's not like ct makes you nicer you know you know like some people have to mention they're kinder

926
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,720
it's not that way um this is one of the trickiest things how did you tell the kids about that

927
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:53,120
i told was there solace in that i mean was that they do not find any solace in it which is

928
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:59,120
interesting because you obviously do i do a ton they do not they go they'll be like mom please

929
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,480
like okay we know he had ct but he's still dead we'd rather him be here they have no

930
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:10,160
my son always says like mom please stop telling people we're lucky he hates it is it possible that

931
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:17,680
he didn't witness what you witnessed in other words he never saw that his dad was deteriorating

932
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:22,400
hundred percent and i think he was little and he worshipped his dad he was just 12 you know he was

933
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:29,600
in sixth grade um i don't think any he was their hero he they he he never did anything wrong in

934
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,480
their eyes he was the best so they are like i don't know what what story you're making up about

935
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:40,640
this cte thing but that's i don't we can't even comprehend dad not being dad um so i try to honor

936
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:45,680
that now because yeah but i will say what jack did honor was i'll never play football and there

937
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,880
was something in my son's eyes that was grateful he didn't have to he won't admit that but i promise

938
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:58,240
you when he's 40 he'll tell you i didn't want to go do that sport yeah he loves it i mean he was

939
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,080
i've never seen a kid so happy last night is that when the rams won he loves being a part of

940
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:07,840
football he loves football he loves watching it we have great discussions around this in our home

941
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,200
they just don't like when i say we're lucky because we didn't have to see him sick

942
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:18,400
because in their world they're like we would rather so how long after nate died did you have

943
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,800
a good night's sleep without medication that's interesting we'll talk about psychedelics at the

944
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,720
same time but i you know the first couple weeks people like you need xanax you need ambian i'd

945
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:33,200
never taken anything and i remember i took them for about a week and i i woke up and i was like

946
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:38,640
god i feel so far away from everything and that was the first experience i had of like traditional

947
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,960
medicine taking you away from your pain and other things bringing you to it so you can work through

948
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:48,160
it which we'll discuss but yeah the exact opposite right yeah the exact opposite which is mind

949
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:53,600
blowing i remember maybe seven or eight months and sleep became a really safe place for me

950
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:02,880
how long after nate died would you wake up and not have that nanosecond of forgetting what had

951
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,280
happened do you know that experience where yeah like the next day you wake up and there's probably

952
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,600
like two seconds when you don't know that that just happened and then it kind of comes crushing down

953
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,840
and then at some point that goes away and there's never a moment when you don't know it didn't happen

954
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:22,000
yeah maybe the last six months wow it was i wouldn't have imagined it could last that

955
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,280
it was jarring to be honest it still gets me sometimes and sometimes i'll lay in my bed and

956
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:33,280
be like nate just to practice saying his name because it's it's a surreal experience because

957
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:40,080
it's like um it's alter worlds there's just no sudden death i think it's just you know everyone

958
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:44,240
asks that oh would you rather be sick or would you rather you know die suddenly i love the games we

959
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:49,840
play with people grieving which again do you think 10 000 years ago they sat around the fire

960
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:55,920
ever playing cancer or die in front of you i'd rather get killed by a saber tooth tiger immediately

961
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,760
or fall out of the tree break your femur and exsanguinate over the next two days then get an

962
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,000
infection and then die a month later that's exactly what people ask me all the time you know i don't

963
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,200
i still i can believe it completely and i still can't believe it i don't wake up shocked anymore

964
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:18,080
i don't have the pit in my stomach the deep um shock and grief is gone it's probably been gone since

965
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:25,920
around four years so i'm a couple months i maybe even three and a half there started to be some

966
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:34,560
space that some type of new neuro pathways that we lived in now were becoming not as worn but

967
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,040
as comfortable as the old ones were of the reality he lived in so for a while it felt like

968
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:45,680
every neuro pathway ended with nate every time the door would open i would think of nate every time

969
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,720
we would eat dinner i would think of nate every time i put the kids to bed every time i'd get in

970
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:55,120
the car he was everywhere he was like it was like his shadow and over time the more things we did

971
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:02,080
the more traveling i did the more um new people i met things started firing differently people

972
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:07,040
that didn't know nate places that i hadn't gone with nate and as that happened it's almost like

973
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:13,200
my brain started to um adjust to a new world that didn't have a minute and then i could feel the

974
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:19,040
stress go down you know today we live in a world where you probably have a billion videos on your

975
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:24,960
phone of you and nate and the kids did you ever have to make a decision about the frequency with

976
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,520
which you would indulge in watching those versus putting a limit on it or saying i'm going to put

977
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,040
this in a box right i'm gonna i'm gonna allow myself to do this for an hour a day but i'm not

978
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,960
for the other 23 hours i'm gonna do something else i mean did you hundred is such a great

979
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,920
question because i we talk about that all the time in grief groups it's it's cutting you get your

980
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:47,120
iphone out and you just let it fly um a lot of what i've started to do recently and i i started

981
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:52,720
early on in some of the practices from the buddhist or is setting a time to feel my emotions were so

982
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:57,600
big for so long and i still work on that like being aware that my emotion is not me but it's

983
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,880
just coming through me but i actually get to close the door if i want and i can open it when

984
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,920
i want that has been a practice that's changed my life the past two years which is okay kelsey do

985
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,360
you want to right now um feel really sad and really kind of get your eyes swelled up and put on some

986
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:19,920
like chicago and just like really go through some videos okay i'm gonna give you seven minutes to

987
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,520
do that and i work seven i know well because for a while like my girlfriend would call at night

988
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,080
and i would just be like it's been hours it's been hours just going and you know and i forward

989
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:34,720
them to people and i just would want feedback like you remember this you remember this and i

990
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:39,840
i would imagine your friends might not even know what to do so because they'd be like wow i don't

991
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,400
want to deny that this happened i don't want to deny that this is special but i also don't want to

992
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,600
keep her head down yeah let her drown and they even get tired people that are supporting grieving

993
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,800
people get tired of being there and being like i know you miss them i know so there's a dance

994
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,760
of saying like and your good friends will be like enough like i think that's good like we've we've

995
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:06,320
been down that road for about an hour now um and even now like i feel like i know sort of how to

996
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:11,680
help people that are grieving because i felt it but i still it's still a very tricky thing um

997
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,800
i don't know how i feel about the videos i'm so grateful i have them my kids don't look at

998
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,800
pictures they don't like it yeah so i was gonna ask you how did the kids participate in that

999
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,120
kids are a great thing to have and they're exhausting to have during grief

1000
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:29,040
when you have kids and you're going through grief they keep you going in a regular life

1001
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:35,200
and at the same time you can't really grieve until they're gone and they do not like to see you sad

1002
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:41,600
but i i talked to a ton of people um who had lost parents when they were younger and i remember all

1003
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,560
of them were like just please don't if if only my mom had been okay it would have been great but we

1004
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:52,240
lost my dad and then we lost my mom too because she never got happy again so i remembered that

1005
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,200
and in beginning i also felt like well my kids need to see that i'm really sad and show them how

1006
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:03,440
to grieve because there's that movement too but what i realize it's a very fine line kids do not

1007
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:09,280
like to see their parents sobbing it scares them so if i'm in a if i'm over in the corner shaking

1008
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:13,680
and crying and being like i miss your father it's not it doesn't feel safe for a nine and 12 year old

1009
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:20,320
do you think that kids are innately wired to move on from this quicker 100 my kids are exceptional

1010
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:27,520
and in talking to other parents who have lost a spouse do you think that's true not just for your

1011
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,560
kids but in general do you think that's true for kids that they are in that sense more wired to

1012
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,880
move on because they live in the present moment they haven't played out a whole future they don't

1013
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,840
know that they missed the wedding they don't know that he missed their graduation because they've

1014
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:47,200
never had graduation that's all in our heads i think that if you this is just what's worked for

1015
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,640
me if you create a home that is joyful and the person and the trauma is allowed to be spoken

1016
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:59,040
about when they want and that there is that it's not something bad that happened it's something

1017
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:05,440
that is we experienced and we get to decide how we want to tell the story i think kids can survive

1018
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:11,280
amazing things much better than adults because they don't have preconceived ideas so yeah i think

1019
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,960
kids are i think kids live in the moment too and if you're lucky enough i hit it right at the right

1020
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:20,480
age because kids become so self-consumed around 12 that their whole world becomes their friends

1021
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:26,880
and so once my kids kicked into that parents are kind of in the background like you're there but

1022
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,920
you're in the background of their lives and nate's alive in our house very much so so it's not

1023
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,320
something they also we talk about them all the time we still have pictures we have some i took

1024
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:45,600
down a lot because i realized too um it goes back to the videos you don't want to be you want to be

1025
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,280
careful with grief and pictures and videos that you let it in when it's the appropriate time

1026
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:56,160
because if not it can it can become all consuming so we definitely have a poster board of pictures

1027
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:03,520
but all the pictures in our house now mostly are of the kids and i and there's some of nate but

1028
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,400
it's not like and we have an area where we have a super bowl and we have a picture of the family

1029
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:15,360
where's his ring his ring is in the bank like the what's it called so deposit box yeah yeah

1030
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:20,320
you don't want to wear it around a neck no i don't want to like a nose ring or something no um yeah i

1031
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:24,720
think talking about it too my kids he's we talk about him all the time i'm like your dad would

1032
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,920
say and they get really pissed if i'm like your dad would be let down and they're like you don't

1033
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,160
know that so don't say it you don't get to pull that i was like i was just trying to get you um

1034
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:38,800
we laugh a lot about the way nate died say more about that i mean who dies at skyzone

1035
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,480
during toddler time wearing orange sticky socks i mean that's just ridiculous like you couldn't

1036
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,760
make that up i think he's the first person to ever die i know i'm not supposed to say skyzone for

1037
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,640
legal reasons or whatever but that's what i mean who does that like he's the first person in history

1038
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,080
to jump jump die at during during toddler time playing basketball with his kids it's just

1039
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:04,800
it's so bad it's good at least for a comic and for me and then i i think in the story i talk a lot he

1040
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,160
died on 11 11 at 11 which again i just was like thanks buddy like there's just a thousand nods to

1041
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:16,400
me it feels like that we're okay and that this thing's bigger than we think and that don't get

1042
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:22,160
your panties in a bunch like this is just death um it happens all the time i think that's the other

1043
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:26,960
thing the kids now we are we've been to enough grief things and enough grief camps that we we

1044
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,200
think we're like people are dying all the time nobody else knows it but it is unbelievable how

1045
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:38,160
many people are dying every day so there's a acceptance of death in our house that is probably

1046
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:46,080
very different than in other houses so how long after nate died did you have your first psychedelic

1047
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:54,160
experience so about nine months after and what was the lead up to that like how did you think

1048
01:34:54,160 --> 01:35:00,320
about going through that and what were you afraid of what were you hoping to get out of it so i had

1049
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:07,760
gone to this event in astonia and up the summer after nate died and a bunch of people were talking

1050
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:16,080
about psychedelics and i for grief work and a lot of trauma work and i had i i really didn't have any

1051
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:22,160
i i got to a point where i was doing better but i i needed to access nate like i had this deep

1052
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:26,560
desire to have a relationship with him and raise the kids with him even if he wasn't in this realm

1053
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,320
and i remember i was having a conversation i was like i just need to get to him

1054
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:36,720
because i know i believe that like the body went away but i don't i don't know where he is and i i

1055
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:41,440
can talk to god i feel great with my relationship with god um i just don't know how to get to him but

1056
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,440
i need to get to him because i was kind of starting to go crazy and this one guy was like have you

1057
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,400
ever done mushrooms and i was like no but my brother did a lot in high school and i would never

1058
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,720
and i don't like druggies and i think you guys are a bunch i'm very uptight and i

1059
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:00,080
have two glasses of wine and i'm not fun and don't even ask and i'm gonna keep judging you

1060
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:03,920
and i'm gonna judge you because that's what i do best and i'm gonna keep doing that because look

1061
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:10,160
where it got me um and then they were like have you ever tried MDMA and i was like this is all

1062
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:14,000
this is all ridiculousness because you guys are all exactly the kids i did not want to hang out

1063
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,480
with in high school because my experience was my brother's an addict my brother-in-law is an addict

1064
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:23,840
um oxy cotton and alcohol he's 14 years sober and then my my brother was just a partier you

1065
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,720
knew followed fish and the dead and i just remember him being like gonzo a lot of high school

1066
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:33,760
and so at some point i was talking to this this guy who'd done so many psychedelics i mean literally

1067
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,720
the guy was crazy he was like telling me about having sex in a thorn bush and i was like why am

1068
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:41,200
i even talking to this weirdo but i said you know i'm just not gonna do i'm never gonna try that

1069
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:45,520
stuff and he said why i said well i'm afraid i'm not i don't want to die like my kids just lost

1070
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,440
their dad i'm not gonna they're not gonna i'm not gonna jump off of a bridge after doing too many

1071
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:53,840
mushrooms and he's like but you're already dead because you're so afraid of everything and i was

1072
01:36:53,840 --> 01:37:03,360
like oh so i talked to a couple of our friends and i said listen i'll be ready when i'm ready

1073
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:09,280
and i mean there's this there's this saying in that community that says the plants you'll the

1074
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,120
plants will welcome you or you'll you'll know like it's not something you can force somebody to do

1075
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:20,960
you'll know when it's time and i got a call in october and of after he had died so almost a year

1076
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,680
and they said we're going to do this group with these shamans are are you interested and i remember

1077
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:32,480
it was very clear i could just hear it i was like i'm in and i would had probably a level 10 anxiety

1078
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:36,560
going into it because i had never done anything i mean i wasn't even a drinker really just always

1079
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:44,720
been an old-fashioned uptight fear-based neurotic person you're just classic and we get to this

1080
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:48,480
house and it would be beforehand the shamans called and just kind of asked me what would i

1081
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:52,480
wanted to work through and i said you know i have these couple of events that were very traumatic the

1082
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:58,400
morgue the coroner's telling my children i couldn't remember anything from the time i'd gotten the call

1083
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:05,600
um until i'd landed until after the plant journey so i had pretty much a whole story about getting

1084
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,920
on the airplane and the woman helping you i didn't know where i i don't i still can't remember where

1085
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:16,080
the layover was but i i couldn't remember a lot of that flight and so i knew there was some trauma

1086
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:22,320
there that had been blocked out and i thought well i better be able to access that so so she listened

1087
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:26,080
to it all and then we got together it was this beautiful group we talked about intention we

1088
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:30,400
talked about um you know what we hoped to get out of it everything opposite of what i thought it

1089
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:36,640
would be which was just like everyone popping pills and you know dancing to rave music and um just a

1090
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:41,280
good group of people i could just loving people supportive and i kind of shared what i was where

1091
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:48,160
i was at and they mean it's kind of a funny story so the first thing they gave me was well they gave

1092
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:53,040
me something and i took it and i had a full-blown panic attack and i raised my hand and i was like

1093
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,600
it's so i told you it's not working like i wanted out and she came over and was like we gave you a

1094
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:03,280
placebo because we knew that you like this this one the first hump was going to be a big one for

1095
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,760
you and she did kind of similar to what the woman on the plane did she put her hand on my head and

1096
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,960
i laid down and she actually breathed me through my panic attack and she said that wasn't anything

1097
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:20,720
now this is it and she said um just let it do its work and did you start with psilocybin or mdma i

1098
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:26,640
don't i i i think i started with i don't know they won't tell me the exact they wouldn't tell

1099
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:31,520
me exactly what and what and where but what i do know is i dropped it oh i remember we were all

1100
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:37,200
laying in a circle and everybody by then was kind of laying down and everyone someone said have you

1101
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,200
dropped in and i was like what what does it drop in like i don't know what does it mean to drop in

1102
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:47,120
and someone you're that annoying person that's like it's the worst no and our friend which you

1103
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:52,320
know but i will name nameless but he was like jesus christ like can we get this girl can you give

1104
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:58,320
her more um but i was like when are we gonna drop in everybody is anybody else dropped in

1105
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:04,560
and somebody was like you'll know when you drop in and i remember like three minutes later i was

1106
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:12,880
like i'm in like it was just so ridiculous um it was just so embarrassing and he was like oh god

1107
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:18,160
here we go babysit her all night um but within like three minutes i was back on the plane

1108
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:26,480
and i was but this time yeah i was back on the plane right then and i started to cry and i

1109
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:31,760
started to i was loud i mean my friend will tell me i was loud our friends were like you were loud

1110
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,560
the whole time um but all of a sudden everybody in the journey space kind of came and sat next to

1111
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:43,440
me and we kind of did the flight together and so i felt supported and so i cried and cried

1112
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,560
and i said this is so scary he's dead you know i went through the whole thing and they were like

1113
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,600
we're right here with you you're not alone we're right here you're safe look how strong you are

1114
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:58,880
you're going to your babies and it felt like six hours from what i know now that you know i we've

1115
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,040
talked about it it was probably like five or six minutes i did the whole flight again but with

1116
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:08,720
support and it was like that first thing was over and i had peace about it i remembered the whole

1117
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:15,280
thing i remembered what seat i was in i remembered you know transferring planes all that stuff and

1118
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:20,320
then i got up i got some water and i was like oh my god i'm not i thought i was going to be like

1119
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:25,920
drunk and crazy i was just regular again i woke up i got up i had i talked to some people i talked

1120
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,440
to the shamans and i remember they were like would you like are you going to go in again and i said

1121
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:35,360
yes and all i did was lay down again and this this whole process was insane to me that it was

1122
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:41,520
i could modulate my experience safely by my intention and whether i close my eyes or not

1123
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:46,640
i mean i was like this is not what i thought so then i revisited the morgue and i was really

1124
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:51,520
angry i had a ton of anger that he'd left me that i had never accessed i mean rage like you

1125
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:57,200
fucking left me at 40 you promised you wouldn't you're a liar you left me with a nine and 12 year

1126
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:03,120
old you bastard i told you to lose weight and i was furious i mean i remember just a rage i had never

1127
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:10,160
felt and you had never really gone through that stage of grief never in the previous year never

1128
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:15,440
been angry at him i just felt sad for him scared for him where is he hope he's okay he's terribly

1129
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:20,160
worried about my dead husband and everyone's like he's good focus on the people that are alive and

1130
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:25,920
at that moment i had all the anger i'd ever had for him for 20 years but mostly for leaving me

1131
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:31,920
because he had promised he wouldn't um furious to the point where my friend was like when you're

1132
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:37,200
down with it i think we're good like you've like we got it and you're also disrupting the whole

1133
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:43,440
group um did they take you to another so he took me up and then one of the facilitators came with

1134
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,640
me and i said would you mind oh because my friend had said why don't you go find nate like you've

1135
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,560
done the work you've gone through a bunch of things we're hours in at this point he said go

1136
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:58,720
go find nate see what he has to tell you because you you wanted to find him and peter no shit i

1137
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:04,160
went up there i laid down and one of the facilitators came in i said can you just remember whatever i

1138
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,800
say because i think it's going to be good and i need you to write it all down and fast forward at

1139
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,040
the in the next day the integration he's like it was too beautiful i couldn't remember anything i

1140
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:17,520
just sat there and listened i'm like oh my god but i remembered most so i laid down on the couch up

1141
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:23,600
by myself and i called for nate and i promised you he was just in front of my face and i know

1142
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,360
everybody's listening to this if you know me you think this is insane but this is exactly my

1143
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:33,600
experience nate was right there he's like i've never left and i said where did you go he's like

1144
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,240
i'm still here i just um my body wasn't serving me anymore and i said what do you mean he goes

1145
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,920
well look at this and he just took his whole body and just like threw it on the ground

1146
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,960
like it was closed and he's like i'm right here and the first thing he did was he showed me my

1147
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:54,400
kids and he said we all chose this they were born for this and the kids were kind of on a mountain

1148
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:59,440
like game of thrones and he's like they called for this we all agreed to this they're stronger

1149
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:05,200
than you think and then he gave me some like tips like he would have if he was here about

1150
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:10,320
how to kind of raise them and what they needed from me and he's like you need to slow down with

1151
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:16,560
adison or you need to just spend time one-on-one with jack like only things he would know and

1152
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:21,600
then he said the biggest thing is you've got to live fearlessly and he said i'm going to show you

1153
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:29,200
what it feels like and then we flew like around the universe and it was probably the first time

1154
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:38,640
in my life i felt um free and he's like there's it's it's all okay we're all okay and you have

1155
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:43,040
a choice right now to just have the best life and i want you to go live it and i'm i'm right

1156
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:52,320
here you can access me at any time just call for me and we from that point on um we have a great

1157
01:44:52,320 --> 01:45:00,320
relationship and i i feel him he sends me songs and birds and hummingbirds and if i pay attention

1158
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:06,640
he's everywhere and i totally i don't know where you go or what happens but i am very clear that

1159
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:12,960
we're made of energy and if i can talk to god why wouldn't i be able to talk to nate and so now it's

1160
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:18,000
this kind of um i mean i like i said it's just like it's even better than our marriage because

1161
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,440
i talk all the time he just listens even more and he doesn't even he and then he just tells me things

1162
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:32,880
in very quick um two or three words like you're fine yes slow down stop talking that's a lot of

1163
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,280
stop talking did you ask him anything in particular that you had never asked him before

1164
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:44,240
in that journey there i asked him why did you play football and he said because it was the

1165
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:48,560
easiest way for people to respect me and listen to me so i could share with them about love

1166
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:55,760
he said i never really loved playing football but i love that it gave me access to people so i

1167
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,000
could talk to them about this stuff i really wanted to talk about which was never about football

1168
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,280
he didn't talk much about football when he was done he hated it he hated to talk about it did

1169
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,600
he still watch it yeah he loved because he loved to put some money on the game and be with his

1170
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:17,200
buddies and just scream at a tv and have fun um he just he was like kelsey this is this this is

1171
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:21,520
what you've been waiting for this is what you you knew this was coming you knew this was coming

1172
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:29,760
you're fine this was my time's over like this was i did my part don't don't um don't worry about

1173
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:39,120
me he's like it's exceptional where i am he was just it was beautiful and i mean i i mean maybe

1174
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:46,400
it's the top one of the top three experiences of my life probably certainly something that most

1175
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:52,880
people who've experienced it would would say yeah and i um you know i also and we talked about this

1176
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:59,520
but xanax and ambien and the things they give you for grief work just put you black you out

1177
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,840
and you have no idea what happened or i used to wake up and be like why is everyone sad like

1178
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:09,600
you know and what what the mushrooms and the whole plant experience gave me was an ability

1179
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:15,360
to go towards it and understand it and walk through it and come out of it being like okay

1180
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:21,600
like we're all okay and for me i think i probably was most afraid of death most of us are but that

1181
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:27,200
was the biggest fear of my life is i didn't want anybody i loved to die and i didn't want to die

1182
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:33,120
and now of course i'm not like looking forward to it but i have great peace that this is so much

1183
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:39,280
bigger and i've seen it and i've felt it and so i don't know people get tired because i'm so fired

1184
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:43,920
up about plant medicine now from someone who's like you know i've probably done five or six since then

1185
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:50,880
nothing quite as mind-blowing as that yeah what have the subsequent trips been like do you go into

1186
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:58,080
them with a much more focused intention i've done both i've gone in with the focused intention like

1187
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:02,720
i'm looking for some answers and i've also gone in being like just tell me what is for me it feels

1188
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:11,600
like a download of information of um it feels like a connection that is so much bigger than

1189
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,800
anything i could have just in my day to day the biggest thing about plants is this is important

1190
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,520
i really need a lot of approval and i've spent my life trying to be great at everything and have

1191
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:26,000
people give me attigirls and when i did that first experience and it's been subsequent and

1192
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,640
all my experiences is my ego completely goes away and i don't i'm the biggest judgment i'm a comic

1193
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:36,480
i try to make fun of everybody i like use everything against people and when i'm in those

1194
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:42,320
experiences i have no judgments on anybody and i have no desire to be liked and no judgments on

1195
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:48,160
yourself yeah i don't i don't i there's this like it's just 10 or 11 hours where i'm not

1196
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:52,960
worried about what people think of me or what i think of them which it's such a relief you know

1197
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:59,200
so for me that's probably that's the biggest thing i get out of those experiences is this

1198
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:04,560
what would it look like if my ego just got out of the way and i just was present with what is and

1199
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:10,560
with what who is and you just see good and i didn't ever feel like messed up i mean i literally

1200
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:17,600
tell my friends who are still so against it you're none of it was scary and obviously i haven't done

1201
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:24,000
any ayahuasca and i i'm not called to that at all right now currently in my life um but man it's a

1202
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,720
lot better than getting drunk and crying you know i stopped drinking pretty pretty soon after he

1203
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:34,320
died because i drink tequila and just sob and so i'm real clear now that alcohol is a depressant

1204
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:42,080
to this day yeah i drink red wine now but i any type of alcohol cues anxiety because the sugar

1205
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,560
makes my heart race and then if i can't sleep then it get then once this thing starts my brain

1206
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:51,040
starts going it can be not a safe place so alcohol just doesn't really work for me anymore

1207
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:58,240
did you talk with your kids after the psilocybin experience and tell them about it yeah no i haven't

1208
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:04,080
yet you meaning as of yet as of yet so they might watch this yeah they might or actually i had some

1209
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,920
notes when i had i left some notes at home and i was like jack can you take a picture of these

1210
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:13,520
notes and i was like oh shit well there you go you're gonna if you read it um he's just now he's

1211
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:21,600
16 now so he would understand it but they are both they hate drunk people they hate my my brother

1212
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,480
mazak actually i mean obviously sober so there's been a connotation around drugs in our family

1213
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:31,760
that it's it's really not good um so this will have to be a longer discussion and i don't really

1214
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,400
know i mean i don't what do you think when do you talk to your kids about it have you talked to your

1215
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:43,600
13 year old no not about psychedelics yeah me neither but um i actually that's not true i've

1216
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:50,080
talked about it once with her through the lens of drugs okay and um sort of trying to explain that

1217
01:50:52,240 --> 01:51:00,080
you know um the legality of a drug is a second order consideration i mean it's an important

1218
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:04,960
consideration obviously if you're trying to abide by the law but the the you want to think about

1219
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,360
this first through the lens of the molecule and and i've shared with her this framework that i

1220
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:13,360
borrowed from somebody else that i think is very valuable right which is um because i talk about

1221
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,800
this all the time with patients right so you know one of the questions you ask a patient

1222
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:21,600
during an intake with them is you know tell me how many drinks you have in an average week

1223
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:27,360
tell me which recreational drugs you use um and this is not a judgmental discussion but it's you

1224
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:31,840
really want to understand this and look a lot of times people say yep i use coke once a month i do

1225
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,680
this i do that i do this one of that and so the the thing i discussed with them and this is sort

1226
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:41,600
of what i explained to olivia once was you know there are certain drugs alcohol being a drug as

1227
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:47,520
well where they change your state i love i've heard this podcast you did yeah yeah yes but they

1228
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:53,520
don't change traits and then there are others that change your state and if you use them correctly

1229
01:51:53,520 --> 01:52:00,560
they can change your traits and so i said and by the way there are legal and illegal molecules in

1230
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:07,280
both of those camps and that's worth noting and respecting but really the things in this camp you

1231
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:12,240
have to really ask yourself how often am i doing this and why am i doing this and so you know i put

1232
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:18,000
cocaine very clearly in this camp right it clearly changes your state and i've never done cocaine but

1233
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,200
the people i talk to who love it tell me how great they feel when they do it but they can't make a

1234
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,640
compelling case for me that it makes them better when they're not on cocaine 100 and the same is

1235
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:33,680
true for alcohol in reality so so one you know you have to be careful about the use of those things

1236
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:38,320
and obviously the things we're talking about psilocybin and MDMA at least have the potential if

1237
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:44,400
done correctly to make you a better version of you long after that medicine is gone yeah i remember

1238
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:49,600
you i listened to that podcast of yours and i that's exactly it like i am a different person

1239
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:54,400
because of those experiences and i'm i'm better and the only reason i know that is because i'm

1240
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:01,120
more i'm less afraid i'm more patient i think i have less answers i'm more open i mean all the

1241
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:08,080
things that you you hope to get in therapy but it's very hard to get your brain to change and i feel

1242
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:14,720
like tell me from a physician standpoint it opens up a pathway that was like blocked like it had a

1243
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:20,160
blockade and you it was always there you just hadn't gone down it and so when i took psilocybin

1244
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:24,560
it like moved that blockade and there there was a road i never knew that was just ease and love and

1245
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:29,920
fearlessness and after i was done i started to walk down that road more often in my day-to-day

1246
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:36,080
life because for so long it wasn't even accessible to me and now it's a road that i choose quite

1247
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:43,280
often um and same thing with MDMA for me i've done that very rarely but it it's shown me fun

1248
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:51,760
how to just be connected and and not again not judging and just um and if mom and you're

1249
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:58,960
listening i know you guys had no idea i was so edgy but it gave me so now even if i don't do it

1250
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:04,960
i remember the feeling i can access that that that neural pathway and i can go oh kelsey you

1251
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,840
know what it feels like to be at a party and be calm and not worrying about getting home and

1252
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:15,600
worried about the uber and and just like be here and i can almost get myself to that new road that

1253
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:22,080
i always had but it just always had a huge blockade in front of it yeah and and i mean i think i think

1254
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:27,680
those are two good examples of how those molecules work and i mean i think mdma really has this

1255
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:34,800
ability to you know so create this empathy that is very difficult for most people to access

1256
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:43,200
um on command uh or frankly not under the influence of that medication and that's to me

1257
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:50,560
if you if you can craft the intention around that it's um you know it can really do an amazing thing

1258
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,360
for a relationship as well yeah with yourself but also with somebody else especially if there has

1259
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:59,760
been something that's gone really wrong sure yeah i mean it's probably been there's been a ton of

1260
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,320
gifts of grief and i talk about them all the time but i think that that those experiences have been

1261
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,960
and everyone hates me for it because once i get excited about something i get really excited so i

1262
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:15,280
came out of it i can just blazing hot on uh plant journeys and now i kind of understand that you have

1263
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:20,640
to be ready and have to want it and have to be ready to be open to it but i am and the other thing

1264
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:28,880
i i do think that um at least in my limited experience um i think that the best of both

1265
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:34,320
worlds is when you combine that work with the traditional work of therapy and i do think that

1266
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:40,800
if there's one thing about the the new appreciation people have of psychedelics that i think is

1267
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:46,560
dangerous it's that people believe that the plant or the molecule by itself can do all the work like

1268
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:51,440
all i have to do is do psilocybin once a month or once a quarter and and it's all good and it's like

1269
01:55:52,560 --> 01:56:00,960
no those are incredible lubricants to allow you to do very difficult things when you're long off

1270
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:07,360
the influence of those medications so i i also think like again it's impossible to say what

1271
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:13,920
fraction of your recovery has been predicated on that experience versus all that came before it and

1272
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:21,120
after it and around it um so that's kind of the one thing that i i tend to remind that's smart

1273
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:26,640
because i've done a ton of work i've read a bunch and i i think the other big thing that i do

1274
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,240
that has supported all of that is just i have i'm militant about meditation

1275
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:39,520
militant and were you before i had started on the path but maybe 20 minutes a day here and there

1276
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:46,400
maybe insight timer um once nate died it became a must and to this day and i i saw you guys just

1277
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:53,520
got this on a bag but i will sit in with dispense i think dispense probably dispenses work has

1278
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:59,920
probably changed my life the most in terms of a daily practice they're changing a thought

1279
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:05,600
or watching a thought or um knowing that my feelings are transient and that i can change

1280
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:11,120
a feeling through it changing a thought or i can say change or i can say stop and um it doesn't

1281
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:16,720
mean they're not going to come but i do have some agency in how i feel and what i feel which i never

1282
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:23,040
believed before um so i think if you if you like you said if you do the the psychedelics in

1283
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:29,360
conjunction with a very deep meditation and you know a committed spiritual practice that gives

1284
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:35,440
you peace whatever that might be you you have a great shot at coming out of pretty much everything

1285
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:42,560
yeah it's i've always found it sad i guess i'm i'm i'm only saying something that i'm sure a

1286
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:50,000
billion other people have thought or said um but it's remarkable that this isn't taught

1287
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:58,000
alongside english science math to kids coming from school like you you can play the thought

1288
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,600
experiment of what if from the moment kids entered kindergarten we had an emotional health

1289
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:10,160
class as well that was part of the core curriculum where you learned to distance yourself from your

1290
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:17,200
thoughts and right like and you know we're gonna spend 30 minutes a day on this course throughout

1291
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:24,240
you know k to 12 yeah um how many different habits could we develop and how could we equip

1292
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:30,000
ourselves um you mentioned something in your book that resonates deeply with me which is radical

1293
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:39,600
acceptance when did you first encounter that term um tera brock i probably read it my mom was into

1294
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:44,960
this stuff for a long time so this was always in the background noise of my life my dad left when i

1295
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:50,720
was 15 and my mom really went on this like journey so these books and these people were part of it but

1296
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:58,320
i the idea of radical acceptance that that that something wasn't good or bad probably happened

1297
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:03,840
i mean after nate died i mean i don't think i think i knew of it in practice but when everything's

1298
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,000
good seems good it's hard to you're like oh yeah good luck to those people that you know

1299
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:13,600
have a sick kid or whatever i hope they just accept what is um and i always thought that before

1300
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:20,160
i really experienced it that it is what it is was an annoying statement and it was kind of just like

1301
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:24,960
a throw away like oh well it is it life's shit so just accept it and now i'm like no it's beautiful

1302
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:31,920
it is what it is how wonderful is that like can you just be with whatever without it doesn't mean

1303
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:38,000
it won't feel hard it doesn't mean it's not miserable it just means it is exactly what you

1304
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,960
are going through and the resistance to that and the wishing it was different is what kills you so

1305
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,680
a lot of people say how are you doing so well and i said because i don't wish it was different

1306
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:55,440
that's pretty much it do you think your kids understand that i don't know i don't they're

1307
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:59,840
still they were so young and they you know i'm i'm really working on understanding that they have

1308
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:04,400
their own path to this and their own journey and we all have different relationships to nate

1309
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:10,720
and different stories that we tell in our head i would say they are surprised at how great life is

1310
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:15,840
compared to what they thought it would be when he first died sometimes they'll say i mean isn't it

1311
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:22,960
great we're so happy again isn't it great that we have fun again um look look at how look at how

1312
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:29,840
good our life is and so that's their way of saying like we made it in some way we we accepted

1313
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:34,880
what is and we continue to build a life that was beautiful we talk a lot in our house about what

1314
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:40,880
would nate want us to do and nate would want us to be joyful so if you want to honor your dead

1315
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:45,040
person the best way to do it is live the life they would want you to live if they were here

1316
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:52,720
so in that sense the kids you know we can't even take it out anymore he's gone and so our life is

1317
02:00:52,800 --> 02:01:01,760
this and we miss him and we're happy and we accept it and we miss him but yeah radical acceptance i

1318
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:06,800
think it gets easier the more you do it so i mean little things you know you practice at the stop

1319
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,120
light you're like and the light isn't moving and it's all the things we've all read but until you

1320
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:16,000
have to practice it because you're in such a dark spot um i don't know that you you can and people

1321
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,600
always say like oh can you transform without going through something big i don't know if you can i

1322
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:27,120
don't know because i i had a i read it all and i intellectually knew it all but until i had to

1323
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:35,440
really dig into those practices i didn't it i was glad i i would say prepare with them but until

1324
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:41,680
you get to that point there is magic in that transformation when you do the work um i don't

1325
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:46,320
know what are your thoughts you think you have to go through hard things i don't think i'm equipped

1326
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:54,640
to answer the way you are yeah i suspect so but i mean i i was hoping not or at least in near miss

1327
02:01:54,640 --> 02:02:00,480
you know i i have a good friend rick elias who was actually on the podcast and um he was on that

1328
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:06,960
united der you know uh u.s air flight that uh was going to crash and somehow made the miraculous

1329
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:13,360
landing in the hudson river in 2009 and so in that sense you know nothing bad happened to him but

1330
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:19,040
there was a two minute period where he really thought no no this is it i am dead he went through

1331
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:27,760
all of that and rick is a you know that was 13 years ago this month and rick is still living

1332
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:35,600
the life of the guy who was given a second chance i agree so you know could rick have come to this

1333
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:41,040
same set of principles that guide his life today without that i just don't know my guess is there's

1334
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:45,840
maybe somebody that could i don't know that i could yeah it's it's just interesting and i there's

1335
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:52,080
just a real relief when you stop wishing it was different whatever it is when you stop wishing

1336
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:57,440
whatever you're going through wasn't and you just go like let's roll like what would i what i what

1337
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:02,960
i've got to learn what's on the other side of this um what will it feel like when it's transformed

1338
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,560
into something different what can i get excited about it's i just i think that the the practices

1339
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:14,880
work that's what i believe now i believe that you can get through things and i've got a lot of easy

1340
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:20,000
easy ways because my situation is fairly easy if you look at it the way we can

1341
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,720
spend some of it it's better that he's not here i was left with resources i always think too about

1342
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:30,240
grief like if a woman has resources it's a very different experience than if you don't so you know

1343
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:36,720
there's a thousand things that interact to make your experience what it is but internally

1344
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:44,240
the stoics and then the buddhist and believing in something bigger than you those are kind of

1345
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:50,720
key pillars at least for me what would you say to a man or woman or child listening to this right now

1346
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:58,960
who's three months out from that tragedy based on everything you've learned to start just hang on

1347
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:06,720
just hang on for now um i think i think i said humans are are built to last we're meant to

1348
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:14,400
we're built to make it through things um and and do the work whatever that work is for you whatever

1349
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:20,960
wherever you're trying to go do the work and the work will eventually support you um you know you

1350
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,400
get like i think of it if you're over here and you're trying to get over here and there's a there's

1351
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,760
you got to build a bridge if you once you build the bridge you'll get over there but you got to go

1352
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:34,320
to work um the bridge isn't there yet and that's where the meditation and the reading and the

1353
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:39,120
gratitude and the changing your brain that's those are each plank that you're building to get over to

1354
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:44,880
the other side and if you do the work you're going to look back and be like damn like i never thought

1355
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:49,040
i could build that bridge and you're going to be more confident and more joyful because you just

1356
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:54,640
saw you did something you never thought you could do so life just got sweeter how hard was it to write

1357
02:04:54,640 --> 02:05:00,480
the book you know i didn't have any pressure around it and i know i think you're writing a book

1358
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:03,920
um i didn't have any pressure on it because it was just not why i asked by the way

1359
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:10,160
no no no um no but i i remember um jill talking about that you were writing when for me i had to

1360
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:14,720
get the story out it was very personal because i wanted my kids to remember and i wanted to

1361
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:17,600
remember because i knew i was going to love again and i knew i was going to date and i knew i was

1362
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:24,320
going to have other relationships and time is a miracle when it comes to life because as time goes

1363
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:29,360
on the pain just it does gradually get better and so i thought i better make sure that the story of

1364
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,880
this great man is down so that my grandchildren and my great grandchildren will know where they

1365
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,680
came from and who he was and how this all happened somewhere in the middle you think this

1366
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:43,920
is such shit that yeah i was embarrassing to like i shouldn't even show it to the my worst enemy

1367
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:49,600
because this is just blabber of nothing and i'm so bored with what i wrote it's so dumb and it's so

1368
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:55,520
ridiculous that where i mean just stop now because this is torture for you and nobody's this is

1369
02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:01,600
horrible and then you get to a point where you've written enough and then it gets to an editor

1370
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,640
and they make it a little better and they give you some feedback and you just start cutting stuff

1371
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:12,480
out and that's kind of then it got fun because i was like just cut out all the junk that you tried

1372
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:19,600
to make and just tell it like it is and don't worry about what people think and i'm so glad i

1373
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:23,600
did it i can't imagine doing it again and i know i want to but i don't even know where you start it

1374
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:29,120
feels surreal now you forget you forget sitting there looking at your computer being like this

1375
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:33,680
possibly the boringest paragraph i've ever written more like i just like you just it's a

1376
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:41,600
unique experience writing a book because the internal dialogue and anxiety and just disgust

1377
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,880
with what you're putting out is really epic just because you're just you're you're reading

1378
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:54,160
what you already hated that you wrote and it's just double flogging you know but i i would tell

1379
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:59,440
people write it down because man it it helps somebody like somebody is is going to be helped

1380
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:06,720
by it or get inspired by it and just go easy on yourself for the book what's the most surprising

1381
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:14,480
thing that you've received as a way of feedback there's there's been so many people that have

1382
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:22,000
written that i said thank you for showing um thank you for being honest and i think what that means

1383
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:28,960
is the good and the bad like not trying to play grief either way like that there is a duality to

1384
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,240
everything in life and people like thank you for letting us know that it was awful and you felt

1385
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:36,960
like you were on fire and you couldn't wait to have sex with other people like thank you for

1386
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:42,000
knowing that like you know that you lost the man of your dreams and you also get to meet other people

1387
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,800
and have a new experience and that's gonna that's that might be exactly what was meant to be

1388
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:51,360
this sense that everything isn't good or bad either way so there's a whole life i'm gonna have

1389
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:55,440
that i never even knew possible and there was one that i really love that got taken away

1390
02:07:56,240 --> 02:08:03,600
so people say like thank you for giving it a multifaceted approach to this experience i'm

1391
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:09,600
having did your kids read it before you published it no have they read it no they don't want to

1392
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:17,840
read it they are terribly embarrassed by it and secretly proud they don't want it out and then

1393
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:23,280
jack's like mom i'm taking your book to my school counselor because well she asked what your job was

1394
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:28,080
and i didn't know what to tell her i said she's she wrote a book and i was like so he they're

1395
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:32,720
proud of it but if they're also way more private than me i'm the least private person on the planet

1396
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:37,600
so i'm learning to understand that they'll tell it in their time and they'll read it in their time

1397
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,320
and they'll read it in their time and their experience will be very different from what i

1398
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:44,160
wrote i'm fairly certain that they'll read chapters and go that's not how it went

1399
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:51,440
like i didn't do that i didn't say that but we'll see i don't know i don't know how they'll be

1400
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:58,480
well kelsie i um i i can't thank you enough you know um this is just such a beautiful story and

1401
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:06,480
i i think people are going to be infinitely enriched whether they've experienced something

1402
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:12,000
like this or whether they will because i think you know we all will yeah might not be as sudden it

1403
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:20,880
might not be as tragic with a capital t but um the human experience is one of loss so um thank

1404
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:23,920
you for everything you've done thank you so much for having me it really means a lot to me
