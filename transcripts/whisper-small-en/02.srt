00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia. The drive

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,000
is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,700
with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,800
years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,220
this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,140
a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,660
Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive. In this episode, which I know is long anticipated,

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,680
I spoke with Dr. Rhonda Patrick from Found My Fitness. I suspect many of you listening

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,820
to this know everything about Rhonda and have been fans of her for a really long period

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,860
of time. On the off chance there's anybody listening who doesn't know who Rhonda is,

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,060
I suspect by the end of this discussion, you will also become a huge fan of hers and her

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,540
podcast, which is exceptional. So I've known Rhonda for quite a while. And despite the

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,380
fact that we both consider San Diego home, we've just been busy enough that we just haven't

15
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,380
had a chance to sit down together in quite a while. So this discussion was kind of long

16
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,940
overdue and it was sort of funny because as soon as Rhonda walked in, we just jumped right

17
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,300
into a really interesting discussion. And then 10 minutes in, I thought, you know, we

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,820
should probably start recording because this is interesting stuff. And so we did. And similarly,

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,540
when the discussion finally ended, we sat around for another 20 minutes talking about

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,980
a bunch of stuff that I found myself thinking, God, I wish we were still recording this because

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,300
it's super interesting. So that's just basically to say, I suspect Rhonda and I will speak

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,260
again at some point soon. So don't worry if all of your questions weren't answered here.

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,140
The other thing about this podcast that was a ton of fun was that in the days leading

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,100
up to it, she and I had emailed each other a few times back and forth some ideas of things

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,660
we would talk about. And in the end, neither of us really had any notes sitting in front

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,820
of us. We just sort of sat there and shot from the hip and didn't follow a script or

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,860
anything like that. And didn't even get to half the things that in our emails we had

28
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,780
suggested we would talk about. That said, all the stuff that we talked about is stuff

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,820
that I think Rhonda brings a great deal of expertise to. So I don't recall the order,

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,380
I know that we certainly touched on IGF and the growth hormone, what I consider a little

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,820
bit of a paradox, which is on the one hand we have some evidence to suggest that elevated

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,460
levels of IGF are bad and that fasting may act in part by reducing those levels. But

33
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,460
at the other end of the discussion, you have some confounding and conflicting data around

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,700
that. We also got into a great discussion about the PPAR enzyme, so PPAR alpha, PPAR

35
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,620
gamma. One of the things that Rhonda does incredibly well on her podcast, and I would

36
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,020
encourage those of you who find this episode interesting, who aren't familiar with her

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,220
work to go back and actually watch some of her stuff. Rhonda doesn't put out a lot of

38
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,500
podcasts, but the reason for that is the amount of work she puts into them is enormous. So

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,880
when she puts out a podcast on video, there's explanations, definitions, and stuff scrolling

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,260
across the screen. So it's unlike me who's incredibly lazy and can't even stand to listen

41
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,280
to a podcast after I record it. Rhonda is methodical in her ability to make that easier

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,260
for the viewer. So you'll learn a lot about this stuff if you think we're going too quickly

43
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,280
over it by probably going back to Rhonda's site. We talk a lot about the possible genetic

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,960
explanations for why some people do and don't respond particularly well to ketogenic diets.

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,040
And of course, you can think of that in two ways. There's respond as far as the ability

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,580
to make ketones, but then there's also sort of these patients that I describe seeing where

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,500
you put them on a ketogenic diet and everything seems to go wrong. So at least biochemically

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,340
wrong. So that's a very interesting discussion. In many ways, I think my favorite part of

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,700
this discussion was the way it started, which was the first question I asked Rhonda, which

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,540
was kind of a random question, I think led to some interesting back and forth between

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,580
us, which was effectively, what do you believe today that you didn't believe before and vice

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,660
versa? And I always find that to be one of the most interesting ways to dive into a discussion

53
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,860
with someone who's buried knee deep into science. Because if you're really thinking

54
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,140
about science, you have to understand of course that virtually all facts have a half life

55
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,380
and our knowledge is constantly evolving. In many ways, that's what makes the field

56
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,380
so difficult to stay on top of, but at the same time, so interesting. And so to me, one

57
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,580
of the marks of a very thoughtful person is someone whose beliefs are flexible and who's

58
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,280
willing to acknowledge that something that they believed was once true or not true can

59
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,600
be flipped. And so I think Rhonda and I share that and I think it was actually really fun

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,120
to see where her beliefs have changed over time. So with that said, I think the show

61
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,720
notes for this particular episode are going to be very helpful and you can find those

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,080
at PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash podcast. And I hope you enjoy this discussion at least

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,340
half as much as I did. I suspect it won't be the last. So without further delay, here's

64
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,580
my conversation with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.

65
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,180
Rhonda, so great to have you here. Happy to be here. It's great to see you again.

66
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,860
I can't believe we live in the same city and only see each other once a year. If you even.

67
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,900
Well thank you for taking the trip up here today to my office. My pleasure. And I'll

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,980
join the long list of people congratulating you on your 10 month old son. Thank you. Thank

69
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,740
you. I almost don't know where to begin because there are so many things that we share in

70
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,060
common as far as interests. But I want to start with a really broad question, which

71
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,620
is you spend so much time thinking about many of the same problems I spend time thinking

72
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:55,980
about. What do you believe today that you did not believe four or five years ago? Probably

73
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,020
the biggest thing that has changed in what I now believe, but I didn't four or five years

74
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:10,060
ago even more, is that one of the major modalities for increasing health span, which is the

75
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,300
healthy part of your life, delaying the onset of age related diseases, the major modality

76
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,420
for doing that, that would be the best way to do it would be caloric restriction or dietary

77
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,540
restriction. So eating 30% less food than you normally would eat. I used to really think

78
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,900
that was the way to go for doing that. And I think that my beliefs have changed for that

79
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,460
and that being the major modality for a few reasons. One reason is because I think that

80
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,140
actually, so one of the things that occurs during caloric restriction is a major drop in the growth

81
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:51,220
hormone IGF-1. And that's thought to regulate a lot of the improved health span effects, at least

82
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:59,540
in some organisms like mice and in rhesus monkeys. But I do believe now based off a variety of

83
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:06,580
research from people like Walter Longo, that periods of growth, actually specifically periods

84
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,220
of IGF-1 are really important. So if you're constantly doing this caloric restriction,

85
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,380
then you're not really going to have that period of growth because you're chronically doing that.

86
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,340
And really interesting, I don't know if you saw the recent nature study that came out,

87
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,940
I think it was in April of this year on lemurs. So the study essentially showed, and these are,

88
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,300
I guess they're not human primate animal model, but their lifespan is, median lifespan is around

89
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,180
six years or something like that. And I think their maximum is 11 or 12 years, I don't remember.

90
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,300
But the caloric restriction did increase the median lifespan. It also increased maximum,

91
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:53,300
so they lived a year longer than typically. And there's a lot of delayed onset of various

92
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:00,740
degenerative diseases, but there was a mass of atrophy in gray brain matter in regions of the

93
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,460
brain that didn't occur in control animals, which is just another sort of example of how sometimes

94
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,660
some of these modalities that we think are really good for increasing health span sometimes have

95
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,780
other effects. And I think that getting into the IGF-1, I think we'll probably, you and I will talk

96
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:23,100
about that because we both have a shared interest in that. But the periods of growth being necessary

97
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,420
for health, I think that's kind of turning point in my mind. And so now I actually think that

98
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:37,180
perhaps even doing periodic prolonged fasts are a better way of doing that because you can get

99
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:46,860
that IGF-1 boost and you can get the lower IGF-1 among other things that occur. But we can dive

100
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,460
into that if you want. But I think that's kind of- We'll be diving.

101
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,500
Yeah. But I think that's probably one of the major things. Yeah, there would be actually

102
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:02,420
another interest that we share would be, I think I was a lot more skeptical of ketogenic diets about

103
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,980
four years ago in terms of being great for long-term health and health span. And I think that some of

104
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,460
my thoughts on that have changed a bit based off of more recent long-term studies in animals,

105
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,260
specifically in mice, work from Dr. Eric Verdon and also from out of UC Davis showing that

106
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,580
ketogenic diets in rodents can increase health span, increase median lifespan, certainly improve

107
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,500
cognitive function. Now the caveat there is that typically with a ketogenic diet in rodents,

108
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,140
it actually can be, most of the time, is obesogenic. And the way that these guys worked around that

109
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,740
was they found that they had to limit the calorie. And what was interesting was that-

110
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,060
Or cycle them, right?

111
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,700
Well, so Dr. Eric Verdon, the way they did that was by cycling it. But at UC Davis, what they did was

112
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,060
actually put a calorie cap and turns out after talking with Dr. Sachin Panda, that they ended

113
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,740
up being on a time restricted feeding schedule. And so the ketogenic diet was, they were basically

114
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,340
eating all their food within a certain eight or eight or so or nine an hour window. And then they

115
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,420
were fasting for- So it's kind of one of those things where in humans, we don't really know,

116
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,500
I don't know exactly how people- I've never actually done a ketogenic diet myself. So I

117
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,060
don't know exactly what people are doing if they're eating all the time or what.

118
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,700
So I'm also intrigued by that. And in many ways, almost have the mirror of your experience,

119
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,380
which was four or five, six years ago, seven years ago, I guess, is when I really, really got into

120
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:46,140
ketogenic diets, was on a ketogenic diet for three years, save one day. And I wouldn't say I

121
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,340
have any less faith in them today. I just am personally less interested and find it much harder

122
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:57,100
to do. So just as far as compliance with a ketogenic diet, you know, I think my life is just more

123
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,620
complicated today in terms of travel and things like that and kids and stuff. But the thing that

124
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,180
surprised me with the recent, because those two publications came out in cell, right? The ones-

125
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,180
Cell metabolism, right?

126
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,660
I was actually kind of surprised by a couple of things. So one was what you said, which was Eric

127
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,380
noting that, hey, when we constitutively gave these guys this food, they just, they got obese.

128
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,020
That's really counterintuitive when you think about how ketogenic diets increase circulating

129
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:32,220
metabolic fuels. And that should downregulate appetite. And I think in humans, you know,

130
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,540
there's a huge debate about why do people lose weight on ketogenic diets? Are they losing weight

131
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,340
because they're eating less? Were they losing weight because they're ramping up fat oxidation

132
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,660
disproportionate to where they were before, which drives up energy expenditure? Of course,

133
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,700
I suspect the answer is both. In other words, if you do the latter, the former should happen.

134
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,660
So when people say, why do you eat less on a ketogenic diet? The question is really,

135
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,580
or the thinking would be, are you eating less because you are basically eating yourself more?

136
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,180
Because you're obviously oxidizing all of those fatty acids to make BHB.

137
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,300
Or is it some other reason that, you know, has to do with the neuro chemistry of these things

138
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,260
that go beyond sort of the metabolic central, pardon me, peripheral effects of it. So that's

139
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,100
the first thing that surprised me with that study, which was why were those mice overeating?

140
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,860
Was there something else in them? Because they couldn't have had that much sucrose. They usually

141
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,300
put sucrose in mouse child, but there couldn't have been that much sucrose. So they wouldn't have

142
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,460
been able to get into ketosis. And I think even previous studies, like earlier in the literature,

143
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,940
showed something similar where it was obesogenic. Now there was certain genetic backgrounds that

144
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,420
also seem to kind of little, you know, regulate that to some degree. But what I was actually

145
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,300
thinking, so you brought up some really interesting points, is that thinking of that in the context of

146
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,740
like, let's say they're constantly eating the fat or they're not having the period of rest.

147
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,740
I know that, for example, when you're making malonyl CoA, which is something that you do,

148
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,060
when you're oxidizing fat, malonyl CoA inhibits the conotene palmatilla transfer is the

149
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,300
basically the transporter to transport fatty acids in the mitochondria. So if you

150
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,620
constantly are making malonyl CoA because you're constantly eating the fat, then you're going to

151
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,700
start to have this inhibition. You're going to start to then store the fatty acids in adipose

152
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,140
tissue rather than catabolizing them. Right? So it seems to me that's-

153
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,620
And we don't see that, by the way, with the exogenous ketones, do we?

154
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,500
This is something I'm still trying to get a handle on.

155
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,900
I agree. I'm certain, I am extremely interested in the exogenous ketones,

156
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,300
particularly because I've tried them. I should have brought you some. Okay, you've tried them.

157
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,580
Yeah, yeah. I was going to bring you some.

158
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:36,540
So I really enjoy the effects they have on my brain. So I've used them for endurance exercise,

159
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,260
and I also like it for that as well. I do notice that I have a little bit of a, I seem to run

160
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,700
longer than I usually stop at this point on the beach and I can keep going another. But what I

161
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:54,380
really like is for me, it really helps with focus and lower anxiety levels. So I seem to be able to,

162
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,780
I'm always onto the next. And so this kind of helps me like, say in the now,

163
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,540
at least I've, and that could be completely placebo, I don't know. But anyways, that's one

164
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,060
thing that I like about that. But to get back to your point, I had wondered the same thing because

165
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,180
what's the effect of exogenous ketones on normal fatty acid metabolism. And the reason I'd wonder

166
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,540
that is because there was a paper that recently came out where I think it was the one that was

167
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,860
done in humans where humans, they were given the beta hydroxybutyrate ester for endurance

168
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,820
and it enhanced endurance performance, but they found it inhibited.

169
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,860
Yes. And also it inhibited fatty acid, something to do with the lip fatty acid transport out of

170
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,820
the adipose, something to do with where I was like going with somewhere, some of that had to do with

171
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,740
lipid metabolism, which suggested possibly there could be an inhibition.

172
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,220
Now, it's funny, I'm in New York next week and Dom is going to be in New York, Dom Degasino,

173
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,740
who obviously you know well. And we're grabbing dinner one night and we're going to talk about

174
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,620
this paper because I remember when it came out, Dom sent me an email.

175
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,900
You can pull it up. Then I'll know for sure if you want. Or I can just send it to you.

176
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,060
Yeah, send it to me for sure. Because there was something about that study that was a little bit

177
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,340
off. I need to kind of go back and look at it. But it does beg another question. So I want to

178
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,140
go back because I know this is going to be a theme today, which is multiple threads that are

179
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,620
easy for us to go off on. You and I are great at going on to it.

180
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go back to the mice. Let's go back to the two studies.

181
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,380
Do you recall if in the Verden study, before they started cycling the ketogenic diet,

182
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,860
when they were just giving it to them all the time, did they have a window in which they could

183
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,180
eat ad libitum that they overate in or were they given 24-hour access to food?

184
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,740
24-hour.

185
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,340
So what they never tried then was, let's give you food for 10 hours and let you eat ad libitum.

186
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,860
Because that would be interesting if they would over eat in that setting. Maybe not that

187
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,380
interesting. The other experiment that I don't think has been done is, remember when they did

188
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:05,340
the, they took a variant which was high fat, but high-ish carb. And so it wasn't, there was enough

189
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,540
carb in the diet that it wasn't producing ketosis, but it was still a high fat diet.

190
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,980
I'd like to see that experiment repeated, but with an exogenous ketone. Because then you could

191
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:21,580
start to identify the effect of the carbohydrate specifically and tease out the effect of the fat

192
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:27,820
and the BHB. Right. I think I remember one of the big differences between the high fat, low carb,

193
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:35,020
and the actual ketogenic diet was the induction of PPR alpha. Yes, exactly. Which makes sense,

194
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,660
because that's involved in ketogenesis itself. But to what degree that regulates any of the other

195
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,260
important properties that were found, including the really the profound effects on the brain.

196
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,460
So I like to personally get my ketogenesis from my periods of fasting.

197
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,100
More so than carbohydrate restriction.

198
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,620
Well, I do refine carbohydrate restriction, but I also, I think there's a lot of benefits. And this

199
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,700
is part of the reason why for so long I was skeptical of a ketogenic diet is because I think

200
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,220
there's a lot of benefits in eating a variety of plants. I think that there's a lot of various

201
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:19,500
micronutrients that are much higher density in plants, folate, magnesium, vitamin K1, but also

202
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,300
there's a lot of fermentable fibers and things that are also really good for the gut microbiome,

203
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,220
which I also think is very important for regulating immune function. So that's kind of been my hangup.

204
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:37,260
But I think people like Dom seem to be doing a modified ketogenic diet where they're definitely

205
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,020
getting the greens, trying to get the leafy greens. So I think that one way to kind of get around that.

206
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,220
Plus, I think there's also a way to do a ketogenic diet where you're eating a lot of salmon, avocado,

207
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,700
nuts, olive oil, and it's not just butter and keto bombs and all this pork rinds and stuff,

208
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,660
where I'm just like, where's the nutrient density in some of that?

209
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,740
Yeah, it's funny. I mean, I guess it depends on how many calories you need, but at the time,

210
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,220
during that window when I was on a ketogenic diet, I was also still very active, certainly much more

211
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,220
so than now. And I really required a lot of calories. I mean, I couldn't maintain my weight

212
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:21,340
below 4,500 calories a day. And I still stuck to pretty strict absolutes on the protein and

213
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,620
carbohydrates. I really kept my carbs, and I didn't look at net carbs. Oh, by the way,

214
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,060
for those listening and wondering what that noise is, this is something Rhonda and I are very used

215
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,180
to. Those are FA-18s, which how many overhead drive-bys are we going to get today if you had

216
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,900
to predict? I would say three more? Yeah, I would say probably between three or four. Okay. Yeah,

217
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,100
it's the sound of freedom people, so just get used to it. So I was getting probably 50 grams

218
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,860
of carbohydrates, total carb. I should say probably about 80 grams of total carb, but you'll see what

219
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,740
type of carbs it was. Really had to limit protein to about 100 to 110 grams. If I went over that,

220
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:08,140
I would get kicked out. And so fat made up about 90% of my total calories. And so there's only so

221
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,460
many ways you can get that much fat. And the most efficient way is actually salad with olive oil. I

222
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,980
mean, I couldn't believe the amount of vegetables I had to consume to stay in ketosis. I basically

223
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,540
had to have two huge salads a day where I would make my own dressing, which was a heavy olive oil

224
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,540
based dressing. And I could probably only have one avocado a day, which I would always have because

225
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,300
other than anything over that I was getting too much carbohydrate. So it's like a lot of macadamia

226
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:39,340
nuts, a lot of olive oil, olive oil based everything. And then the hardest part for me was

227
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,860
clearly being stingy with the protein. What was in the salad? It's like, I mean, okay, so I'd go,

228
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm a pretty boring guy. So it's romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, had to kind of

229
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,700
like limit the carrots a little bit. I normally love carrots. So you can eat tomatoes and

230
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,220
everything on the ketogenic. Yeah. Now again, part of it is I can get away with more because

231
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,940
I probably exercise more. And I was doing this before people were sort of putting butter in

232
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,980
their coffee and stuff like that. So that was not, I consumed a lot of dairy though. So it's the other

233
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,580
thing, tons of cheese, tons of sour cream, because you just needed those calories. And I actually

234
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:20,300
developed like a spreadsheet that was customized for my caloric needs. But I had this formula of

235
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,220
looking at every ingredient. Like, could you find the food that you could eat without restriction

236
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,580
that wouldn't destroy your ratios? And so for me at my caloric levels, like cream cheese and sour

237
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,300
cream were sort of the perfect thing. Whereas even high fat Greek yogurt had too much protein. So I

238
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,460
had to consume that in moderation. That's the other interesting thing. And I think I talked to Eric

239
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:48,220
about this was how much of the effects on health span were due to low protein intake and how much

240
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,700
were due to the actual being in ketosis. Yeah. I've talked about this with Vaulter a few times.

241
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,500
We don't see eye to eye on this because for several reasons. One, I'm not entirely convinced

242
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,700
of the IGF paradigm anymore. So that's one thing where the question I asked you, that would be my

243
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,300
answer. So five years ago, I would have said IGF is the devil, growth hormone is the devil. You

244
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,660
want them to be as low as possible. I'm not convinced of that today. And I can't wait to

245
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,180
explore that with you. But the other thing is if you really want to produce the lowest level of

246
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,380
insulin and IGF, I am not aware of a way to do that beyond the ketogenic diet that is incredibly low

247
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,940
in protein, incredibly low in carbohydrate. When I go back and look at my blood levels,

248
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,180
because I check my blood about every six to eight weeks, and I've been doing this for, you know,

249
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,300
10 years. I mean, my lowest IGF levels were during the three years I was in ketosis. I mean,

250
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,580
they were very low. They were, I mean, not ridiculously low, but 25th percentile for age

251
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,900
versus say 75th percentile today. So that makes sense to me because if you think about,

252
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,900
you know, some of the major dietary regulators of the IGF-1 pathway are protein, essentially

253
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,700
amino acids specifically, and also insulin. Insulin through IGF-PP3.

254
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:05,260
Exactly, or IPP1. So I mean, I think that, so for example, you know, if someone's eating a low protein

255
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,620
and low, you're getting, you may not be a vegan, but even if you had a, you're limiting your protein,

256
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,780
you know, even to some degree, you're certainly getting more than someone, maybe me, that's not

257
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,700
doing that really, although I do kind of limit my protein. But it's a misconception. You see,

258
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,940
I think a lot of people assume ketogenic diets are high protein diets. I think some people do

259
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,260
consider that, yeah. But if you're, there may be certain people out there who can produce ketones

260
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,140
with high protein, but in my experience, personally and more important clinically, meaning,

261
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,780
I don't know, over the course of my practice, my career in medicine, I mean, I've probably at

262
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,860
least encountered 50 or 60 patients at a very detailed level on ketogenic diets, almost with

263
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,460
that exception, protein is the bigger thing that fouls people up. And so that's the thing I've

264
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,740
always found a bit confusing in some of those discussions is, and even Eric mentioned this on

265
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,380
your podcast, which is, well, you got to be careful if you're on a ketogenic diet, you don't have too

266
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,420
much protein. And I was like, those don't go hand in hand. You're not on a ketogenic diet if you're

267
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,060
eating a lot of protein, because you won't make the ketones. That said, I wouldn't be surprised

268
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,820
if there are polymorphisms that allow people more or less. And you've obviously talked a lot about

269
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,460
the PPAR alpha, is it PPAR alpha or PPAR gamma, where you see the differences in a person's

270
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,140
ability to generate ketones? The PPAR alpha is predominantly found in the liver and it's involved

271
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,980
in fatty acid catabolism, the production of ketone bodies. So that would be the major one.

272
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,140
Now there's nothing empirically, I've seen in literature that's looked specifically at PPAR

273
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,300
alpha and a ketogenic diet or fasting, but most of the literature out there looking at the effects

274
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,060
of PPAR alpha with people that are either head or homozygous have to do with the context of high

275
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,420
saturated fat, low polyunsaturated fat diet, because polyunsaturated fat activates the PPAR

276
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,860
family of transcription factors, which are nuclear hormone receptor transcription factors. But the

277
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,540
PPAR gamma is predominantly found in adipose tissue. I mean, they're found in other tissues,

278
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,460
but I see predominantly that's like the most, they're highly expressed in that adipose tissue.

279
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,740
And it plays a role in basically taking up fatty acids into adipose tissue, whereas the alpha,

280
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,500
which is in the liver, plays a role in the transport, catabolism. So one would just sort

281
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,500
of imagine, I mean, it would be nice to see that someone look at that, people with these specific

282
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,580
SNPs and how that... Does Prometheus identify various SNPs of PPAR alpha? Yes, but they don't

283
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:30,220
really tell you anything. They sort of pull abstracts from PubMed and just kind of like dump

284
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,100
it there. So you kind of can start with the research there. I've been developing a genetic

285
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,900
tool and I just, we're actually developing it a lot more of a former NIH geneticist who's

286
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,620
probably phenomenal, who's been working with me on to help me sort of develop those. Basically,

287
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:50,620
look at the literature and see what some of these SNPs are doing. And then in conjunction with

288
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,380
looking at biomarkers, various blood biomarkers to kind of help people guide what sort of they

289
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,420
should do, what's a bypass around it, a potential bypass, for example. So with the PPAR alpha or

290
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,540
gamma, I think that the take-home, at least from the literature, is essentially you want to have a

291
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:13,100
higher ratio of poly and monounsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio in order to lower your

292
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,340
type 2 diabetes risk. You're saying for any, for people with the wild type or with people with

293
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,660
certain SNPs. With the SNPs, within PPAR alpha, yeah, and gamma as well because to some degrees,

294
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:30,860
some of the ones in PPAR gamma affect the uptake of fatty acids and adipose tissue and also muscle.

295
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,420
And so it kind of can affect, you know, you have a lot more free fatty acids around and that can,

296
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,020
you know, have an effect on insulin sensitivity and other things as well.

297
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,700
We should talk about this offline because I have a subset of patients for which we have such rich

298
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,020
data. And if I'm positive, all of them would be interested in knowing this and, you know, we'd

299
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,060
certainly get their permission, but it would be interesting in taking their, you know, just their

300
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,580
straight up 23andMe data. So here's the pattern I've seen and I'm very curious as to what the

301
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:07,260
overlap is. So there's a clearly a subset of people. I think my N is too small to quantify it,

302
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,980
but directionally it seems like, I don't know, 10 or 20% of people. When you put them on ketogenic

303
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,260
diets in the standard way, which usually ends up meaning you're getting at least 40% of your

304
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:25,100
calories from saturated fat, typically 40 to 45% from mono and the remainder from poly,

305
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,300
everything goes to hell in a hand basket. And the obvious things that go to hell in a hand basket

306
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,060
have been certainly written about on the blogosphere and Twitter sphere, which is usually

307
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,580
their LDL particle numbers skyrockets, despite the fact that their triglycerides go down. So

308
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,660
they seem to be getting more insulin sensitive, but yet inflammation is going up. And you see

309
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,540
that both specifically cardiac specifically, so things like oxidized LDL and LPPLA too,

310
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,740
but even non specifically C reactive protein, fibrinogen, but the deeper level is the why.

311
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,820
And what you see is they're making much more cholesterol markers of cholesterol biosynthesis,

312
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,300
like does master law go way up. And some of their phytosterols go up, which is very counterintuitive

313
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,860
phytosterols would generally go down on a ketogenic diet, but they're going way up,

314
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,900
suggesting that they're absorbing much more cholesterol, like biliary cholesterol.

315
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,700
So the first time I noticed this was 2012. And I think I wrote about this once on a blog,

316
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,340
but I don't remember. Maybe I'm thinking of another example. And it was this relatively

317
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,380
young patient who really loved being on a ketogenic diet. But when we get his blood test back,

318
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,660
I mean, his LDL particle number was above 3,500 nanomole per liter. And I know there are a lot of

319
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,620
guys out there who seem to think that as long as you're on a ketogenic diet, it doesn't matter.

320
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,940
None of this stuff matters. I completely don't subscribe to that. And my view is that's

321
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,260
irresponsible. So I said to them, I said, look, I don't think a ketogenic diet is right for you.

322
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,420
And he said, no, no, no, no. It's the best thing I've ever done. Like I feel better. I look better.

323
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,980
I'm performing better. We got to figure out a way to do this. And the only thing I could think of,

324
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,380
and I talked with Tom Dayspring about this. And he said, let's try an experiment and rip all the

325
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,820
saturated fat out of his diet. He was sort of like me. He was eating a lot. He, meaning he's a high

326
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,940
caloric consumer. So that gets really hard. So we created a diet form that was only about 20 to

327
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,900
25 grams a day of saturated fat. And he ended up getting about 65% of his fat calories from

328
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,940
monounsaturated fat, which was pretty gross. I mean, you're drinking olive oil at that point,

329
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,300
but he was interested in doing the experiment. And sure enough after, I don't know, maybe eight

330
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:39,420
to 12 weeks, same macronutrient distribution in terms of fat, protein, carbohydrate. The only

331
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:46,860
shift was the type of fat. So we just substituted mono for saturated. His LDLP was 1300 animal per

332
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,300
liter. All of the inflammation was gone and all of the sterile biomarkers went back to normal.

333
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,860
I've since seen that about six times. And now I'm wondering if we took those patients and ran them

334
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,900
through what you're doing. Yeah. Yeah. That would be really interesting. Would they be the ones that

335
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,980
have those snips? And there's a variety of them that do that. So there's the PPR alpha, PPR gamma.

336
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,660
There's a, there's a couple of FTO related snips also that the ratio of saturated. And basically

337
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,460
in the literature, these studies have all looked at the ratio of saturated to mono and polyunsaturated

338
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,420
fat. And for whatever reason, people with those snips, when they have a higher saturated fat to

339
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,940
poly or mono and or mono, they have higher inflammation, higher oxidized LDL, higher

340
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,180
small dense LDL, higher, you can just, you know, all these just terrible. Do you have a sense of

341
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,860
the frequency based on the research you've done on this? How prevalent that is? Kind of. I would

342
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,820
say, you know, I'd have to look back at the data probably less than 20%. So it might be in the

343
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,420
ballpark of what I'm seeing for this different phenotype. It might be. Yeah, it might be. So

344
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,620
that would be really interesting to run them through, through my tool. And, and like I said,

345
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,980
we're, we're even expanding that a little bit. I found, I found a few more.

346
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Are patients sending you any of their data or are they doing it on their own and just

347
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,820
they're doing it on their own. Some people have shared their data with me because they've emailed

348
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,100
me and something interesting. And I'm like, Oh, wow, that's super interesting. Do you mind sharing

349
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,420
that with me? And they have. So if anybody's listening to this and they're saying, Hey,

350
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,740
you know, I had an advanced lipid test before and after I went on a ketogenic diet and I

351
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,780
looked like this situation you described, can they reach out to you through your

352
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,700
blog and send this data to you? They can actually just use the genetic tool and then sort of,

353
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,620
you know, share with you the data. If they want to share with me the data, you know, I can't

354
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,420
promise anything, but, but they can certainly get the why themselves by just using genetic tool

355
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,500
right now, which, which I have, I have free reports for, for example, the PPR genes, but then I have

356
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,580
a whole comprehensive report. That's a $10 recommended. So if someone doesn't want to pay

357
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,300
$10 to do the comprehensive, they can just get the free report and get the Y potential Y themselves.

358
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,020
So I hope that anyone listening to this, because I, again, if I'm seeing this at 10 to 20% of the

359
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,140
time and you're seeing it, then it'd be great to get a few hundred people who are that phenotype

360
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,380
and find out if the phenotype matches the genotype. Right. Yeah, it would absolutely be. And like I

361
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,980
said, I have, I have had people have that problem where they've tried to catch a genetic diet and

362
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,940
couldn't figure out and they did have one or even more than, than one of the SNPs that regulate

363
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,300
fatty acid metabolism. So, and then there's another phenotype that fortunately is more rare.

364
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,940
And I also wonder what's going on with PPR alpha specifically, which is people who

365
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,380
do everything by the book. And maybe I'm a sucker and maybe I'm gullible and maybe I believe patients

366
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,580
too much, but I don't think I've ever had a patient lie to me. I really think like when they're not

367
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,340
doing what they're supposed to be doing, they tell you I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

368
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:43,420
So it's not uncommon in this rare subset of patients that is where they're doing everything

369
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:48,220
by the book. I mean, they're working their tail off to keep their carbs here, to keep their protein

370
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:54,140
here, to keep their fat here, to keep it within this distribution. And they cannot get even close

371
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,980
to half a millimolar of BHB in their blood. And to me, that's a really frustrating situation. It's

372
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,660
frustrating for the patient because they're sort of like, what the hell I'm doing everything right.

373
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,220
Like I'm not making ketones. And, you know, I think Steve Finney sort of put out this notion

374
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,940
that the threshold was about 0.5 millimolar. I don't have anything to argue that one way or the

375
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,980
other. So I generally can, you know, based on my own empirical experience personally, I sort of felt

376
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,220
like one millimolar was about the threshold. But again, I think that's neither here nor there.

377
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,060
But when these people are doing what I'm describing and they're at best 0.2, maybe 0.3 millimolar,

378
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,620
it just made me wonder there's something in their machinery that's not doing this. Now, the question

379
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,660
is, is it a like policies problem? Is it an oxidation problem? Is it a conversion problem?

380
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,220
I mean, that I don't know, but it would also be interesting to understand where could the

381
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,420
weak links be in their ketosis machinery. Right. And there's probably, you know, there's a variety

382
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,460
of snips in these genes. And, you know, there may be certain snips that haven't even really been

383
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:58,300
tested or who knows. But it sounds like, you know, to me that there's certainly something going on

384
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,140
with the process of ketogenesis in some of the patients and their activity levels or they're

385
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:10,700
active. Yeah, we're pretty, I mean, we've evolved a lot in our thinking on how those patients can be

386
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,620
helped, but it seems that the best way to get them over that hump is fasting coupled with exercise

387
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,260
if they're capable. But it's got to be relatively, it has to be, it's not gardening, like it's got to

388
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:27,100
be exercise exercise, you know, they have to really deplete glycogen. So that's the other thing I sort

389
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,620
of wonder in some of these folks is what's happening with with gluconeogenesis? Because I

390
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,100
think until you start to dip down in glycogen a little bit, it's really hard to do this. And of

391
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,460
course we can't do liver biopsies. Wait, so fasting does get them into ketosis. And so again,

392
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,500
we're dealing with such a small end that I don't, I want to be thoughtful about not generalizing too

393
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,940
much. So there's one patient in particular who's the poster child for couldn't do the ketosis thing

394
00:33:52,940 --> 00:34:02,380
straight away. But when we put him on every month, a five day FMD, so he would do the five day FMD,

395
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:09,660
but ketogenic, not long goes FMD. And then the 25 days of ad lib was time restricted eating

396
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:16,860
ketogenic. Then we've seen great results doing that in two people. So that would suggest that

397
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,060
something again, we're not doing this as an experiment at this point, it's like clinical,

398
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,820
it's like just try to get the job done sort of thing. But that would suggest that something

399
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,540
about the fasting and or the exercise and or the time restriction could get them over the hump.

400
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,580
But it's interesting because from an evolutionary perspective, you should have been selected out

401
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,740
really quickly if you couldn't make ketones efficiently. Well, it sounds to me that maybe

402
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,060
maybe there's the glycogen, you know, you're not you're not getting depleting the glycogen too,

403
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,700
if that's, you know, so maybe it's not to do with the production of ketone bias, but it's actually

404
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,340
just takes a long time to deplete that glycogen. I do think there's a huge variation. Obviously,

405
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,300
physical activity plays a role in that as well. I can fast I can do you know, like when I do my

406
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,180
time restricted eating, ideally, I like to do it within, you know, nine or 10 hours, eat all my

407
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,780
food within 10 hours. And then I, you know, I like to fast for like 15 hours, I can do that. And with

408
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,100
my physical activity levels, you know, I will be closer to one millimolar fast like you will get

409
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,780
to one millimolar after 15 hours of fasting. I will be closer to that when I'm really physically

410
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,380
active. Like during the periods a couple of years ago, when I was doing lots of like, long,

411
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,020
like long distance running and stuff, I can get closer. I mean, I mean, I'm going off of like a

412
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,380
precision extra, which probably is not very precision extras. It's I mean, that's really good.

413
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,620
Yeah, so I can get between like point seven millimolar to like point nine.

414
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,300
But are you consuming a ketogenic diet during your feeding? So my diet typically, so I like I said,

415
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,340
I've never really intentionally tried to do a ketogenic diet. But my my diet is I pretty much

416
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,940
eat a lot of the same things. And typically, it's salmon, a salad or a sauteed vegetable with

417
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:59,340
olive oil, some pasture raised butter from pasture raised animals. And my fruits will be like blue

418
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,620
berries, I'll have avocado. So I'll have sometimes I'll have a smoothie with some blueberries,

419
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,900
avocado and kale. And will you have two meals in that window? Or it depends if I have the smoothie

420
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,140
or not. Typically, I'll have breakfast and then an early dinner. And then I'll have like a snack,

421
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:19,260
either nuts or the smoothie, the kale with some blueberries and avocado. So I think it, you know,

422
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:26,380
I need a lot of nuts too. You know, I probably do. What kind of nuts? Walnuts, macadamia nuts, pistachios,

423
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,460
cashews, almonds, I think probably I put cashews in the candy category. Oh, really? No, no, I just

424
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,900
mean like, I can't stop eating those things. So when I when I talk about nuts, I'm like, I eat nuts

425
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:44,300
and sometimes cashews because like, I just might as well be eating M&Ms. Is there a lot? Well, yeah,

426
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,780
no, look, all kidding aside, when I was on the ketogenic diet, and I had to be very mindful of

427
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,580
this stuff. Basically, I could only consume almonds and macadamia. Everything else was just a little

428
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,500
too high in carbohydrate. The cashews just like my own personal demons. I don't know what it is

429
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,620
about cashews. Like, I love watermelon, like the summer like right now. Oh, like my son loves watermelon.

430
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,540
You could eat a whole one. Oh, yeah, like put a little salt on it, like my father-in-law from

431
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,900
the south and taught me that. So in the summertime, I like to, I like to eat some watermelon. I like

432
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,780
to eat peaches, you know, so I'll definitely indulge in more fruits because that's when they're

433
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,820
around. But you know, so I do, I think my diet tends to be... I wouldn't be surprised if before

434
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,380
you entered your like, so let's say you finish your feeding window just before you went to bed,

435
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,700
it wouldn't surprise me if you're already at 0.2 or 0.3 millimolar, right? Probably, yeah.

436
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,140
I never actually measured that right. So check that and that'll give me a sense because if you...

437
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,020
Well, I'm not doing as strict because I'm still nursing, so I'm because it's just so hard to like

438
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,820
time-wise get everything I'm eating probably more like within the 11 to 12 hour. Okay, well, when

439
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,900
you get back to the 15, I'd be curious because if you're actually able to go from 0 or 0.1 millimolar

440
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:01,580
to 0.7 to 1 millimolar in a 15 hour fast, that's impressive. So when I took the exogenous ketones

441
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:08,140
and I've done this... Did you do the ester? I did the ester by HBMN. I did their instructions,

442
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,620
which is eat it with a high carbohydrate diet. So I had a little bowl of some whole

443
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:20,220
oats with some blueberries in it and then I took the BHB ester. I literally went from like 0.1

444
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,500
millimolar ketone in one hour to 6 millimolar. Wow. Six, in one hour. That's really high.

445
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,300
So that's impressive. Okay.

446
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,460
I'm trying to think. I definitely don't get that high and that's just with one bottle?

447
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,500
With one bottle. And then how long did it last, do you recall?

448
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,620
It depends on whether or not I did exercise, like intense exercise. And so if I did the intense

449
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,740
exercise like an hour later, I was down to like two or three or something. And have you ever

450
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,380
taken it and just done work, for example, where basically the brain is doing more of the exercise

451
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,420
than... Yeah, that's mostly what I do it now, but I'm not measuring it because I'm usually like

452
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:02,540
doing a podcast or going traveling and doing something. But that's typical what I use it for,

453
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:07,900
is that. So I'm not really using it for exercise. Yeah, they've really come a long way and taste.

454
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:14,060
Really? They still taste awful. Yeah, it's funny. I remember Kevin Rose, who's a good mutual friend

455
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,340
of ours, when he tried them first, he texted me and he's like, dude, these things aren't that bad.

456
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,860
You made it sound like these things were horrible. And I was like, when I had it, I thought I was

457
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,380
drinking kerosene or jet fuel. I thought I was going to die, go blind first, then die. He goes,

458
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,780
no, no, no, this stuff's good. He goes, actually, I wouldn't call it a sipping key tone, but it's

459
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,460
actually pretty... I was talking to the guys at Human and the T Delta S folks, I think they've

460
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,900
done a good job kind of making them less ridiculous. They must really have tasted bad when you tried

461
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,020
it. Because I personally think it's closer to the kerosene side than the... It was so bad,

462
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:55,180
Rhonda, that there was a good three month period where my favorite thing to do, more than anything

463
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,980
in the world, was if anyone came over to my house for dinner, they had to try one finger dip worth

464
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,300
of stuff. And of course, the first time I drank it, I just took 50 ml and chugged it neat without

465
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,380
mixing it or anything like that. And I feel they just getting people to try this stuff.

466
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,580
The salts are obviously much more palatable. Yeah, I've tried the salts.

467
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,060
Less studied, but more palatable. I didn't really... I certainly didn't feel like I had the same

468
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:26,780
effects as the ester. And also, if I took a really high dose of it, I felt like I had some GI distress.

469
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,860
Absolutely. And I have also noticed that for some people, that is... For me, that's the case. So I

470
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:38,860
cannot take the BHB ester on an empty stomach. The only way I can tolerate that at high doses is

471
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:44,140
either to put it with powdered MCT or actually just take it with a meal, which in many ways defeats

472
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,500
the purpose because I like it as a way to avoid meals. Did it lower your blood glucose? Because

473
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,660
so significantly, it was astounding. Yeah, no, it's pretty impressive.

474
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,620
That needs to be studied. Yeah. Yeah. And I know that Jeff Wu, the CEO at Human,

475
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,220
is very interested in that. And I republished a post I wrote five years ago on exogenous ketones

476
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,140
a couple of weeks ago. And a lot of scientists have reached out and said, hey, we're really

477
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,740
interested in studying this. What can you tell us about this? And so I think people are starting to

478
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,700
realize that's an interesting way to lower glucose. Really significantly. More than 20%.

479
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,460
I dropped 30 points. Wow. Yeah, that's perfect.

480
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:29,740
Yeah. Like after a high carbohydrate, like I said, I had oatmeal with some blueberries. It was nuts.

481
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:36,140
Of course, my blood sugar because at the time too, I mean, I've just been nursing at night. And so

482
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,780
waking up multiple times, that is terrible for your blood glucose levels and such. But so they

483
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,220
were a little higher than usual. But yeah, I dropped me 30 points. Well, yeah, that's more

484
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,860
than we typically see. Is it? Yeah. On the topic of blood glucose, have you ever experimented with

485
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:56,300
Acrobose? No, I've experimented with it with cells and culture, but not like personally.

486
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,900
This stuff's pretty interesting. It works quite well. Yeah. I'll certainly, if I'm going to

487
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,140
indulge in some high carb action, I'm going to take a hundred milligrams of Acrobose beforehand

488
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,900
and just flatline my glucose. Wow. In many ways, I find it actually more potent than metformin

489
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,740
at glucose reduction. I mean, I think metformin has many other effects that we'll probably get

490
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,900
into as well. Let's go back to the IGF thing. Yeah. Because this is sort of the thing that,

491
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,540
here's the thing, I'll just jump right to my punchline and my question with this. There are

492
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,900
two issues I now have with things I used to take to be the God's honest truth. Actually, three

493
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:38,140
things. The first is I found Cynthia Kenyon's work on the DAF-16 mutants in C. elegans to be the most

494
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:47,580
convincing evidence of the role of IGF or attenuating IGF in longevity. And I now question

495
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,460
that, not question the work, but question the inference that that can be applied to humans

496
00:42:53,020 --> 00:43:01,740
given the fact that only their germ cells divide. And therefore cancer in that organism looks

497
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,340
nothing like cancer in us. Cancer in that organism is only a cell getting larger. There is no

498
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,300
proliferation. We have to sort of, I mean, it's obvious, it's the risk of stating the obvious,

499
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,740
which is we're not worms, but that's a huge difference in biology. So that's the first

500
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,180
thing. Let me let you comment on that. Yes, because I've done those experiments.

501
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,020
Actually, that's probably what straight out of college. And I went to work at the Salk Institute

502
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,700
with Andrew Dillon, who trained with Cynthia Kenyon. I was a chemistry major in college and I

503
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,260
decided I kind of wanted to try some real biology. Say I only had a little bit of biology in college.

504
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,500
And so I went to work at the Salk and really it was like those first experiments I did

505
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:46,700
with worms where we would knock down the insulin IGF-1 signaling pathway, also known as the DEV-2.

506
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,420
And the worms would live literally 100% longer. They'd go from two weeks to four weeks, right?

507
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,500
Yeah. I mean, it was like, and not only that, the worms were so youthful. You would look at these

508
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,420
worms, because it's all I would do day after day under a microscope is just picking and poking and

509
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,300
looking at the worms and how they move. And as they get older, they start to become less mobile.

510
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,940
And I mean, it's just very obvious. It's the most convincing data, right?

511
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,620
It is very convincing. And now it's me in my mind was kind of like when I was like,

512
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,460
holy shit, we have a gene that's sort of homologous to this. And this is happening in those worms.

513
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,180
I want to understand that. And here's the thing about that data. And this is what I think,

514
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:28,300
if you get rid of another gene that's homologous to Foxo, DEV-16.

515
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,460
Oh, DEV-16 is right. That's homologous to Foxo.

516
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:36,700
It completely obliterates the lifespan extension, meaning it's the Foxo-3 that seems to be really

517
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,540
important for the life. We have how many? We have four Foxos?

518
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,900
You mean different Fox genes? Yeah.

519
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,660
Okay. Yeah. I don't know exactly how many, but the Foxo, we have three.

520
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,860
We have one, two, and four. Was it one, two, and three?

521
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,100
I thought there was like a one, two, four, five. But their analog is 16. I remember that, right?

522
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,020
Their DEV-16 is basically our Foxo. Yes. Foxo. Yeah. So, okay. Well, anyways,

523
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,780
yeah, I'm not sure I'm getting confused with the number.

524
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,460
You know this better than I do, but okay, yeah.

525
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,540
But what is interesting is that the lifespan extension was completely like ameliorated.

526
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,660
And did their health span curves, because the experiment you're describing,

527
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,900
and no one can see what I'm doing, but you know what I'm talking about, like the natural

528
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:19,020
was a two-week lifespan where for the first week, they're youthful, and then they have a declining

529
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,140
health span curve. So at the time of their death, they're totally decrepit. In the experiment,

530
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,860
you're describing, if I'm thinking of the same one, you doubled the lifespan, and their

531
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,740
longevity curve became a square function. It just went out and boom.

532
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,500
Kind of. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's exactly what happened. But you get rid of the DEV-16,

533
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,900
and they're like wild type. Oh, they're like wild type. Okay.

534
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,140
And that largely has to do with, you know, so that the IGF-1 insulin signaling pathway both

535
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,500
inhibit Foxo-3. So if you get rid of that inhibition, constitutively, Foxo-3 is constantly

536
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,020
active in those worms. I mean, it's just like super, you know, they're making superoxide

537
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,540
dismutase, they're making more stem cells, they're making just everything's active, you know,

538
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,380
more autophagy, more stress, like all these stress resistance pathways. I mean,

539
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:05,820
Foxo-3 is a transcription factor. It regulates a whole host of genes, many of which have to do with

540
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:11,260
DNA repair, autophagy, stem cell function, production of antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory

541
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,820
pathways. So it's a lot of really good stuff. You want active all the time. So there's that

542
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:21,180
component to the longevity pathway. And actually, if you look at the animal data from rodents where

543
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:28,060
they're caloric restricted, if you get rid of the Foxo-3, the median lifespan extension is gone.

544
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,420
So the lifespan extension depends on Foxo-3. The cancer stuff was still like, it didn't matter.

545
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,700
So the cancer reduction didn't depend on Foxo-3, only the lifespan extension. So I think there may

546
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:45,180
be an uncoupling between humans and IGF-1. One of the major problems with IGF-1 is actually cancer.

547
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:50,060
And if you look at, you know, animal studies, if you look at human studies like humans that have

548
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,620
polymorphisms that make them have more IGF-1, they have much higher cancer incidence, vice

549
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,020
versa. So if you look at people that have polymorphisms, I think- Is that the case? I mean,

550
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,780
we look at the opposites, right? We look at the ones that have low GH and by proxy low IGF and

551
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,460
have less cancer. So you're talking about Laron syndrome. Yeah. So Laron syndrome, yes, they do.

552
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,340
But I think there's also another one in IGF. There's HETs and IGF-1 receptor. So this is,

553
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,620
you're not talking about acromegaly or people that are making too much GH.

554
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:26,060
They also are more susceptible to cancer as well. Yes. I am talking about them as well, actually.

555
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:30,300
The people with acromegaly are more susceptible to cancer. Maybe I am. That's what I was referring

556
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:35,340
to with that have higher circulating levels of IGF-1. So you're saying you can't uncouple the

557
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,260
growth hormone from IGF-1? Yeah. That's been one of the things I've struggled with is it's hard to

558
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:45,020
uncouple the GH, the effect of GH on the liver. In humans. Yes. Yeah, exactly. But animal studies,

559
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,740
that has been uncoupled. If you do any sort of tumor transplant animals and then

560
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,380
make them have IGF-1 through a variety of modalities, the cancer will grow rapidly.

561
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:00,460
So how do we explain the human epidemiology? There are a few people that are more critical

562
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,380
of epidemiology than me. I'm not a particular fan of it. But I find it to be quite interesting in

563
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,620
the negative, meaning the contra positives within epidemiology can be quite interesting.

564
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:16,940
So this is the next thing that got me going, wait a minute. And that was, there's a U-shaped

565
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:23,100
mortality curve that is skewed to the right for IGF and all-cause mortality, cancer mortality,

566
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:30,380
cardiovascular mortality, and neurodegenerative mortality. But when you uncouple them by disease,

567
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:36,140
you see a very interesting pattern. So all-cause mortality, as IGF goes up, it actually starts to

568
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:43,900
go down. It naders at the 70th percentile and then it starts to rise. But it doesn't get as high

569
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,300
as it started. I know for people listening, this is confusing, so we'll include the figures of all

570
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:54,780
these from the papers. But the point is, it's not that as IGF goes up, mortality goes up.

571
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,860
It's the opposite for 70% of the ledger, only at the very end. In other words, only high levels

572
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,740
of IGF, very high levels of IGF seem problematic. And as I know you've talked about, I've heard you

573
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:11,580
talk about this on your podcast, you have to then desegregate that by age. The older you get,

574
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,740
the better IGF seems to be, presumably because of the preservation of lean tissue.

575
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:23,420
It turns out that most of the uptick in the mortality above the 70th percentile is driven

576
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:28,140
by cancer. But actually cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease seem to get,

577
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,780
they flatline by the end. So meaning there was no benefit to being at the 100th percentile

578
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,740
or the 99th percentile versus the 80th versus the 70th, but you weren't getting penalized for it,

579
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:43,500
which suggested to me that low IGF might not be the ticket. Maybe it's some combination of

580
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:49,740
cycling high and low IGF, but living at around the median to slightly above that, the 60th,

581
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,300
the 70th percentile. And again, that's probably more a function of my misunderstanding of the

582
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,980
literature five years ago, but I really came away thinking IGF, we've got to keep that as low as

583
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,020
possible. It's funny, you and I have- We've evolved in the-

584
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:07,900
Yeah, very similar because I now also think that IGF-1 does play a very important role,

585
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,540
obviously in development, but also in the repair of muscle, in the growth of muscle,

586
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,540
preserving muscle mass. Also, it gets transported across the blood-brain barrier,

587
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,180
plays an important role in neurogenesis and allowing existing neurons to survive,

588
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:27,500
which brings me back to that gray matter thing with the lemurs. And the thing that was interesting to

589
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:34,860
me was the effect of exercise on IGF-1. And the fact that for one, it's been shown that the boost

590
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:41,180
in neurogenesis after exercise in the brain via brain drive requires IGF-1. Animal studies have

591
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,140
shown that mostly in rodents have shown that exercise causes IGF-1 across the blood-brain

592
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:52,220
barrier, get into the brain. But in human studies, I've also seen some showing that it does lower

593
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,620
serum levels. I think presumably it's also going into the muscle and the brain. So I think that

594
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,660
people that are exercising, they're putting that IGF-1 to the places where it's supposed to go,

595
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,620
muscle tissue, brain tissue as well. But in addition to that, and this is what's more recent

596
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,100
work from Dr. Walter Longo, is that we know that he does his prolonged fast and I think the prolonged

597
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:20,540
fasting is extremely interesting for a couple of main reasons. And one is, I think that it has

598
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:27,100
tremendous potential for the treatment of autoimmune disease and also cancer based on

599
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:33,420
his work. And what he has shown now in animal studies and some pilot clinical studies is that

600
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:40,860
doing a prolonged fast and or in some cases, the fasting mimicking diet causes this massive

601
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:47,740
shrinking of organs where he doesn't know how much of it's due to cell size decreasing versus

602
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,860
apoptosis. He does know apoptosis is occurring and he has showed that in multiple publications.

603
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:58,300
There is a massive induction of apoptosis after a prolonged fast, which makes sense because it's

604
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:04,060
a very strong stress. And then after, during the refeeding phase, their organs basically come back.

605
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:09,660
They come back, they grow, regrow. And presumably selectively repopulate. Yeah. So he's shown that

606
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:15,500
the stem cells get activated. So basically, they have to be activated by the low IGF-1,

607
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,060
but then to proliferate and differentiate into whatever tissue type we're talking about, let's

608
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:26,220
say we're talking about the immune system, then IGF-1 is required for that proliferation and

609
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:32,060
differentiation and repopulation of the tissue, which means you can't just keep the IGF-1 low.

610
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,300
The refeeding is just as important as the deprivation. And the IGF-1 is key in that.

611
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,980
And so, you know, what he's shown now is that you can take, for example, in the multiple sclerosis

612
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,940
animal model, you can actually cause stem cells to be activated through the prolonged fast and

613
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:50,940
then during the refeeding phase, the stem cells make non-disfunctional. So they're making normal,

614
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,500
non-auto-immune cells. And he's done like a pilot clinical study with multiple sclerosis,

615
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,420
people with multiple sclerosis, and it's helped with symptoms. But he's also done these cancer

616
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,900
studies. And this is kind of where there's been some clinical studies that he's been involved with,

617
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,540
like a 48-hour water fast that's been done in patients undergoing standard of care treatment.

618
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:14,860
And he's shown that it was tolerable. Not only that, there seemed to be less myelotoxicity,

619
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:19,020
less neutropenia. So basically, they're – and it sensitized cancer cells to death. So not only

620
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,980
were the cancer cells dying more, but less of the normal cells were dying. And then he's gone ahead

621
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,540
and shown this in animal models, also with the fasting mimicking diet. And it's like if you look

622
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,460
at the data, particularly in the animal model, because they can, you know, do all the tissue

623
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,180
harvesting and stuff, I mean, it's like – it's so phenomenal that I would not be surprised that in

624
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,060
the next 10 years, it will be required part of standard of care because it seems to be so

625
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:46,460
incredibly robust at selectively killing cancer cells, which, you know, makes sense. I mean,

626
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,740
oncogenes, they screw up all sorts of things. One of them is the stress response. And, you know,

627
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,580
cancer cells can't respond to stress. They're primed to die. I mean, it's – I spent a long

628
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:01,500
time, you know, studying cancer cell metabolism, apoptosis with Doug Green and Joseph Opperman at

629
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,460
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. And that's kind of one of the primary ways that a lot of these

630
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,580
chemotherapeutic drugs, if they can get to the tumor site, work, is that because it's a stress,

631
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:16,380
cancer cells can't handle it, you know, they die. So I kind of went off on a tangent here.

632
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,100
So to get back to the IGF-1 – Let me say one thing going back to what you just said that is also

633
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,100
interesting, but in the same thing. So I agree that I think that it would really be great if

634
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:30,700
patients had a better insight into nutrition going into chemotherapy. And the few times I go and give

635
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:36,860
talks at hospitals or go and talk at like a cancer meeting, I'm amazed at how resistant the

636
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:41,660
oncologists are. On average, obviously there were exceptions, but on average to interfering with

637
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:48,060
nutrition. Because in many ways, their primary concern tragically is preserving weight. And so

638
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,780
I always get a little verklempt when I walk through an oncology ward and I see patients drinking in

639
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:57,740
sure. Like, I couldn't think of a worse thing you'd want to consume when you have cancer.

640
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,460
And yet the goal is, hey, we got to fatten these people up. So I agree with you. And I really hope

641
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:07,420
that this research is accelerated because I do think patients would benefit greatly from this.

642
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,140
And the other application that I saw of this several years ago – This is quite old now,

643
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:16,620
but it blew my mind. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Jay Mitchell's work up at Harvard.

644
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:22,220
He did an experiment where he took three groups of mice. So the first group were

645
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,540
constitutively calorically restricted for their entire life. These were probably like one and

646
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:31,260
a half year old mice. So they're about halfway through their life. Starting the adult. Yeah,

647
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:38,220
so these animals were constantly at 70% caloric intake. The next group was your control group.

648
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:45,260
And then your third group was ad libitum diet until two days before an operation. And at which

649
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,980
point they were calorie restricted to a near fast. And I'd have to go back and look. I can't remember

650
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,380
if it was 24 or 48 hours of fasting. It might have been a 24 hour fast. 48 would be pretty extreme

651
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,500
for mice. So in summary, you've got control. This straight up eating, you've got 70%

652
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:07,420
or 30% CR forever. And then you've got control and then fasted for a day. All the mice were then

653
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,940
operated on where their femoral arteries were ligated, held for a period of time,

654
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,860
and then they were reperfused. For people not familiar with what that means. So that means you

655
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,300
open the animal up, you put clamps on the femoral arteries, which would basically stop all perfusion

656
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:27,180
of blood to the lower part of the body. And then after some period of time, just before you kill

657
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:31,820
the animal, you release that and then you reperfuse the blood. Basically the oxygen

658
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,100
reperfuses the organism that's considered a reperfusion injury, which is about one of the

659
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,300
most stressful things you can do to an organism so that you can really rapidly kill someone by

660
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,060
doing that. And that's something that in surgery happens quite a bit. For example,

661
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,980
you end up having to clamp something off to repair something downstream of that.

662
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:56,540
Okay. So what happened was all of the control animals died without exception. Of the other two

663
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:02,300
groups, the groups that were either calorie restricted for life or transiently starved

664
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,700
before the surgery, a significant subset did not die. And I can't remember the number. And again,

665
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,140
I know we're going to probably link to this study. So people are going to listen to this and go,

666
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,460
that idiot got all those details wrong, but this is the gist of it. A non-trivial subset of them

667
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:21,100
lived. And what's interesting is you could get the same benefit by an acute period of caloric

668
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,980
restriction in proximity to an insult that you could get by a lifelong of caloric restriction.

669
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:31,420
And the third piece that was interesting was the group that were just starved transiently actually

670
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,220
had a faster recovery, which again, they were fitter organisms. I remember the first time I came

671
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,220
across that thinking there's got to be something to cycling. And people used to always ask me like,

672
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,460
why are you on a ketogenic diet every minute of every day? Would there be any benefit in cycling?

673
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,940
Now I still don't know the answer to that question, but I'm more curious about it now

674
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,500
based on what you just described from Vaulter's work, plus this type of stuff,

675
00:57:54,060 --> 00:58:00,700
plus just the general ethos of the way we evolved. We've fasted, we fed, we fasted, we fed,

676
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:06,220
we fasted a long time, we gorged. It just seems we've evolved for cycling.

677
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:11,580
Right. Yeah, I agree. It's really that with Vaulter's work, I just I'm so excited about the

678
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:16,140
prolonged fasting and the potential benefits of it. I think that actually something that you and

679
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,700
I discussed several years ago, and I had you interviewed you on my podcast, that you brought

680
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:26,220
up that I thought was really interesting had to do with like the failed clinical trials with binding

681
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:31,900
IGF-1 in cancer. And Vaulter brought up something interesting in a conversation I had with him. And

682
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:40,780
that is possibly that we now know IGF-1 having low and IGF-1 is important. So if you're constantly

683
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:45,420
having low IGF-1 and the IGF-1 is important for the immune system or population, you can imagine

684
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,620
the context of cancer when you're giving other treatments along with it, that would be important

685
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:55,580
because your immune system is key in working off cancer. And I thought that was a really interesting

686
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,620
point. Of course, we don't have evidence of that. But I think it's something that would be interesting

687
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:06,300
to investigate and it makes sense. Yeah, I definitely am on the same page with you. I'm not,

688
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,820
like I started out with saying, I don't think that chronic caloric restriction and low IGF-1 is the

689
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:18,140
essential like way for improving health span. I do think that IGF-1, you want it to go to your muscle,

690
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:21,740
you want it to go to your brain. So I think people should definitely be active, especially if they're

691
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:26,380
eating a high protein and or even high carbohydrate or something that's going to produce a lot of

692
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:30,460
insulin. They shouldn't be eating refined carbs, but people do. If they're eating them, they should

693
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:36,300
definitely be exercising. That's another change in my belief system, I think, today versus, I don't

694
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,540
know, five or six years ago. I think five or six years ago, I didn't think exercise was that

695
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:45,020
important to longevity, which actually sounds ridiculous for anyone who knows me because I

696
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,260
was probably exercising four hours a day, but not because I believed it would make me live longer.

697
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:56,700
It was just sort of soothing my addictions. But I think today I feel I am much more convinced by a

698
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:01,980
lot of the data you've described, certainly the central stuff. When we published this paper

699
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,140
earlier this year with Richard Isaacson that you and I were talking about before we started recording,

700
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,140
we wanted to get a sense of like, if you took a completely unbiased approach and look at the

701
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,620
literature, what was the single most compelling thing you could do to generate or preserve brain

702
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:20,620
health? And we came away thinking that it was actually exercise. And I remember when the

703
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,060
analysts were kind of going through this and showing me all the data, I was like, come on,

704
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:30,220
guys, there's no way exercise could be the most important thing for brain health. And again,

705
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,620
I'm saying this as a guy who loves exercise more than anybody, but it just struck me as there's

706
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:39,260
no way. And again, I think part of it was I was just thinking about it through the vascular lens.

707
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:45,020
And obviously, you know, I think better than I do that when you start to think about brain health,

708
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,380
you have to think about it through a vascular lens, a metabolic lens, growth factor lens. I mean,

709
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,260
there were overlapping but distinct pathways that are going to influence brain health. And so

710
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:01,660
I was kind of humbled by that. And now, I guess in many ways, I'm a little more adamant about it

711
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:07,660
with my patients. Not that I wasn't, you know, adamant before, but this is like, boy, if you're

712
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:13,820
not active every day, like, we got to change that. I actually the main reason I exercise is for my

713
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,860
brain is certainly just not only for, you know, preventing neurodegenerative disease and atrophy

714
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:23,180
and all that, but just because it affects my executive function and affects my anxiety levels,

715
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,820
it affects my ability to make decisions. I absolutely, if I have something that's bothering

716
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,380
me, you're giving me anxiety, or have to make a really important decision, going for a long run

717
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,420
really helps me. And there's been studies showing that it helps with executive function,

718
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:43,020
long term planning, like aerobic exercise, specifically, you know, and then high intensity

719
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,420
interval training, all that stuff, they all they all do different things.

720
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,180
Well, that's the thing we couldn't we couldn't tease this out of the literature, which again,

721
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:54,060
probably is just a limitation of shitty human clinical trials. But that's the second order

722
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:57,660
question, right? Which is if you're going to take the Tim Ferriss approach, which is what's the

723
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,380
minimum effective dose? Because there are some people like maybe you or I, who I think just

724
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:07,420
generally like exercise and also get these other benefits, these endorphin benefits. But there are

725
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:11,820
some people who are like, look, what do I need to do? Like, I'm going to treat exercise like medicine.

726
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:16,700
And I think in that setting, I'm still not clear. So if you were that person, would I say Rhonda,

727
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,540
as long as you are lifting weights, one hour, three times a week, like if you can only give

728
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:27,340
me three hours, would that be how I'd want you to spend it? Or would I rather you be doing anaerobic

729
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:32,780
aerobic type thing like I mean, that's, to me, those are where these biomarkers start to become

730
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:37,020
very important, because we're not going to generate hard outcome studies with that level of control.

731
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,100
Once you, you know, try to control that many variables and be that strict about it, you're

732
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:47,180
going to very much lose a hard outcome prospectively. But if we knew what to measure, right, and that's,

733
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:53,020
you know, would we be measuring an integral of IGF, for example, so how much it rises, how much it

734
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:57,180
falls, and then what that looks like over time. But I guess that's the funny thing, right? Like the

735
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,140
more we learn, the less we know. Yeah, absolutely. I think that we definitely don't know the answer to

736
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,860
that question. But I think there's a lot of data out there showing, for example, strength training,

737
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,860
you know, there's benefits on the brain that's been shown published, this benefits on preventing

738
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,740
muscle atrophy, there's benefits on preventing cancer incident, like, that's all been shown for

739
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:20,220
strength training for aerobic. And you know, this high intensity interval training is also, also

740
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:25,900
seems to be making its way as well. Like, like there was a study that I that I found VO2 max,

741
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:31,420
this is, you know, the ability of your your body to transport oxygen during exercise, which also is

742
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:35,660
an indicator of when you're not exercising, and obviously transporting oxygen to the brain,

743
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:41,340
for example, is extremely important. VO2 max declines with age, like 1% per year,

744
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,620
I forgot starting at what age, but you know, so 10% per decade.

745
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,020
So that's almost parallels the muscle mass decline.

746
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:51,180
It does, it does parallel. Exactly. And there was a study showing that 24 sessions of high

747
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,540
intensity interval training where it was like a 45 minute session, five minute warm up,

748
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,620
five minute cool down, and then you know, in between the max intervals, which were like,

749
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:05,260
pretty long, like a minute, there was, you know, the 70% of max water. Anyway, so

750
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:10,860
24 of those increased VO2 max by 12%. So you're literally taking an entire decade

751
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,900
of decline and like reversing it with the 24.

752
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:18,140
Yeah, that's, that's actually a good point. I when I was more active as a sort of competitive,

753
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,900
you know, in cycling, you we would get our VO2 max tested about twice a year.

754
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,740
Ryan Flaherty, who we were talking about before the podcast, who's one of my close friends,

755
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:30,380
and you've got to know him as well. I learned from Ryan that actually VO2 max is not the

756
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:35,820
most important indicator as a runner or cyclist. It's V VO2 max or P VO2 max that matters. In other

757
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:41,340
words, for a runner, V VO2 max is much more predictive of performance, which is the velocity

758
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:47,820
you carry at VO2 max. And for a cyclist, it's P VO2 max, which is the power output at VO2 max.

759
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:53,980
That said, every time you go to test, you want it to test well. So, you know, over time I learned

760
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:58,300
how to game the system. You know, I want to make sure my VO2 max is in the 70s, which again, to put

761
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,140
that in perspective, like that's not at the level of professional athlete or something like the guys

762
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:06,780
that are winning the Tour de France are in the high 80s or low 90s in terms of milligrams per

763
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:14,780
mil per kilogram. But nevertheless, just altering my training for three weeks before a VO2 max test

764
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:20,460
and dropping my weight. So if I shed two kilograms and did those types of intervals, I actually had

765
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:24,780
it down to a science where there was a workout I would do, you know, in Carmel Valley, you've got

766
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,820
the 56 that goes out and it's got a bike path next to it. There's a section of that bike path

767
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:38,860
that is 1.6 miles long and it goes up at about 4%. And just doing repeat intervals of that,

768
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:43,820
which takes about four minutes all out to go one direction and then about six minutes to cruise back,

769
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:50,780
four of those, that was it twice a week for like three weeks and your VO2 max exploded.

770
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:56,940
Now, of course, the question is, is that like, you know, cramming for the test, getting the result,

771
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,340
but not necessarily like, do you have to keep doing that to get the decade long benefit? I don't know

772
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:07,820
the answer, but I agree that like, if you can maintain muscle mass and you can maintain peak

773
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:13,020
aerobic performance, it's not, it doesn't even matter at that point. If you're living longer,

774
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:18,620
you're clearly living better, right? Like if you, if you don't budge anything on maximum lifespan,

775
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,900
you've dramatically improved median lifespan. Right. And that's, you know,

776
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:25,260
I think for most people, that's what matters. It is. Yeah. For me, it is. I mean,

777
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,100
what's the, what's the maximum lifespan that like a human's lived 120?

778
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,020
124 or something like that. Is it 124? 121 or 124, maybe.

779
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:37,740
Something like that. Yeah. Living beyond that. I mean, that's, I think the goal is really to,

780
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:42,140
at least for me, I think that's a lot more achievable is increasing my, my median

781
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,540
health span, my, my health span, you know? So, so basically preventing, staving off

782
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:51,100
cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, those sorts of things so that I'm,

783
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:58,220
so that I'm living healthier and also, you know, a little bit longer, but obviously not 125 or six.

784
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:05,180
Yeah. I don't really subscribe to the theory that we're going to meet some take off point where,

785
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:09,500
you know, there's immortality. I'm really not convinced that that's, that that's sort of

786
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:15,180
biologically possible. And I don't suspect I'll be alive at a time when it would ever come to

787
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:20,460
fruition. I don't remember the journal. It was a paper that came out of Japan and the study

788
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:27,580
looked at a variety of people of different ages. So elderly population, centenarians,

789
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:32,620
which are a hundred semi-super centenarians, which are between a hundred and 105 and then

790
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:39,420
super centenarians, which are 105 plus and looked at a variety of biomarkers for health and aging.

791
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:45,500
So telomeres, senescence, kidney function, glycated hemoglobin, lipid, the whole lipid panel,

792
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,980
triglycerides, kidney function, hematopoiesis, like all that stuff was looked at inflammatory

793
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:57,180
biomarkers. And what was found is that aside from age, what was predictive of being able to basically

794
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:03,980
stay alive was low inflammation, like more than hematopoiesis, more than glycated hemoglobin,

795
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,340
blood glucose levels, lipid, all that stuff. It was basically the ability to suppress inflammation.

796
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:13,980
Like that was predictive of cognitive function and also basically staying alive.

797
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:17,420
Do you remember what they looked at? Were they looking at C-reactive protein and things like that?

798
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,540
They looked at a whole panel. No, they, they, they,

799
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,980
they looked at the interleukins and stuff also.

800
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,780
Yeah, TNF. They looked at a whole panel of, and also some immune cells that are indicative,

801
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,780
indicative of inflammation. So there was a whole panel of biomarkers that were looked at for

802
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:36,060
inflammation. HPV, Titer or something was also looked at. So the interesting thing about that

803
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:42,300
study was that the inflammation was so key for each age group, right? Like even more than all

804
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:47,180
this other stuff, like that I've thought about like senescence and telomeres and low blood glucose

805
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,420
levels and all that stuff. And so I really, and if you look at some of the rodent literature,

806
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:56,700
for example, I remember the study where NF-kappa B, which is classically thought about as an

807
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:02,300
inflammatory mediator, which it is, it also has an anti-inflammatory component to it. And if you

808
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:07,180
get rid of the anti-inflammatory component, rodents will have this sort of low level of

809
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:11,900
chronic inflammation because every time it's activated, there's not that anti-inflammatory

810
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,260
part that's kind of keeping it in check. And so there's kind of like this, like lower

811
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:20,540
chronic inflammation that's happening. And those animals live like 30% less. So their,

812
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,860
so their life spans cut short by about 30%. So that's kind of interesting, right? You're that

813
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,820
just getting rid of that little anti-inflammatory component of just one major regulator of immune

814
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:34,380
system has a profound effect on lifespan. And then of course, if you look at SNPs and stuff,

815
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,380
of course, you can always find, you know, well, since inerians have a higher percentage of

816
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:44,380
10 in anti-inflammatory anyways, you know, so the inflammation, it's an interesting finding that

817
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:49,980
suppressing inflammation seems to be important for at least, you know, according to that study for

818
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:54,620
making it to every part of, you know, I don't know what you would call it every basically

819
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:59,260
progressing to the maximum level, that maximum lifespan level that humans can possibly live.

820
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,860
Well, there was a clinical trial published either earlier this year or last year that looked at an

821
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:12,220
IL-1 antagonist. And so this was a study that took people and made no change in their lipid

822
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:17,740
metabolism, lipid biomarker. And, you know, this was they, they didn't do anything to the patients

823
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:23,020
as far as differentiating the groups by traditional biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.

824
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:27,420
But one group was given a placebo, one group was given an IL-1 antagonist. And the question was,

825
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,620
could that impact cardiovascular mortality? And we've long talked about how cardiovascular

826
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:39,100
disease is sort of this trifecta of lipoproteins, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

827
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:43,580
But this was in many ways, the most elegant first test of that in humans using

828
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:49,100
heart outcomes. So major adverse cardiac event, stroke, MI, death. The hypothesis was found to

829
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:55,100
be correct. So the patients getting the IL-1 antagonist, despite having no difference in

830
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:00,700
lipids or any other biomarker, had an improved outcome with respect to cardiovascular health.

831
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:07,340
About a month ago, another trial that was using low dose of methotrexate, which is an immune

832
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:13,820
suppressant, was halted early. And the results will not be announced until this fall. But if you

833
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:20,540
read kind of the fine print, it does not appear it was halted for a bad reason. Meaning it might have

834
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:26,300
been halted actually for basically early efficacy, which presumably would have been in the group

835
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:31,180
getting the methotrexate. So again, we won't know that until the meeting in October, I think, when

836
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:36,460
this will be presented. But if that turns out to be the case, that's pretty interesting because now

837
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,940
you've taken something that we practically have great examples of, like the one you've given,

838
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:45,340
and now potentially there's ways to think about using it. So taking a step back from all of this

839
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:49,500
stuff, like, of course, I think about it at the level of like, I'm just a mechanic, right? It's

840
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:55,100
like, how can you manipulate these things in people? Like cycling, using nutrition and fasting

841
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:00,940
to cycle IGF, maybe even using an exogenous growth hormone, for all we know. I've always been quite

842
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:05,980
skeptical of growth hormones use in the field of longevity, but maybe periods of oscillating

843
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:11,420
rapamycin and growth hormone and fasting where you're cycling high periods of anabolic, high

844
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:16,140
periods of catabolic phase, maybe there's something to it, and then cycling agents like

845
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:22,220
methotrexate and all these things. So I don't know. My hope is like in 10 years, we've got

846
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:29,500
a complete personalized toolkit for how everybody could figure out exactly what drugs or hormones or

847
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,980
nutrients to take and cycle and how to do it. And then of course, the key is you have to be able to

848
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:38,940
measure stuff. You know, the the with the cardiovascular rate of mortality, the sauna is

849
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:43,180
something that is interesting to me for that for that reason, because of the profound effects that

850
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:49,020
it has specifically on lowering cardiovascular related mortality. And of course, there's some

851
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,660
clinical trials showing that, you know, there's a variety of other biomarkers and potential

852
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,980
mechanisms by that for which that's happening. But if you look at some of the data by Dr.

853
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:01,980
Yari Laukonen out of Finland, if you look at some of the observational studies, you know, where

854
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:06,700
there's like a couple thousand men that were doing it sauna so ubiquitous in Finland. But if

855
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,940
you look at, for example, men that are using it two to three times a week versus four to seven

856
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:15,900
times a week versus once a week. And you look at, for example, cardiovascular rate of mortality,

857
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:21,420
two to three times a week, it's lowered by like 27%. But when you jump to 47 times a week, it goes

858
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:27,900
up to 40. All cause mortality goes to 40. All cause mortality is also lowered. dementia and

859
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,980
Alzheimer's disease again, like, like 20% lowered if you're doing two to three. I'm so glad you

860
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,420
brought this up because I almost forgot and I wanted to talk to you about this. This is one of

861
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:42,380
those things where I think three years ago, I was completely dismissive of this stuff, which is to

862
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:47,660
say I still love going into a sauna because the one thing that I felt sauna really mattered for

863
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:53,100
was sleep and not for the growth hormone level. But because I think there's pretty good data that

864
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:58,700
a great way to sleep is to create a high gradient of temperature. So the faster, the more negative,

865
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:04,220
the derivative of temperature DT by DT, when you sleep, the faster you'll go to sleep and the

866
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:09,660
longer you'll stay asleep. So a sauna before bed, if you could jump in the sauna, then take a cold

867
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,740
shower, then jump into a cold bed, you're going to sleep like a baby. I've done it. It's absolutely

868
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:20,380
true. It's remarkable. Yeah. So I always accepted that, but I looked at all of that epidemiologic

869
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:25,580
stuff and I was like, the healthy user bias here is through the roof. Like I came up with a hundred

870
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:30,780
reasons why I just couldn't believe it, including saunas are painful. So if you are fit enough to

871
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:35,420
sit in a sauna seven days a week versus the guy who can only sit in it one day a week, like how

872
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:41,660
do I know that that's not driving it? Now, since that time I've become a lot more interested

873
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:47,980
because now the mechanisms are starting to become more well understood. And so I'd love to have you

874
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:52,380
talk a little bit more about this because I know you've talked about this a lot on your podcast,

875
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:59,580
but in many ways, your pursuit of this has become one of the more convincing arguments in my

876
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:04,940
thinking on the actual health benefits of this independent of the healthy user benefits of this.

877
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:11,100
Yeah, the healthy user benefits. So of course, with Yari's work, he's tried to correct for all

878
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,660
that physical activity that he's done everything like looking at lipid blood cholesterol numbers,

879
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:20,220
LDL number, like just like really, you know, try to try his best to kind of correct for that

880
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:25,020
healthy user bias. And of course, there's a dose dependence, which always makes it more convincing.

881
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,580
But he's then since published some some clinical trials where he's looked at, for example,

882
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:35,340
the arterial compliance, and of course, blood pressures. And that's one of the main things

883
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,740
that's affected his blood pressure, but also just like the ability of the arteries to like expand

884
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:45,340
and contract in response to pressure, like that's improved, which is really important. So I think

885
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:49,580
that, you know, obviously, the sauna, the heat itself does does affect, you know, blood flow,

886
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:55,580
plasma volume, all that stuff is change. So so I think that the cardiovascular aspects and Yari's

887
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:00,140
trying to really kind of tease apart more mechanisms, because he is a he's an MD PhD. He's a

888
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:06,380
cardiologist by training, but he's also got a PhD. So he's he's trying, you know, really hard to

889
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,460
to kind of understand exactly what's going on. But I do think that it's really seems convincing.

890
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:15,260
It's really convincing with the cardiovascular related mortality, specifically, it's very

891
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:19,660
robust. Personally, it's kind of interesting to think about how much of, you know, exercise

892
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:23,980
also elevates your core body temperature. I mean, there's this overlap there, you know, and when I

893
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:28,140
sit in a sauna, my heart rate starts to elevate like I'm doing cardiovascular. And that's that's

894
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:33,020
what happens. Like I'm doing cardiovascular exercise, start to sway. I mean, a lot of the same

895
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:38,620
adaptations that happen with exercise are happening when you're you're sitting in a hot sauna and even

896
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:43,820
a hot bath, like more recently, another study came out trying hot bath affected had a positive effect

897
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:48,700
on a variety of cardiovascular related markers as well, which again, but you have to sit in it long

898
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:53,100
enough, you know, to experience some of those effects with the elevation of the heart rate and

899
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,100
all that stuff. But there's also really profound effect on the immune system. Like,

900
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:05,020
part of the benefit of exercise is that it is an acute oxidative stress burst, an acute inflammatory

901
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:11,340
burst. You know, there's then a response to that. And the net response is a positive anti inflammatory

902
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:17,020
and antioxidant response, but the inflammatory and oxidant response is required to get that.

903
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:22,620
And something similar is happening with with the sauna as well. Recently, there was a study looking

904
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:27,500
by Dr. Charles raison, he had made this like fancy contraption where he elevated core body

905
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:33,180
temperature and he had a sham control. So actually, people the sham control also made people a little

906
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:38,220
bit hot, and they thought they were actually getting the treatment. But it had a very strong

907
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:43,420
antidepressant. How do they do that? He explains it on my podcast, so you can go to the transcript,

908
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:48,460
you can just kind of strikes me as one of the few things you can't placebo. He they did some crafty

909
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:54,140
thing, which I not going to try to explain, but I will absolutely botch it. They did it and and they

910
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:58,300
had a sham control. And in fact, about he said about 70% of the people that had the sham control

911
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,220
thought they had the actual treatment. So it were like there was definitely a they were trying to

912
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:07,420
control for the placebo effect. What's interesting is I even the reason I got into this sauna was

913
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:11,980
the effects that I felt on my mood when I was in graduate school, like I lived across the street

914
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:17,180
from YMCA. And so I started using this on and it was like, very black and white. Like I was like,

915
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:22,860
wow, this is amazing. Like I can handle all this wet sauna dry. So this was this is a dry sauna.

916
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:27,500
Do we have a sense of dry sauna versus IR versus all the different? Yeah, so I mean,

917
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:33,420
the infrared saunas are like, they only get to like about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. And it's not

918
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:39,100
very hot. If you look at Yari's work, like their saunas that they're using in Finland, they do they

919
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,820
have a lot of what they call low loo or something, which is like they throw the water on makes the

920
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:49,020
humid, which makes it really hot. I've been to Finland and try that tried the their saunas before.

921
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:54,620
But basically, the temperature gets to around 170 between 175 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit.

922
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:59,260
And most of the men in these studies are doing about 20 minutes to get the maximum benefits.

923
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:03,100
11 minutes had some benefits sitting in 11 minutes, but there was a stronger effect.

924
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,660
They stayed to 20 minutes. So if you're in a infrared sauna that only gets to 140 degrees

925
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:12,780
Fahrenheit, you probably would have to stay in a much longer to get the same benefit. Now, most

926
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:18,300
I see. So the IR doesn't doesn't get deeper penetration, thereby alleviating the need to

927
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,500
stay in at a higher temperature. It doesn't I mean, sometimes people talk about there's a lot of

928
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,580
marketing involved in a lot of that stuff. If you strip that out, though, if you strip that out,

929
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:30,540
the infrared saunas do affect the sweating mechanisms, like something to do with the

930
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,500
penetration there, you do sweat, which is great because you actually do excrete things like BPA

931
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,260
and phthalates and mercury and heavy metals and things like that from sweat. So that is

932
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:45,260
that's what a lot of those mark those straight up dry sauna to 170 degrees,

933
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:49,820
spend three or four nights a week in that my favorite. Yeah, that's personally, I would much

934
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:54,940
prefer sitting in a regular dry sauna or even a sauna that you can throw water on. You can throw

935
01:19:54,940 --> 01:20:00,940
water just not infrared sauna. Yeah, so that so that would be, you know, the obviously they're the

936
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:05,820
the fire hazard risk is more when you're having a sauna like that versus just an infrared. And the

937
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:11,100
infrared ones are I think cheaper as well. So it's certainly more convenient to have an infrared

938
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:17,740
sauna. But personally, I prefer for the other like the barrel saunas are really nice. There's also an

939
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:21,660
effect on the immune system. I was mentioning Charles raison he met he measured aisle six,

940
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:27,580
which is also it's part of the Janus cytokine because it does like it's, it's got like multiple

941
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:32,620
pleiotropic effects. And it's it's acutely released upon exercise as well. And it has it's very

942
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:37,500
important for you know, an anti inflammatory response, releasing myokines and all these things

943
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,060
and muscle. So it has, it's important for insulin sensitivity. A lot of the insulin sensitivity

944
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:47,100
effects exercise has so so the sauna does the same thing that the exercise does where there's just a

945
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:52,380
rapid aisle six release, at least according to Charles raison's data. And he said that actually

946
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:56,700
correlates with you know, I've never looked at I wear a continuous glucose monitor a lot, but I've

947
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,380
never really paid much attention to it in the sauna. And I don't have a sauna, but I'm going to

948
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:06,940
be this weekend at a friend's place who has a barrel sauna. And so I'll make sure that I document

949
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:12,220
what my glucose levels doing, because you would think transiently would go up, right? Right. But

950
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:17,820
I know that at least there's an one animal study where the heat stress, quote unquote animal sauna,

951
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:23,100
it actually increases glucose transporters and a type two diabetic model that actually improved

952
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:27,500
insulin sensitivity and lowered blood glucose, because the glucose was now being taken up into

953
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:32,380
muscle butter. So I wonder, you know, how much of the again, it's like you're you're affecting the

954
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,580
aisle six is is really important for that. And aisle six is released upon heat stress without

955
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:42,780
the exercise. So uncoupling, you know, how much of the benefits from exercise, there's certainly

956
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:47,500
some overlap. And I think that there's also there are separate benefits that exercise has as well,

957
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:52,940
independent of the heat stress component of it. But I certainly think there is a lot of overlap

958
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,620
between those two things. And so the sauna becomes very interesting. And there's the whole heat shock

959
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:01,500
protein part where you know, heat stress is one of the major ways to increase heat shock proteins,

960
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,460
which do play an important role in neurodegenerative preventing neurodegenerative diseases.

961
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:12,060
And I do think it's also really hard to uncouple the effects on the vascular system,

962
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,300
which is important, right as well, because it's having such a profound effect on the vascular

963
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:20,780
system, the heat stress, it's hard to uncouple how much of the staving off of dementia and

964
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:25,180
Alzheimer's has to do with that versus heat shock proteins. This is to me the biggest challenge

965
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:29,580
with Alzheimer's disease just is, you know, we're talking about it in a pretty nuanced way. But I

966
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:34,620
think unfortunately, clinically, it's still considered one disease. But, you know, to the

967
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:38,780
best of my understanding, it's really several diseases that all have a very similar common

968
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:43,420
final pathway. You know, for example, like going back some of the ketone data, you know, why does

969
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:50,780
ketone enhance memory in some models? Certainly even going back, oh, God, 10 years, you see a lot of

970
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:57,580
anecdote of people in early stage dementia who when given even MCT oil would see transient

971
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:02,700
improvements in cognition. Now, Richard Veach did some of the most elegant work on this.

972
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:07,020
Richard Veach, by the way, is the guy who along with Kieran Clark created the ketone ester that

973
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:12,300
T delta S licenses to human. And, you know, they showed, I think, quite convincingly in this animal

974
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:19,100
model that the BHB was basically bypassing pyruvate dehydrogenase. And so all of a sudden,

975
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:23,740
you know, you think about the energy deficit that a neuron would experience if you have insulin

976
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:29,340
resistance at PDH. So if, you know, glucose is going to pyruvate and pyruvate can't get in because

977
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:35,900
PDH is resistant, giving BHB would just bypass it. You go straight into the Krebs cycle, you make

978
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:41,180
all the ATP you want. But that might only be a subset of people that are, you know, suffering,

979
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:45,020
right? There's also going to be the microvascular variant, and then there's going to be the sort of

980
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:50,380
more toxin variant. So the nice thing about SONA, too, just thinking about it is, as I get like,

981
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:55,100
I'm becoming more and more convinced of this, it's actually like a really pleasant thing that you can

982
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:59,900
do to potentially live longer and certainly live better because many of the things we talk about,

983
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,700
I mean, let's call a spade a spade. Fasting is not fun. I wish I could tell you that, you know,

984
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:08,940
not eating is fun, but like I just love eating. So anytime I'm not eating, I'm sort of like,

985
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,260
there's a discipline that's required to do it. But I don't know, sitting in the SONA for 20

986
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:17,740
minutes before you go to bed is pretty enjoyable. Of course, the problem is it's not, it's not,

987
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:20,140
it's not accessible to everyone. It's not accessible to a certain point.

988
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,900
You don't like it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A certain point. It's enjoyable until you're like,

989
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:28,460
holy shit, it's hot. I want to get out. But it's knowing that like you get to get out

990
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:32,780
and then that jump into the pool or the whatever it is, is pretty nice.

991
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:37,340
Yeah. And the discomfort you experience from like the heat stress where you're like really

992
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:42,700
hot is actually, I think key for the positive benefits, at least for me it was on my mood,

993
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:47,420
where I was just like, felt so good. So what about the reciprocal of that cold? So I used to do a

994
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:53,820
lot of cold therapy, but all for DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness. So that was my main interest was

995
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:58,620
back in the olden days, I would go out and buy a hundred pounds of ice or 50 pounds of ice,

996
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:03,820
I guess, throw it in the bathtub, cold water. And I would immerse myself and that was unbearable,

997
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:10,700
but that really sped up my recovery from difficult workouts. It's a pain in the ass. So I started

998
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:16,460
doing cryo and the data, I was pretty convinced that whole body cryo, three minutes of whole body

999
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:21,100
cryo at the right temperature was going to produce a roughly comparable effect in DOMS,

1000
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:26,300
but had a fraction of the time and 10X the cost. But I've also had people talk to me about,

1001
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:30,620
and again, I've never really looked into this, but I'm guessing you have ice cold showers for

1002
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:36,700
increasing norepinephrine levels, things like that, mood altering. Have you looked into this?

1003
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:40,940
I've looked into the literature. Yeah, that's something that I did notice from doing cold

1004
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:46,860
showers. And sometimes I'll do them before like a big talk or something, because it does help me

1005
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,820
focus and it helps with my anxiety, kind of very similar.

1006
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:54,540
Yeah, I was going to say, how do we square the two completely different things? You sit in the

1007
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:58,620
sauna to help with anxiety and then you could have the cold shower. Well, I didn't start getting

1008
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:03,820
into the cold shower until probably a couple of years ago. The sauna I started doing...

1009
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,500
In grad school. Yeah, probably about 2008,

1010
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:13,820
so a long time ago. So they're completely uncoupled in my experience.

1011
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:18,700
So do you think the sauna is working more through GH and other...

1012
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:23,660
I think the sauna has a very profound... First, it affects the immune system and that inflammation

1013
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:28,460
has a major effect on brain. And I think that that's work from Charles Raison is pretty clear.

1014
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:32,940
It's definitely... There's definitely an antidepressant effect that seems to correlate

1015
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:38,060
with biomarkers of the immune system. So the more potent the IL-6 response, the more potent the

1016
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:43,180
antidepressant response. In addition to that, there's a very strong effect on beta-dorphins.

1017
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:50,060
Beta-dorphins are dumped. And also this other system called dinoorphin, which is the opposite.

1018
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:56,140
And what's interesting is that when you activate dinoorphin through the kappa opioid pathway,

1019
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:00,380
instead of new opioid, you feel uncomfortable. And it's the part where I was talking about

1020
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:03,020
when you're like, I'm hot. I want to get out. It's the part when you're exercising,

1021
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:07,660
where you're like, oh, it's that uncomfortable feeling. Well, that's... You're making dinoorphin,

1022
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:11,260
partly because it cools your body down. So it's kind of a response to elevating your...

1023
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,900
I'm convinced by the way there are a subset of athletes that don't produce that at the same level.

1024
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,380
I mean, seriously, there are people I think who...

1025
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:19,820
There are, yeah.

1026
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:23,580
Because we talk about like, why can that guy tolerate so much more pain than that guy?

1027
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:27,500
And at some point, it's possible that they're actually experiencing less pain.

1028
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:32,140
There definitely are variants in the kappa opioid receptor pathway and all that.

1029
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:32,940
So...

1030
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:38,540
I'm surprised that hasn't become a performance-enhancing drug, which is blocking that receptor,

1031
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:43,580
the pain receptor in the brain, which is a very interesting thought. But now...

1032
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:47,980
So then on the cold front, what do you think is mediating that? Neurotransmitters?

1033
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:53,740
So basically on the cold front, the norepinephrine, that's been shown. So animal studies have shown

1034
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:59,340
when norepinephrine's released in the locus corollis reason of the brain after cold exposure

1035
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:04,300
and a variety of cold water exposure, cryotherapy. If you're doing a cold water,

1036
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,700
if it's like 50 degrees Fahrenheit, you got to stay in a little longer than a couple of minutes

1037
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:13,820
in a really cold cryotherapy chamber. But in humans, plasma norepinephrine has been looked at,

1038
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,780
which does seem to sort of correlate with the release in the brain.

1039
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:19,740
It's so hard though to look at the plasma to understand that stuff.

1040
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:25,580
I know. I know. It is. It is. So I do think that some of the mood is affected by the

1041
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,020
norepinephrine as well.

1042
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:31,260
Have you experimented with the stacking, which is go do the sauna for 20 minutes,

1043
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:35,340
then go do the ice shower for whatever 10 minutes and you get an additive effect?

1044
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:40,140
I feel really good. Yeah, I feel really good. And that's when I did notice that my sleep was

1045
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:44,380
really profoundly affected. What's interesting is there's some studies showing that heat stress,

1046
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:49,580
at least in piglets, does affect, actually it seems to elongate the REM sleep stage,

1047
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:55,580
which I don't know what all that means. So there's certainly an effect of heat on sleep.

1048
01:28:55,580 --> 01:29:00,940
And then of course, cold is lowering your body temperature is important for sleep onset.

1049
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,620
But I don't know. There's something about the combination of the two. Absolutely.

1050
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:09,660
I sleep amazing after doing the combination of both.

1051
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:13,260
I think cold is really interesting for the effects on mitochondrial biogenesis.

1052
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:17,100
I mean, exercise is probably one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis,

1053
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:21,980
but cold exposure has been shown human studies, both in adipose tissue and in muscle tissue,

1054
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:25,420
to boost biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis.

1055
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,780
Well, it depends on what tissue we're looking at. So like, you know, PGC1 alpha,

1056
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:37,100
would probably be one of the best, I would say, for muscle tissue. In adipose tissue,

1057
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:42,620
perhaps the same. I would say PGC1 alpha is probably one of the best.

1058
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:45,900
It's another downstream one. I can't, for some reason, I'm drawing a blank.

1059
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:51,260
Yeah. So that's interesting to me, the effect on mitochondrial biogenesis. But personally,

1060
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:57,180
I like the exercise, you know, for my mitochondrial biogenesis. I'm not like doing

1061
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,260
cold exposure all the time. It's not like something that I do often. Like I said, I'll

1062
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,100
do it once in a while before a big event I have to talk at or something, just because it does seem

1063
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:11,260
to help me with my mood and my clothes. Have you ever swam in water that's so cold that you actually

1064
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:15,500
feel like you're on fire? Yeah, I have been. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1065
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,500
That to me is an amazing, I assume it's due to the vasoconstriction. I don't know.

1066
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:25,660
But it's the coldest water I ever swam in was in the Colorado River and it was 42 degrees,

1067
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:31,340
which is, I mean, that's unusually cold. And the only reason I think I was able to swim in it was

1068
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:36,620
it was May. And so the sun was, it was about 90 degrees Fahrenheit was the air temperature. So

1069
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:41,020
you could, like I wouldn't be able to swim in 42 degree water on a cloudy day, for example,

1070
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:47,420
or a cold day. But I couldn't believe the sensation of feeling like I had jumped into boiling oil.

1071
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:53,020
It was incredible, which is very different from my normal exposure to cold. I used to swim a lot

1072
01:30:53,020 --> 01:31:00,460
in the ocean. And if you do a three hour swim at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or 52, 53, you get a little

1073
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:05,740
bit of that effect, but more or less you can still, you still know you're in cold water. But this

1074
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:12,700
particular time I remember, and I probably spent 15 to 20 minutes in this 42 degree temp the entire

1075
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:19,260
time I felt like I was burning. Wow. And again, I had no idea why. I guess my assumption was that

1076
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:23,500
such profound vasoconstriction in the periphery that. You know, the one thing that I wanted to

1077
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:28,780
mention when you brought this up for recovery is because there is some evidence that for whatever

1078
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:34,300
reason, strength training, when you do cold exposure, like immediately after strength training,

1079
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:40,140
if you do it within, let's say before, like sometimes with it, sometime within an hour before

1080
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:47,580
or after strength training, it seems to blunt some of the hypertrophy effects. Yes. Yes. And

1081
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:52,700
actually, it's interesting you say that that's the exact reason I would never take like ibuprofen

1082
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:57,900
or any anti-inflammatory agent. I would limit it even that day. I wouldn't take any of those

1083
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:03,660
agents because you're impairing that rebuild. Yeah. Yeah. So that's also interesting that

1084
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:08,540
the timing of it seems to be, you know, again, there's, it's been shown that about an hour after

1085
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:14,380
exercise is when the anti-inflammatory response starts to peak. And so it's like, if you can,

1086
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:19,580
you basically, if you're within that hour window when the inflammation is happening to create that

1087
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:25,500
anti-inflammatory response, you don't want to dampen that. At least that's, it seems to be what

1088
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:30,380
I think and literature seems to suggest. And there's of course mechanisms where it's like

1089
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,700
specific macrophages and muscle tissue are really important for activating all these things that,

1090
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:39,100
you know, eventually result in satellite cell proliferation, you know, and of course IGF-1

1091
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,820
is in there somewhere. So again, you know, the immune system activation is important for

1092
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:49,660
a lot of the benefits of exercise, including muscle hypertrophy. So there's one more topic.

1093
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:53,820
I just want to get to, if we can spare a bit more time, which is, which is NAD,

1094
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:58,540
the precursors, the whole shtick. You've spent a lot of time thinking about this.

1095
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:06,060
What is your current thinking on, does having more NAD to NADH matter? The thing about the NAD.

1096
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,580
I guess I should provide context for people. Why am I asking this question? Right? So there's lots

1097
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:16,140
of supplements out there now that are, you know, either giving NR or NAD. And the claim is that

1098
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:21,820
these things can enhance longevity. You could live longer and that also you live better. You have more

1099
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:27,580
energy, all of these other things. And so in the mitochondria, you have complex one, which converts

1100
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:34,780
NADH to NAD. And the idea is we do know that as you age, that ratio of NAD to NADH goes down. And so

1101
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:39,420
part of the thinking is, well, and this is outside of the Sirtuin pathway, but this is upstream of

1102
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:44,780
that. But if you give more of either the precursor or NAD, you're basically fixing something that is

1103
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:50,700
getting worse as you age. Yeah. So that, I mean, the question is, why does it go down? And that's,

1104
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,780
I think there's multiple reasons for that. At least that's been shown in literature. NAD is

1105
01:33:54,780 --> 01:34:01,180
a very important cofactor for mitochondria. I mean, obviously mitochondria are making NADH and

1106
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:05,580
that hydrogen, the proton is used and electrons are used to basically generate energy through

1107
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:09,660
the electron transport chain. And it's also generating the mitochondrial membrane potential

1108
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:14,220
by kicking out the proton. So that's really important for mitochondrial function, respiratory

1109
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:18,860
function, energy production, which is like the key of everything, right? But in addition to that,

1110
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:24,060
you have, as you mentioned, Sirtuins, which are histone deacetylases, which have a whole host of

1111
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:29,020
functions that they're doing regulating tons and tons of different pathways. They're also seem to

1112
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:33,580
be very important for health span. And then in addition to that, there's very important DNA

1113
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:39,980
repair enzyme PARP that literally syncs up NAD. I mean, it's like an NAD sync. I mean,

1114
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:45,740
so we're constantly having damage. Where does it reside, that enzyme?

1115
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:51,660
Where in the cell? Yeah. Is it nuclear? It must be, right? Yeah. And the reason I ask is,

1116
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:57,180
how do we know that these supplements that we take orally are going to actually reach their

1117
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:02,220
bioavailability in the place we want them? Right. Okay. But that said, we'll come back to that after.

1118
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:05,740
Yeah. I think it's in the nucleus. I mean, as far as I remember. It would make sense to be there,

1119
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:10,940
but yeah. Otherwise, it shuttles there, but I think it is. So it's very important for repairing

1120
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:17,420
DNA damage. And so that's one of the major syncs in actually inflammation. All these things are

1121
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:22,700
kind of upstream of PARP activation. So the more that's happening, the more PARPs being activated.

1122
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:27,420
So you have NAD going there. So one argument, just to make sure I understand what you're saying

1123
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:32,140
is, look, if you're getting older, you're going to have more DNA damage. That's just stochastic.

1124
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:39,100
And if your little guy that repairs it requires NAD as fuel, that would explain one reason

1125
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:43,900
potentially why NAD would decline as we age. Yeah. And it's certainly a sync for it. Yeah.

1126
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,780
So the other thing is, well, if your immune system is constantly activated too,

1127
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:55,100
if more inflammation you have, all that energy is required. So NAD is being consumed more for that

1128
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,940
as well. So that's sort of another thing. Basically, NAD levels decline with age. And

1129
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:04,060
it's probably because it's just getting used up more. Or the other, the alternative is,

1130
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:08,300
is there something else going on in terms of this whole salvage pathway? There's another pathway

1131
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:13,580
that you can do to regenerate NAD, and if that's kind of going wrong. And I think there's some

1132
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:17,820
increasing evidence for that as well. Would that make Metformin a bad idea from this standpoint?

1133
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:23,340
Because Metformin inhibits Complex 1. So Metformin lowers the ratio of NAD to NADH.

1134
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:26,940
Does it? Has that been shown? So you're saying it should lower it?

1135
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:31,180
It should lower it. Now, of course, that's counterintuitive because we know it activates

1136
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:35,980
AMPK. So I probably have to sit down and think about this. But we do know Metformin inhibits

1137
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:44,220
Complex 1. And we know that Complex 1 turns NADH to NAD, which makes me wonder, is it possible that

1138
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:49,740
Metformin would impair DNA repair through that mechanism by reducing substrate?

1139
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:53,980
I have no idea. Well, I'm going to write that down. That's something we're going to have to look

1140
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:59,900
into. There we go. Because I wasn't aware of the, I didn't understand that link. Yeah, exactly.

1141
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:03,580
I think that's a major one. I literally think that's a major thing for it. I think that the

1142
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:07,900
part is, I think it's just like going there. Yeah. So the animal evidence, you mentioned some

1143
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:12,700
of the supplements, precursors that can form NAD. I think that the animal evidence suggests

1144
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:20,380
that it can, at least in rodents, improve health span, particularly in models that are heavily

1145
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:25,020
dependent on mitochondria, like muscle myopathy models or something like that. I think that was

1146
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:31,580
one. And also the brain. So I think those are the two organs I've seen major positive effects with

1147
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:36,700
NAD supplementation. And then there's some, of course, pilot clinical studies showing that, yes,

1148
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:41,340
you can take, for example, nicotinamide riboside. And it does seem to increase

1149
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:45,020
NAD levels in plasma in a dose dependent manner. Now, again, you raise the question.

1150
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,900
We have no idea if it's getting in the cell. Is it getting in the cell? Is it getting in the,

1151
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:53,740
now we do know in animal studies, I think that has been shown because it's affecting the

1152
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:57,660
mitochondri, like I said, those animal models of myopathy and stuff and mitochondrial function

1153
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:02,300
was improved and all that stuff. So, so in animal models, it obviously is affecting mitochondrial

1154
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:06,140
function. So it must be getting to the right place. I don't know why I have found myself

1155
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:12,380
skeptical of this. I think it's good to start with skepticism. I mean, I think that NAD levels are,

1156
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:17,900
you can increase them with fasting. So when you fast, as you mentioned, you convert NAD into

1157
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:24,140
NADH in the presence of energy, because that's basically when you have a substrate like glucose

1158
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:30,540
or fatty acid, that's when you produce NADH or FADH2. So in the absence of those substrates,

1159
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:34,540
then you start to make your NAD starts to build up. So back to your metformin question.

1160
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:40,860
You said, I know who to ask. I definitely know. I'm going to ask Nav Chandel. He will know the

1161
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,740
answer to this question. I follow a lot of his work when I was in grad, him, Ralph DeBardini's,

1162
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:50,620
I did it because I was doing a lot of cancer metabolism, mitochondrial function and stuff.

1163
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:55,820
So I followed a lot of his work. Do you have Nav's book, Navigating Metabolism? No, I don't. No,

1164
01:38:55,820 --> 01:39:01,420
I just used to read his papers back when I was a graduate school. Yeah. So Nav and David Sabatini

1165
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:05,500
were in town a couple of weeks ago and I was leaving town the day they were coming into town.

1166
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,860
So we hung out for three hours near the airport. And I was just reminded of how much fun it is to

1167
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:18,700
talk about mitochondria. Yeah, for sure. What is the most interesting question you feel you don't

1168
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:25,260
yet know the answer to, but you feel is knowable that you're sort of actively putting in lots of

1169
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:31,100
your clock cycles on thinking about? I would really like to know if, for example, someone who is

1170
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:37,900
like myself, who I don't have a lot of body fat, I'm active, I eat a pretty healthy diet,

1171
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:42,620
I don't smoke, I don't have any of those bad habits. If I were to do a prolonged fast a couple

1172
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:49,500
days a year, would that truly have an effect on increasing my stem cell production, potentially

1173
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:54,620
getting rid of any dysfunctional immune cells, dysfunctional liver cells, dysfunctional whatever,

1174
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:59,980
muscle cells and repopulating them with healthy new cells, like basically this rejuvenation,

1175
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:04,460
could I get this burst of rejuvenation a couple times a year and would that have,

1176
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:11,260
in turn, have an effect on delaying the onset of age-related diseases, improving my health span,

1177
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:16,700
keeping my stem cells less damaged? That would be very interesting to me because to me, that's

1178
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:21,500
something that's very doable for myself. I mean, the experiment to figure that out is different

1179
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:25,980
because it's in humans and so that's going to be really hard. You have to figure out if you can

1180
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:30,540
even look at certain biomarkers to know that, but I feel like that would be something that's

1181
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:33,980
so easy for someone to do. It's interested in longevity.

1182
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:38,620
And you think it would be sort of once or twice a year doing like a five-day water only mineral?

1183
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:41,500
Well, the question is how often would you need to do it?

1184
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:46,140
Yeah, and how long of it. So we have a lot of the studies coming out of animal data,

1185
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:50,780
which I mean, these rodents, they lose 20% of their body weight after a 48-hour water fast.

1186
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:55,500
Yeah, I find it hard to infer anything from rodents when it comes to fasting

1187
01:40:55,580 --> 01:41:00,380
because of this exact reason. Even the Jay Mitchell stuff I talked about earlier,

1188
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:04,140
I mean, I think it's an interesting proof of concept, but I don't actually know how you would

1189
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:07,100
apply that to humans. Right. So the question is, it's like, okay,

1190
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:11,500
so if you have a 48-hour fast in a rodent or a fast, does that mean it's 10-day fast?

1191
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:18,140
Exactly. Yeah. So I guess I'll expand my sort of answer to that question, like maybe do a prolonged

1192
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:22,380
water fast, like time in a kinetic study. Right. What's the frequency? What's the duration to get

1193
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:27,100
the maximum benefit? Yeah. And I am specifically interested in this shrinking of the organs and

1194
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:32,460
then regrowing like this potential robust activation of stem cells clearing away.

1195
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,020
You know, we're not just talking about autophagy. We're not just talking about

1196
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:39,660
clearing away damaged mitochondria, pieces of DNA, protein, which is all really great.

1197
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:44,220
You are getting that, but well, in theory, in humans, in addition to that, I mean,

1198
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:47,820
I'm talking about clearing away the damage to the whole cell, like just getting rid of it and

1199
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:52,860
replacing it with a brand new, young healthy cell. Like that's what I'm interested in. You know,

1200
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:58,700
I would love to, you know, even just the hope that that's possible, you know, based off of some of the

1201
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:04,140
pilot studies that Vulture has done in humans and certainly the animal evidence, like I'm convinced

1202
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:10,620
I'm going to at least try because it seems very possible. I know that he is trying to find the

1203
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:17,020
best biomarkers to look at for, you know, stem cell activation. It's not quite as straightforward.

1204
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:21,340
You can't just, you know, harvest a bunch of tissues and look at things. But I certainly have

1205
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:25,500
gotten some anecdotes from people that have had autoimmune like diseases and things said,

1206
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:29,900
like fasting is like completely reversed. Some of it like like eczema or something.

1207
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:34,620
Yeah. No, no, it's, it's, you know, where it's anecdotal. But certainly when you start to have

1208
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:38,940
enough people saying the same thing, it's like, wow, that's interesting that you've heard that

1209
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:43,580
five or five or six times now. Yeah, I think that would, that's a good one. I guess I think of

1210
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:50,220
a very similar question with rapamycin. Rapamycin. Yeah. What dose and what frequency

1211
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:53,980
to produce the best longevity phenotype. Do you know the interesting thing with the

1212
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:58,540
rapamycin is the effect on the senescent cells? Like, like that's so interesting to me.

1213
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:03,340
I didn't know really about that until I listened to your podcast with Judas.

1214
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:08,300
Yeah, she's amazing. She's really, she's really, she's really great and very knowledgeable in the

1215
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:13,660
whole senescent field. Yeah. I had no, I had no idea either. The life expanding effect is,

1216
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:17,340
is that males only or was that both males and females? No male and female. Is it? And it's

1217
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:21,900
across, I mean, it's, it's everything from yeast to worms to flies to mammals. I mean,

1218
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:26,620
it's the only drug that's uniformly extended life across a billion years of evolution.

1219
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,980
I mean, and there's really interesting work. I mean, I think Matt Caberland. You're talking

1220
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:35,420
maximum lifespan or are we talking median? Actually in the mice, it was, I have to go

1221
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:39,820
back and look. Probably median. Most of the time it's median, but yeah. And what was interesting

1222
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:45,100
in the mice is they started late in life. They started at 600 days, which is, you know, that's

1223
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:49,500
about 60 years old. Yeah. That's, that's like starting as with a 60 year old. Wow. That was

1224
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,500
really late in life for the mice. Yeah. It was. Wow. Which made it that much more impressive.

1225
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:58,380
That is, that is very interesting. So Caberland's work, do you know Matt up at the University of

1226
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:05,100
Washington? He is giving rapamycin to dogs, but these are pets, right? So these are not

1227
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:09,420
laboratory animals, which is what makes it really interesting is you've got animals that

1228
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:14,700
live in our environment that are, and dogs sort of have a very predictable demise, right? They're

1229
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:19,500
either going to be, you know, die in an accident, be euthanized, have cardiomyopathy or die of cancer.

1230
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:26,300
That's basically how dogs die. And the cardiomyopathy that they get is not an atherosclerotic

1231
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:30,300
cardiomyopathy. They get a cardiomyopathy where the muscles are actually just getting weaker and

1232
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:36,700
weaker and their ejection fraction is going down. And in studies as short as 12 weeks,

1233
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:44,140
they're seeing a 10% increase in ejection fraction of these dogs. And so the question is how much of

1234
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:50,300
that is working through senescence, just selectively knocking out senescent cells and letting myocytes

1235
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:55,260
regenerate. Yeah. The study out of the Mayo Clinic where they did some drug that selectively

1236
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:01,420
targeted senescent cells and it led to 20% increase in median lifespan. Sort of an interesting

1237
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:06,060
proof of principle, how just, well, that was an, I think an accelerated aging model. So they had

1238
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:10,300
accumulated more senescent cells. Obviously they had to do something like that. But, um,

1239
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:14,460
but it all comes back to this idea of specificity and selection, you know, everything we've talked

1240
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:19,580
about, if you really stop to think about it, comes down to how could you target this tissue and leave

1241
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:24,780
that tissue alone or how could you target this cell and leave that cell alone? And, uh, in many

1242
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:30,620
ways I think that's kind of got to be the next frontier here is, you know, even if you think

1243
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:36,220
about something as crude as chemotherapy, it is not hard to kill a cancer cell with a chemical.

1244
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:41,180
That's trivial. It's hard to kill a cancer cell and not a normal cell. And that's why chemotherapy

1245
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:45,340
obviously targets rapidly dividing cells and it's still very crude. But the stuff we're talking

1246
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:51,100
about is like taking that to the next level, which is how could you get this enzyme to work more

1247
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:55,340
efficiently, but in this subset of cell, you know, just in the muscle, but not in the fat or not in

1248
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:59,660
the liver. Yeah. And that's again, where the fasting is just so impressive to me. The fact that,

1249
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:04,140
you know, all the normal cells is you're enhancing all these stress response pathways. So the chemo

1250
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:08,780
drug becomes that most more less, almost less, you know, efficacious. Like it's like almost

1251
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:14,460
like a lower dose because it's like, got these robust anti-epiprotic and anti-stress response

1252
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:18,460
genes that are dealing with that sort of stress. And so it's like, it can take the toxic insole

1253
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:24,060
because of that upregulation that fasting is doing and the cancer cells just can't. So I'm,

1254
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:28,780
I'm so glad that that work's being done. I hope that there is more funding that goes in that area.

1255
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:33,420
I think that it is a really important area of research again, like I said, for the, you know,

1256
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,260
this is, and this is all from, from Walter's work and some of some of his colleagues. So I'm just

1257
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:41,340
kind of like the fan girl, you know, but I'm certainly, I'm happy someone's doing that research

1258
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:46,380
and I would love to see that be used as a standard of care someday for sure. So Rhonda, many of the

1259
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,900
people listening to this will know everything about where to find you, but for the, let's assume

1260
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:54,220
there's someone here who, this is their first time meeting you. Where can they learn more about you

1261
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:58,300
and how can they interact with you? I have a podcast. It's called Found My Fitness. You can

1262
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:04,140
find it on iTunes and on my website foundmyfitness.com. All the episode pages there with

1263
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:09,260
links to the video, which has. And your videos are remarkable because you put so much work into

1264
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:15,260
actually like a podcast like this, unfortunately we're too lazy. Like I'm not going to actually

1265
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:20,380
do much except create show notes, but on yours, it's like, it's like a Khan Academy, right? It's

1266
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:24,220
like everything is being explained in the video as well. Like in text. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah,

1267
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:29,180
it's explaining the figures, definitions and all that are there in the video. And also on,

1268
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:33,580
I think we're having now definitions and stuff on the website. So people can, the, the goal is to

1269
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:38,140
definitely showcase, you know, a lot of the, the researchers and scientists that I interview and

1270
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:43,740
also to educate people as well. So Found My Fitness, I'm on iTunes and my website and social media.

1271
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:48,220

1272
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:51,900
Facebook, Instagram, I'm on all of them. But yeah, and what's your handle? Found My Fitness.

1273
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:57,820
So you were ahead of me on this. Like you, you immediately recognize the value of exercise. I'm

1274
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:03,340
a late comer to this. I mostly from, from personal experience, I realized I was like,

1275
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:07,660
this is like, this is great for my brain. And from there, I just kind of dove into it. I was

1276
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:12,220
convinced. Yeah, for sure. Rhonda, I can't thank you enough. This has been awesome. I don't suspect

1277
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:19,420
it's the last time we'll talk about this stuff. So until next time. Awesome. You can find all of
