00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,380
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,760
today's episode. Welcome to a special episode of The Drive. To celebrate our 100th anniversary,

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,280
we have decided to try something a little different. The title of this episode is Strong

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,320
Convictions Loosely Held. And what that basically comes down to is Bob asking me questions about

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,240
things that I've kind of changed my mind on over the past year and a half. So we definitely go

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,600
into a lot of areas where I had a strong point of view or a reasonable point of view on something,

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,440
and then after either preparing for a podcast or going through a discussion, I sort of came away

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,600
with a different point of view. And it's usually changed my behavior for the better. So we thought

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,320
this would be kind of an interesting and maybe even clever way to go about doing a retrospective

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,840
on the first 99 episodes. And of course, we also do take a moment to sort of talk about some of the

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,760
things, highlights, things that I've maybe enjoyed the most or that Bob's enjoyed the most. If you

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,920
like the style of this episode, by the way, please let us know because I'd be open to doing it again.

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,440
I actually found it quite fun to reminisce. So again, if you find this interesting, please let us

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,840
know. I'd be happy to repeat this every 50 episodes or so. And I guess without any further delay,

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:24,680
I hope you enjoy episode 100 of The Drive. So for episode 100, as I alluded to in the introduction,

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,440
we're going to do something a little bit different. And I can't take any credit for this idea. So if

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,680
you like it, Bob gets all the credit. If you dislike it, well, hopefully you won't dislike it.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,480
But many of you know Bob Kaplan, the guy behind the guy behind the guy. And one of the things

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,080
that Bob has had the luxury of doing, if you can think of it as a luxury, is sort of helping me

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,920
get ready for many of the past 99 episodes of podcasts. And there's a lot that goes into

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,880
making this sausage known as the podcast. Once in a while, I just get up there and wing it. But I

29
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,480
think more often than not, a lot of thought has to go into who do we want to interview? What do we

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,840
want to talk about? What do I need to know in order to have this discussion in sort of a thoughtful

31
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,560
way? And throughout that process, my opinion on things can change. And sometimes not necessarily

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,480
through the podcast per se, but just through the evolution of learning and what it means to sort of

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,720
scour information and test a hypothesis and see data that conflict with your pre-existing way

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,560
of thinking about things. I mean, all of these things have led to an enormous evolution over

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,760
a period of time in the way I think about things and do a lot of things. And I think,

36
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,960
I know that on some levels that might sound like a real cop-out to think that one can change their

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,000
mind on how things work. But I think that when I've written this before, I think in politics,

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,240
that may be a cop-out, but I don't think in science or in medicine that should be viewed as a cop-out.

39
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,880
I think one should always be malleable and willing to sort of lean into new information. And in fact,

40
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,960
the title of this podcast, Strong Convictions Loosely Held, is a phrase that exists in various

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,880
different forms. So sometimes it's Strong Opinions Loosely Held, Strong Opinions Weekly Held, Strong

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,280
Convictions Weekly Held. I've seen many different versions of it, but in particular, this version

43
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,960
of it, Strong Convictions Loosely Held, is something that I remember one of my patients telling me a

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,560
couple of years ago in reference to one of his mentors in the investment space. So this patient

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:42,760
of mine is himself an investor, and he came out of a very successful hedge fund, and he spoke very

46
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,320
affectionately about how he was mentored there. And he said that that was sort of one of the things

47
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,040
that allowed them to be so successful was they had very strong convictions and they would make

48
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,960
bold investments based on those things, but they were very loosely held convictions and they were

49
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,240
always looking for ways to change their information. So in that spirit, I am joined today by

50
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:11,800
Bob Kaplan, and I think Bob has, along with maybe two or three other people around me clinically,

51
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:19,080
as good an insight into some of the various things I've changed my mind on. And so, Bob, how do you

52
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,520
want to do this? Do you want to just ask me about things I've changed my mind on or point them out

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,680
to me or call me out on what you want to do? Yeah, I think that works. Call you out on things you've

54
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,160
changed your mind. But again, I think it's really important. That's a feature, not a bug. One of the

55
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,680
quotes that I heard or somebody talking about this idea of the strong opinions, strong opinions

56
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,160
weekly held is it was on a blog actually, and it's Richard Feynman, just to confuse everyone,

57
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,080
Richard Feynman the other, the SUNY biochemist who said that a colleague at NIH said,

58
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,640
And by the way, that's SUNY S-U-N-Y. Just to confuse people. Just to really confuse people now.

59
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,760
It's not the Shia Richard Feynman. It's, yeah, forget it.

60
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,640
Yes. So he had a colleague, at least he wrote this in his blog, and he said,

61
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,280
what you do in science is you make a hypothesis, and then you try to shoot yourself down. And I

62
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,160
think that that's really succinct. And the podcast for over the 100 episodes, Peter has a lot of

63
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,160
hypotheses, which is great for me, because I think I share a lot of those and I get to dig into them

64
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,160
as an analyst. And so I think from a selfish perspective, what I see in podcasts and the

65
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,480
episodes and why Peter is so successful, other than his rugged good looks, is that he has a lot of

66
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:39,240
hypotheses. He has a lot of ideas, and he's not afraid to just say whatever he thinks and try to

67
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,520
find the people who are the absolute experts or even just somebody who disagrees with him and his

68
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,360
take on something, try to dig into it further to see basically to see if he can shoot it down,

69
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,840
because I think the more hypotheses you can shoot down, actually, things get a little bit simpler,

70
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,840
even as much as we're waiting in a lot of this uncertainty.

71
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,680
But a lot of that actually occurs behind the scenes. I hear what you're saying, but I think

72
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,000
most of the shooting down is not actually done in the podcast. It's actually done in the preparation

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,400
for it and some of the analyses that come after the fact. So I also could imagine somebody listening

74
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,080
to this saying, well, your podcasts aren't really that contentious. It's not like you're getting

75
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,600
into rip roaring fights. It's not like our podcast is sort of an environment where we're always just

76
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,520
trying to come up with a contrarian point of view or an antagonistic point of view. I think

77
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,760
a lot of the places where my minds have been changed has been in getting ready to do it.

78
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,080
And sometimes, frankly, it just doesn't have to do with the podcast, but I do think this is a great

79
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,680
excuse as any to be 100 episodes into this thing and say, hey, two years ago, what did I do or what

80
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,320
did I think or how did I behave in a way that was different from today? So yeah, hopefully we've got

81
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,760
some interesting ones to talk about. I've seen that you and Nick have been comparing notes.

82
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,760
We have. I've got a good mixture here of hard topics and maybe a little softer. So we'll see

83
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:08,680
if we can sprinkle them in. This might be on the harder side. Metformin. So maybe think about,

84
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,440
I guess in the context of the episodes, it was probably it was summer of 2018 or so you started

85
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,400
the podcast since then. How have your strong convictions, if you had them, changed at all

86
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,920
since then? Well, in the summer of 2018, I was taking Metformin. I had been taking it for about

87
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:35,080
seven years. I think I started in 2011, and that was based on a lot of research that I had seen

88
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,720
and read in a white paper we had written internally that looked at the benefits of

89
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,960
Metformin in people with type 2 diabetes and in people without type 2 diabetes, but with obesity,

90
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,120
which was probably just a proxy for hyperinsulinemia, but it's not entirely clear. But the benefits were

91
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,560
not subtle. In particular, the benefits were around a reduction in cancer mortality and

92
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,720
survival with cancer as well. So both a reduction in the incidence of cancer and an increase in the

93
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,720
survival of cancer. And we certainly weren't the only people to figure this out in 2011. There are

94
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,360
people who figured this out long before us, but we were sort of, I think a little bit early on the

95
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,400
cusp of viewing Metformin as a drug that might have a benefit for people who were not type 2

96
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,320
diabetic, but looking for sort of a boost in longevity. And truthfully, not a lot of our

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,000
patients in the practice were taking Metformin. One, because my convictions, I guess, weren't that

98
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,720
strong. They were strong enough that I was willing to take it because I could also kind of monitor a

99
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,800
bunch of things in the background, but not strong enough that I felt like it should be dispensed like

100
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,520
you would dispense chiclets or tic-tacs to people. I don't know why I said chiclets or...

101
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,080
Because you dispense them like candy anywhere you go. We know you're the chiclets and tic-tacs guy.

102
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,120
Whenever I don't know the last time I had a chiclet or a tic-tac, do they even make

103
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,160
chiclets anymore? I think they do. I don't even remember seeing these things in a grocery store.

104
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,680
I know they made tic-tacs. I've seen tic-tacs, but I don't think I've seen a chiclet in a long

105
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:15,400
time. I miss chiclets. So that said, a lot of patients over time would say, hey, I've heard

106
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,720
about this drug called Metformin, kind of interested in it. What's your take on it? And sort of share

107
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,600
our white paper with them. And in the end, we ended up prescribing it for a number of patients.

108
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,280
I would say off label, meaning these aren't patients that were hyperinsulinemic or diabetic.

109
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,760
So fast forward. Well, actually we had an interview with Nir Barzilai, who is certainly

110
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,920
one of the world's experts on this topic. That was a very interesting podcast. I

111
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,360
learned a few things there that I didn't even know before, which again, given that I'd been

112
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,600
spending so much time thinking about Metformin, I think that really speaks to Nir's depth of

113
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,320
knowledge on that front. But somewhere along the way, something changed. And the first clue

114
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,720
was December of 2018. So in December of 2018, which was when I first became interested in

115
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,120
zone two training, it was the first time I'd ever been checking my lactate levels

116
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,480
under low levels of exertion. And it was the first time I'd been just checking lactate levels

117
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,840
in a while since I hadn't been doing much lactate testing since I stopped competing in

118
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,760
sports where that mattered. And I was kind of surprised at how high my lactate levels were,

119
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,960
especially my fasting lactate, just baseline, like not exercising lactate levels.

120
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,040
And that got me poking and poking and poking and coming to the obvious conclusion that Metformin

121
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,440
is a weak mitochondrial toxin. And as such, it probably shouldn't be surprising that you'd have

122
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,240
a higher level of lactate. In medical school, every student learns that one of the potential

123
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:02,120
rare complications of Metformin is lactic acidosis. I'm sure somebody in an ER somewhere has even seen

124
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,720
it. So again, it's not a huge stretch that you would see elevated levels of lactate. But it did

125
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,440
get me thinking, which is, wait a minute, what if the benefits of Metformin are only going to be

126
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,600
most pronounced in people who have otherwise quite defective mitochondria to begin with and or people

127
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,640
who can tolerate a slight hit in the sort of mitochondrial performance because of all the other

128
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,680
benefits they're getting? And what if that doesn't hold true for someone who's otherwise quite healthy

129
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:40,440
and looking to really maximize mitochondrial health and throughput? And basically, since that

130
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,080
time, I would say that more and more literature have probably emerged suggesting that we might

131
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:54,040
want to think about Metformin different in people who are quote unquote sick versus healthy. I hate

132
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,600
using a stupid division like that sick versus healthy, but I mean, I could sort of explain

133
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,640
what I mean in a bit more detail, but I think people get the gist of it. What if this is a drug

134
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:11,480
that still offers a sizable benefit to people who are metabolically ill, but that benefit sort of

135
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,640
evaporates in people who are not. And so I would say that my position today, so I've stopped taking

136
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,800
Metformin after making this observation in December of 2018, I then spent the next six months,

137
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,840
maybe not that long, maybe the next four months experimenting a lot with it. So only dosing it in

138
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,440
the evening, but not in the morning, reducing the dose, like making a whole bunch of changes to see

139
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,240
if I noticed any difference before ultimately stopping it and then stopping it altogether.

140
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,760
And then realizing a couple of things. One, yeah, my lactate levels went down and my zone two

141
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,720
efficiency as measured by lactate went up, but also my glucose levels are a bit higher. There's

142
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,800
no question it was suppressing glucose levels and that was probably a good thing. So I have no way

143
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,440
of knowing if the net benefit of stopping Metformin has been positive or negative, but I now would say

144
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:12,120
I reserve Metformin prescriptions for patients who obviously are in need of it from the standpoint

145
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:19,560
of glucose and insulin regulation, but I don't view it really as a pro-longevity agent yet. Again,

146
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,480
very likely we'll be having a discussion in two years, Bob, and I'll have changed my view again.

147
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,720
There will be some new data that will have emerged that will have told me that yes, despite the

148
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,280
elevated levels of lactate, it's still a net positive even in someone who's metabolically

149
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,480
healthy. And we've obviously looked at a bunch of other papers that look at the impact of Metformin

150
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,160
on muscle mass and training effects. Though a lot of those studies seem suboptimal because they

151
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,200
don't include some of the more functional analyses of the muscle that you'd want to see. So I don't

152
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,800
think this is not an open and shut case. We have a lot to continue to learn, but as of today, I have

153
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,440
a really different point of view than for the previous decade. And I don't think the jury's

154
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,200
necessarily out that in the next 900 episodes that you do going forward, you'll probably have a few

155
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,240
that are on Metformin and you may change your thinking on it down the road, I imagine. Yeah.

156
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,560
I mean, I think one big thing that's going to be interesting is to see if TAME, which is the study

157
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,960
that Nier Barzil I spoke about on our podcast, does TAME actually get funded? Because again,

158
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,800
if TAME is done correctly, it's really not going to be weighted towards people with diabetes. It's

159
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,440
going to be looking at people without diabetes and asking the question, can this extend life

160
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,600
indirectly via mitigating the onset of chronic disease? So in the end, nothing matters more than

161
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
that is health span and lifespan. All of these other things that we're looking at, such as

162
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,400
lactate levels and zone 2 efficiency or muscle mass, those are proxies for that. So in a large

163
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,120
enough study, if we could actually go after the thing that matters, that would hold great weight.

164
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,320
Okay. So I'm going to bring in a little social media into this on Instagram. I think it's pretty

165
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,520
clear that anybody who follows you that you recently got a dog. You're snuggling up with that pup.

166
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,240
And along the same lines, have you changed your mind on having a dog? Because I believe in some

167
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,720
of the podcasts, maybe we've talked about in the AMAs and other times about the reluctance to get a

168
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:19,800
dog and maybe you caving at some point down the road. Yes. We do have a puppy. Four weeks ago,

169
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,840
we got her little Molly and you are absolutely correct that remember that scene in planes,

170
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,960
trains and automobiles when I think it was John Candy's character says something to the effect of

171
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,280
if I'd woken up with my head sewn in the carpet, I would have been less surprised. Remember that line?

172
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,840
I think I thought the day that we were going to get a dog was never, I just thought it'll never happen

173
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,840
because I don't have the bandwidth to absorb any additional work. My wife is already functioning

174
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,160
at the level of three wives. And it's just like, why would we do that to ourselves? And even though

175
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,840
our daughter was the one begging, it's not like she can take care of a dog when she's at school

176
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,480
or whatever. So I was just like, no, this is never going to happen. And then I don't know what, I mean,

177
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,600
I just don't know what happened. For lack of a better way of describing it somewhere in there,

178
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:24,440
the resistance just weakened. And I was in Australia and I must admit prior to that Australia trip,

179
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:31,880
we had gone and looked at a couple of puppies in a dog shelter nearby. And I must admit there were

180
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,880
some cute little puppies in there, but I still kind of came away from that experience thinking,

181
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,440
we just need a couple more years. We just need the two guys to be a little bit older and a little

182
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:50,200
less dependent on us. And then somehow they just went to the dog shelter when I was in Australia.

183
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,360
They FaceTimed me from there and said, there's this little girl, little puppy, Molly,

184
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:04,280
she's perfect. And they gave me all the reasons why she was perfect. And I actually went out to

185
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,240
social media to seek an opinion. This was like one of the few times social media was actually helpful,

186
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:17,880
because this puppy was the runt of her litter and she was visually impaired. And I really wanted to

187
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,720
know if we were biting off more than we could chew. And so I asked that question broadly and

188
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,960
the feedback was overwhelming actually, both on Twitter and Instagram. And people said,

189
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,600
she's going to make an awesome puppy. And I will say this a month in, it's way more work than I

190
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,000
expected. And not so much for me, but certainly for my wife and for my daughter and for me too,

191
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,640
but I'm taking on 10% of the additional work. But I think people were right that a dog that

192
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,560
doesn't see perfectly, perhaps coupled with some other characteristics of just being a rescued dog,

193
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:59,000
she's amazingly gentle and sweet and kind. And I don't know. So I don't regret it, even though

194
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,080
it's harder than I thought it would be. And there have been a number of accidents that have required

195
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,040
significant cleaning. But I think I'm getting the point that people had been trying to make for

196
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:18,520
years when I had been saying, why would anybody get a dog? Which is, I think there are these

197
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,400
intangible benefits that come from a dog that you don't appreciate. If you try to just think

198
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,720
about it with your logical brain, you guys have a dog, right? We do. The dog has passed. We're

199
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,080
going to get another one. But yeah, I mean, I definitely share your feelings about it. It's

200
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,840
funny. It sounds a lot like having a kid where you think you get older. I think if you don't pop one

201
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,920
out when you're younger and you're older, you're trying to think like, when's the right time? We

202
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,480
need to line up all these things. It's just like, there's never the right time. Although probably

203
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,800
any time is probably the right time if you don't have a kid and then you raise that child. And

204
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,600
there are probably accidents along the way as well. Whether it's a dog or a person, this is

205
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,680
completely inappropriate, but I thought of it when you were talking about loving a dog. This is a

206
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,800
joke. This is not my joke. It says, want to know who loves you more. Put your spouse and your dog

207
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,000
in the trunk of a car and drive around for an hour. When you open the trunk, who's happy to see you?

208
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,680
I honestly, I think that joke, I don't know, I've heard it recently, but I would always be amazed

209
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,960
that you just think of dogs and you come home every single day and it's like you went to Afghanistan,

210
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,400
toured duty for three years and you came back and you get that kind of reaction every single day.

211
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,880
And it's pretty amazing. I'm a big fan. So I have a...

212
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
So I'm in the club now.

213
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Yeah, I'm in the club. It was interesting too. I caught one thing which is great is that

214
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,800
when people ask you, where does Peter Uttia get his second opinions, you can say Twitter and

215
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,320
Instagram, which is nice.

216
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
When it really counts.

217
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,560
We're going to go back to the pharmaceuticals. We've got Rapamycin.

218
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,360
However your feelings changed on this one.

219
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,880
Well, this has sort of been another area of real interest of mine for many years,

220
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,200
not quite as far back as the sort of metformin interest, which started I think around 2010,

221
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:23,400
2011 for me, but probably by about 2012 and certainly by about 2014 when the first

222
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,760
that sort of really interesting ever all in this paper was published by Joan Manick,

223
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:38,520
Lloyd Klikstein and others in December of 2014. That was a real, real peak to my curiosity.

224
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:47,000
That was a paper that showed that the strength of vaccination in healthy subjects who were,

225
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,760
I believe about age 65 could be augmented by basically a Rapamycin analog, which again

226
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,760
is counterintuitive, right? That's the adaptive immune system getting better with Rapamycin.

227
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:09,480
Very counterintuitive because of course Rapamycin's on label use is specifically to suppress the

228
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,520
adaptive immune system. And that's what makes it such a efficacious tool for mitigating organ

229
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,320
rejection. But of course, what that study would show was a couple of things, which is there are

230
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,560
different ways that you can dose it. Two of the three treatment arms in that study were only being

231
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,200
given Rapamycin once a week, one at five milligrams, one at 20 milligrams, by the way,

232
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,840
I said Rapamycin. I almost use Everolamis and Rapamycin interchangeably, but it was not Rapamycin.

233
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:49,160
And that study was sort of the turning point for me. And what it really led to was the next

234
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:58,920
four years, just a deeper and deeper look into all of the literature. We've had, I think, two

235
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,120
podcasts that have been dedicated to Rapamycin and mTOR, one with David Sabatini, one with Matt

236
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Cabraline. I feel like we're overdue for another one, by the way, because I know that was very early.

237
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,440
Yeah, a little inside baseball, but those interviews were, I think, like in 2017.

238
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,080
That's right.

239
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,920
Was that Sabatini and it was this summer we went over there, you gave a talk?

240
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,480
That's right. Yeah.

241
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,160
Talked to some geology geeks.

242
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,280
Yep, August of 17. So we're way overdue to go back and revisit that. But basically just more

243
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:36,440
and more data, both in animals and in humans, really got me to a point where I felt really

244
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,560
comfortable that, one, I was taking enough because you've probably heard me talk about this before,

245
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:47,240
that you always think of two risks when you're taking a medication that you don't have an

246
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:55,080
immediate biomarker for. So if you're talking about taking a statin or taking a PCSK9 inhibitor,

247
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,920
well, you have a very clear biomarker that at least tells you if the drug is working.

248
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,440
And similarly, you have either clinical signs or biomarkers that tell you if things are going awry.

249
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,160
Clinical signs might be muscle aches and you might see outside of complete breakdown of muscle,

250
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,680
you might still see significant elevations of CK or significant elevations of labor function tests

251
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,120
or things like that. You have some sort of bearing on either symptoms that would cause

252
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,760
you to revisit your decision to use the medication or lack of efficacy or other signs that tell you,

253
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,680
hey, this isn't a good idea. But with rapamycin, you don't have any of that. I mean, on the symptom

254
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,520
side, obviously, if you take too much, you're going to start to see some of the symptoms like

255
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,560
mouth sores and things like that. But you don't really know if you're taking enough and you don't

256
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,240
know if you're taking too much beyond some of those symptoms. And so you really have to be able

257
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,280
to triangulate on what the right dose is. And so that's what basically took me about four years.

258
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,880
Once I sort of felt like I think this makes sense, there was still, I couldn't quite get to the point

259
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,640
where I could understand what to do, how to do it. And I think that was sort of the big switch that

260
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,320
flipped in, well, probably about 18 months ago, kind of in the fall of 2018. And I would still say

261
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,880
that here I am a year and a half later, I'm still really eager to figure out ways that we can

262
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:29,800
have biomarkers that can lend some insight into this. Probably more so on the efficacy side,

263
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,880
there's still a lot of questions I have on the use of rapamycin, even though I'm using it. I sort

264
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,200
of cycle it a little bit. I think there's lots to be asked there. Is it the right cycling? Is it the

265
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,240
right period? Is the right on versus off? All of those things are, we don't have enough answers yet,

266
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,000
but my convictions are now high enough on the side of something that looks like what I'm doing

267
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,200
right now is probably beneficial. One thing interesting too, just about the metformin and

268
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:05,000
rapamycin is, I think you might've talked about this with Nier, that was January of last year,

269
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,240
so about a year ago, is him and a few other colleagues, I think Steve Ostad was one of them,

270
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,880
they were talking about what is the trial that we want to do. I think there was a lot of debate

271
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,560
and healthy conversation around whether they should use metformin or rapamycin. I wish that

272
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,240
there was enough resources in the world to try both, but it sounded like they had to do one,

273
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,520
then it was metformin. Yeah. I remember actually having that discussion with Steve Ostad over

274
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,120
dinner about four years ago at the time before Tame had been fully formulated and saying,

275
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,240
if you're only going to get one bite at this apple, rapamycin might be the more interesting agent to

276
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,600
study. I think their concern was the monitoring was going to be more complicated, just the

277
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,800
economics of trying to understand how the immune system was potentially changing, was going to

278
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,600
make that sort of cost prohibitive study, unfortunately. On the subject of apples,

279
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know why this is apples, I think of archery and shooting an apple on someone's head,

280
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,680
but are you still practicing archery? I am. I practice a lot. I think archery and driving are

281
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,120
the two things that I really sort of just try to carve out time for every single day that I'm not

282
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,320
traveling. Luckily, I travel a lot less than I used to, so that means more practice. How do you think

283
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,760
that goes? I was just thinking that in terms of getting better, the more you practice it, is it

284
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,640
just do the gains become more and more incremental or do you always feel like you're learning something

285
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,480
each session, so to speak? In terms of archery, I think it's more objective where maybe you can

286
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,400
take your score and say on average, I'm improving over time with those things.

287
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,880
Yeah, I think they're both so different and yet so similar. I think that with archery,

288
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,760
it's so hard to explain how addictive it is if you've never done it, but I think anybody who's

289
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,840
fired a compound bow, I think most people are like, oh wow, I can see why this is really something

290
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:04,920
else. First of all, there's no ceiling to how much one can improve. That's the beauty of something

291
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:12,360
like this is you have so much ability to measure how you're doing that you can never say, I've kind

292
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,320
of plateaued, I've kind of hit my limit, there's just always a place to go up. Really, it's many

293
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,360
different sports in one. There's the indoor target, you're shooting at 20 yards, and at 20 yards,

294
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,440
you're expected to be able to hit something the size of a quarter. So if you think about that,

295
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,600
something 60 feet away, you have to be able to hit a quarter 60 feet away, and in a perfect round,

296
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,080
you would take 60 shots and do that 60 times. How many times do you think I've done that so far, Bob?

297
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,680
A hundred.

298
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,040
Zero.

299
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,360
See what I did there?

300
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,240
Very nice, very nice. Yes, the hundredth episode. So I have yet to score a perfect

301
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,160
300 round, like a perfect 360 round, which is what that would be. So anyway, this is meaning

302
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:06,280
all 60 were in the tiny little X. And to be clear, there are days when I find that fact infuriating.

303
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,920
There's times when I get so close and then I blow it at the end, and then there's times I just blow

304
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,840
it in the first shot and I'm frustrated and I don't even want to finish. But you also realize

305
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,840
that archery is kind of a great metaphor for life and you can't focus just too much on your

306
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,240
target. You really have to focus on the process or you're not going to get better. So one of the

307
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,400
things we do a lot in archery is called blank baling, which is taking a shot at a huge target,

308
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,560
like they're these big bales, without actually looking at a target, like literally not having

309
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,320
a target there. So there's nothing for you to fixate onto so that you can just go through the

310
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,720
sequence. And when I'm traveling, I take this thing called a shot trainer with me, which is like a

311
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,400
little string attached to something that sits in your hand that sort of mimics the feeling of the

312
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:04,280
riser. And I'll take maybe 20 to 40 shots a day in my room, hotel room or whatever, that are obviously

313
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,240
not aimed at a target or not doing anything, but just going through the muscle memory of where are

314
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,080
my feet? Where is the pressure on my hands? How am I feeling the contraction of my rhomboid? All

315
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,200
those sorts of things. Again, if you're listening to this and you're thinking, oh my god, how did

316
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,160
that guy just manage to waste the last three minutes of my life telling me that? Again, I

317
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,280
don't think you have to like archery to appreciate the notion of mastery. And I do think that as

318
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:40,200
people, we crave getting better at something and that can be lots of things. It doesn't just have

319
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,080
to be a physical domain. It can be an intellectual domain. It can be an emotional domain or a

320
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:51,240
relational domain. But anyway, for me, this habit with archery, this curiosity started three years

321
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,800
ago and now it's something I can't imagine. If a day goes by that I don't do it, I feel like I'm

322
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,680
missing something. I think there's something to that process. I think about my childhood,

323
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:08,360
the intellectual pursuit. I had these things uncoupled that I just wasn't very good. I was

324
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:15,640
not a very good student. 1.44 grade point average in high school. What? Don't fire me. That's

325
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,160
actually really hard to graduate with that kind of GPA. It's not just hard to graduate. How do you

326
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,760
even get a grade point average of 1.44? The secret is not showing up. That's how you do that.

327
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,480
What were you doing? Having fun. At least what I thought was having fun at the time. But I was

328
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,640
also, I guess to the larger point here, not get into my childhood too much.

329
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,880
You can't throw out the 1.44 without explaining it, but okay.

330
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,400
I was also playing hockey and that's a totally different sport, but I excelled at it. I went

331
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,720
through that. You don't automatically excel at a sport like that. I probably, particularly in

332
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,360
Massachusetts, you got to really work at it and it instilled a lot of stuff in me. I never made the

333
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,720
connection until later in my life that intellectual pursuits and educating yourself and things like

334
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,520
that, it's not very much different. It's like in order to be good at blank, you are going to suck

335
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,520
at blank. If you have a few of these victories, Peter, you have so many of these things. I think

336
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,240
you're in a way obsessed with mastery and you have so many different things that you've pursued

337
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,200
excellence in that you realize even if you have no idea what this thing is, if you put the time

338
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,120
and the effort in that you can get better at it. I would put a plug in for anybody at a younger age.

339
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,040
Maybe it's like, I never thought about musical instruments that way, but maybe it is. I know

340
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,400
Olivia plays the drums and that's something you first start and you're just like, you can't keep

341
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,200
a beat. Then check in a few months later and you can see that progress. You just know that work

342
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,240
and effort and time, this sounds like grit, those kinds of things, but they apply to so many

343
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,280
different things. With this podcast, I think there's a parallel there with all the episodes and

344
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,000
all the information that goes into the prep with the guests. I think that you have a

345
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,680
predilection to guests who have a healthy obsession, let's call it healthy, a healthy

346
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,920
obsession with these topics as well. They know a lot about these things probably through

347
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,960
similar practice with those things. It's funny you bring that up, by the way. I actually had

348
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,520
this discussion with Olivia two days ago. I know how it came up. We were sitting there at dinner

349
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,920
and I was just complimenting her on how impressed I was with how hard she's been studying this year,

350
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,040
which was a real switch that flipped in her. It's like, you don't have to ask her to do her homework.

351
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:40,280
She just wants to do it and she makes cue cards and is always just going out of her way to really

352
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,160
try to learn stuff in a way that I just didn't see her doing before. I was just saying, hey,

353
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,920
that's so great, blah, blah, blah. Then she asked me, she's like, well, when you were my age,

354
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:55,480
how much did you study? I was like, Olivia, you have no idea. You couldn't have done less than I

355
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:03,160
did. I was categorically a moron in school. Again, there's a fine line there. Really, what it was

356
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,200
was I wasn't interested in what was happening and so my interests were elsewhere. The point I made

357
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,560
to her is exactly the point that you made, which was the reason that I was ultimately able to do

358
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,720
well in school was fortunately I had spent all of that time still trying to master something.

359
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:28,600
It was that pursuit of that that became transferable. I agree. I just think I do pity the

360
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,840
person who's never found it interesting to try to get better at something. To be clear,

361
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:41,240
you can take it too far. I don't consider archery for me to be the greatest form of recreation

362
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:53,480
because I am very internally competitive and I'm sometimes too focused on the result and not the

363
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,920
process. There are days when archery is like meditation to me. Just being out there just

364
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:06,280
feels so amazing and the sun is shining and the wind is blowing and I can disregard the outcome,

365
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,640
but that's not often the case. When you think about the podcast with Ryan Holiday, where we

366
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,840
talk about stillness, I would say that archery for me does not constitute stillness because

367
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,360
stillness can't really have an objective. I think for me, archery carries with it too much of an

368
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,160
objective. I still think that one has to have those other things in there. This is funny. I

369
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,680
didn't even think of it this way, but I think this is one thing I've noticed about having a puppy.

370
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,600
A puppy is as kinetic as she is. It is a form of stillness for me. Taking her out and walking her

371
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,360
and picking up her poop, there's nothing else to be doing and there's no outcome associated with

372
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,640
it. There's no objective. It's literally just a forced reason to be outside and to be observing

373
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:06,120
the completely comical nature of a puppy. It's funny, even though we didn't pose it this way,

374
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,960
if you want to ask me about another really big change in the way I think about things over the

375
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,400
past couple of years, it's a huge appreciation for how essential it is to have something that is not

376
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,440
object-oriented, outcome-based. Not everything in your life can be outcome-based.

377
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,800
I've recently gone back to swimming, actually. This might be a good segue to another topic,

378
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,960
but it's funny when you were talking about stillness and how some of these little things

379
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,800
that you don't even realize are stillness or stillness. I was going to use the example of

380
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,720
washing dishes and then I realized you've got the forks and spoons and knives game,

381
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,440
so you turned that into a competition. Even a lot of people just wash the dishes and it's

382
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,520
therapeutic for them because it's stillness for them. You turned it into a competition.

383
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Things that were once like, you know, saying a second ago, even swimming for me now is something

384
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,480
that is really a form of stillness. I just started swimming again a couple months ago and I go like

385
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,040
once a week and I don't keep track of how far I'm swimming. I know I'm not swimming too far.

386
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:18,040
I'm in the water maybe 45 minutes to an hour and all I'm doing is swimming. I'm not doing workouts.

387
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,720
I'm not looking at the pace clock. I'm not doing intervals. I literally just get in the water with

388
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,280
no agenda other than to get wet and hear the sound of water going by my ears. Probably I'm not even

389
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,920
swimming hard enough to get into zone two truthfully. I doubt my heart rates above 120.

390
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,240
That's the next topic. That's where I think this is a good segue. I think this is out of the

391
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,320
row. If you think about it, you can talk about it, but I think that's one of the things is like a

392
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,240
governor putting a rate limiter on your performance when you do zone two. That it's almost like for a

393
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,360
lot of people it is for me doing this reminds me kind of of stillness. Although I might read on

394
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,760
the bike or things like that, but can you talk about zone two importance and how you're thinking

395
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,920
has changed on that? Yeah, when I stopped riding a bike with a purpose, which was for me a time

396
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:13,960
trial. That would have been late 2014, early 2015. I kind of really just stopped doing any low

397
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,240
intensity aerobic training. Anyone who does ride a bike or swims a lot has plenty of that activity

398
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,760
in them. Even if you're training for the 200 meter individual medley, which is a race that's

399
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,840
very short, very quick and very painful, you still put in hours and hours a week of aerobic

400
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,480
based training. Similarly, if you're training for a one hour all out time trial, you still put in

401
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,040
hours a week of low end aerobic based training. When I stopped doing that, I was like, well,

402
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:53,800
I don't need to do this anymore. I went from cycling to rowing and running. I was sort of

403
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,480
obsessed with just being as efficient as possible. So everything was all out. I mean,

404
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,600
if I was running, it was going to be a six minute mile. It wasn't going to be a nine minute mile.

405
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:12,920
I think, especially through the interactions that I had with Inigo, who I met about a year before

406
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,160
I had him on the podcast, which was just recently, it was sort of meeting him and kind of going back

407
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:26,760
through the literature on that type of training and the benefits that it could have both from

408
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,560
the standpoint of metabolic benefits such as glucose, insulin dependent and insulin

409
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,200
dependent glucose, mediated disposal, looking at just sort of mitochondrial function, mitochondrial

410
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,640
health density, and then looking at sort of the sort of neurotropic factors, the BDNF secretion

411
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,960
that can come from this type of activity. I mean, all of these things were just pointing towards,

412
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,920
this was a glaring hole in my training that I needed to get back. And so that has been great.

413
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,200
And like you said, I mean, one of the things about zone two that I really enjoy is it's just

414
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,280
not that hard. You know, like, frankly, sometimes it's just nice to get on the bike and I probably

415
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,680
spend three or four hours a week doing it. And that is my time to listen to podcasts and audio

416
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,040
books. And I really enjoy it. I can't wait to get on that bike as sort of boring as it seems to be

417
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,760
sitting on a stationary bike for that long. There's never been a day when I've been like,

418
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,960
I don't feel like doing this. I just, I always look forward to it. And I think in large part,

419
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,240
it's because I also get to combine it with learning, which you wouldn't be doing if you're

420
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,920
out there crushing intervals. And not that there's something wrong with that. I think each of these

421
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,240
things has this time and a place, but I think that we can do zone two our entire lives, we can do it

422
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,560
safely. And it just yields enormous dividends. What's nice about that too, for I think a lot

423
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:51,240
of your training is you've got the smart ERG so you can tie yourself to the mast that the output,

424
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,640
whether you pedal faster, it's going to give you the output that you pre-desired. So you can't

425
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,160
start cheating, which is what I find myself doing when I don't have it on smart. Just the ERG that I

426
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,200
find myself peddling faster, just unconsciously, just wanting to push myself harder. But do you

427
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,880
use a Wahoo kicker? What's your device? Are you on a Wahoo? Yeah, Wahoo kicker. So you can set it to

428
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:20,040
either smart or set it at a certain level. Yeah. Yeah. I love my Wahoo kicker. Yeah, me too.

429
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,640
Did you ever have a CompuTrainer back in the day? I did. Yeah. I had it on an old Windows

430
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,560
computer. I remember that I had the little CompuTrainer and then it's connected to the

431
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:35,240
to the bike trainer. Yeah. Tried simulating the Tour de France one year, just in terms of the time.

432
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,520
Yeah. So talk about the time over summer. I had a bucket. My wife now, I can't believe she's my

433
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,280
wife now. I was living in Las Vegas and it was the middle of our, I would sit in our apartment

434
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,520
with a bike trainer and had a bucket with ice of water bottles and things like that. And eggs. I

435
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,560
think I was doing a ketogenic diet. So I was eating eggs at the time, but I don't know if that

436
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,400
was stillness. I wasn't going anywhere. It was stationary biking. So on this topic, moving along,

437
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,000
the importance of deadlifts as an adult, how has your thinking changed on this? I like your history

438
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,320
on this one. So maybe even take it back to in school when you were, you were doing powerlifting

439
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,760
before it might've been in vogue. Yeah. Yeah. Long before it was in vogue, one of my best friends in

440
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:23,480
high school who was also involved in boxing and martial arts, we would go to the Scarborough

441
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,200
campus of the university of Toronto every day and lift weights. And it was, it's still one of the

442
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,520
fondest memories I have of what a gym could be like. It would certainly be the, it was certainly

443
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:43,640
not the sunny, warm golds in Venice, but it had some of those features, which was old school,

444
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,280
lots of iron, nothing fancy. Of course, unlike a nice gym, this was like two stories below

445
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,320
ground. So there were no windows poorly ventilated. So in the summer it was staggeringly hot. In the

446
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,640
winter it was so cold, you felt like you were getting frost bitten by touching the iron.

447
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,680
And aside from me and my friend, there were no kids there. We were 14, 15, 16 years old.

448
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,560
And it was this group of men who to this day I think back and like can't believe how strong they

449
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,760
were. And most of them competed in powerlifting. And so that sort of got us interested in power

450
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,400
lifting. And that's how we sort of started putzing around with it. And as most people know who are

451
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,960
listening, or I guess people who might know who are listening, powerlifting is different from

452
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,840
Olympic lifting. Powerlifting is three lifts, the deadlift, the squat and the bench press.

453
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,640
And so yeah, make along for a short grew up doing a lot of deadlifting, a lot of squatting,

454
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,960
a lot of bench pressing was always very horrible at bench press, much better at squatting and

455
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:50,920
deadlifting. Fast forward to, I don't know, a few years ago, maybe three years ago,

456
00:43:51,880 --> 00:44:00,440
I had an injury where I kind of tore or partially tore one of my obliques. I don't even remember

457
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,800
how I did it. I remember it was very stupid, whatever I did. And everything, tearing a phone book.

458
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,320
That would be great possible. But everything went kind of sideways after that. And I really

459
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:22,520
was never able to fully deadlift again without some discomfort. And so again, this is now take

460
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,680
it back to maybe 2016, I sort of decided, you know what, maybe the deadlift has

461
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:36,920
reached its point of futility. And maybe I've extracted all I'm going to out of that. And

462
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,000
there's no denying what a wonderful movement it is, in terms of being a total hip hinge compound

463
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,040
movement. But I was like, look, I could probably get most of the benefits of a deadlift doing

464
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,960
things that place me under less load. And also, again, in the spirit of thinking about longevity,

465
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,240
I thought, why does one need to subject themselves to twice their body weight or more in an axial

466
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:05,240
load? So I sort of got away from it. And then I think all that kind of changed when I started

467
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:11,000
DNS, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization, which I started about 18 months ago. And we're going

468
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,040
to have a podcast on this topic, because it's just, there's so much I want to talk about here.

469
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,760
And so actually, I think today we got an email about how we're trying to make some time for this

470
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,440
podcast. So we'll definitely, if you're listening to this, and you don't know what DNS is, dynamic

471
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,360
neuromuscular stabilization, by all means, you should go read about it. But we're going to have

472
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:34,520
at least one solid podcast on this. But it was through that process that I realized, actually,

473
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,720
the deadlift, for me, was going to be beneficial, not because of the metabolic benefits, I was not

474
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,960
going to be doing Tabata deadlifts, like I used to, or even by trying to set records for how much I

475
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,240
could lift or anything like that, but rather, because it becomes a beautiful audit for everything

476
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:59,480
working perfectly. So I deadlifted this morning. So today's a Monday, I deadlifted on Saturday,

477
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,000
I deadlifted a few days before that, like I deadlift at least twice a week, often three times a

478
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,560
week, both straight bar and trap bar. And Bob, I don't go that heavy. I don't know the last time,

479
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,840
maybe I've had 400 pounds on one of those on the trap bar in the past year, but I usually

480
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:25,000
sort of stop at about 350 to 375 on the straight bar, I'm even lighter, maybe 185.

481
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:35,560
I do a lot of slow eccentrics. I film every single rep of every single set. And I study it,

482
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:46,680
and I send it to Beth Lewis, who is my coach. And we do so much around making this deadlift perfect.

483
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,560
And I'd rather take a lightweight and deadlift it perfectly several times a week. And I'm not doing

484
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,800
killing crusher sets. Today was four sets of 10, five sets of 10 maybe. And at no point was I past

485
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,400
my limit. So again, I can push myself harder doing other things, but what I could get out of doing

486
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:14,680
that deadlift perfectly is, do I have just the right amount of thoracic extension? Do I have

487
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:22,040
just the right curvature in the lumbar spine? Am I activating my glutes? Am I activating my

488
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,440
hamstrings? Am I pulling back instead of pulling up? Am I wedging correctly? All of this little

489
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:34,680
stuff translates biomechanically to the activities of daily living that matter to me, like getting up

490
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:41,480
off the floor, picking up one of my kids, lifting a piece of luggage or something like that. And so

491
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,400
if I can do the deadlift and it feels right, then I know I'm ready to do everything correctly. And

492
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,800
when I'm deadlifting and I feel like, hey, this isn't correct, this doesn't feel right. Well,

493
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,040
first of all, now I've really learned what that feeling is. And secondly, I've now learned the

494
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,720
steps that I can go back and reconstruct what needs to be done. And so one of the things I

495
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,920
definitely want to do at some point in the next year is actually put together kind of a video on

496
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,000
deadlift and deadlift preparation. Because I think that there are probably 10 exercises

497
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,360
that I do as a way to get ready to deadlift. And they don't take long. My deadlift checklist

498
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,200
is like 10 to 15 minutes. So it's not so onerous. It's almost like ketosis, the way we were talking

499
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:30,440
about it in the past, which is it's not even clear if it's the ketones themselves that can sometimes

500
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,280
be the benefit versus the metabolic conditions that allow you to make them. In other words,

501
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,400
I'm not even sure how much of the benefit is the actual deadlift versus all the things you have to

502
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,200
do to do the deadlift correctly. And one of the most exciting things, just on this last thing I

503
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:52,280
say on this, is it never occurred to me up until a year and a half ago that you could actually

504
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,880
deadlift in a way that puts your spine under traction. That's very counterintuitive. You would

505
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,160
think that anytime you're lifting under an axial load, your spine is under compression. But it

506
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,680
turns out when you learn the right positioning and you understand how to create intra-abdominal

507
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,520
pressure and you know how to elongate your spine, you can actually deadlift and create

508
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,680
traction in the spine actively. And that's why deadlifting is the most important thing I do

509
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,680
before I get on an airplane. Because when you're on an airplane and you're sitting there for five

510
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:30,760
or six hours, what you really want to do is not let your spine be compressed. And the deadlift

511
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,720
primes me to then go and sort of maintain that activated form of traction. Yeah. It's a

512
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,520
significant investment, but I would say it's worth it that you'll bring your hex bar to the gate

513
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,960
before your flight and pump yourself up and bang out a few sets. I mean, I don't know what it is

514
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,360
about the TSA guys. They get so wigged out when you have your hex bar there at the gate. Put that

515
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:58,280
overhead. Yeah. If you're TSA pre, they don't mind as much. But if you're not TSA pre, they just lose

516
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,480
it. Sticklers. They're sticklers. Yeah. Separate topic, a little lighter, maybe. Have you read any

517
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:13,240
good books lately? I am about a third of the way through Andrew Solomon's Far From the Tree. Have

518
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,840
you read that? No, I have not. It's super interesting. It's a long book, so yeah, it's going to take a

519
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,960
while. But I've actually thought it would be probably really interesting to have Andrew on

520
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,880
the podcast. He's obviously just one of those guys that when you're in the process of writing a book,

521
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,440
you probably shouldn't be reading their books because they just make you not want to write

522
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,320
yours anymore because you're so bad. You're like, oh, how does he do it? It's like Sid Mukherjee.

523
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:45,080
It's just one of these people who are just so, so exceptional in their ability to write. Not a word

524
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:52,600
is wasted. Everything is just perfect. Prior to that, I reread Stillness is the Key for the third

525
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,960
time. I know we interviewed Ryan a few months ago. That is a book that has just spoken to me probably

526
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,920
more than anything else Ryan has written. He's written some really great books in that series.

527
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:09,000
Just overall, the other two books in that series, Ego is the Enemy, which I'm also a huge fan of,

528
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,440
and The Obstacle is the Way. Stillness is really the one that captivates me. That's why I've just

529
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,840
finished it for a third time. I've also gifted that book probably half a dozen times. I suspect

530
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,280
there'll be at least a fourth reading of that book in my future. What about you?

531
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,560
Good question. I was thinking in the context of the podcast, and there are so many books,

532
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,400
I guess it's not recently, but for the guests, just reading a lot of the books is great. It's a

533
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,640
pleasure. Actually, think of Gary Taubes and how you read Why We Get Fat, and you had a list of

534
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,880
questions, and you asked him all those questions. There's a version of that where I get to read

535
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,920
these books, and I have a list of questions, and I'll ask you to ask the questions or ping them

536
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,680
off of you. Actually, what I'm reading right now, it's not out yet, but it's really interesting,

537
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,960
which is Vinay Prasad, who will probably be right around the time of this episode, I guess,

538
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,160
or now he recorded around that time. He has a book called Malignant, which is really interesting.

539
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,720
It gets into public health policy and cancer. It's funny about the books that you reread.

540
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,760
There's a Taleb quote. It's funny. He's now like the, I would say, Einstein or Lincoln,

541
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,560
but you attribute all these quotes to him. He has a lot of aphorisms. Is it better to read five books

542
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,560
or to read one book five times? I think it depends on the quality of the book.

543
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,840
Azra Raza is another guest on the podcast. Hasn't come up yet, but the first cell.

544
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,080
That's right. Yeah. We'll be talking with her very soon. That looks like a great book.

545
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,720
I'm waiting. When you had Sid Mukherjee on too, he talked about a PBS that they're going to do

546
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:45,240
another follow-up, which is not a book, but for that podcast, I went back and I read The Gene

547
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,360
and The Emperor of All Maladies and The Three Laws, which is like a, I guess it's a Ted book.

548
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,200
It's almost like a Ted talk in a book. And that is really, really interesting. And you went into

549
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:01,320
each law in depth there. My thing is I usually go in the sauna about an hour a day and I either

550
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:07,480
print out a stack of papers that I want to read for research or just read a book in there. So I

551
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,360
should probably just write all the, put these down in a spreadsheet and see what I'm accumulating as

552
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:18,520
far as reading. But a bunch of it has been on the podcast prep. I also read that stillness is the

553
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,520
key, which I found that's definitely worth reading again. I've got a bunch of others, but we'll move

554
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:32,360
on. Baby aspirin and the use for prevention of blood clots or thrombosis during a flight.

555
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:39,640
Yeah. So I used to be of the mindset that anybody who was on a flight, on a long enough flight,

556
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:47,160
should be taking a baby aspirin for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. And I just assumed that

557
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:53,640
that was the case. I mean, it's widely understood that baby aspirin or aspirin in general inhibits

558
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,480
platelets and platelets of course are one of the cellular matters in blood that's responsible for

559
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,440
clotting. So it just struck me as sort of reasonable. And then I don't know, again, maybe about a year,

560
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:11,080
year and a half ago, kind of did a little digging into this and found that there really wasn't much

561
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:17,560
evidence that aspirin or baby aspirin had any efficacy in mitigation of deep vein thrombosis,

562
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,400
especially on an airplane. And in digging around, we sort of found that, well, the gold standard

563
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,560
would of course be heparin, which could either be fractionated or ultra low molecular weight heparin,

564
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,640
but these are not very practical. I mean, intravenous heparin is obviously not something

565
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,480
you're going to do before a flight. And even the low molecular weight heparins have to be injected.

566
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:48,040
So we found a couple of supplements online. One was called FlightTab, I think. I think it was FLITE

567
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,160
Tab. At the time you could buy it on Amazon. I haven't looked in a while to see if it's still

568
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,800
there. But it was a pretty potent agent that actually had pretty remarkable evidence that

569
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,120
it prevented DVT. And then the other is something that is also pretty easy to get over the counter

570
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:08,120
called Natokynase. And I think that the Natto is a plant. It's plant derived. I think it actually

571
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:13,800
kind of, it's like sort of a stinky odor is sort of the types of foods that it occurs in naturally

572
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,600
or certain types of mushrooms or cheeses or things like that. But these are things that

573
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,800
actually turned out to have far more evidence. And they were both things I'd never heard of until

574
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,480
we sort of really dug into this question. So that was a bit of a humbling experience

575
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,160
because you think, well, look, on first principles, aspirin has got to be thinning

576
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,960
the blood. It's got to be good for this. And then you realize, well, wait a minute. Even something

577
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,920
as simple as that, when you actually really antagonize the literature, it turned out not

578
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,400
to be the case. And the things that did seem to have some efficacy are things I'd never even heard

579
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,880
of. So it's a little scary because it makes you wonder how many times is that happening throughout

580
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:58,760
the course of my life. Yeah. This sounds apropos in terms of strong convictions held loosely.

581
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,360
Your feeling on generic drugs, obviously, Catherine Eban was a guest there. What do you

582
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,920
think prior to that and some of the stuff that you were seeing in, I guess, the clinic, or at least

583
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,960
at the some of your patients and taking generics? Yeah. I mean, Catherine's podcast is, I mean,

584
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,920
it would be hard to say that that hasn't been one of the 10 most important podcasts that we've done

585
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,400
in this first hundred. If you haven't listened to that, I suggest you just hit pause on this now

586
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,800
and go back and listen to it. What number was it? Do you know? You can search E-ban, E-B-A-N,

587
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,360
and your podcast player and it'll show up. But I think prior to that, my view had always been

588
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,520
generics are great. They're the exact same as branded except they're a fraction of the cost

589
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,520
and branded drugs are a scam. That was sort of my default thinking all through medical school.

590
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:49,720
I'd say in the last couple of years, I began to wonder if maybe there were a couple generics that

591
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:57,320
weren't great because in the case of certain drugs where you do have a very clear biomarker

592
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:03,240
for use, such as a statin, you put a patient on Crestor, but of course they don't get Crestor,

593
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,400
they get Resuva statin, and you look at their blood level two months later and there's no

594
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,520
change in anything that you would expect to see a change in. And when you query them, they tell you

595
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,080
they've taken it every day and you believe them because there's nothing they need to lie. They

596
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,840
can easily say, I forgot if they did. You see a couple of those things and you start to wonder

597
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,600
if maybe not all generics are created equal. But then of course in the discussion with Catherine,

598
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,840
I came away thinking, oh boy, this is a totally different way of doing things. And frankly,

599
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,520
it's completely changed the way we do things in the practice now. So we work primarily with one

600
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:48,200
pharmacy that will either at our insistence or the patient's insistence only issue branded drugs,

601
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,520
sometimes even when it is a little bit costly. And when we do generics, we do it through the lens of

602
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:01,400
looking at the companies specifically that make them and at least taking a first order pass at

603
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,880
cross-referencing that with an FDA list of potential bad actors. So I don't think that has

604
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:14,120
completely mitigated the problem, but I think it's probably taken care of three quarters of it.

605
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:22,840
Another one, this one is a omega-3 fatty acids. Your thoughts on that, and obviously Bill Harris

606
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:28,440
is somebody who came on the podcast recently. So Catherine Eban was number 71, that was in

607
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:34,280
September of last year. And Bill Harris was in December of last year. And he came on and talked

608
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,120
about omega-3 fatty acids. So what's your take on omega-3 and how has it changed?

609
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,720
This is funny. I think I'm still sort of in my evolution on this. I mean, I think I've

610
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,920
longly held the, for a long time held the view, longly, is that even a word? Do I just make that

611
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:56,520
up? Longly, I've longly held the view. I have for a long time held the view that EPA and DHA

612
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:03,720
are beneficial. Obviously had some questions as to, again, how much of it was the other things that

613
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,000
you got when you ate things that were high in EPA and DHA versus just the supplemental thing.

614
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,800
I would say that my thinking has evolved to the point where EPA and DHA by themselves are quite

615
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,240
potent drugs. And we really ought to think of them in that way. So in fact, you look at a drug

616
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:25,400
like Visepa, which is just pharmaceutical grade EPA at the tune of four grams. I mean,

617
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:34,920
that is as potent as any anti-cardiovascular disease drug that we have. So clearly EPA

618
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,120
has a benefit to it, especially in patients that are at risk for cardiovascular disease.

619
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:49,720
I think with DHA, the clinical trials data are still not clear. And there's a pretty interesting

620
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,080
setback on a clinical trial in the fall that was looking at a combination of EPA, DHA, and it was

621
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,360
a trial that was stopped for futility. So there was no harm from it, but there wasn't the big bang

622
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:07,160
benefit that we frankly expected to see based on the earlier trial with Visepa, which was just EPA.

623
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:12,040
I think the discussion with Bill Harris certainly increased my level of confidence

624
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:18,760
in the necessity of EPA and DHA. And also probably drove me to a point of thinking about it being a

625
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:25,400
higher level that we should strive for. We used to generally look at an RBC or red blood cell

626
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:32,280
membrane level of about 8% to 10%. But I think I came away from the discussion with Bill Harris

627
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:37,880
thinking we could really push that up to 12%, 14% without undesirable side effects, and also

628
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:43,320
getting more value or more benefit from it. I think one area that Bill had a very strong

629
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:50,040
conviction on that I've also, I've kind of had the opposite conviction to. So I think I'm still in

630
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,880
the space of wanting to learn this. So I think my strong conviction had generally been that excessive

631
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:02,360
amounts of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFAs were generally not a good thing. And the

632
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,720
associative data there is not hard to understand. But again, the problem with the associative data

633
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:16,440
is things that are full of omega-6 PUFAs are often crap. So it's easy to see an association

634
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:24,440
with high omega-6 polyunsaturated fat and disease, chronic disease. But Bill's point was that the

635
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,040
omega-6 polyunsaturated fats aren't harmful. It's just that diets that are rich in them tend to be

636
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:35,720
void in EPA and DHA. So his real takeaway was don't think about omega-6 polyunsaturated fats,

637
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:41,000
you just need to add more EPA and DHA in. That's the issue. And so I think you and I have been

638
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,600
talking about this actually over the past couple of weeks, but I think I'd really like to go back

639
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,880
and do a podcast that looks specifically at the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid discussion

640
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:55,080
and really kind of dive into the whole PUFAs literature from an omega-6 standpoint. Because

641
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,120
again, this is a very polarizing topic. People just on both sides of this. Both sides I think

642
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,960
have people that I think are quite bright. So I'm a bit confused on that. And for me, it's not really

643
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:11,720
a huge issue personally, because I just don't gravitate towards those oils. I find them to be

644
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:18,040
kind of gross. And I don't know why you'd want to consume. It wouldn't occur to me to put canola oil

645
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,600
on a salad when I could put olive oil on or something like that. So on a personal level,

646
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:29,080
I think the point is somewhat moot because N6 PUFA don't make up much of my diet. But I do think it

647
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,760
has huge implications for public health. And I think it has implications for our patients when

648
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:41,400
we think about people who are potentially eating a lot of PUFA. Okay. One question here. One theme

649
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,560
in recent episodes, not overly related to medicine, has been the idea of saying no. I think of a

650
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:54,840
Jason Fried, Rick Elias, actually probably Jason Fried twice have talked about this thing and how

651
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:01,880
you viewed this sort of in the past and now today, this idea of saying no. How good you are at it,

652
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,680
when do you think it's applicable? And if you've improved on this. I've definitely improved on it

653
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,560
in the sense that there was a day when I couldn't say no or wouldn't say no to anything or anyone.

654
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:17,720
The pendulum was pretty far off on one side where I was basically on a treadmill of sort of saying

655
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,720
yes to anything and everything that was asked of me. Began to realize that I just couldn't do that

656
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:30,520
anymore. And I'm getting a lot better at saying no. And I don't think I'm doing it at a level that's

657
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,600
unhealthy either. I mean, you can obviously take these things to far extremes on both sides and

658
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:43,880
you could sort of say no to everything and become sort of dysfunctional in that way. It's hard to do.

659
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:49,560
It is hard to do. And I remember there was a podcast that there was someone that Tim Ferriss

660
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:54,840
had on his podcast. God, I want to say like a year and a half ago. I forget the name of the person,

661
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,280
but hopefully we'll find it for the show notes. It was a really good episode on saying no. And I

662
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:05,240
remember that was actually the first time I started really contemplating it. And I remember shortly

663
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,280
after listening to it, I had someone who I really liked respected called me and said, Hey, I really

664
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:17,080
like you to be on the board of such and such. And I mean, deep down, I knew it was going to be a pain

665
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:23,480
in the ass. I knew it was just going to be so much work. And even just the travel of getting to the

666
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:27,480
board meetings was like, wasn't in a place where there was easy access and all those other things.

667
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,320
And I remember like thinking, I just, I just got to do this. I just got to do this.

668
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:38,840
And I remembered one of the lessons in that podcast was don't answer, just say, can I get back to you?

669
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,080
So I pulled the, can I get back to you on this? And then with the benefit of a little bit of distance,

670
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,920
I realized, Peter, you're crazy. Like you can't possibly do this thing. You already lament the

671
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,080
time you don't get to spend at home. So then the next day I just called him back and said, Hey, I

672
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:00,760
can't do this. I'm sorry, but here's why. And just like this person in the podcast with Tim said,

673
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:08,440
the guy understood. It wasn't like I'd committed some grievous heinous crime and declining this. So

674
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,320
I think that's just an important thing to remember. And yeah, I continue to look forward to refining

675
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:19,240
my no saying skills. It's interesting. I think it's always hard for ourselves to do it. But then

676
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,120
when you think in the context of how you work and operate with other people or decision making,

677
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,040
you'll very easily say no, if it's whether it's like having more patience in the practice,

678
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,920
if it's not going to benefit what you have going on, then you're usually very matter of fact. But

679
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,160
I think it's almost like a, it might be like the ego getting in the way or something where you just,

680
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,560
you want to tackle everything. I mean, I think it's, this is probably a little cathartic,

681
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,720
but it's getting into some of this research where you'll have to tell me no, as far as the

682
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,400
the deep dives and the rabbit holes that I want to go down or say like, we're just, we're on a

683
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,440
mission. I don't want to give the milk analogy, but for a lot of these episodes and a lot of the

684
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,800
guests, a little bit of the deep diving can help. But oftentimes it's really about the stuff that

685
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:05,240
you say no to help shape the things that you actually are focusing on day to day that matter.

686
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:10,760
Yeah, that's the insight that I think Jason Fried brought to his episode really well, which was

687
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,920
when you're saying yes to something, you're actually saying no to something else. You just

688
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,720
don't know what that something else is yet. That's a very important insight. Then again,

689
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,360
I would, anybody who struggles with saying no, I think would, would benefit greatly from actually

690
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:29,560
both episodes with Jason, because I think we touch on them in both. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. I think

691
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,520
Tim Ferriss just himself talking about saying no and his evolution, he's probably done his own

692
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,440
podcast talking about that. And I always think of, I do a lot of reading on Charlie Munger and

693
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:43,480
Warren Buffett, but if you look at their schedules, they're like practically empty. I think Munger

694
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:49,240
refers to himself as like a book with legs that all he does is he just reads and that's how he

695
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,520
gets smarter. And so he jealously guards his time. You would look at the schedule and you'd say, oh,

696
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,720
it's wide open. It looks like, you know, if you're the secretary and say, yeah, it looks like a

697
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,440
schedule's wide open. Nope. It's more about saying no and what that schedule can be open to. If you

698
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,880
have all those vacancies there. Yeah. I have great envy for that. And I hope to one day get

699
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:13,080
to that point where my calendar doesn't look like it does now. And it's much more last minute things

700
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:18,200
that are being scheduled where you can actually say like, Hey, do I want to have this meeting

701
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,120
tomorrow as opposed to do I want to have this meeting in three months? So I think maybe one

702
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,280
more question, if you want to take it, I know this one is difficult because it's like, what is the

703
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,600
thing? It's like asking you like which of your children is your favorite. But as far as the

704
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,800
episodes go to any of them stand out in your mind, maybe even just like the style or the way

705
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:41,640
it's happened or separate question, as far as just doing a podcast, hosting a podcast and interviewing

706
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,120
people and having conversations, are there things like going into this that you thought, I mean,

707
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,880
part of it was like, you never wanted to do a podcast. And now I think that you might have a

708
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,080
different opinion about that. So how about that strong opinion, maybe a little more loosely held

709
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,960
today as far as doing a podcast? Yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, I think the first time

710
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:09,400
the idea of a podcast was floated to me was about 2014. And I mean, it was the worst idea I ever

711
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:15,640
heard. And it was mostly due to a fear of the amount of work that would go into it. Because at

712
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:21,720
the time I knew a few people who were doing podcasts. And it was sort of the only thing they

713
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:27,320
did was like, well, that's a nonstarter, I just don't have the time to do something where it's

714
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:34,360
the only thing I'm doing. So it's just not going to happen. And I sort of kind of kept that point

715
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,880
of view, frankly, until about two years ago, when we, or maybe a little less than two years ago,

716
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,240
actually, when we decided to give it a try. So yeah, that was a very strongly held or strong

717
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:51,000
conviction, fortunately, loosely enough held that I was able to sort of get out of my own way on that.

718
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:59,560
And yeah, I really can say that I have enjoyed it a lot. It is hard, it is a little more work than I

719
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:07,800
thought. But also, we have such a big team that works on it, that I have it easier than probably

720
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:14,520
a lot of people who do a podcast, in that I have a great research team. We have two people that work

721
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,520
exclusively on the podcast and Travis and Nick. So all the heavy lifting of making show notes and

722
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,080
things like that, none of that falls on my shoulders. So all I really have to think about is

723
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:30,920
having discussions with people and trying to think of topics that I want to meet people who can speak

724
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:36,840
to those topics. So I've loved it. And it's hard to believe we're at 100 because you sort of realize

725
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,600
there's not that many podcasts that sort of get into the territory of multiple hundreds of episodes.

726
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,400
And I mean, barring some unforeseen thing, we're going to one day be that podcast that's on our

727
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,440
300th episode or something crazy. Now to your first question, honestly, I just I've thought

728
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,520
about this a lot. And I do, I get asked this question a lot, Bob, which is what is my favorite

729
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:04,600
episode? And I just, it's so hard because they are so different. There are some that I've really

730
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:12,920
enjoyed from a technical standpoint. I think the Rick Johnson podcast and the Keith Flaherty podcast

731
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:20,200
really stand out to me as podcasts that I have gone back and listened to several times because

732
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:25,640
of the technical content in them. So they're probably half a dozen that are like that for

733
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,680
me, where they're just just so much interesting information that I can't wait to go back and

734
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,640
listen to them again, which I don't listen to most of the podcasts. I think on the other side of the

735
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:42,760
coin, there are experiences for me like interviewing Damon Hill was just unbelievable. And just to

736
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:51,320
have him be so open and so just available to talk through his own difficulties and obviously

737
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,520
everything that went into his career and beforehand, that was a really special episode for me

738
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,760
as just a fan of his and it was such a fan of F1 and obviously a fan of Senna,

739
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:06,680
who was his teammate when he died. I thought the Rick Elias podcast really, even though I knew Rick

740
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:11,400
really well, and there was nothing we talked about that I didn't know, but I just, as it was unfolding

741
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,080
and we were having the discussion, I remember thinking, you know what? I think a lot of people

742
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:20,120
are going to really benefit from this episode. I know I was. And then we've already touched on

743
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:26,440
some, but you look at the Catherine E. Ben podcast, which is just an unbelievable opportunity to,

744
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:32,120
I think, help people with information, which is also kind of part of the itch that we're trying

745
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:37,080
to scratch here. So the irony of it is if I sat here long enough, Bob, I could tell you something

746
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,840
special about all 99 that came before this with the exception of the AMAs. I could probably rattle

747
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:48,520
off something special about 80 of these podcasts through the lens of one or more filter.

748
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,880
Yeah. I'm going to bring Tom Brady into the podcast. I mean, it's probably a record as far

749
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:59,000
as how long I've waited. I think he's often asked the question, what's his favorite Super Bowl ring?

750
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,880
And he says the next one. So I think maybe you think about that with the episodes. What's your

751
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,920
favorite episode? Might be the next one for me. I mean, that's how it is for me. I like reflecting

752
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:13,960
on these episodes, but the research that goes into these guests. And I think we just have a lot of

753
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:20,200
similarities as far as our interests. So for me, for me, for you to be creating the podcasts that

754
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:26,600
you would want to listen to having Z dog, who's your buddy Stanford from Z dog to Marty. I don't

755
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:32,840
is it Macquarie Macquarie. I usually say Macquarie to Mark Messier to say like, why hasn't

756
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,720
somebody sat down for a multiple hour podcast with Mark Messier and just talk about the Oilers,

757
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,400
one of the greatest teams, if not, I'm sure you would say maybe the greatest team

758
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:47,560
ever in any sport. I mean, that stuff to me is so cool. Yeah, I think about it that way that it's

759
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:52,680
similar. I could talk about each one of them and how great they are, but I'm hopefully looking

760
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,800
forward to the ones that come too. Well, I mean, I am as well. I think we're, I just, I know we're

761
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:03,000
getting better at this. And I remember having, I think I may have even mentioned this once before

762
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,040
on a podcast, whether it was ours or someone else's that I had this little tiny fear when we started

763
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,800
that we were going to run out of things to talk about and run out of people to interview. And

764
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,760
I was sort of reluctant to start this thing and then realize, well, after 50 episodes,

765
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:22,760
there's nothing left to do. And I think you can attest to the fact that our list of people we want

766
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:29,080
to have on is growing at the same rate as our AMA list of questions. Like we can't interview

767
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:35,320
people quick enough at the rate that we want to learn stuff. So I have a feeling we're going to

768
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:40,520
be able to do this for a very long time. And I do look forward to getting better at it. It is a craft

769
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,720
and it's hard. I do try to listen to some of the podcasts to learn from them. And I've certainly

770
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:50,280
picked up a number of things I could be doing better. And as I think I talked about on Tim's

771
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:56,280
podcast, I enjoy listening to other really good podcasts for some insight into how to do this

772
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,720
thing better. But anyway, I'm excited about it. And it's hard to imagine what the next hundred

773
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,840
have to hold actually. Yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to it. I think maybe we cheers, have some

774
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,240
champagne or you can wrestle a centenarian to commemorate the moment. I'm sure that's what you

775
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,800
probably have that on your schedule anyway. Yeah, I've got a little bit of centenarian

776
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:22,680
boxing this afternoon. Yeah. Well, Bob, this was a good idea. I don't know if it was your idea or

777
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,520
Nick's idea, but maybe both of you guys deserve credit for this. But I think this was a fun way

778
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,760
to commemorate a hundred kind of looking back and looking forward. Absolutely. Thank you for

779

788
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:23,080
than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions,

789
