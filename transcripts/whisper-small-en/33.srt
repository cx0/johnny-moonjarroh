00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,400
Hey, welcome to this episode of The Drive.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,680
On this episode, I interview an amazing scientist and a very dear friend, Dr. Rudy Leibel.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:58,560
Rudy's a professor at Columbia University where his work has focused primarily on type

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,440
2 diabetes and obesity.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,920
I've known Rudy for quite a while, probably about six years now, maybe a little longer.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,900
We worked together very closely back at the nutrition science initiative where he was

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,920
one of the very important collaborators in one of the more theoretical experiments that

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
we did.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,480
Rudy and I have always just had a ton of fun just hanging out over great meals and great

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,560
wine and great beer, talking about science.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,000
And so I thought it might be fun to try to reproduce some of those discussions here.

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Couple things.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,720
First, we recorded this on a Friday afternoon on the Upper East Side and you'll probably

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,440
notice a little more noise than usual just on account of the street noise.

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,000
So apologies for that.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,920
Second point is we spend quite a bit of time, probably about the first hour and 10, hour

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,200
and 15 minutes just talking about the discovery of leptin for which Rudy played arguably the

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
single most important role.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
I see many people played a role in the discovery of leptin, but in many ways Rudy was sort

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,200
of the chief architect of that.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,000
And certainly inside of the scientific community, he is largely regarded as that, though unfortunately

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,240
history may write that story a little bit differently.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,900
So for those of you listening to this who don't really, really get off on geeky science

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,840
and knowing the nuts and bolts of all of the experiments and how one found this gene and

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,120
the difference between a southern blot and a northern blot and a DNA sequence, you might

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,160
just want to skip to about an hour 15 when we get to the other stuff.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,500
But that said, if you really are interested in science, I think there's a lot to be gained

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,040
from listening to these discussions because that's certainly something I plan to do a

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,480
lot of as interview scientists.

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,720
And part of that is kind of understanding their stories.

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,320
Again, a lot of what we talk about in this post is technical.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm hopeful that in the show notes we'll be able to provide a lot of sort of the necessary

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,320
glossary to make it a little easier to ingest.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,120
I don't do a great job, I apologize, of trying to clarify terms.

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,080
Occasionally I remember that not everybody knows what hyperphasia means and I explained

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,160
that that means eating too much.

48
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,000
But again, I apologize for that and just look to the show notes if you want clarification

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
on anything.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,500
We get into a lot of discussion around obesity, the genetics of obesity and the regulation

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
of obesity.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,360
How much of this is regulated centrally, meaning in the brain, versus peripherally, everywhere

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,100
outside of the brain?

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,300
We talk a lot about energy expenditure and for those of you who are really interested

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,660
in this science, Rudy gives a great explanation of the two techniques that are used to measure

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,720
energy expenditure, known as indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water.

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,900
We talk about a number of genes that are known to predispose to obesity, some very acutely

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,380
and some very crudely, like the FTO gene.

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,340
And we of course talk a lot about insulin resistance, which in many ways is sort of

60
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,980
a bit of a paradox because on the one hand if you're insulin resistant, you technically

61
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,780
shouldn't be able to get fat.

62
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,900
But of course, many insulin resistant people are able to get fat.

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,940
They do accumulate adipose tissue.

64
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
What else can I say about this?

65
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,020
I guess those are kind of the most important things I'd say to guide you.

66
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,660
So in summary, if you really don't want to hear about how leptin was discovered, skip

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,460
to an hour 15.

68
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,940
If you do, sit back and relax.

69
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,740
The other highlight of this was it was the first time I ever gave Rudy a topo chico.

70
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,580
He loved it.

71
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,460
And I think I've got another convert.

72
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,340
So anyway, hope you enjoy this.

73
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,020
Without further ado, here is my lovely discussion with the amazing Dr. Rudy Blaben.

74
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,300
Alright Rudy, how are you?

75
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,380
I'm very well, thank you.

76
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,940
Thanks so much for trekking over to the east side.

77
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,900
Well, thanks for inviting me.

78
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,460
This will be one of the first times in a while that we hang out without a drink, including

79
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,340
my favorite beer, which you're one of the few people I've shared it with.

80
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,180
I don't tell anybody what that beer is because I, and I just found 19 bottles of it in Florida

81
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
last week.

82
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,060
So I'm pretty psyched about that.

83
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,420
I'll continue to share with you, of course.

84
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Still in Florida?

85
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,460
No, it's actually in San Diego right now.

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,260
Yeah, just arrived.

87
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,420
There's so much I want to talk about.

88
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,540
I almost don't even know where to begin.

89
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,380
I'm guessing that a number of the people listening to this won't actually know who you are necessarily.

90
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,660
But I think by the end of this, they'll be super interested in learning more about you.

91
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,620
During the introduction, I will have explained sort of a lot of stuff about you.

92
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,180
But tell me a little bit about what you do and then more importantly, why you do it.

93
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,140
I've been very interested since, oh, past 30 years or so in biology of the regulation

94
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,460
of body weight in both animals and humans.

95
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:45,660
But the studies of animals are designed primarily to shed light on what's the basis for the

96
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,580
control of body weight in humans.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,220
I'm a physician and have been interested in the clinical problem of obesity for even longer

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,980
than I've been doing research on it.

99
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:06,820
And I have taken over the years various approaches, beginning with studies of human adipose tissue

100
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,420
aspirated using various needles from various subcutaneous depots in humans, meaning around

101
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,380
the rear end and in the front of the abdomen.

102
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,300
And then became very interested in the genetics of obesity and have done some studies trying

103
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,300
to identify various genes that are related to that and continue to do so and have also

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,140
done a large number of studies in mice designed to look at this problem.

105
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:44,420
And very recently, or at least within the past five or ten years, have begun to focus

106
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,540
on the use of stem cells to try to understand, again, the biology of brain cells that regulate

107
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,940
body weight and the cells and the pancreas that produce insulin.

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,380
Because obesity and diabetes go hand in hand clinically.

109
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,820
And this is not an accident.

110
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,220
They're very tightly related in a number of really very interesting ways.

111
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:17,340
So that my studies of obesity have led more or less inexorably towards the study of diabetes

112
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
as well.

113
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,220
So now my laboratory really does some of both.

114
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,020
And you're at Columbia now, you were at Rockefeller before that, but originally you were in Boston,

115
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
correct?

116
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
That's correct.

117
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,100
My clinical training, I'm trained as a pediatrician and an endocrinologist.

118
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,860
And that training took place in Boston at both the Massachusetts General Hospital and

119
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,380
the Children's Hospital.

120
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,940
And then for five or six years, I worked at both the Mass General and a community hospital

121
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:54,020
in the Boston area, the Cambridge City Hospital, again, doing both general pediatrics and some

122
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,060
endocrinology.

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,660
So what got you interested in obesity?

124
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,620
I was interested in obesity, or at least in the part of the brain that regulates body

125
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,820
weight, even as a medical student.

126
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,940
We didn't study it specifically.

127
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,700
It wasn't emphasized the role of the hypothalamus, which turns out to be very important in that

128
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,700
regard.

129
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,780
I had the opportunity as a medical student, actually a first year medical student, to

130
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:27,500
work at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research with a neuroscientist named Harvey

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:35,740
Carton, who was a physician who was interested actually in the study of bird brains.

132
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,580
And he took me on for a summer, actually it ended up being two summers, to work in his

133
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,900
laboratory primarily helping with histological studies of the bird brain.

134
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,700
But the laboratory that he was in was run by a man named Wally J.H.

135
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,060
Nauta, who was recognized at the time, and subsequently perhaps even more so as one of

136
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,860
the great neuroanatomists with regard to the hypothalamus.

137
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,740
So actually I was indoctrinated a bit just by hanging around the other people who were

138
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,540
working there, including Dr. Carton, in terms of the importance of the hypothalamus in

139
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,820
a number of areas of physiology.

140
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,980
Where does the hypothalamus sit in relation to the pituitary or even more grossly like

141
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,460
other main structures in the brain?

142
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,940
I think you can sort of picture it as lying between or being triangulated in a sense or

143
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,300
at the cross hairs of a line drawn between the eyes and the side of the forehead.

144
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,500
And it's situated just above the pituitary gland, if you know where that is.

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,180
Yeah, which is sort of behind the optic chiasm.

146
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,900
Yes, that's correct.

147
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,260
And it's a very small organ, or at least it's a very small part of the brain, about the

148
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,620
tip of the small finger, but does play a role in the regulation of many important physiological

149
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:09,540
functions, including things like blood pressure, body temperature, and from my point of view,

150
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,380
very importantly, body weight, and also increasingly apparent that it plays an important role in

151
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,460
blood sugar control as well.

152
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,460
So it's been known for many, many years as being a critical part of the brain, the so-called

153
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,180
vegetative brain, not under conscious control.

154
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,260
Work that's gone on over the past 30, 40, 50 years has increasingly raised the level

155
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,580
of sophistication with which we understand the function of that part of the brain.

156
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,100
About 21 years ago, or maybe 20 years ago, whenever it was, but early in medical school,

157
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,900
I remember when we did neuroanatomy, the professor said, if you have to sacrifice any part of

158
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,820
your brain and you're prioritizing, the last thing you want to sacrifice is the hypothalamus.

159
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,420
If you're only allowed to keep a couple square centimeters of brain, keep the hypothalamus.

160
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,460
You know, I mean, we could get into the weeds, exactly.

161
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,980
That's a poor man's problem.

162
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
That's right.

163
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,460
I think that would be important.

164
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,300
The other thing you'd want to hang onto is the part of the brain that regulates respiration,

165
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,380
because even with the hypothalamus, if you're not breathing, you're not going to get very

166
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,380
far.

167
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
But I agree.

168
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,820
I think he was excluding the brain stem for this.

169
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
The hypothalamus is right up there.

170
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,220
At some point, I want to come back to it.

171
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,420
I want to have you tell us all about zucker rats, because that's sort of what got me interested

172
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,180
in this idea of how can this part of the brain, when subjected to so many different types

173
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,860
of insults and lesions, produce so many seemingly wild and disparate phenotypes that seem so

174
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
out of whack.

175
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:57,540
But before we go there, let's go back to your junior pediatrician schlepping along, taking

176
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,820
care of overweight kids.

177
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,140
We're in the late 70s.

178
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,380
What time of your life is this?

179
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,980
Yeah, we're in the mid 70s.

180
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Mid 70s.

181
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,140
So there's not that many obese kids, are there?

182
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
There were plenty.

183
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,660
Still in back then, yeah.

184
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Oh, yeah.

185
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,140
So what are you doing for them?

186
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
How are you helping them?

187
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:23,900
So back in that day, the conventional view was that obesity was largely due to imbalances

188
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,020
of hormones, at least potentially, in addition to whatever other sort of behavioral issues

189
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,860
might be implicated.

190
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:38,780
But almost all children with obesity were referred, if it was significant and severe

191
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,340
enough, to either an endocrinologist or a psychiatrist.

192
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,220
That was sort of the bifurcation point for a referral of these children.

193
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,100
I don't think either the endocrinologist or the psychiatrist really could do very much

194
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
for these children.

195
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,380
I certainly couldn't.

196
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,820
And it was an evening in the fall in the city of Cambridge in a small office that I used

197
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,500
for the very small number of referrals that I actually saw.

198
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,420
Most of my time was spent with the medical students trying to teach them various aspects

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,220
of pediatrics.

200
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,700
But one evening, I saw a young boy about seven or eight years old with his mother and examined

201
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,180
him, weighed him, and so forth, and determined it's quite clear that he was very obese.

202
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,300
He had no other stigmata of the sorts of things that we looked for, meaning very severe problems

203
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,820
with thyroid or adrenal gland, which can sometimes produce severe obesity.

204
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,300
And he didn't have any of the stigmata of the single genetic type of disorders that

205
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,780
were known about at the time, like Prader-Willi syndrome or part A-butyl.

206
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,220
And I said to the mother, your son has severe obesity.

207
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,180
I can't tell you what the etiology of it is.

208
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,700
It's clear that there's something going on.

209
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,020
There's problems that we don't really fully understand or understand very well at all.

210
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:09,980
And my only advice is to try to restrict the number of calories that he eats and increase

211
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,860
his physical activity, which is, I think, unobjectionable advice in any circumstance

212
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,900
like that.

213
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:25,580
And the mother turned to the boy and said, Randall, let's get out of here.

214
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,620
This doctor doesn't know shit.

215
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,100
I love that you remember his name.

216
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh, yes.

217
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,540
I do remember his name.

218
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,060
And she took him by the hand and they left.

219
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,820
And I remember sitting behind the desk and thinking to myself, Randall's mother, you've

220
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,780
got a point.

221
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,700
And it was that experience, actually, I'd been interested in some of the physiological

222
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:58,100
aspects of obesity and adipose tissue that led me to decide that if I was going to do

223
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,900
anything about this, I was going to have to train myself to do the kind of research

224
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,380
that might be helpful in terms of understanding the disease.

225
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,060
And it was shortly after that that I actually moved to New York, to the Rockefeller, to

226
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,460
begin to try to do those kinds of experiments.

227
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,580
That story, which obviously we've discussed before, and I get such a kick out of it.

228
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,580
But at the same time, it's actually a remarkable example of something that medicine is a privilege.

229
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,860
It gives you a privilege and it's up to you to do anything with it, which is patients

230
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,100
generally provide the appropriate physician with the right level of humility.

231
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,300
And I think, look, it's a testament to you that you sort of could reflect on what Randall's

232
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,140
mom said, because I think there are other people who couldn't.

233
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,500
There are other people who could say, well, screw you.

234
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,700
That's the advice I've got.

235
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,340
And that's the best I can do.

236
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,340
And it wouldn't skip a beat kind of moving on.

237
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,460
But when I talk to a lot of great physician scientists, that seems to be the one thing

238
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,900
that they all have in common.

239
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,620
They may have many things in common, but this one is important, which is it's the ability

240
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,100
to sort of pause on your tracks and say, wait a minute, there is a clinical situation and

241
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,700
I cannot for the life of me explain it.

242
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,580
And I have to know the answer.

243
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,280
So it's so amazing that one chance encounter like that basically altered the entire course

244
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,940
of your career and put you on this path to do some really amazing stuff, as we'll, I

245
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,980
think, discuss in the next hour or so.

246
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,940
I think you're probably right that one of the great, I think, privileges of a medical

247
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,420
education is that it does give you a very broad perspective on the human condition,

248
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:42,100
if you want to call it that, all the way from psychological issues to very fundamental biological

249
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
ones.

250
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:50,540
And physicians as a group do have this, as you pointed out, rather unique opportunity

251
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:58,020
to look at a problem that afflicts human beings, sometimes at the level of basic metabolism

252
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,060
and endocrinology, other times on a more systemic or even social level.

253
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,860
And I'm sure we could name some of the names of people who have operated all these levels,

254
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,540
but I think you're right.

255
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,860
I've always felt that it was really somehow an enormous opportunity and a gift to be able

256
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:27,180
to pursue this down to the level that I've been able to do in the past 30 years or so.

257
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:33,980
And I must say, in addition to whatever my previous training and experience did to make

258
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:41,180
that possible, I also have to acknowledge that my family was very supportive in terms

259
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,660
of allowing me to basically back out of a more classical sort of academic medical track

260
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,660
and retrain myself to the level that I thought was required in order to do this research

261
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,180
or basically move from a very nice home in Brookline, Massachusetts to an 800 square

262
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:09,700
foot apartment in Manhattan with a wife and two small children and lived there for 15

263
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,540
or 16 years while I sort of got my act together.

264
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,300
There's plenty of great research that can happen at Harvard.

265
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,820
Why did you come to New York?

266
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,940
I came to New York actually after looking around in the Boston area for someone who

267
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,700
could mentor me in this kind of activity.

268
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,340
And it turned out there were, I mean, there's some interesting stories about that, but the

269
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,300
advice that I got from the people who were not in a position to help me in the way that

270
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,180
I thought I needed help was that I might consider going to the Rockefeller and working with

271
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,780
a physician scientist named Jules Hirsch, who at the time was very interested in the

272
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,220
biology of adipose tissue from a number of perspectives.

273
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,620
And I had actually communicated with Dr. Hirsch in the literature by commenting on some of

274
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:04,060
the work that he had done with regard to adipocytes and signals that might come from adipocytes

275
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,480
that affect potentially food intake and body weight.

276
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,600
This was an area that he was quite interested in, and I was too based on some of the thinking

277
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,120
I had done about it while I was in the training in Boston.

278
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,760
And he and I actually had had a communication in the literature on some of the work that

279
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
he had done.

280
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,040
And I went actually to visit his laboratory while I was in New York for an entirely different

281
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
reason.

282
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,200
And it was very shortly after that that I moved.

283
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,640
Which is another great example of the types of common threads we see in great scientists,

284
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,960
whether they be scientists or physician scientists, which is mentorship, right?

285
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,800
Again, every person I talk to who's done something remarkable in science can point to mentors,

286
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,200
a mentor or mentors.

287
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,760
And obviously for you, Jules was probably the most important mentor, I'm guessing.

288
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
That's right.

289
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,880
I had very important other mentors in the area of clinical medicine.

290
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,080
And the one who trained me in endocrinology, an individual, again, a physician scientist,

291
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,120
more clinically oriented named Jack Crawford, himself was very interested in the role of

292
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,920
body fat and its interaction with other physiological systems in the body, most notably the onset

293
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
of puberty.

294
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,480
And it was he that actually put me in contact with another scientist at Harvard named Rose

295
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,600
Frisch, who also was very interested in why, for example, young women who lost weight as

296
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:41,280
a result of anorexia or more commonly in her experience due to very vigorous physical training

297
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,000
for things like distance running or bicycling.

298
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,760
Swimming became amenorrhea.

299
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
In other words, their period stopped.

300
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,760
And Rose was very curious about why this was and whether there was a communication between fat and

301
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,920
parts of the brain that regulate the gonadal axis, which is the hypothalamus again.

302
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,840
And I remember having many conversations with Rose about where the signal might be coming from.

303
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,080
She thought it actually might be coming from adipose tissue or adipocytes in the bone marrow.

304
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,040
And it was always encouraging me to study bone marrow as a source of whatever this signal might be.

305
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,080
So what year did you arrive at Rockefeller?

306
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
1978.

307
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,280
At that point in time, was the adipose tissue, was it was adipose cell?

308
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,840
Were they was this regarded as an inert sort of storage depot for fatty acid or was it considered an endocrine organ?

309
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,640
Like what was the state of thinking about fat?

310
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:52,800
At that time, the view of the role of adipose tissue was very strongly in the direction of the sort of former

311
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:06,000
characterization that you made, which is that it was a passive depot for fat in the form of storing free fatty acids as triglycerides so that they were hydrophobic,

312
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,400
so that you could pack a lot of calories into an organ or into a cell without having a lot of water there.

313
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:20,880
So it's a very efficient way of storing energy, actually, as you know, up to probably around nine calories per gram.

314
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:35,080
And its role as a signaling device or an endocrine organ was really people were thinking about it, but there was no firm evidence in this regard.

315
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:45,280
Other than, I think, the increasing sense that the size of the adipose mass was doing something to the levels of circulating insulin,

316
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,680
that somehow insulin rises when the fat mass rises and the mechanism or the relationship of these two.

317
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Not the other way around? Was it clear which direction?

318
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:08,480
So at the time, I think the view was pretty much that as fat mass increases, the concentration of insulin rises to meet the consequences of so-called insulin resistance,

319
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:16,480
which occurred not only in adipose tissue, but maybe more importantly in liver and muscle.

320
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:29,480
And so that there was some relationship between fat mass and this endocrine, but fat mass is a secretory organ itself of molecules that might have some of these effects.

321
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:37,480
It was really a pretty new idea that nobody really had any direct, at least at the time, evidence for.

322
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Obviously, we're going to get to the story of leptin, which I think is just another great example of incredible persistence, an incredible focus and drive.

323
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:58,480
But obviously, before getting to the punchline, which occurred several decades later, what was your first insight into a hormone that would go on to be leptin?

324
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Where did you first figure this that there was something that was being secreted by fat cells?

325
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:19,480
I think the first evidence in this regard, or at least some of the most important evidence, came from experiments that were done by an investigator at the Jackson Laboratories in Maine named Douglas Coleman.

326
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:36,480
And Coleman was a biochemist, a physiologist who was interested in some of the rare mouse mutations that led to very severe obesity.

327
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:48,480
And he was one of the first to study the OB-OB or OB's mouse, which was a spontaneous mutation that arose in the Jackson colony.

328
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:59,480
And he also was one of the close students of another mutation that arose there a number of years later in the so-called diabetes or DB gene.

329
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,480
So what was the phenotype of this OB-OB mouse?

330
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,480
The OB-OB mouse was –

331
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,480
That's not to be confused with the OB-1 Kenobi mouse. That's a very different phenotype, right?

332
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
That's correct.

333
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:20,480
The OB-OB mouse was noted to be very severely obese, very early in life.

334
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:30,480
So these animals were clearly obese by the time shortly after weaning, which is three or four weeks of age.

335
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:41,480
You could tell that they were obese. And if you left them alone and let them eat as much as they wanted, they would eat up to the point of becoming pretty heroically obese,

336
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,480
meaning these animals could reach weights of 70 or 80 grams,

337
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:56,480
whereas a normal so-called wild-type mouse at maximum weight would be somewhere around 40 or 50 grams much later in life.

338
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,480
An OB mouse could get up to 60 or 70 grams very early in life. The animals were infertile.

339
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
So how did they keep breeding them?

340
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,480
So the way they would breed these animals is breed the parents, the heterozygous animals that were able to generate the –

341
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
So get two heteros to make homos.

342
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Correct.

343
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
So the phenotype centered around hyperphasia?

344
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,480
It was centered around two phenotypes, actually, that Dr. Coleman was able to show.

345
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Primarily, the obesity was due to hyperphagia, but he also was able to demonstrate by a mechanism –

346
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Sorry, I should just clarify for listeners, that means excessive appetite.

347
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Yes, by excess food intake.

348
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,480
That was the primary cause of their obesity.

349
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:47,480
But he also, by using a technique called peer feeding, where he would only feed the animal the amount that a normal-weight animal would eat,

350
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,480
that those animals tended to store more of their excess calories as fat.

351
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
We sometimes refer to this as partitioning.

352
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,480
And by another set of experimental maneuvers, he was able to show that their metabolic rate was slower.

353
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,480
So these animals had what you might call a trifecta for obesity.

354
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,480
They ate more, spent less, and whatever they stored was preferentially stored as fat.

355
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
And these were fascinating animals.

356
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,480
People tried for many years to figure out what was wrong with them,

357
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,480
and they had many metabolic consequences of their obesity.

358
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,480
But nothing about their physiology necessarily pointed to what the primary mechanism was,

359
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:39,480
where the genetics clearly indicated that this was a single gene, or very likely to be a single.

360
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,480
And this, of course, is long before you've got your PCR technology that can very easily help you sequence this.

361
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
So two questions, though.

362
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Lifespan was what?

363
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Lifespan not severely affected, actually.

364
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,480
They could live to a fairly normal lifespan, somewhat short and fast.

365
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Two and a half, three years.

366
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Not quite. They didn't last quite that long, but certainly up to 18 months or two years.

367
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Important to note, because of the question of whether fat makes something or not,

368
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:17,480
the human not only observed these OB mice, but also this second mutation that arose later at the Jackson lab

369
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
and was named the diabetes mouse.

370
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,480
That's because that animal looked a lot like an OB mouse, but got diabetes very early in life,

371
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:35,480
unlike the OB mouse, which seemed to be obese, but not necessarily particularly diabetes-prone.

372
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,480
It was clear that the mutation in the gene, again, another single gene that caused the diabetes mouse,

373
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
was not the OB gene.

374
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
It was on a different chromosome.

375
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Coleman was able to show that.

376
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:56,480
So here you had animals that looked a great deal like each other, at least in terms of the overeating and the low energy expenditure.

377
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
One was prone to get diabetes, and the other not.

378
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:10,480
What Coleman ultimately did was to join the circulation of the OB mouse to a wild-type animal

379
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,480
and the DB, or diabetes mouse, to a wild-type animal using it.

380
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
So like a live parabiosis.

381
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,480
That's the technical term for it, is a parabiosis.

382
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,480
He showed that if you hooked an OB mouse up to a wild-type mouse in this way,

383
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:34,480
that the OB mouse would correct its hyperphagia, its excess food intake, and actually begin to lose weight.

384
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:43,480
So something presumably in the wild-type mouse, some humoral factor, some hormone, something must have been missing in the OB-OB mouse

385
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,480
that when given to it corrected its phenotype.

386
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Correct.

387
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,480
And what happened when you did the parabiosis with the DB mouse?

388
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,480
With the DB mouse, you got the opposite situation where the wild-type animal began to lose weight

389
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,480
and actually stopped eating and would die of starvation, basically.

390
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Whereas the DB mouse just went merrily on its way, eating and remaining obese.

391
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:18,480
So Coleman thought based on these two experiments that maybe the OB mouse was missing something

392
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:26,480
that the wild-type mouse produced, and the DB mouse that looked an awful lot like an OB mouse was missing the ability to respond

393
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:34,480
to whatever that molecule or molecules were that were required to regulate body weight.

394
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:41,480
And this was around the time that it was becoming clear that hormones had receptors that were specific to those hormones,

395
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,480
like thyroid, insulin, growth hormone.

396
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,480
So Coleman hypothesized that the OB mouse was missing what we refer to as the ligand, the circulating hormone,

397
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
and the DB mouse was missing the receptor for it.

398
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,480
And it turns out that Dr. Coleman was right.

399
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Everything you've just said was known by what point in time?

400
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I would say by the late 1970s.

401
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Okay, so just as you're coming on the scene, the whippersnapper who doesn't know shit,

402
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:18,480
the guy up in Jackson, up in Maine knows this, and you can't wait to get all over this.

403
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Correct.

404
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:29,480
So I began by actually studying adipose tissue to see whether there was something that might be regulated

405
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,480
by adipose tissue that would fit in this sort of general category of something that might produce a signal

406
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,480
or might be related to the anatomy of the adipose tissue.

407
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:49,480
At the time, Jules Hirsch was particularly interested in the fact that it appeared that what happens when people get obese

408
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,480
is that their fat cells expand up to a sort of maximum size, and then new fat cells begin to appear,

409
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,480
whether they were made de novo or had been resting in the area of the other adipocytes.

410
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:09,480
It wasn't clear at the time, but what happens as people get more and more obese is that more and more fat cells are recruited

411
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:17,480
so that if you look at a very obese individual, they have what is referred to in the literature as hyperplastic adipose tissue.

412
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,480
They have more fat cells, and Jules had actually figured out a way to count the fat cells of a human being.

413
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
And you can look under a microscope and see how big the fat cells are.

414
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,480
So he was very interested in what it is that permits a big fat cell to call up, if you will,

415
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,480
the other fat cells that are going to be needed once it reaches a critical size

416
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,480
and whether these fat cells were generating something that might act like a signal.

417
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Are there any organelles inside a fat cell?

418
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Oh, yeah. Fat cell has the complete repertoire of organelles that any other cell does.

419
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,480
So it's got a regular, quote unquote, regular nucleus. It's got mitochondria.

420
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's got the whole—

421
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,480
It's just its cytoplasm is dominated by these lipid droplets.

422
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Correct. It's designed to be able to hold these huge lipid droplets, but otherwise is a perfectly respectable cell,

423
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,480
has all the other components.

424
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,480
And what Jules had been doing, along with another investigator in the lab, a guy named Erv Faust,

425
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,480
was extirpating adipose tissue from rats. They were working primarily with rats.

426
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Although there were some OB mice around, I'd actually seen those when I was at Harvard in Boston,

427
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,480
endocrinologist who trained me, just talked to me about them.

428
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Jules and Erv were extirpating adipose tissue depots from rats and looking to see what happened.

429
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,480
And one of the things that they were struck by is that when they took a fat pad out,

430
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,480
if they waited long enough and just let the animal eat whatever it wanted to eat,

431
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,480
it would eat its way back up to restoring that fat pad.

432
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Through de novo creation of more fat cells, you were by—

433
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,480
You leave the capsule of the depot there and it is able to generate new fat cells.

434
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,480
And they fill up, and they don't fill up to three times the size that they were before.

435
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,480
They go right back to the appropriate size for that depot.

436
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,480
And one of the things that Jules and Erv were very interested in is how does the animal—

437
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,480
How does the animal know that it should eat a little bit more to be able to generate the fat that's been extirpated?

438
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,480
And did this experiment only work when you started with obese rats, or did it work if you took a lean rat as well?

439
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,480
It worked with lean rats just as well.

440
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,480
As a matter of fact, most of the work they did was with lean rats, or not genetically obese rats.

441
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Now, speaking of rats, you explained to us what the OB OB and the DB DB DB OB—

442
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,480
What about the Zucker rat, which preceded a lot of this stuff but had some interesting and similar features, right?

443
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Right. So the Zucker rat was discovered, or identified, if you will, by a woman named Lois Zucker, the rat's name after her and her husband.

444
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,480
And it had characteristics very similar to these mice that we were talking about, the OB and the DB mice.

445
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:28,480
They were hyperphagic. They appeared to have a little bit lower energy expenditure and would become hugely obese.

446
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,480
I mean, these animals got up to heroic size.

447
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Yeah, we're going to include some pictures of the Zucker mice in this—

448
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
The Zucker rats.

449
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
That's right, the Zucker rats in this show.

450
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Very—again, got very obese, and many, many studies were done of the Zucker rat trying to, again, understand what the mechanism behind its obesity was.

451
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Again, it appeared to be due to a single gene.

452
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
In other words, like the OB or DB mouse, there was a single mutant gene.

453
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,480
When the animal had two copies of the abnormal or low-activity gene, the animals would become very obese.

454
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:23,480
And one of the reigning hypotheses about the Zucker rat, again, at around the late 70s, early 80s, was that the fat itself was making too much of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase.

455
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:43,480
And this is an enzyme which is produced by adipose tissue, by adipocytes, which breaks down circulating triglycerides and allows the free fatty acids that are released to be taken up by the adipocytes and the glycerol backbone, so to speak, remains in the circulation.

456
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:54,480
So the idea was that the Zucker rat, for some reason, had hyperactive lipoprotein lipase, and the adipose tissue was acting like a vacuum cleaner, in a sense.

457
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:03,480
It was sucking up the circulating fat, the triglyceride, and storing it, and that's how the animals got obese.

458
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:17,480
And in association with that observation was the idea that maybe the process of sucking up substrate from the circulation does something to drive or increase food intake.

459
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:36,480
So this model was often referred to as a pull model for the development of obesity. That is, that the adipose tissue was actually acting as a pulling mechanism for substrate, which was in turn affecting food intake, so the animal got fat that way.

460
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:56,480
So the animal was effectively starving, even though it stored an unbelievable amount of energy, it was disproportionately taking those circulating metabolic fuels and putting them into storage, so that if you buy this idea that something is sensing energy availability, that would naturally drive the hyperphasia, right?

461
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Correct. And the other model, the one more consistent, say, with the OB or the DB mouse, was the so-called push model, which is that fat cells were being filled up because the brain itself had a pushing the substrate.

462
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:25,480
So these push-pull models were very much discussed in terms of what they said about where the primary mechanisms might be for the control of body weight.

463
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Was it the adipose tissue that was basically begging for more fuel and sucking it in and causing the animal to eat that way, or was there something going on primarily in the brain that was influencing the food intake and the adipose tissue was being passed?

464
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:55,480
And like all good problems in medicine, there's examples of both that are quite elegant, right? I mean, that's sort of the challenge of this is when you look at this in experimental models, you could find very elegant examples of each, correct?

465
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:10,480
You could find elegant examples that pointed in the direction of both of these. It was interesting. I mean, it was the whole issue of lipoprotein lipase suggested that, again, this model, the Zucker rat, that was used in the last few years, was that it was very much a very elegant example of each.

466
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:18,480
The Zucker rat was used to support this idea that the LPL was, as it was referred to, was critical in this regard.

467
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:32,480
But it was known that individuals who had total lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and there are such individuals on a genetic basis, had very, very high levels of circulating triglyceride.

468
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I mean, these can be life-threatening in terms of the levels that are reached, but they had perfectly normal adipose tissue.

469
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:51,480
So this suggested that maybe LPL wasn't critical or an absolute meaning you would expect those patients to have sky high triglycerides and be emaciated. Yes, and they weren't, and they aren't.

470
00:39:51,480 --> 00:40:03,480
So this was already sort of a question about the lipoprotein lipase. And we know that those patients were completely deficient in LPL. Yes. Does that mean they had no LPL on their muscle cells as well?

471
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:11,480
So the individuals who are totally deficient in LPL have no LPL on any cell type.

472
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,480
It's hard to imagine how they function. Does that mean they're completely dependent on glycolysis?

473
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:30,480
They are able to take up the fatty acids. They don't need the LPL to break down the triglyceride. They do fine. I mean, in terms of being able to, there's nothing wrong with their manipulation or movement of fatty acid.

474
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,480
And that's probably why they have normal adipose tissue and normal muscle.

475
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:43,480
So it's interesting the history of this, and just to mention this, we now know what the Zucker mutation is.

476
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:59,320
And one of the earliest experiments I did at Rockefeller, or one of the relatively early experiments, is we tried to map the position of the Zucker obesity gene in the same way that we were already trying to map with the

477
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:12,480
footwear and ultimately clone the OB and DB gene for pretty obvious reasons at this point, that we wanted to figure out what the signal and whether there was a receptor for this.

478
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:28,480
And as part of this work, a student who worked with me named Gary Truitt made a map of the position of the Zucker gene, which we did by crossing the Zucker rats with another strain of rats so that we could make what's referred to as a genetic map.

479
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,480
And tell me how that works, because everything I've ever done with genes came after we had the luxury of real-time PCR.

480
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:49,480
And we just said, you know, my generation had it so easy. You guys like, when I hear stories about people doing positional gene stuff, you know, 40, 50 years ago, I'm like, wow, that's incredible.

481
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,480
So tell me, technically, like, what were you actually doing to positionally isolate that?

482
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:19,480
So the way these experiments are done, they're pretty much the same principle, is that you take in the case of rats or mice, which you have this luxury, you can cross one strain of mouse or rat to another strain of mouse or rat, and then look for signposts of genetic variation along the entire genome of the animal.

483
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:31,480
And each strain has different sequences of DNA. The major differences are in the so-called non-coding region. Some of the differences are in coding regions.

484
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:46,480
And back then, we used a technique called southern blotting to look for basically putting down signposts on the DNA of an animal to figure out where the differences between the strains resided.

485
00:42:46,480 --> 00:43:15,480
And by monitoring the obesity of the animal and knowing which strain was actually carrying the gene that we didn't know what it was, but we know what strain it came from, in this case, the Zucker strain, we could actually mark the DNA of these animals that had been interbred and figure out where the Zucker chromosome, the Zucker genetic markers, were segregated.

486
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,480
We would look for correlation of region which has the Zucker genetic variation with the obesity of the animals.

487
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Because if you do these crosses in the way that I described, you get some obese, you're going to get in some non-obese animals, and then by relating where the sequences are corresponding to the strain from which you know the gene is being used, you can see the gene is being used.

488
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,480
And this was a qualitative assessment, not so much a quantitative assessment, right?

489
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:58,480
So the quantitative assessment is, is the animal obese or not obese? You absolutely have to get this right because the obese animal has, in this particular model, a lot of the genes that are being used in the genome.

490
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:24,480
So the quantitative assessment is, is the animal obese or not obese? You absolutely have to get this right because the obese animal has, in this particular model, two copies of the mutant gene that's producing the obesity, and if it's not obese, it either has one or zero copies, and you need to be absolutely clear what the phenotype is, so to speak, of the animal is.

491
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:36,480
And then if you put these markers down, these signposts down, you can define an interval in which that gene must reside.

492
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,480
So it's actually, it's, in a sense, it's quantitative at the level of the phenotype.

493
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,480
So the best you could do is say this is on, you know, 17p or 17q. That's, that's like the level of resolution you can get out of this?

494
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Yes.

495
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,480
What happened when they did a parabiosis with a zucker rat? Did anyone do that?

496
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:08,480
There have been parabiosis experiments done with rats, but they've generally done these in a, in a slightly different way from the way you asked the question.

497
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:21,480
And those studies have again supported the idea that the zucker rat may be overproducing, like the DB mouse, the product which is suppressive of food intake.

498
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:37,480
And as a matter of fact, when we were trying to clone these genes, I actually took blood out of zucker rats and injected it into DB mice to see whether or not I could slow down their food intake, because at one time we were worried that we might not be able to get it.

499
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,480
We might not be able to get the gene by mapping and would have to try to isolate the product out of the blood of an animal.

500
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,480
But the zucker rat studies supported the idea that the same as the mice.

501
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:59,480
So we'll fast forward now into the late seventies, early eighties. You're working mostly now in the lab. Your clinical responsibilities have shrunk significantly, right?

502
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:23,480
So at the time I was doing these experiments, I had some experiments still going on, no clinical practice at all, but I was studying humans in the clinical research center at Rockefeller, looking at the effects of weight loss and weight gain on energy metabolism in these individuals.

503
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Again, beginning to try to understand what it is that's regulating body weight in a human.

504
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:52,480
The idea being that if you reduce the body weight of a human down by 10 or 20%, what happens to them metabolically that might be consistent with some of these things that had been seen in mice that would suggest that, again, in humans there's regulatory pathways that are there in order to regulate the amount of weight.

505
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:08,480
Regulate the amount of stored energy. So my time was basically split between doing these studies of humans who were in the clinical research center for long periods of time when we would study the metabolic consequences of perturbing their body weight.

506
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,480
The other was spent trying to identify these genes and try to clone the genes.

507
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:28,480
So how did that progress through the 80s as you were working to try to identify specifically the OB OB gene? And again, the reason you were pretty confident that it was a single gene was just based on the breeding pattern.

508
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Yes, the breeding pattern clearly indicated that this was a single.

509
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Because it was sort of Mendelian.

510
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:45,480
Yes, absolutely Mendelian. So so-called autosomal recessive Mendelian as is the DB mouse and the Zucker rat. So what we did is what I basically described for the rat.

511
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,480
Why was it harder for the mice?

512
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,480
To clone the gene?

513
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Yes.

514
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
It was not harder.

515
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
It was not.

516
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:03,480
No, no, I think it was equally difficult. What I was describing is when we didn't actually sort of finish that part of the conversation, we did make a map of where the Zucker gene was located.

517
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,480
The gene was located in the rat.

518
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:28,480
But we didn't clone the gene out of the rat at that time. And what that experiment showed is that that was interesting aproposis lipoprotein lipase hypothesis is that the Zucker gene was in a part of the rat genome entirely separate from where the LPL gene was located.

519
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:44,480
So from that experiment alone, we knew that it couldn't be LPL as the causal mechanism of the Zucker rat. We didn't know what it was, but we could clearly identify what it wasn't.

520
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Because if the gene is not in the location that is segregating with the phenotype, it's not the gene. This was hard for people, I think, to understand or at least to accept at the time.

521
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:15,480
But the LPL, I think, was not full appreciation of what an experiment like that represents, which is basically an unequivocal falsifying experiment. That is, if it isn't in the place where the gene must be, then it can't be the gene.

522
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,480
I mean, it's a syllogism.

523
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,480
Yeah. And you don't get a lot of those in science.

524
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,480
No, you don't get those.

525
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,480
Especially in biology.

526
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,480
Right. And so this early on, this was one of the proofs that at least we knew one gene that it wasn't.

527
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,480
It wasn't.

528
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:43,480
And then, to sort of back then to your question, we used a very similar strategy, an identical strategy, with the mice. We crossed the mice to strains that were different from the strain on which the mutation existed.

529
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:53,480
And by doing that, we're able to make maps of the region where the gene was located. And that was actually known for other reasons. Coleman had figured it out.

530
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:09,480
He knew which chromosome these genes were on. So we at least had that as a sort of initial guide. But what the gene was or how it worked was obviously entirely unknown.

531
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,480
What was Coleman's training?

532
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:27,480
What was trained is a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin, I think. And we actually consulted with Dr. Coleman, Doug, very early on, matter of fact, very early on in the process about which strains of mice might be appropriate as so-called counter strains.

533
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:44,480
And he was extremely helpful. I mean, he used to come down. We would talk to him, go visit him at Jackson on at least one occasion, met with him in Philadelphia.

534
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
So he loved the collaboration.

535
00:50:45,480 --> 00:51:04,480
He loved it. It was very encouraging of that. He always said that he wasn't sort of au courant with regard to the tools of so-called molecular genetics. But in fact, I and Jeff Friedman, who was the other sort of PI on this project, neither of us was expert in molecular genetics.

536
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,480
So we sort of had to train ourselves to do this, as did the students who worked with us on this project.

537
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
So when did Jeff enter the lab?

538
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:25,480
I got to know Jeff because he was, he rotated as a resident, actually, at New York Hospital through Jules's lab to work with another investigator there.

539
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,480
So I got to know him when he rotated through.

540
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,480
But he and I started this project after he entered the PhD program.

541
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:43,480
He was a physician and then went on to get a PhD at Rockefeller in a different laboratory. But he and I started the project to clone these genes together.

542
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,480
About what year was that?

543
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:51,480
1985 or 1986, I guess, and, you know, 1986, probably.

544
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,480
What were the major steps that took place starting around the mid-80s that were kind of like the essential?

545
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,480
I mean, I think one of the things that's just hard for people to think to understand is how much you have to fail in science.

546
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:14,480
I mean, sounds simple, right? We want to clone a gene. And yet in that era, that was very hard to do.

547
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:26,480
Right. There were efforts underway at around the same time to clone the gene for Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, to name a few.

548
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Other single gene.

549
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Other single gene disorders. And for a number of reasons, genes that are on sex chromosomes may be a little bit easier to handle in this regard.

550
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:52,480
But the same tools were being used, the so-called Southern blotting, putting down markers across the genome, using this rather tedious technique of having to put the DNA down on a blot of some kind,

551
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:59,480
and then exposing it with radioactively tagged reagents to be able to find these individual markers.

552
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,480
This was a tedious process.

553
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:08,480
One thing that helped with the mice is that there existed a chromosome in mice.

554
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,480
So these are called Robertsonian chromosomes in which you have two chromosomes joined to each other.

555
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:22,480
And there was a so-called Robertsonian chromosome that had both chromosome four and chromosome six of the mouse attached to each other.

556
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:30,480
We knew based on Doug Coleman's work that the OB gene was on chromosome six and the DB gene was on chromosome four.

557
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:42,480
And one of the students who came to work on this project very early, a young man named Nate Bahari, who came over from New York Hospital as a medical student and spent time on this project.

558
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,480
And then went on to get a PhD working on it.

559
00:53:45,480 --> 00:54:01,480
He took glass needles, if you can believe this, and dissected out under a microscope the rough regions of the chromosome six and four that we knew must have the gene in them.

560
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:20,480
And made from those needle dissected chromosome fragments, other markers that we could put down on the DNA from these mice that we had intercross to make a finer and finer map of the region in which the gene must reside.

561
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:29,480
And otherwise, this was identical to the Zucker strategy in which we very carefully looked at, see whether a mouse was obese or not.

562
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:37,480
And again, these are mentalizing phenotypes, but we had to be absolutely sure what the phenotype of the mouse was.

563
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:47,480
And then we could use the DNA from the obese animal to make a finer and finer map around the region where the gene must reside.

564
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,480
I don't even understand how that would work.

565
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,480
What resolution of a microscope would you need to be tweaking chromosomes?

566
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
Chromosomes aren't that small.

567
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,480
I mean, you can see a chromosome quite easily with a high-powered microscope.

568
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,480
But having the steady hands and the patience to be able to do this was quite an achievement.

569
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:14,480
I would say it was sine qua non without which this project wouldn't have been done at the time.

570
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,480
We didn't have the tools, some of the ones that you already mentioned, available.

571
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:29,480
So we had to try to identify additional signposts, if you will, in the region of the two genes that we were primarily interested in.

572
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,480
That is the OB and the DB gene.

573
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,480
At the time, you're basically thinking, look, we're looking for a gene for a hormone.

574
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,480
We're probably looking for a gene for a receptor, so a ligand receptor.

575
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,480
Did you have an expectation that those would be on the same chromosome, or would that be completely unnecessary?

576
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
No, we knew that they absolutely weren't.

577
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
No, no, I knew you knew that they weren't.

578
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,480
But would you expect that?

579
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:59,480
For example, in thyroid, is T4 and TSH or T4 and TR, the thyroid receptor, or TSH and TSR, are they necessarily?

580
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,480
No.

581
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,480
No, there's no relationship.

582
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,480
No, no.

583
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:11,480
So the function doesn't require that the genes be in proximity to each other, and if they are, it's almost always just a coincidence.

584
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Got it.

585
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,480
What was the kind of critical breakthrough that led to the cloning of this gene?

586
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:31,480
So what was done basically was to make the map as fine as we could using the reagents that I mentioned to you and some others that we were able to get hold of,

587
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:43,480
and using computer programs to put these data together in such a way as to be able to generate as fine a map of the region around this gene as we could.

588
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:52,480
And then what was done was to go into the region that must contain the gene and begin to look for expressed,

589
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:02,480
meaning that the DNA was transcribed, transcripts that were being read off of this part of the DNA.

590
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:12,480
And by taking the transcripts that came off and putting them against various organs from the OB or the DB mouse,

591
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:22,480
we would look for transcripts that were specifically altered in animals that were mutant for the gene.

592
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:31,480
So you would expect, you might ordinarily expect maybe the level of the gene that we were looking for would be very low in the organ that was affected.

593
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:38,480
And again, even though we know now it was adipose tissue, and there were certainly reasons to think that might be where the OB gene was,

594
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:49,480
when we did these experiments, we actually looked at every organ in the animal, brain, thyroid, muscle, adipose tissue, anything we could get our hands on.

595
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:58,480
We actually dissected out almost everything out of a mouse to look to see where the deficiency or the excess might be.

596
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,480
Sometimes genes, transcripts are overexpressed, although they're not functionally competent.

597
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:16,480
And actually at a visit to the Jackson labs when Doug Coleman was retiring, one of the investigators there asked me if I would like to have,

598
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,480
or we would like to have mice that appeared to have the OB mutation, but a different mouse.

599
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:30,480
So the original mutation occurred in the mouse that was identified at Jackson in the early 1950s.

600
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:37,480
This was a new mutation that had arisen and almost certainly wouldn't be identical to the one that had arisen earlier.

601
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,480
But was similar in phenotypes?

602
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,480
Absolutely identical in phenotypes.

603
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,480
So I got those mice and we took them to Rockefeller.

604
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,480
What did you call them?

605
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,480
Two Js.

606
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,480
So the OB, the first mutation we referred to as one J, that's just the nomenclature, and the second one was OB2J.

607
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:07,480
And we took the OB organs out of the one Js and the two Js and ran these transcripts against them using the technique called northern blotting at the time.

608
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,480
Not to be confused with western blotting.

609
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,480
Not to be confused with western blotting.

610
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,480
So northern blotting is looking actually at RNA.

611
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:27,480
It turned out that the two J was extremely valuable animal because those animals didn't express any of what turned out to be the leptin transcript,

612
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:35,480
whereas the one Js actually overexpressed it, but it was functionally inadequate, functionally inactive.

613
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:42,480
But the transcript was increased, again, for reasons having to do with the molecular biology of how these systems work.

614
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:51,480
When we saw that there was one animal that had a very low level and the other very high, this was a smoking gun, so to speak.

615
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:58,480
This was the evidence that that piece of the genome was actually a part of the OB gene.

616
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,480
So ultimately, where did this ligand, where did it show up?

617
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:19,480
The OB gene showed up almost solely, virtually solely, I mean, in adipose tissue, fully consistent with the idea that adipose tissue was producing something that was picked up in Doug's parabiosis experiments.

618
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
Which chromosome?

619
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Chromosome six of the mouse.

620
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,480
It's chromosome seven of the human.

621
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:35,480
We actually knew that because we could put the orthologs of the mouse genes down on human DNA.

622
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:41,480
And so just like we did with the Zucker rat, we actually knew where the gene was.

623
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,480
Do mice have 23 pairs of chromosomes?

624
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,480
They have, yes, 23.

625
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,480
23 including the sex.

626
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,480
So what name was given to this?

627
01:00:50,480 --> 01:01:07,480
I mean, it's referred to as the OB gene or the name that was given to the protein is leptin, which was the name was chosen because that suggested that whatever this was, it had an effect to lighten the body weight of an animal.

628
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:16,480
So now you have it that the fat cell secretes leptin and the OB mouse can't make leptin, correct?

629
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
Correct.

630
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,480
And the DB mouse makes all the leptin in the world.

631
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:26,480
This wasn't known at the time because the gene, the first gene to be cloned was the OB gene.

632
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:34,480
And the fact that the DB gene was the receptor was actually learned in two ways.

633
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:44,480
One by taking the OB protein and putting it down on what's called an expression library from part of the brain, the choroid plexus.

634
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,480
Wait, sorry to interrupt one thing, Rudy, I apologize.

635
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,480
Did they ever do parabiosis between the OB and the DB?

636
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,480
Yes, that was done as well.

637
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,480
Okay.

638
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,480
Because that would, that should fix the OB.

639
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
It did.

640
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,480
But not the DB.

641
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Correct.

642
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,480
Okay.

643
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,480
Which is another great and elegant example that one of them had the ligand deficiency, the other had the receptor deficiency.

644
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,480
God, Mendelian genetics are freaking awesome when they work.

645
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:19,480
Yeah, well, so that was one of the reasons for using these animals is that you could use the genetics to really help to narrow down the region where these genes had to be located.

646
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:24,480
If it were a polygenic disturbance, it's really, it's a whole different order of business.

647
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:36,480
So basically the DB gene was, or the protein that was nominated to be the DB gene was pulled out of a library of, what's called an expression library of choroid plexus,

648
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,480
by using the OB protein as a probe to see what it stuck to.

649
01:02:42,480 --> 01:03:03,480
And that gene that was pulled out of the choroid plexus in that way, we then took and mapped into the DB crosses that we had and showed that that, if you will, nominated gene, mapped right in the right place for the DB gene.

650
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Which was on chromosome four in the mouse.

651
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:21,480
Yes, correct. And it also turned out that that gene, the DB gene, the leptin receptor, is the mutant in the zucker rat, which we showed by cloning the gene then out of the zucker rat, knowing where it was.

652
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:31,480
So this was hailed as one of the most important insights and breakthroughs in all of obesity research. This was, what, 1994?

653
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,480
And then the DB gene a year or two later.

654
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:45,480
What was your expectation at the time? What type of hope did you hold out for the discovery of the gene, but perhaps more importantly, the protein that it coded for?

655
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,480
So there were different schools of thought with regard to what this protein actually did.

656
01:03:51,480 --> 01:04:06,480
I think one view was that if you saw this as a protein that suppresses food intake, which it definitely does in an OB mouse, if you give it to an OB mouse, you can basically, quote, cure the animal.

657
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,480
And if you give it in very high doses to a mouse, it will suppress its food intake.

658
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:27,480
So one view was that this was a weight suppressing hormone. The other view, which was taken by Jeff Flyer, who was at Harvard at the time, later became dean, still at Harvard.

659
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:50,480
And the other thing that was extremely true was working with on this project or had worked on it and myself was that the protein was actually more important in its deficiency state as a signal to the brain that you didn't have enough energy to survive under circumstances of a fast or to have enough energy on board to successfully complete a pregnancy.

660
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:57,480
So one view was that very high levels would normally suppress body weight, although it was hard to imagine at the time.

661
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Evolutionarily, that was not a natural state.

662
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:05,480
That's correct. So that's why we were wondering right from the beginning, why would nature invent something that would suppress?

663
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,480
Right. It makes more sense that nature would say, here's a hormone that if it's low, is it kicking the pants to eat?

664
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,480
That's correct.

665
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,480
Or, and maybe other things, right? Maybe prevent you from getting pregnant.

666
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:27,480
Yes. And that's, I think, turned out to be the correct model for how this hormone, its primary mechanism of action, is that it is there to tell the brain that you don't have enough fat.

667
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:33,480
And in an OB mouse, you don't make the hormone leptin, so the brain thinks you don't have any fat.

668
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:44,480
And in the DB mouse, it doesn't receive the signal from the perfectly adequate amounts, actually high levels of leptin, so that the animal, again, thinks that it's starving.

669
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Are there human conditions that mimic the OB and DB condition of the mice?

670
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:59,480
Yes. So there are humans, there are handful of humans who have mutations of the OB gene and are obese and have many of the phenotypic characteristics of a...

671
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,480
And these are patients that you've cured with this, you give these patients leptin and you cure them?

672
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:13,480
Yes. They're curable by giving leptin. And there are a handful, again, of individuals with leptin receptor mutations, which are comparable.

673
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,480
How do you help those patients?

674
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:34,480
Those, the leptin won't help. You can't treat them with leptin. And there is no effective intervention for those people at this time, although there are drugs that are being developed that are designed to act downstream of some of the actions of leptin that might, if you could, rectify the activity there.

675
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:48,480
For example, at a receptor called the melanocortin-4 receptor, that would presumably or possibly help to rectify the phenotype of those individuals, although at present, it's not a proven effective intervention.

676
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,480
It might turn out to be.

677
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,480
It wasn't long after the discovery of leptin that what drug company came in?

678
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Amgen.

679
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:03,480
So Amgen obviously bought the rights to do this, thinking this could be a blockbuster obesity drug.

680
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,480
Mm-hmm.

681
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,480
Turned out not to be, because unless you had a leptin deficiency, it didn't seem to help much, right?

682
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:25,480
Correct. There was a major trial of the use of leptin as a therapeutic agent and obese individuals. And neither the obese individuals or the lean individuals who were in the study as controls responded very much to raising the risk.

683
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,480
Much to raising blood levels as much as tenfold above where they were normally located in those individuals.

684
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,480
So I just did a blood draw.

685
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,480
I've been doing a blood draw on myself every seven days because I'm doing, you know, me, Rudy.

686
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,480
That's just the shit I do. So my leptin level last Friday was two or less than two.

687
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,480
The cutoff was two. So I have a low level of leptin.

688
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:58,480
So if you gave me enough leptin to raise my serum levels to levels that I rarely see clinically, like when I check leptin levels on patients, which I always do, I always want to see leptin.

689
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:03,480
I want to see adiponectin. I want to see insulin. I want to see MIFA, FFA, et cetera.

690
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:09,480
It's very unusual that I'll see a leptin level, even in an overweight patient more than about 40 or 50.

691
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,480
So if you took me and you gave me that much leptin, do you think it would regulate or depress my appetite in any way?

692
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,480
Well, first of all, your leptin is low now because you're not eating. So...

693
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,480
Oh, this is even, this is back when I was eating too.

694
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:33,480
Right. So leptin is very highly correlated with body fat. At any level of body fat, if you stop eating, if you restrict calories, the level of leptin will drop by...

695
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Within what period of time?

696
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,480
Within 12, 18 hours. It'll drop by 50 percent.

697
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,480
So if we check a leptin level on a patient in the morning following a 12-hour fast, we can assume that that's about half what their fed leptin level.

698
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:53,480
Well, 12, it depends on what they've been eating. 12 may be a little short in that context. So to be safe, I would say 24.

699
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,480
Okay.

700
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:02,480
But it'll start down within 12 hours. So a 12-hour fast will give you a leptin level, which is not what it would be if you were to draw it when the patient is...

701
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:14,480
So let's say my fed level is two or three or four. My fasting level is less than two. If you injected me with enough leptin such that, let's just say my level was now 100.

702
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,480
The level that you would see in the highest fed obese patient. What would that do to me?

703
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,480
Based on the studies that have been done, the so-called leptin trial, not very much.

704
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,480
So interesting.

705
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:35,480
You might have some, at least in some of these individuals, there was some reduction in body weight, but not very significant.

706
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,480
Through the mechanism of reducing intake?

707
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:49,480
Yeah, primarily, apparently, yes. Although there weren't detailed formal studies of food intake done in those experiments.

708
01:09:49,480 --> 01:10:01,480
Now, going back to the DBs, who obviously have in many ways a worse problem, earlier you alluded to Prader-Willi. What is the genetic defect in Prader-Willi, and what's the phenotype?

709
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:16,480
So Prader-Willi is a genetic disorder in which, rather than having a single gene affected, there's a region of the genome which is, in most instances, not all, but the majority of instances, deleted.

710
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:29,480
There is a region of chromosome 15 in which there is a large deletion that is a region that has normally 20 or so genes in it.

711
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:42,480
And when deleted, when the paternal, the father's copy of this interval is deleted, the individual becomes, has a very characteristic phenotype.

712
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:57,480
Maternal, the mother's copy, is not expressed. This is called an imprinted region of the genome, which, again, for technical reasons, the only one chromosome expresses the genes from that interval.

713
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:04,480
And in the Prader-Willi region, the maternal genes are silenced. So they're there, but they're not expressed.

714
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
So the mom could be a silent carrier.

715
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:22,480
The mom could be a silent carrier is not the right term. Almost all of these individuals are the result of spontaneous deletions that occur after conception.

716
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
So it's not transmitted.

717
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:34,480
So it's sort of polygenic, and you can have—so the one example that is in my world that I get is familial hypercholesterolemia. It's a phenotypic description.

718
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:41,480
There are at least 2,000 known mutations, distinct mutations, that can produce the same phenotype.

719
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:52,480
So in that case, no one really—I don't want to say nobody cares, but it's a lot less interesting to try to map out each and every one of the genes that can lead to familial hypercholesterolemia.

720
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,480
It's more important to understand the phenotype and how to treat it.

721
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:05,480
I'm guessing Prader-Willi is not quite that diverse, but is it safe to say, if I'm understanding you correctly, that you could have two patients with Prader-Willi that will have different genes?

722
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:16,480
There are rare instances of Prader-Willi in which the number of genes deleted, rather than being that large interval that I mentioned, include only three genes.

723
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:22,480
But they're still in the region which is deleted in the large deletion patients.

724
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,480
So they're necessary and sufficient genes?

725
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:35,480
Yes. We think that those—that smaller region probably has the necessary and sufficient genes, although again, there's debate in the field about this.

726
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:40,480
The children, though, who are affected with this disorder have very characteristic phenotypes.

727
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:46,480
They actually don't grow well. They don't feed well early in life. They actually have failure to thrive.

728
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:56,480
They're floppy and hard to feed and not very responsive in terms of ingestive behaviors.

729
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:07,480
And then, again, for reasons that are entirely unknown at this point, between the ages of four, five, three years of age, they become hyperphagic.

730
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,480
They, again, drive to eat becomes very, very strong.

731
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:22,480
These are some of the most tragic stories I've ever heard. These children, who I've never taken—I'm not a pediatrician, so I've never taken care of them, but I've talked to parents of children.

732
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:34,480
They have to lock the refrigerators. I even had one parent tell me that they actually have to lock the bathroom because the child is so hungry, so hyperphasic, that he would go into the bathroom to try to eat out of the toilet.

733
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:43,480
It's true that in the majority of instances, these children require very close scrutiny of their access to food.

734
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:53,480
And in many instances, the parents or the caretakers have to resort to locking up whatever food is and would otherwise be available to the children.

735
01:13:53,480 --> 01:14:01,480
But I think it's important to point out that there are ways of managing this disorder, which has other characteristics.

736
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:19,480
There are many endocrine disturbances that go along with it, including actually growth hormone deficiency and administration of growth hormone to these children and various other sort of interventions that require a great deal of parental attention.

737
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:30,480
No doubt about that. Some of the severity of the disease is manageable at a clinical level with very high levels of scrutiny by the people who are taking care of them.

738
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:39,480
So that not all children with greater willy will necessarily become hugely obese or suffer the consequences of severe obesity.

739
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:49,480
This is one of those things where I hope I know there are folks out there trying to raise money to do clinical trials in this because anecdotally, again, there are these very interesting stories.

740
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:57,480
The first I ever heard of this was probably four years ago. I was giving a talk. I don't even remember where it was. It was in Chicago, but I can't even recall the audience.

741
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:06,480
But afterwards, a woman came up to me and I was giving a talk about longevity. It wasn't an obesity specific talk or anything like that.

742
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:12,480
But a woman came up to me and introduced herself and said her son had prayed her willy and was going off the rails, etc.

743
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,480
And at about the age of seven or eight, she put him on a ketogenic diet.

744
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:25,480
And it corrected the phenotype, including the cognitive developmental part, which often accompanies this.

745
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:35,480
She then, I guess, since that time had formed kind of a support group and you had more and more of these parents that were putting their prayer willy kids on to ketogenic diets.

746
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:43,480
Again, it's very difficult to draw much of a conclusion when you don't have control data and you have obviously the selection biases that go into these things.

747
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:49,480
But it struck me as very interesting. Do the prayer willy kids are they hyperinsulinemic?

748
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:59,480
They are hyperinsulinemic to the level that would be anticipated based on their degree of adiposity.

749
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:09,480
And in some research that we've done very recently using some of the stem cell techniques, or at least using stem cells that I alluded to much earlier,

750
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:25,480
we've got some evidence that suggests that one of the major consequences of deleting this region of the chromosome 15 by mechanisms that are somewhat complicated,

751
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:31,480
influence the expression of an enzyme called proconvertease one.

752
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:41,480
And this enzyme is critical for the processing of many of the hormones and neuropeptides that are made in the body.

753
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:52,480
Virtually all hormones and neuropeptides are made as pro hormones, that is precursor hormones that are then processed by proconvertease one.

754
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:59,480
And that is what produces or generates the mature form of the hormone or neuropeptide.

755
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:12,480
And we think actually that the phenotype, many of the phenotypes of the prayer willy patients may in fact be due to a deficiency or underactivity of proconvertease one,

756
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:23,480
which is not in the interval where this deletion occurs, but is influenced downstream by one or another of the genes in that in that interval.

757
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:29,480
And it's relevant in the question of insulin because insulin is processed by proconvertease.

758
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,480
So some of the...

759
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,480
That's where the C peptide gets cleaved off the pre hormone.

760
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,480
That's correct.

761
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:40,480
So some of the hyperinsulinemia of the prayer willy might be pro insulin.

762
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:46,480
Insulin, pro insulin has biological activity, but much lower than native insulin.

763
01:17:46,480 --> 01:18:02,480
And so if this turns out to be the case, then it might be possible to rectify some of the proter willy phenotypes by being able to increase the activity of proconvertease one pharmacologically or by other means.

764
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:15,480
So there's all this incredible work, all this incredible molecular biology and molecular genetics that's identified leptin deficiency, leptoreceptor deficiencies, the cluster of defects that lead to prayer willy.

765
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:24,480
And yet the question is how much do these things tell us about the more broad condition of obesity that afflicts?

766
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,480
I don't even know the stats.

767
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,480
I don't really keep track of this stuff anymore, but I don't know what.

768
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,480
A third of Americans are probably obese now.

769
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,480
So I'll tell you an interesting perspective on that question.

770
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,480
I mentioned it earlier.

771
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:52,480
While we were doing the efforts to clone these genes, I was studying patients in the clinical research center with Jules Hirsch, Mike Rosenbaum, long standing associates.

772
01:18:52,480 --> 01:19:15,480
And what we were doing is looking at the metabolic consequences of weight reduction and showing that if you reduce the body weight of a human by 10 percent, 20 percent, you get a reduction in energy expenditure, which is greater than what you would predict from the loss of just body size or that they're in other words, their metabolic rate didn't reduce just to support the new reduced weight.

773
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,480
It reduced even further, which would almost try to return them to a heavier weight.

774
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,480
Right.

775
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:25,480
So they had a disproportionate reduction in energy expenditure.

776
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:44,480
And some of the data suggested that the major change in energy expenditure was not in resting metabolic rate, but in the energy cost of low levels of physical activity of muscle work, so to speak, but at very low levels of activity.

777
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:57,480
And we went on to show that, as you would expect, based on a lot of what we've been talking about, the leptin levels were low in these individuals, low but proportional to the reduced amount of body fat.

778
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:12,480
So one hypothesis that we had is that this reduction in energy expenditure was in fact a reflection of the fact that the body was sensing the reduction in low and leptin and interpreting that as a starvation state.

779
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:21,480
That is for that individual, that new lower body weight represented a threat, if you will, to survival or reproduction.

780
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:30,480
And we've done experiments subsequently in which we've injected leptin into those individuals. None of them has a genetic lesion of the leptin genes.

781
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,480
Right. So they're just weight reduced.

782
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,480
They're just weight reduced normal individuals.

783
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:41,480
We've put leptin back into them by injection to raise the blood level back to where it was before they lost their body weight.

784
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,480
So these are very low doses of leptin.

785
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:57,480
And that intervention will restore their energy expenditure back to where it was before they lost the body weight, even though they're now still maintaining the lower body weight.

786
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,480
So put this in some quantitative terms for me.

787
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:10,480
That infusion of leptin gave them how many more K cal per day in energy expenditure, all things equal between movement activity, etc.

788
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,480
You're talking about 100 K cal a day? Like what kind of a delta are you producing?

789
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Two or three hundred, because these are big people to start with.

790
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,480
And that's a huge delta.

791
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:25,480
Right. And we could show that that effect is primarily being conveyed through skeletal muscle.

792
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:34,480
So what happens is that the muscle becomes less efficient, if you want to think about it that way, after the leptin administration.

793
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:42,480
So there are two ways that we broadly in the research setting measure energy expenditure, indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water.

794
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,480
Can you spend a second explaining each of those?

795
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:59,480
So indirect calorimetry is really classical physics, if you will, in which the rate of oxygen consumption and the rate of carbon dioxide are measured in a number of ways.

796
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:15,480
The most frequent is to put a mask or hood over the head of the individual in whom the measurement is made and simply use gas sensors and flow meters to quantify the amount of oxygen consumed and CO2 released.

797
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:30,480
And from that information, one can quite easily calculate how many K cals of energy are being expended to correlate, if you will, to account for the amount of oxygen consumed in the CO2 produced.

798
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:42,480
And by looking at the ratio of those two, one can even get a indication of the kind of fuel that's being burned to support the metabolic rate.

799
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:56,480
So the V and I'll just spit it out so folks can if they're there, we'll link to all of this stuff. But the the RQ or the respiratory quotient is the ratio of CO2 produced or VCO2 divided by the amount of oxygen consumed or the VO2.

800
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:01,480
And and that'll vary sort of between, you know, typically about point seven and one, right?

801
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:01,480


802
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,480
You can see it outside of those ranges.

803
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:10,480
The lower it is, the more they're partitioning and drawing from fat. The higher it is, the more they're drawing from glycogen.

804
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,480
Correct.

805
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:21,480
And if I still remember my weir coefficients, energy expenditure is something to the effect of 3.94 times the VO2 plus 1.11 times the VCO2.

806
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,480
Well, your memory is better than mine, but I can't recite you the weir equation off the top of my head.

807
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:32,480
You know, it's really funny. About five years ago, I asked Kevin Hall to send me the derivation of it.

808
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:42,480
And it was so great to get this page, two pages of differential equations so I could go through and actually see how the weir coefficients were described,

809
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:52,480
which, of course, then led to the inevitable question that you and I have talked about in the past, which is, do those coefficients hold in the presence of radical dietary change,

810
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:57,480
such as, you know, a very, very low fat, high carbohydrate diet or the opposite.

811
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:04,480
So then if that's how indirect calorimetry works, and of course, by the way, these things happen in metabolic chambers, that's the ultimate way to do it, right?

812
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:09,480
Where you can put a person into a room and the room itself has all of these sensors embedded in it.

813
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:17,480
Right. And that is exactly the same principle, but they're the individuals not restricted in terms of their motion other than in the room that they're in.

814
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:23,480
So you can get exactly the same information, but over a much longer period of time, I mean, you can do it for days.

815
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:34,480
There was a point when I wanted to build one of these at my home. I was so obsessed with knowing every I wanted to know like my VO two and VCO two almost every minute of the day.

816
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,480
And then I found out it would cost at least five million to build one and realized I couldn't build one.

817
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:43,480
But I thought, boy, if I ever make enough money to build one of those, that that's a great fun.

818
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:52,480
That's like that's fun for the whole family. If you really stop to think about it, you know, I mean, who wouldn't want to go sit in the metabolic chamber on the weekend, just kicking it, watching football.

819
01:24:53,480 --> 01:25:09,480
We just built one of these actually at Columbia. And it's quite a you're right. It's it's not only expensive, but requires a great deal of attention to things like leaks and airflow and you know, I broke one once doing what.

820
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:21,480
So you'll recall, I used to spend time in these chambers. And I guess I exceeded the level of CO two production that it was sort of calibrated for because I was on my bicycle and I was riding pretty vigorously.

821
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:32,480
And the CO two sensor broke. And it's one of those things where you don't get a big red flag. It was just after the fact that data didn't make sense. And this is where you appreciate what you're saying, which is the engineering in this thing is amazing.

822
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:40,480
And so you got to pour through, you know, the longest spreadsheets in the world to start to look for where the mistakes are. But it's it's really beautiful stuff.

823
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:52,480
And there's not many of these in the country. Like there's obviously Columbia has some NIH has some TRI has some Pennington has some Baylor has some not many.

824
01:25:52,480 --> 01:26:04,480
Like you said, the tricky to construct and require high level of attention to their maintenance and operation. It's not just like going down in your basement and measuring your RQ.

825
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:10,480
So how does doubly labeled water work, which I also have had the privilege of ingesting.

826
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:28,480
So doubly labeled water is a technique which uses two isotopes of water, which is H two O. In one, the oxygen is a heavier version of the normal or the more more prevalent oxygen molecule.

827
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:43,480
And the other, the hydrogen is a heavy atom as opposed to the more prevalent kind of hydrogen in the in the environment. And what you do is you can give these as a mixture.

828
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:52,480
You have to know exactly how much of each one you've given, but you can give this as a drink basically of what amounts to heavy isotope labeled water.

829
01:26:53,480 --> 01:27:19,480
And then look at the relative concentration of these two isotopes. You can do it in blood. You can do it in urine. You go. We often do it in both and the difference in the rate of excretion of the so-called oh, 18 water, the heavy isotope of water, which is oxygen is borne out both in urine, but also in the expired.

830
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:34,480
Air of an individual as carbon dioxide and the H two O, which comes out by non respiratory means you can actually get a measure of how much CO two the individual is producing.

831
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:47,480
And you can use that and the nature of the diet that the individual is on to back calculate from what would be the RQ back to the.

832
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:58,480
So you would use the FQ basically. Correct. So the FQ is if you stuck the person's food into a bomb, calorimeter, burned it, that would produce the RQ.

833
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:09,480
So the limitation of this is a couple of things. One, the patient's got to be weight stable, right? This starts to fall flat when they're losing or gaining tremendous amounts of weight.

834
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:18,480
And two, you have to have a pretty darn good idea what they're eating. So each of these methods, ingenious and completely distinct, both have huge limitations.

835
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:27,480
The former, of course, requires an artificial environment. They don't get to be free living and you can't really study them for that long.

836
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:38,480
But the latter, where they can be free living and you can study them for two weeks at a time with a single ingestion of the doubly labeled water, you better make sure that they're not gaining and losing weight.

837
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:43,480
You better make sure you know exactly what they're eating. And in an ideal world, it better be the same thing almost every day, right?

838
01:28:43,480 --> 01:29:02,480
And in general, because of the issues that you just mentioned, I think most investigators in this field prefer, at least in terms of its nominal accuracy, the room calorimeter over the doubly labeled water.

839
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:19,480
But the doubly labeled water does have the virtue, as you pointed out, of being applicable over much longer periods of time so that you can get integrated idea of how much energy an individual is expending over literally days or even weeks.

840
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:27,480
What's sometimes done is to redose the individual at some point in the experiment and simply continue it.

841
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:46,480
When I did this, I did several days in several chambers and then separately did the LW. I was kind of amazed at how closely they overlapped. Of course, it was hard to replicate my chamber activity in the real world because there's so much more movement outside of the chamber.

842
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:55,480
But they were surprisingly in line, which is interesting because at the time I was on a ketogenic diet, which there's a lot of things that could be changing there.

843
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:10,480
So I want to go back to something that we kind of got into a little bit, but to me it's one of the most fascinating discussions slash debates, which is the idea of appetite being regulated centrally versus peripherally.

844
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:27,480
And you and I have had some incredible dinners having these discussions. And I've always found your perspectives to be interesting because I think few people are more qualified to talk about that in that they know so much about both.

845
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:37,480
I mean, in many ways, leptin at its inception was really viewed as a peripheral way to regulate appetite. So let me explain what I mean by that for the listener.

846
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:53,480
When you're hungry, is this all being driven by what your brain is saying? Is it possible that somewhere outside of the brain, which we refer to as the periphery, your liver, your fat cells, your muscles, the level of blood glucose that's circulating, is there some other signal?

847
01:30:53,480 --> 01:31:13,480
It's kind of interesting that here we are in the year 2018 and it's still not entirely clear where appetite is regulated. So how has your thinking on this topic evolved through your own immense knowledge of both the central and peripheral components of appetite?

848
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:23,480
You want to take a sip of that Topo Chico before you try to answer that? For the listener, I've introduced Rudy to Topo Chico today. So he's one sip into it. He declared it the finest bottled water.

849
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:37,480
I would describe the system from high altitude as the following, that there are CNS, central nervous system mechanisms. They're not all in the hypothalamus, but many of them are.

850
01:31:37,480 --> 01:32:02,480
And many of those that aren't do interact with the hypothalamus and that organ or set of cells can be regarded as the integrating center for basically the reception of signals that are of relevance to how an organism ought to respond to its environment in terms of food intake.

851
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:23,480
And also for control of some of the aspects of energy expenditure that are not necessarily under voluntary control, such as autonomic nervous system. And what's coming into that system is, I think, broader than we had originally anticipated.

852
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:39,480
So clearly leptin is an example of a hormone that's secreted from adipose tissue, but there are many other peptides actually or hormones that come out of adipose tissue. There are neural signals that are now being identified.

853
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:51,480
That is nerve-borne signals that look like they're coming out of and going into adipose tissue that may be playing a much more important role than we had sort of previously appreciated.

854
01:32:51,480 --> 01:33:14,480
The gastrointestinal tract, which for obvious reasons is a very relevant aspect of the system originally was, I think, regarded pretty much the way that adipose tissue was. It's a tube that absorbed your calories and didn't really participate actively in the regulation of that aspect of biology.

855
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:32,480
Clearly the advent of various surgeries for control of body weight have indicated that that sort of premise is incorrect. That is, that there are very powerful influences of the gastrointestinal tract, which are brought out by some of the surgeries that are done.

856
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:53,480
And it's now very clear that the gastrointestinal tract at many levels is communicating with the brain both by products that it secretes and by direct neural input, probably primarily, but not entirely by the vagus nerve into the brain stem and then further up into the brain.

857
01:33:53,480 --> 01:34:13,480
So just taking that as a sort of very broad picture, it's much clearer now that there is no sort of single definitive part of the biology of an individual which is dictating this very complex system.

858
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:32,480
And it's really a product of the interaction of these peripheral signals, as you referred to them, including metabolites such as glucose and free fatty acids and so forth. And the central nervous system, not just the hypothalamus, but areas like the brain stem, the amygdala, the frontal cortex.

859
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:47,480
There's many other areas of the brain that interact with these signals to influence both the behaviors and the unconscious, if you will, the vegetative responses that ultimately go into the regulation of body weight.

860
01:34:47,480 --> 01:35:03,480
So I think it's obviously a very complex and over-determined system. And it's that way because it is absolutely critical to survival. So it's not surprising in a way that it's as complex as it is.

861
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:29,480
But I think what it clearly does is it introduces all sorts of possibilities for mischief with regard to body weight regulation, starting in the frontal cortex where decisions are made, at least with regard to some aspects of this, all the way down into the colon where you've got large numbers of bacteria that are producing things, metabolites and molecules themselves.

862
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:45,480
That again, we're only just beginning to understand. So we're not only talking about a regulatory system that has all of these elements, but a bunch of organisms literally living within us that are influencing it in ways that I don't think we've really fully understood.

863
01:35:45,480 --> 01:36:14,480
The miracle is actually when you think about all the ways that it could go wrong, that it doesn't go wrong any more than it actually does. And it looks to me like the major problem in terms of the obesity that you referred to earlier that's increasing has to do a great deal with the environment and what people are being exposed to that's very novel with regard to the system.

864
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:32,480
I mean, this system was not designed for the regulation of metabolism and body weight in an environment in which with a cell phone, you can bring literally as many calories as you want into your living room without getting up off your behind.

865
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:49,480
So we're dealing with an organism which has its very complex and beautiful system designed to regulate various aspects of the biology, which is now in an environment which is entirely, at least in many regards, novel to the system.

866
01:36:49,480 --> 01:37:12,480
And it fails in the sense that there's a lot more obesity than there was prior to the environment that we've been able to create. But it's not totally dysregulated. I think people are just now regulating their body weight at somewhat higher levels than they were in other circumstances.

867
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:24,480
Again, I don't follow the statistics. It's not something I'm paying huge attention to. But are the rates of obesity plateauing or are they still increasing? Or is the curve concave up or concave down?

868
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:45,480
So several years ago, it looked like the rates were either slowing down or level. Now it looks like maybe they're continuing to inch up, but not as rapidly as they were, say, a decade ago. So there's been some relenting of the rate of increase in obesity in both adults and children.

869
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:50,480
But it looks like it's still rising, although at a lower rate.

870
01:37:50,480 --> 01:38:12,480
You have concern that there are epigenetic implications of this, that 10,000 years ago, the prevalence of obesity, again, largely probably driven by the environment that made it pretty hard to become obese, not just in terms of food availability in terms of absolute calories, but presumably the types of calories that were available.

871
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:17,480
I mean, I think my recollection is that 10,000 years ago, nothing came in a package, right?

872
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,480
As far as we know.

873
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:31,480
So we didn't have Pop-Tarts. We didn't have breakfast cereal. We didn't have orange juice. We didn't have french fries and whatever else are the culprit potentials.

874
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:48,480
So if Johnny got a set of genes that were slightly suboptimal, Johnny Jr. probably got some of those suboptimal genes, but there was nothing being imprinted on the genome that was being transmitted to generations.

875
01:38:48,480 --> 01:39:10,480
And I mean, what do you think about this idea that we could be reaching kind of a dangerous point in the evolution of our species where children, maybe during critical windows of development, if exposed to, you know, again, in my opinion, it's probably a lot of this sort of really highly refined crap, high amounts of fructose that we're seeing with the naphyl D,

876
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:21,480
that this is setting them up for a real problem later in life. It's going to make it a lot harder, not just for them to lose weight one day, but also for their offspring. Is there any evidence of that?

877
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:35,480
I think there is evidence that's, I'm not so sure I would use the term imprinting. That has sort of specific biological meaning and implications. I mean, we could talk about that in a minute.

878
01:39:35,480 --> 01:40:04,480
But if what you're saying is, are there perhaps critical periods of development in a child in which if the child is caused to become more obese than he or she might be in some other environment, that that will leave a mark on the regulatory system that will then cause that individual to want to sustain or maintain a higher body weight.

879
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:33,480
I think the answer is probably, or at least possibly yes. That is that there may be critical periods in human development. Certainly, I think the data are also available to some extent in animal studies that suggest that if you manipulate body weight or some of these systems at critical periods of development, you end up with an animal which is more likely to be obese.

880
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:49,480
And if you hadn't done that, and exactly what the molecular and neuro anatomical or other physiological consequences of that manipulation are that lead to the maintenance of a higher body weight.

881
01:40:49,480 --> 01:41:11,480
This is obviously a critical area of study. It's actually something that people in my lab are quite interested in. That is whether we can impose by dietary or other manipulations a higher body weight or a higher sustained body weight in an animal by early manipulations either by diet or endocrine manipulations.

882
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:31,480
And I think the answer is probably yes. But what is the consequence of that in terms of the regulatory elements that we were talking about? We don't yet know. Another aspect or another perspective on this is the following question.

883
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:47,480
If you manipulate the metabolism of a pregnant animal or human, what are the consequences of that on the developing brain or physiology of the fetus?

884
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:57,480
I mean, there's evidence now that a mother who is hyperinsulinemic or has gestational diabetes is increasing the child's risk of obesity. Is that not the case?

885
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,480
There are data that suggest that-

886
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,480
It's registry data, so it's hard to know.

887
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:15,480
Right. But that obesity in a pregnant woman does confer by, again, by mechanisms that we don't understand higher risk of obesity in her offspring.

888
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:28,480
Although I'd love to see it stratified by hyperinsulinemic versus non-hyperinsulinemic obesity, because I feel like I remember reading that it also seems to be dependent on the gestational stage.

889
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:38,480
In other words, like when the dorsal and ventral buds of the pancreas are forming, which I can't even remember when that is, maybe week seven, eight, nine, something like that, those are very critical windows, right?

890
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:50,480
That's when islet cell formation is taking place and nutrient exposure or insulin exposure during that period of time could have a more profound effect than, say, late in the third trimester where perhaps it's not as effective.

891
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:56,480
Again, I don't follow this literature, so I don't want to sound like a complete moron.

892
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:07,480
And the last time I really paid attention to this stuff was probably four years ago, and it was, again, largely registry-based data, so very difficult to know cause versus effect.

893
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:18,480
Again, the literature, as you sort of implied, is wobbly on this point, but I'll just tell you about a couple of experiments, actually, that we've done.

894
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:36,480
One, to answer, to address this question of hyperinsulinemia in a dam in a pregnant animal and its effects on the fetus, we were able to do an experiment in which we were interested in separating the issue of high body weight

895
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,480
and adiposity from the effect of insulin itself.

896
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:48,480
And so we actually used a genetic model of hyperinsulinemia, and we're able to make the dams hyperinsulinemic without being obese.

897
01:43:48,480 --> 01:44:02,480
So these are perfectly normal body weight dams that were very hyperinsulinemic, and the pups that they were carrying, some of those pups had no abnormality of any insulin-related genes.

898
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:08,480
So they were what we would call wild-type pups being incubated in a hyperinsulinemic dam.

899
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:14,480
And we were very interested to see what the consequences would be on the metabolism and body weight of these animals.

900
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:35,480
And very interestingly, these animals showed transient elevations of body weight and body fat when they were in what I guess we would describe as adolescent period of a mouse, which tended to revert back to normal over time.

901
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:43,480
You could definitely see an effect in the body weight and metabolism of the mouse, but it appeared to be transient.

902
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,480
And to be clear, the mother was euglycemic.

903
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,480
The mother was euglycemic and hyperinsulinemic.

904
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,480
That's a tough needle to thread, my friend.

905
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,480
So again, it's the power of genetics, so we could do that.

906
01:44:53,480 --> 01:45:04,480
So these kind of experiments, we also looked at the brains of these animals, and there were some very subtle differences in the way the hypothalamic cells, the numbers of different types of hypothalamic cells,

907
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:28,480
which suggested in sort of support of the inference of your implication of your question, there are consequences of these metabolic states of the dam that can influence the subsequent development of the pup, even if the pup doesn't have the genetic etiology that led to the derangement, if you want to call it that, in the dam.

908
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:57,480
We've more recently been doing some experiments along these lines looking at leptin in a similar way, and again, can see evidence of influence, long-term influence of manipulations of leptin in this way, which again suggests that these transient periods of exposure at various levels or various periods of development can have long-term consequences for organisms that don't themselves have any primary abnormalities.

909
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:12,480
So I think this probably supports the notion that there are things going on in the environment that are not reversible once the environment is necessarily reversed.

910
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:25,480
That is, the exposure to the environment may change the biology in such a way that even when the insult, if you want to call it that, is removed, the biology is permanently impacted.

911
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:44,480
We've spent a long time talking about low carbohydrate diets. You were part of one of the studies that was funded by NUSI, and while the study that you were a major part of was not a diet study, so it wasn't really looking at diets, it used diets as a tool to ask questions.

912
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:53,480
Clinically, we know that low carbohydrate diets are very effective. I think it would be very difficult for people to dispute that at this point in time.

913
01:46:54,480 --> 01:47:03,480
The interesting question, if you're Rudy Leibel, is why? What do you think? Why do these diets seem so effective for so many people?

914
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:14,480
Let's not even get into the fancy stuff about the diabetes reversal and stuff like that, where I think the results are especially pronounced, but just in terms of obesity reduction. Why do you think these things work?

915
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:38,480
I guess my view of this is that to the extent that diet composition has an effect on body weight, which clearly it can, that this is the result of the interaction of the components of the diet with aspects of the regulatory control of food intake.

916
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:59,480
The way I describe this is the hedonic aspects of the food that's being ingested will influence the drive to ingest that particular food. I think individuals differ in terms of their sensitivity or susceptibility to diets of different composition.

917
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:14,480
There clearly are some individuals who, when fed or offered or imposed diets that have pretty radical compositional differences, will respond very well.

918
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:20,480
In other words, there are people who respond well to high carb diets. There are people who respond well to low carb diets.

919
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:33,480
I think that it's primarily some aspect of the hedonics of these diets, if you want to call it that, that's driving the favorable response.

920
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:49,480
I know, and I'm sure you and I have discussed this many, many times, there are individuals who view the diet composition as having, in addition to what effects I just described, also an impact on energy homeostasis itself,

921
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:59,480
meaning that the composition of the diet can influence the degree of caloric expenditure per unit of calories ingested.

922
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:11,480
I'm not a sort of strong proponent of that view. I guess I try to remain agnostic about it, but my bias, if you want to call it that from my experience, is that that's right.

923
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:30,480
Diet composition can have an effect on body weight. It doesn't do so by effects primarily or maybe at all on energy expenditure per se, but can have pretty striking effects on an individual's desire to eat those calories delivered in that form.

924
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:43,480
There's two ways to think about that. If you leave the energy expenditure side away, on the intake side, is it the case that a low carbohydrate diet, as you say, is purely a hedonic issue?

925
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:49,480
People, when they're on these diets, they're just not as hungry because the food is not as diverse or not as palatable.

926
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:53,480
An alternative viewpoint is they eat a lot less because they're eating themselves more.

927
01:49:54,480 --> 01:50:02,480
In other words, the way I try to explain this to my patients when we're talking about nutrition is you want to differentiate between exogenous and endogenous calories.

928
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:08,480
So most people walk around, if they're weight stable, purely subsiding on exogenous calories.

929
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:15,480
But if you want to lose weight, by definition, you must start to consume endogenous calories. You have to start eating yourself.

930
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:30,480
And this gets back to the question of the regulation of body weight peripherally. If you are eating yourself, can the CNS figure that out and say, hey, we've got all this lipolysis going on.

931
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:40,480
We're liberating all of this fat out of a fat cell. That's energy. Fantastic. I will program the system. You need less exogenously.

932
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:47,480
So those are two kind of very different ideas, right? The one is just, hey, this food is boring and doesn't taste great. I'm just going to eat less of it.

933
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:55,480
Personally, I don't find that theory is appealing because having worked with so many patients that do this, if that were the case, I'd suspect they'd be more hungry.

934
01:50:55,480 --> 01:51:05,480
But yet they don't seem to be very hungry, which is, I think for most people, the only thing that's intolerable over long periods of time is hunger.

935
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:15,480
You look back at the Ansel Keyes starvation experiments and those guys weren't really like what they were eating, maybe 1,600 calories a day, but they were losing their minds.

936
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:24,480
I mean, these guys lost their minds on 1,600 calories per day. So starvation is clearly an unacceptable state in the long run.

937
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:32,480
I got to be honest with you, I'm glad I don't work on this problem. I'm much more interested in just trying to figure out this other easy problem of longevity.

938
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:42,480
But this obesity thing is a real bear because at the same time, as much success as I've seen for people on low carbohydrate diets, I also know that they don't work for everybody.

939
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:56,480
And therein lies the challenge of why? Why would something, I mean, again, it's a naive question in the sense that you've just spent the last two hours explaining some of the most complex biology of obesity.

940
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:16,480
Why should everyone respond to the same treatment? But it does. It really frustrates me that there are certain patients in which no matter what one does or no matter what they do, I think patients that try really, really hard and can't lose weight, I find that to be a very frustrating clinical problem.

941
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:32,480
So I guess maybe I should rephrase the way I answered your question. And that is to say that I believe that the composition of the diet can influence aspects of ingestive behavior.

942
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:46,480
I emphasize the hedonic aspect, but I'm certainly open to the possibility that if you feed a diet of divergent composition, you will definitely have some influence.

943
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:59,480
I mean, this is well documented on the substrates that are in the circulation as a result of feeding that diet. Those substrates themselves, metabolites, you were mentioning fatty acid, but many other things change,

944
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:23,480
may themselves have an effect on the drive to eat. I'm sympathetic to that idea. And exactly in any given individual who does or doesn't respond to a specific diet, which of the mechanisms, you know, whether it's occurring at the level of the taste of the diet or some of the metabolic consequences of the diet,

945
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:37,480
I would say to the extent that somebody is successful in losing weight on that diet, A, they have to be a negative energy balance. That is, there's no way that they can eat the number of calories that they're expending and lose weight.

946
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:55,480
So they need to be in negative energy balance. And I mean, that's just a given. And then the mechanism by which the diet composition influences the success of their ability to sustain a hypocaloric state, which, as you pointed out, is uncomfortable.

947
01:53:55,480 --> 01:54:13,480
I'm open to the possibility that it could be at any level of the sort of neural circuitry that regulates food intake, it could be very proximal in terms of taste aspects, but it could also be some of the mechanisms that you mentioned.

948
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:35,480
I think that's perfectly reasonable. How that works, as you pointed out, is a tough nut to figure out. And I think, like you said, there are individuals who respond very well to diets of quite divergent composition, but they have to be taking less calories than they are spending.

949
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:47,480
Right. And that's an easy thing to do mathematically. It's a very hard thing to do clinically because, again, I think patients can tolerate a lot, but I don't think people can tolerate hunger for very long.

950
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:59,480
I think to ask somebody to be constantly hungry is a losing proposition. And that's why I believe clinically low carbohydrate diets seem to be more satiating.

951
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:08,480
And again, whether they're satiating because of something in their composition or whether they're just satiating because you end up eating more of yourself.

952
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:17,480
I mean, I've seen lots of patients who, and this has even been published, who on 16, 1700 calories a day of a ketogenic diet seem completely fine.

953
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:26,480
And yet Ansel Keyes' patients at 1400, 1500, 1600, 1600 calories of basically very high carbohydrate diet, very low fat diets, lost their minds.

954
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:31,480
What did you believe 10 years ago that you don't believe today to be true?

955
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:53,480
I think over the past decade, the field of the sort of neuroscience of body weight regulation or ingested behavior and energy expenditure has expanded the role of other elements in the central nervous system beyond what began as our very intense focus on the hypothalamus.

956
01:55:53,480 --> 01:56:02,480
Partly that's historical and for reasons having to do with the tractability of some of the cell types and mechanisms in the hypothalamus.

957
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:22,480
But I would say the biggest change in my thinking about this has been that these super hypothalamic aspects of the central nervous system, again, starting with the cortex and working down, have a much stronger, I think, ultimate impact on this regulatory system than the way I perceive it.

958
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:36,480
A decade ago. And what this does is it opens up, I think, a lot of very interesting aspects of the biology that maybe we weren't either capable of or didn't focus on adequately.

959
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:45,480
Part of which actually is in response to the point you were just raising. That is, what is the effect of diet composition on hunger and so forth?

960
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:57,480
It's almost certainly an aspect of this sort of view of the broader central nervous system impact on ingested behavior than just the hypothalamus.

961
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:07,480
You know, my mentor, Jules Hirsch, I think, who unfortunately passed away three years ago, he would agree with this.

962
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:18,480
I mean, he always, I think, was suspicious of focusing, you know, slavishly, if you will, on the hypothalamus as the center for all of this.

963
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:28,480
He always, I think, had a much broader perspective on some of the psychoaffective aspects, as he would describe them, of ingested behavior.

964
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:38,480
And I think he would see the sort of flowering of broader view of some of these regulatory aspects of food intake to other parts of the central nervous system.

965
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:48,480
He would say, I told you so. And he was right. I think he's looking down at you saying that. He's probably saying, well, other stuff too.

966
01:57:48,480 --> 01:58:00,480
If we get away with a magic wand and not only were resources unlimited, but more importantly, any of the technical considerations that make this type of study challenging were just ameliorated.

967
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:13,480
What's the dream experiment you would want to do if you got one more shot at this? You could spend the rest of your career doing a dream experiment with infinite resources, infinite subject participation.

968
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:22,480
Screw the ethics. There's no IRB. You've got a bunch of clones out of Westworld. You can do whatever the hell you want. What experiment do you want to do?

969
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:26,480
Once to take your final kick at this problem?

970
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:33,480
There is a gene that was identified now 10, 12 years ago.

971
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:34,480
FTO?

972
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,480
Yes.

973
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:36,480
You tested me for this?

974
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:37,480
Yes.

975
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:39,480
I was negative.

976
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:57,480
I was identified by Mark McCarthy and some other investigators in Great Britain as sending the strongest genetic signal for obesity or elevated body fat, not severe effect, but the strongest statistical signal ever detected in humans.

977
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:59,480
It remains the same.

978
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:21,480
The prevalence of the variants that are associated with higher body fat are very high in the general population. So there are a lot of these variants of this gene that are contributing to human obesity, not of the severity certainly of the OB or the monocortin-4 receptor.

979
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:36,480
There are various schools of thought about how this gene is doing it. The interesting thing is that the variation in the gene that is conferring the risk of obesity is variation in what we call non-coding part of the genome.

980
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:53,480
So as people will know, a small fraction of the genome, 2 or 3%, actually encodes the proteins that are made that we've been talking about actually. The rest of it is regulatory parts and elements that we don't understand very well.

981
01:59:53,480 --> 02:00:09,480
The variants that are implicated for the FTO gene actually occur in the non-coding region. We know exactly where they are. It's not a mystery where they are, but they are in non-coding. They're in the first intron, so to speak, of this gene.

982
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:25,480
The mechanism by which this very, very common variant leads to subtle increases in body fatness in a large number of individuals, to me this is a very intriguing question.

983
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:35,480
There are some that view the effect as being conveyed through what's called browning of adipose tissue, increasing the energy expenditure of adipose tissue.

984
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:49,480
There are others like myself who think it's affecting central nervous system circuits that affect food intake, but the mechanism, at least in terms of the central nervous system, is really unknown.

985
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:57,480
The primary phenotype that's seen in these individuals who do or don't have what we call the risk variants is food intake.

986
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:12,480
I mean, if you measure their food intake very carefully in a lab, you can see that the individuals with the variants will eat slightly more. They actually may have a slight preference for fattier, higher fat foods than individuals who don't.

987
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:32,480
But what exactly is going on in the central nervous system is not clear. They have actually, in one study, pretty characteristic functional magnetic resonance imaging differences among individuals who do or don't have this variant, but the mechanism is unknown.

988
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:40,480
And this is something which has intrigued me now for eight or ten years. That's the experiment I would love to do. I mean, we're actually trying to do it.

989
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:59,480
Tell me specifically what the actual experiment is. But before you do that, I want to make sure I'm, and this is going to be an oversimplified analogy, but what you're basically saying is there's a genetic marker, effectively, that creates or identifies those who are predisposed in a high nutrient environment to overeat.

990
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:10,480
So even though our ancestors would have had these genes, the reason, or never mind our ancestors, even though a hundred years ago or 50 years ago, this gene still existed, probably at the same prevalence.

991
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:21,480
You didn't have the food environment to pour fuel on that fire. Now, just to push back a little bit, isn't that sort of like saying, we've got all these people getting lung cancer.

992
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:31,480
It only started when they started smoking and, you know, only one in 10 of these smokers are getting lung cancer. There's a gene that might be predisposing them to lung cancer.

993
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:45,480
So you're basically saying, I want to look at the problem of why are certain people susceptible to an environmental trigger versus what's the environmental trigger. In the case of smoking, it was so obvious. It was the goddamn cigarettes.

994
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:50,480
In the case of obesity, it's a little more complicated. Correct. So what's the experiment you would do?

995
02:02:50,480 --> 02:03:05,480
So the experiment that I would do, and actually we're trying to do these now, is to actually look in animals in whom the variants of the genes that we think are affected by this.

996
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:13,480
Because even though the intronic region is not encoding anything, we think it's affecting genes that do encode something.

997
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:32,480
And we think we know at least what one of those genes is. And what I would like to see is what the consequences of these variants are on the functional activity of the system that we think is mediating the effects of these genes.

998
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:46,480
Because I, again, for reasons that are quite technical, I think that one of the major impacts of this gene or these variants in this gene is actually on the structure of the nervous system.

999
02:03:46,480 --> 02:04:07,480
So I think their impact is occurring early in the development of the brain. And that what it's doing is changing the circuitry slightly in a very maybe subtle way, probably subtle way, that favors the increased food intake that you just described.

1000
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:24,480
And the implication of this is very relevant to some of the things we were just talking about earlier. That is, can the environment impose permanent signatures on the feeding circuit, so to speak?

1001
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:51,480
And this is, I think, a prime candidate in that regard. And the virtue of the FTO study that we've been talking about is that we know at least enough about the genetics and some of the mechanisms that we can design the experiments, primarily but not totally in mice, to be able to look precisely at where the changes are occurring.

1002
02:04:51,480 --> 02:05:15,480
We now just coming online are the tools to look at the circuits as they are acting physiologically. We can activate these circuits in the brain of an animal by using various neurophysiological and neurogenetic techniques that will, I think, permit us to see where the structural consequences of these variants reside.

1003
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:27,480
And my guess is that that would give us an insight into the sort of prevalent genetic susceptibility or one of the prevalent genetic susceptibility.

1004
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:36,480
What would we do with that information? Let's assume you had all of that information. How does that take obesity from 35% to 5%?

1005
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:43,480
Well, you're asking somebody who is not an epidemiologist, and I, you know, some of us do what we know how to do.

1006
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,480
You're a hammer, you look for a nail.

1007
02:05:45,480 --> 02:06:02,480
So I'm a hammer looking for the nail of whether or not I can show a gene which alters the structure of the central nervous system in a developing organism in such a way as to make it susceptible to the environment.

1008
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:19,480
And the animals that we have studied where we've manipulated this gene definitely are sensitive to the environment in the sense that they will choose or eat more of a high-fat diet than a normal or, you know, a regular diet.

1009
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,480
How many such SNPs are there in humans?

1010
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:26,480
There are at least a half a dozen SNPs in the first intron.

1011
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,480
In the first intron alone.

1012
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:29,480
But that's where they are.

1013
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:30,480
That's where they all are.

1014
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:31,480
That's where they all are.

1015
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:40,480
What is the prevalence, to the best of our knowledge, of people today who have at least one of these SNPs in that first intron?

1016
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,480
60%.

1017
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:47,480
So 60% of the population would be at least somewhat susceptible to obesity.

1018
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,480
Yeah.

1019
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:57,480
Which is, you know, sort of fits with what we see because the effect size of this genetic variation is not on or off.

1020
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:05,480
It just widens, I think, or increases the susceptibility to whatever it is in the environment that's doing this.

1021
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:09,480
Are there pharmacologic things that could be done to combat this?

1022
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:10,480
Well, we don't know what it is.

1023
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,480
So we don't know.

1024
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:12,480
Because we don't know what the, we don't know the protein.

1025
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,480
It's so much more complicated because it's non-coding.

1026
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,480
Correct.

1027
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,480
But that's what fascinates me about it.

1028
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:24,480
And I think it's producing something in the central nervous system which is structural in consequence, at least in part.

1029
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,480
And that's why I'm fascinated by it.

1030
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:39,480
Because what this means is that if you have this predisposition, it may change the nature of your central nervous system structurally in such a way as to make you either more or less.

1031
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:53,480
So if you take just hypothetically an animal that's born with these introns, with this pattern of introns, and you could magically use CRISPR and you could delete them and edit them and make them a wild type again, do you fix the phenotype?

1032
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:59,480
Because if not, that would certainly point to something early on in neurologic development, right?

1033
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:00,480
Yes, you do.

1034
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,480
So we can do that kind of thing.

1035
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:03,480
You've done that experiment?

1036
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:04,480
Yeah.

1037
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:05,480
And we've also done experiment.

1038
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:07,480
And sorry, it did or did not fix the phenotype?

1039
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,480
It fixes it.

1040
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:13,480
Okay, so that means that it has an influence that transcends development, right?

1041
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:14,480
It's part of development.

1042
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:20,480
I mean, because the fix occurs at the level of the fertilization of the genetic...

1043
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:23,480
Oh, you never fixed it post.

1044
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:24,480
Not fixed it post.

1045
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:25,480
Okay, okay.

1046
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:28,480
So Rudy, you're never going to stop working, are you?

1047
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:32,480
Well, if I've got to figure this out, I'll have to stay at it for a little bit longer.

1048
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,480
There are a lot of other things I want to talk with you about.

1049
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,480
Maybe we'll just spend a couple minutes.

1050
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:43,480
There's something else I want to talk about, which is the most complicated topic ever, insulin resistance.

1051
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:46,480
What the hell does insulin resistance mean?

1052
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:50,480
How can an insulin resistant person be fat?

1053
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:57,480
When by definition, insulin needs to tell the adipocyte to take up the free fatty acid as triglyceride.

1054
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:03,480
So does insulin resistance mean insulin resistance of the muscle, insulin resistance of the liver,

1055
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,480
but insulin sensitivity of the adipocyte?

1056
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:07,480
What does that mean?

1057
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:15,480
The metabolic disposition of glucose, for example, is obviously, or maybe not so obviously,

1058
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:18,480
it's not primarily via adipose tissue.

1059
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:23,480
I mean, glucose, when it gets into this circulation and is removed or taken up, it's...

1060
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:24,480
Mostly in the muscle.

1061
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,480
Yes, it's mostly in the muscle.

1062
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:36,480
So to the extent that insulin resistance is functionally denominated by elevated blood glucose...

1063
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:39,480
It would seem to be the muscle as the primary defect.

1064
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,480
To be the muscle, which is the primary defect.

1065
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:51,480
Now, the mechanism of the insulin resistance of muscle, I mean, this is an area that's not one that I work in primarily,

1066
02:09:51,480 --> 02:10:01,480
but there appears to be that what's going on at the sort of distal end of the insulin resistance path

1067
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:06,480
is that the glucose transporters are not getting to the surface.

1068
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:14,480
They're not responding to insulin the way that they do in a non-insulin resistant person.

1069
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:22,480
And when the insulin transporters, the glucose transporters don't get to the muscle, get to the surface of the muscle cell,

1070
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:24,480
they can't transport glucose.

1071
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:30,480
So at a molecular level, depending on exactly whose model of this you look at,

1072
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:35,480
there's something wrong with the transmission of the signal from the insulin receptor...

1073
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:38,480
Into the cell, to send the glute transporter up.

1074
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:48,480
Right. And exactly what that defect is, again, depends on who you talk to or what mechanism is invoked.

1075
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:52,480
That appears to be, at least on one level, the sort of primary...

1076
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,480
So what's happening in the liver?

1077
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:59,480
You know, when we do an old glucose tolerance test, the reason we do it for such a short period of time, relatively speaking,

1078
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:07,480
aside from who wants to keep a patient in the lab forever, is you pretty much eliminate de novo glycogenesis or you eliminate DNL, right?

1079
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:13,480
So you're basically looking at uptake by muscle, but there's some being taken up by the liver.

1080
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:18,480
And I don't know that I understand fully, aside from capacity, right?

1081
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:22,480
The liver has a relatively small capacity for glycogen relative to the muscles.

1082
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:28,480
What else determines that partitioning of how much glucose in the bloodstream is going into the muscle versus the liver?

1083
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:38,480
And then ultimately, anything that exceeds those capacities will then undergo DNL and the de novo lipogenic pathway will produce addition free fatty acid.

1084
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,480
And again, what does it mean to be insulin resistant in the liver?

1085
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:48,480
So it's interesting. You know, the liver, if you want to look at it this way, there are sort of two major metabolic things going on.

1086
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:56,480
There are a lot of things going on in the liver, but as far as what we're talking about, one is the ability to make lipid, to synthesize lipid.

1087
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:02,480
And the other is the ability to make or take up glycogen, to release or take up glycogen.

1088
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:10,480
They are differentially sensitive to insulin suppression or enhancement, if you want to look at it that way.

1089
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:23,480
And what happens, I mean, just again, at a biochemical level is you can get insulin resistant in the liver to the suppression of gluconeogenesis

1090
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:27,480
while you maintain sensitivity to the effect of insulin on the liver.

1091
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:30,480
De novo lipogenesis pathway. That's the worst outcome.

1092
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:34,480
Yes, but that's what happens. I mean, that's the state.

1093
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:35,480
How is that regulated?

1094
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:43,480
In many individuals who have issues with regard to insulin homeostasis, if you want to describe it that way.

1095
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:51,480
Yeah. So for the listener, what we're basically saying is the doomsday scenario would be your muscles become resistant to the signaling of insulin,

1096
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:55,480
and they don't put these glute transporters up there and you don't bring glucose into your muscle.

1097
02:12:55,480 --> 02:13:05,480
Yeah, but why that happens actually, in other words, what is it about becoming obese that is actually doing something to skeletal muscle?

1098
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:07,480
What if it's the reverse?

1099
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:11,480
Well, it may be. I mean, again, this is an area of somewhat hot debate.

1100
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:33,480
But one possibility, I guess, is that there's something that happens to adipose tissue when you store whatever for that individual is an excess amount of lipid that's producing another molecule or some other mechanism by which muscle is affected with regard to its insulin sensitivity.

1101
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:48,480
The other possibility, which I think, again, many people think is at least partly relevant, is that when you increase the amount of lipid in your adipose tissue, you also increase the amount of lipid in your muscle.

1102
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:58,480
The fat that's in your muscle, actually the marbling of your own muscle, and that that itself has an effect on glucose homeostasis.

1103
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:00,480
So there's a whole...

1104
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:06,480
What does Gerald Schumann think of this? Doesn't he have an idea that it starts in the liver? Isn't that his view?

1105
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:17,480
So Gerald Schumann has done a lot of work on the mechanism by which insulin affects glucose transport in muscle.

1106
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:21,480
I don't want to speak for him, I mean, in terms of what he thinks about this.

1107
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:35,480
But he certainly is one of the people who I think has advanced the field in terms of understanding why, for example, ambient fatty acids seems to suppress glucose uptake in muscle.

1108
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:38,480
This was originally described by Randall.

1109
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,480
And just to be clear, that's not Randall the patient.

1110
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:42,480
That's correct. Not that Randall.

1111
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,480
You didn't know shit about.

1112
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,480
Not spelled differently also.

1113
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:58,480
So I think what Gerald Schumann has done is to advance our understanding of a very, I think, compelling mechanism by which high levels of ambient fatty acid themselves might suppress insulin signaling.

1114
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:08,480
Some of that fatty acid could in fact come from lipid that's stored in the muscle as opposed to lipid or fatty acids that are in the circulation.

1115
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,480
So these two different phenotypes, right?

1116
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:15,480
You know, when you look at Cahill's 40-day fasted subjects, their free fatty acids were through the roof.

1117
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:20,480
Their insulin was very low. Their glucose was very low. Their ketones were very high.

1118
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:24,480
It's interesting to know, would you call them insulin sensitive or insulin resistant, right?

1119
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:30,480
Because probably if you challenge them with glucose immediately, they would have hyperglycemia.

1120
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:35,480
Physiologically, their muscles probably would in the short moment say, hey, I don't want this stuff.

1121
02:15:35,480 --> 02:15:37,480
Save every gram of that for the brain.

1122
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:43,480
But presumably if you refed them carbs for three days, they'd probably be as insulin sensitive as they'd ever been.

1123
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:47,480
Right. So I mean, this is one of the reasons why I think you're right.

1124
02:15:47,480 --> 02:16:03,480
But I think maybe what Schumann or Randall would say is that the reason for the lack of response to the transport of glucose is that the system has now been down set by virtue of the high ambient free fatty acids.

1125
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:05,480
And it may take some time to…

1126
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:08,480
Interesting. So you're thinking that could be the short-term signal.

1127
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:13,480
Correct. And that takes time. That's why, again, I don't do this for a living. I mean, you would know this.

1128
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:21,480
But why people are encouraged not to restrict their carbohydrates prior to having a glucose tolerance test, for example.

1129
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:22,480
Right.

1130
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:26,480
Because you can manipulate the system in the way that you just mentioned.

1131
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:32,480
Rudy, I could sit here and talk about this stuff all night long, but your wife will probably be pissed off that I kept you here all night.

1132
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:35,480
So maybe not. Maybe she's actually enjoying the fact that you're here.

1133
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:42,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This has been super interesting. You're really one of the most thoughtful people I've ever spoken to on this topic.

1134
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:49,480
And I think there are a lot of areas where we don't necessarily see eye to eye clinically, which, again, that sounds like a much more harsh statement than it is.

1135
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:52,480
I just think we look at the world a little differently on some level.

1136
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,480
Yeah, I'm a hammer.

1137
02:16:53,480 --> 02:17:00,480
You're a hammer looking for a nail. And I'm kind of a general contractor looking for everything in sight. I mean, I think it's interesting.

1138
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:09,480
I think your FTO example is a great example. I mean, if I were tackling this problem and I'm glad I'm not, I'd be wanting to understand the environmental trigger.

1139
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:18,480
Is it the cigarette that's causing lung cancer? You're trying to solve a different problem, which is why is it that only some people get lung cancer when they smoke?

1140
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:23,480
And those people, before the adage of the invention of cigarettes would have never got lung cancer.

1141
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:28,480
But now that these cigarettes are here, probably can't do much about it. Let's figure out who they are.

1142
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:34,480
And not just for that reason. I mean, just as an intellectual question, I find it very intriguing.

1143
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:43,480
But knowledge of whatever would lead a person who smokes not to get lung cancer, it would be very nice to know what that is.

1144
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:44,480
Yeah.

1145
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:50,480
That whatever that biology is for many, many reasons, not just related necessarily to lung cancer.

1146
02:17:50,480 --> 02:18:03,480
And I see the issue of the consequences of a genetic variant very prevalent in the population, which predisposes some individuals to the environmental consequences and others not.

1147
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:19,480
If we knew what that mechanism is, there's no reason to believe that at some point we might not be able to manipulate it, not only in service of those who have the genetic variant, but others who might benefit from knowledge of the circuitry.

1148
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:40,480
Yeah. I mean, that makes a lot of sense. And you've given me some great pearls over the years. I remember you, I think it was one night at dinner when you, me, Mike Rosenbaum were playing patty cakes and it somehow came up that in your 10 to 20% weight reduced subjects, a little bit of T3 could overcome some of the deficit.

1149
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:53,480
And I remember having this Eureka moment because I was like, wait a minute, all these patients I see that lose weight have a reverse T3 spike that would exactly explain why giving them T3 rather than T4 would address the problem.

1150
02:18:53,480 --> 02:19:00,480
You give a patient with high reverse T3, T4, you're just, you're making them worse, but you give them T3, you can bypass it.

1151
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:06,480
So I'm incredibly grateful to you, to your work and for your friendship. So thank you very much.

1152
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:07,480
My pleasure. Thank you.
