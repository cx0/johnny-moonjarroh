00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,640
Hey, Nier, it's great to have you back. I was thinking about this when I was sort of

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,480
preparing for the podcast today. There's so much I want to cover today that I don't think

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,140
it's actually going to be possible. I'm pretty sure that we're going to talk as much as we

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,960
talk today and I'm going to be saying to the team, all right, let's talk about when we're

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,440
going to have Nier back because there's really just too many things I want to go through.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,720
So anyway, thank you for making time and let's just get right into it.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,540
So thanks, Peter. I'm happy to come back, but it's you who's coming to me every week

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,900
and I'm so grateful for what you're doing for this field and for helping all of us catching

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,960
this field of longevity that's going to come true very rapidly, I hope.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,840
I was thinking about the first place I wanted to start and there's really no good one place

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
to start because there's just so much I want to talk about.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,380
But let's start with centenarians. You know, you along with Dr.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,960
Pearls are probably two of the people who have spent the most time studying this very,

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,240
very unique subset of the population.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,240
So I think everybody knows what a centenarian is, someone who lives to be 100 or more.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,680
But there's so much nuance about what it is about these special people.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,600
And then, you know, there's sort of the pop culture view of this, which is people love to talk about

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,160
all of the bad behaviors that centenarians engage in, how much more they smoke,

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,760
how much less they exercise, all how much whiskey they drink and all of those things,

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,800
which are really cute. But when you study them scientifically and when you study their offspring

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,240
scientifically, as you've both done, we learn a lot of things.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,240
And if my interpretation of the literature is at least partially correct,

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,320
it appears that genes play a significant role.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,320
So genes don't seem to play a big role in people living to 70 versus 80.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,640
But boy, when you start to talk about living to 90 versus 100, you know, relative to 70 or 80,

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,400
genes play a pretty big role. So tell me a little bit about what we understand

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,640
about the role that the parents play in determining the lifespan of offsprings, right?

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,840
How fortunate were these people to pick their parents?

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Let me just tackle one of the things you said, that there's no much genetic impact

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:39,480
in people between 70 and 80. And it's true if you compare the lifespan of fathers and sons, okay,

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,080
or mothers and daughters or sons. And let me tell you why it's problematic.

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,040
My grandfather got a heart attack when he was 68 and he died. That's my grandfather.

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,080
My father got a heart attack at 68 and he had triple bypass and he died at 84.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,240
So the correlation between age of death in different cohorts is not much revealing.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,120
But let me say it now differently. Let's say it's 20%, okay? Let's say it's 20%.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,240
If we understand this 20%, understand it really, we can use that in order to prevent

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,640
the 80% of the environment. Well, maybe another way to think about it near, because that example

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,800
is a great example, which makes it very difficult over discrete generations to make a comparison.

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,560
Do we have twin data? Because it seems to me that if you had monozygotic twin data,

41
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,120
that would be the gold standard for looking at the discordance and concordance between the role

42
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,520
of genes in separate environments, right? So let me tell you the problems with twins.

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:02,920
Twins are usually born small for their gestational age. In fact, it's more true that one of the

44
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,680
twins is small for their gestational age. Now, I've been doing studies with rats from before

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:19,480
when you ligate the uterine artery and make them small, they get diabetes, which they never get

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:27,560
at three months. We know that twins or that babies that are born small for age develop

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,640
age-related disease very rapidly. It's called the Barker hypothesis, right? It's observation

48
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:42,200
from Holland in World War II. So, and we actually determine some of the epigenetic manifestation

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:50,760
of what happens epigenetically when you do that. So I don't think twins are the right model unless

50
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,640
you understand that and account for that. Nier, this is super interesting. Can you tell me a little

51
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,040
bit more about that? I actually was not aware of the relationship between low birth weight and the

52
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,680
epigenetic imprint of that on reduced lifespan. And I assume healthspan or is it just lifespan?

53
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:18,520
It's mainly healthspan in humans that we know. You know, first thing that's obvious when you have

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:30,760
a small gestational age twin, there's the catch-up growth of the small baby. And those twins born in

55
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:39,240
the same day in few years, one of them is an obese child and one is a normal child. And as you know,

56
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:49,640
obesity drives aging very rapidly. So that's one mechanism. The changes in imprinting of epigenetic,

57
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:57,960
I would say for now that it's more of a description than a mechanism. There are many genes that are

58
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,280
involved and I'm not aware of a recent paper that says, you know, this is what happens.

59
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:12,920
So let's get back to the broader question, which is when an individual or when a cohort of individuals

60
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,240
lives to 100 and we compare them with a cohort of individuals that lives to 80,

61
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:29,880
what are the types of genes that seem to be offering protection to that group that lives to 100?

62
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:37,960
What is it that the centenarians have in a sort of polygenic sense that the rest of us schmucks don't have?

63
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,720
When we went to the centenarians, we had three hypotheses that we had to take care of. One is

64
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,720
that it's all the environment. Okay. It happens that they did exactly the right thing what the

65
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,680
doctors tell us to do now. The second, and it's not true, as you mentioned, it's not true. 60% of

66
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,760
the men are smoking and 30% of the women, 50% of them are overweight and obese and all that,

67
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:10,280
and not exercising and not vegetarians. The second hypothesis is that they have perfect genome.

68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,560
We know that we have a lot of genotypes that are putting us at risk for a variety of age-related

69
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:25,480
disease. So maybe one out of 10,000 doesn't have that, and that's why they're flying in so gracefully.

70
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:32,840
So to be clear, part of that hypothesis is the absence of bad genes, not necessarily the presence

71
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,320
of good genes. Exactly. That only the absence of bad genes will allow them just to get without

72
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,440
diseases. Yes. I'll describe a very simple study that we've done. I'm sorry, I took you off your

73
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,760
track, but what was the third hypothesis? The third hypothesis is that there are genes that

74
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:59,560
slows their aging. So good genes. So it's basically... So it's okay. Fair enough. So as for the second

75
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,720
hypothesis, that they have what we call the perfect genome, we took our first 44 centenarians and did

76
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,320
whole genome sequencing at the time. Huge expense. But we only had those centenarians. Okay. We don't

77
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:25,880
have had the control, but we had a great instrument we thought. It's called cleanvar. It's an

78
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:36,680
accumulation of all the genes that have shown to be causing diseases. If you had a cleanvar variant,

79
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:46,280
you're very likely to have a disease. So we simply asked, do our centenarians have any of those

80
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,200
variants? And how many of those variants are there? At the time, there were 15,000. Now there are many

81
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,000
more. So just to put that in perspective for the listener, that I mean, we have between 20 and 30,000

82
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,080
coding genes, correct? Right. But these are variants of how many genes? Well, I don't remember how many

83
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:15,880
genes are in the variants, but those are variants that were found to be compelling. And by the way,

84
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,880
a lot of them are not. That's another story. So let's keep it simple. We had 15,000 variants

85
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,320
and we asked, do our 44 centenarians have variants? And the answer was each centenarian

86
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,240
had between five and six bad variants. Five and six out of 15,000 possible. Right. And we didn't

87
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,520
have a control, so we don't know how many the average person had. Right. But think of it,

88
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:49,160
those centenarians, each one of had five variants that will probably cause a disease and none of

89
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,520
them had it. And if you're asking, are those variants important? Well, we have two centenarians

90
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:05,560
who have the ApoE4 homozygosity that puts them at major risk, one of the best genetic risks

91
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,200
for Alzheimer's. The textbook says they would be demented at 70 and dead at 80 and they're at 100

92
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,880
and not demented. Genes for Parkinson's, for cancers, for other diseases. So basically,

93
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:30,040
the centenarians don't have the perfect genome, which left us with finding genes that are

94
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,800
protective. Right. That slows their aging, are protectives even against genes that are thought,

95
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,080
at least, as I'm saying, it's probably not totally true, thought to most probably cause a disease.

96
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,320
And tell me near approximately what year did you arrive at that conclusion?

97
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,000
This paper is more than 10 years old. I think we had several papers since then

98
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,680
confirming this. And look, like always, there are some,

99
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:14,120
there is a decrease also in bad genotypes in centenarians, some decrease. But really,

100
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,880
the majority of the study shows that it's not that it's not the perfect genome. It's something else.

101
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,280
We've very easily eliminated hypothesis one, which is centenarians live to 100 because of what they

102
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,600
do, their behaviors, their environment. You now make a very compelling case that it's not number

103
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:44,040
two, either. It's not that they lack any disease driving genes. So it is, in fact, this third

104
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,880
hypothesis. When did you actually demonstrate that? That's that's obviously a much harder one

105
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,840
to demonstrate because you probably have a far smaller library of disease sparing variants as

106
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,800
opposed to disease causing variants. So when did you start to arrive on what some of those variants

107
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,240
were? The story was interesting because remember we started the study in 1998 and there were other

108
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,400
parts of the studies that I didn't talk with you about. But one of the things we had is we start to

109
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:23,960
establish the phenotype. And one of the phenotypes that came up is high level of HDL cholesterol.

110
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,280
Actually, very high level of HDL cholesterol that was more obvious in the offspring of our

111
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,920
centenarians, even than our centenarians. So we have offsprings that have HDL cholesterol 130,

112
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:46,200
140, you know, the folds higher than it should be. And what we could do when we were when the

113
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,040
methods were poor and we were poor, we were going about genes that are involved in those

114
00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:01,080
phenotypes. And we actually got a very compelling data on two genotypes that seems to be functional,

115
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,800
important, that are controlling lipid metabolism. One of them was a CTP genotype and one was an

116
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:19,400
APOS C3 genotypes. And those genotypes increased from about eight to nine percent of the homozygosity

117
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:29,800
in control to almost 20 percent in centenarians. And it's not only that. Look, when you have people

118
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:39,800
of all ages, unrelated, you can look at the trend of the genotypes. If the genotype is killing you,

119
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,200
then as you go closer to 80, 90 and above, those genotypes will decrease.

120
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:55,080
And if they are going up, and by the way, the slope that's going up is a very important

121
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:03,400
statistical tool, then they are very likely to be longevity genotypes. And this is what we found.

122
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,600
And it's so interesting. It was our initial discovery. And drug companies were at our

123
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,080
doorsteps immediately because not because they're interested in aging, but they said just a minute,

124
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,040
if we have if we make a good drug, OK, if the drug is really good, it targets exactly that

125
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:33,480
with outside effects, then we have already safety. We have safety because those guys for 100 years had

126
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,320
in both cases, by the way, suppression of the expression of those genes. It must be safe.

127
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,040
So let's develop the drug. And isn't it amazing how big the graveyard is of CTEP inhibitors? Yes.

128
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:57,640
And I don't totally understand it. And I listened to one of your podcasts. Yeah, Tom Dayspring and

129
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,280
I have discussed this in great detail. I think a lot of it comes down to not understanding the

130
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,640
biology of HDL. I mean, the biology of LDL is relatively straightforward. The biology of HDL,

131
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,080
I think it's safe to say we don't understand at all. I mean, that would be putting it mildly.

132
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,040
And I think the challenge with the CTEP inhibitors is they raised HDL cholesterol. So in one sense,

133
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,560
they reproduced the phenotype in its most crude sense. But you can think of it very simplistically,

134
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,840
I think, which is how do you raise HDL cholesterol? Do you raise it by putting more cholesterol into

135
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,960
HDL? Do you raise it by impairing HDL from conducting reverse cholesterol transport and

136
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:46,600
getting rid of cholesterol? Right. Those are two very different approaches to raising HDL. And when

137
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,680
you look at the centenarians and examine their phenotype, you don't really know what it is. You

138
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:59,400
would speculate that they have better HDL function. But the reality of it is we have other phenotypes

139
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,840
that exist in nature. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I've seen a number of papers that

140
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,600
examine people with HDL cholesterol that's very elevated who have very advanced atherosclerosis.

141
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,640
And in fact, the elevated level of HDL cholesterol they have suggests impaired HDL function and

142
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:25,320
impaired reverse cholesterol transport. And so I think that's probably the issue around why a lot

143
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,760
of these drugs have failed. And it obviously speaks to the humility with which all of us need to be

144
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,160
able to examine these phenotypes. And it's a clever way to go about doing it, right? A very

145
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,880
clever thing is look for phenotypes that are different and work backwards to find genotypes.

146
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,320
Right. So let me add two points to this. Absolutely. The trade-offs of this pathway are amazing.

147
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,480
On one hand, you don't clear cholesterol. On the other hand, you have high HDL. But

148
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,000
for me, it's not about the HDL because all the particle size are significantly bigger.

149
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:09,480
So you could say it's all about high dense LDL, right? That's the phenotype that we're depicting.

150
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,360
So I think this part is important. The other thing that was really striking,

151
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:25,640
I told you about those two centenarians with ApoE4 genotypes. They both had very high HDL

152
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:35,240
cholesterol and they were homozygous for CTP. And so it is possible, in fact, the major phenotype

153
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:43,720
for us of the HDL wasn't cardiovascular, it was cognitive function. And so when I'm saying

154
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,440
cognitive function, maybe we're talking about physiology. We're thinking of this physiology

155
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,960
from a heart perspective. And maybe there's a physiology of that from a brain perspective that

156
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:02,680
we don't totally understand. And by the way, I did ask Merck. I said to Merck, do cognitive function.

157
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:11,080
Okay. And they did. But the people they go to the study were between 50 and 70 years old.

158
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,320
Two years. So there's no results for that.

159
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,800
Nier, did you have, you might not know this off the top of your head, but even offline, I'd love

160
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:24,760
to hear what you learned about the variants of clotho that those people had, especially the ones

161
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:32,360
who were homozygous for ApoE4. You're probably aware, but there are variants of clotho that seem

162
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:42,280
to completely abrogate the effect of E4, meaning you take people with ApoE4, either hetero or

163
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:49,560
homozygous. And if they have this particular variant of clotho, they behave as though they are E3.

164
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,040
This is so interesting. So we published on clotho. And clotho was the example of what we call

165
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:07,320
a V shape or a U shape genotype. Clotho basically killed, seemed to kill 50% of our subjects by age

166
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:18,680
85. Okay, the genotype has disappeared by age 85. And all of a sudden, after that, it was the same.

167
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:26,440
Okay, it was the same. And our interpretation was that, you know, those centenarians were born

168
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,160
with clotho, but they were also born with longevity genes, which made the clotho not significant. Okay.

169
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,920
But another hypothesis is that the actual clotho that they had is a clotho that was protective in

170
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,240
another mechanism. So what about some of these other genes that have now come to light? So

171
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,920
Foxo, for example, tell us a little bit about Foxo. How did you arrive at that? What was the

172
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,880
phenotype that tipped you in that direction? Or did you arrive at Foxo through a pure genetic

173
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,560
analysis? Well, I didn't come up with Foxo. Foxo came out from Japan in Okinawa. And I'm using you

174
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:14,440
in the very liberal sense, Nir. I'm giving you and the field credit. And me is not only me, right?

175
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,480
It's a big team. And in fact, you know, the research now has changed very much. The teams

176
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,360
are really teams because you need to computational and the AI people and the doctors and the

177
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:35,080
physiology. So it's we. But let me start it differently. Because, you know, why did I start

178
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:42,920
centenarians? I started centenarians because all of a sudden, in the mid 90s, it became apparent

179
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,600
that you change just one gene in a nematode and they can live 10 times longer. Right. By the way,

180
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,400
the gene was bugging me because it's the insulin receptor, the IGF insulin receptor gene. And the

181
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,840
nematodes were insulin resistant. And they also had abdominal obesity. They accumulated fat in their

182
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,720
intestinal cell. It wasn't the right example, but the concept was right. And so I started the

183
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,680
centenarians. I told you about the first genes that I saw. And then I wrote a grant. And, you know,

184
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:25,640
most of the grants that I wrote ended up the hypothesis ended up being wrong, though we found

185
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:33,320
the right explanations. Mostly there was one grant that I wrote. And I said, I'm writing this

186
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,840
hypothesis, knowing it's wrong. And that is that growth hormone IGF signaling pathway have anything

187
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,120
to do with human longevity. I said, it's great. You know, we have the nematodes, we have this and

188
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,000
that, but this is wrong. And I was totally wrong about it. And I'm telling you the bottom line,

189
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:01,960
60% of our centenarians have genes that impairs growth hormone IGF signaling pathway,

190
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:12,440
including the FOXA3A. 60%. It's the most common genotype. It's not only genotypes, by the way,

191
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,840
it's micro RNA, it's genotypes on the IGF receptor, it's deletions of the growth hormone receptor.

192
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,160
There's lots of ways to get to this. But this is very common. And sorry, just to double click on

193
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,280
that a little bit near, I think it's worth maybe giving people a little bit of a primer on the

194
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:37,960
relationship between growth hormone and IGF-1. And if you want, we can talk about IGF-BP3.

195
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,800
Right. Well, okay. So the growth hormone IGF, I was trying to slide over.

196
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,400
No, no, no, no, I think this is important to the story. So please expand.

197
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:55,160
So I said, I said growth hormone IGF, and I'll stand by picking those two. But for growth,

198
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,840
there are actually hundreds of genes, okay? There are hundreds of genes. If you only look at

199
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,880
what determines height, there's hundreds of genes that are determining heights.

200
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:18,040
But the growth hormone is the growth hormone pathway or the growth hormone signaling pathway

201
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,680
that really comes from the pituitary controlled by the hypothalamus, but comes from the pituitary

202
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:34,440
and makes you grow when you need to grow. And it has its own actions, but also it has a specific

203
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,320
action of binding to its receptor in liver and releasing the second important growth hormone,

204
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:48,840
which is called IGF-1. It stands for insulin growth factor one. And so those are the hormones

205
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:57,160
that we're talking about. The advantage of IGF-1 is that it's measurable. Growth hormone is

206
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,200
measurable in provocation and in young people and not much in old people. So IGF is kind of the

207
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:11,720
biomarker for this action. IGF itself is really complicated because there are five, actually,

208
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,480
I hear that there are seven binding proteins and there's a lot of regulation in between.

209
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:26,840
But it's true to say that levels of IGF are really very good biomarkers, even if you don't

210
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:35,480
agree that there are causative for variety of health outcomes. And I want to say another thing,

211
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:44,360
you know that in nature, the dwarfs are doing better as far as longevity. The little dogs are

212
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:52,920
doing better. The ponies are living longer. And in animals, everyone, no matter how you interfere,

213
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:00,280
you're getting better longevity. Even the larone dwarfs that have deletion of the growth hormone

214
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:08,440
receptor, we don't know if they live longer, but at least they have less age-related diseases like

215
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,760
cancer or diabetes. But they have more alcoholism and suicide. And as you said, it's not clear that

216
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,280
they live any longer. They just seem to be spared of some of the chronic diseases in exchange for

217
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,000
others, correct? I'm always describing it that they are still unhappy to be short. They drink,

218
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,200
they cross the road and nobody sees them when they're drunk and they're being run over, right?

219
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,840
It's not natural. But let me tell you a much more optimistic story about that.

220
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,040
We discovered, and when I say we, it's Gil etzmon who was a fellow and then a faculty with us,

221
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,560
he's still involved, he's now in Israel, but we looked at all the pathway and we discovered

222
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,000
that our centenarians have deletion of exome 3 in the growth hormone receptor.

223
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,720
And Gil came to me and showed also the trend. And as I said, the trend is important. So

224
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:17,640
the homozygosity was 3% in our population and 12% in centenarians. And I said, Gil,

225
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,720
what's their IGF-1 level? And he showed me, it's significantly lower. I said terrific.

226
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,000
What was their maximal height? And he said, that's the problem. And he shows me,

227
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,120
they're significantly taller than the rest of the people, 2-3 inches taller.

228
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:45,960
Wait, the people that had 10%, the people that were homozygous were taller than the controls?

229
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,000
Significantly taller.

230
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,200
And 2-3 inches is not subtle. What was the relative Z score difference between them in IGF?

231
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,600
I don't remember. I'll get you the reference. It was like a 20% decrease.

232
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,840
And what about their IGF binding proteins?

233
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,520
There is nothing special there. There is nothing special.

234
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,880
No major difference.

235
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:13,160
No. But you're on the right track. So I said to Gil, what do you do with genetics? First of all,

236
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,400
you need to do validation. The paper is not accepted without validation. I said do validation.

237
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:28,920
So Gil got three other studies from all over the world, actually. And all of them were showing the

238
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:37,800
same thing. The oldest old had a false difference in their growth hormone in this deletion,

239
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:47,080
which was very compelling on its own. But still, why do they have lower IGF-1? So we went to-

240
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Sorry, just to be clear, they had lower growth hormone. They should have lower IGF-1.

241
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,080
You're saying, but they were taller.

242
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,960
Why they were taller. Sorry. I meant why they were taller.

243
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,600
Yes.

244
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,080
So, Hasikoen, who's the dean of the Gerontology School at USC and one of my collaborator,

245
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,160
is a growth hormone expert. And he took the cells- And by the way, that's another thing that we have.

246
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:17,720
We have the lymphoblasts of our centenarians. So if you have a phenotype, if you have a genotype,

247
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,320
you can actually look at its action with lymphoblasts. And he took this lymphoblasts,

248
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,320
and he incubated them with and without growth hormone. And something really interesting

249
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,320
happened when they were not incubated with growth hormone. The phosphorylation of this receptor,

250
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,560
the activity of this receptor was lower, as we thought it would be, because they have deletion

251
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:50,280
of an axon. But when he incubated with growth hormone, it was almost like an amplifying switch.

252
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:59,880
They were phosphorylated three times as much. The same was with proliferation. Proliferation was lower,

253
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:09,800
and with growth hormone was increased. So what we understood that happened, although we don't

254
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:20,200
understand this switch mechanism, but when they go through puberty, okay, they are activating growth

255
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,720
hormone. They're very sensitive. They're sensitive, they grow taller. And once their growth hormone

256
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,360
decreases after puberty, they are tall, but their IGF stays low for the rest of their lives.

257
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,840
What fraction of centenarians share this genotype? 12%.

258
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:46,200
20%. 12%. Okay. I want to talk more about the genotypes, and I'm going to come back to a

259
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:52,440
question around this, so hopefully I'll remember. So this is now another big major axis, is the

260
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,680
genotype cluster around GH. We've already addressed the genotype cluster around CTEP.

261
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,960
Let's talk about FOXO, let's talk about TSHR, let's talk about some of the others.

262
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,440
Okay. Can I make a point, because I don't want to forget it, so you can add it wherever.

263
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:22,600
We recently published a paper, because we didn't understand so well why the literature is so

264
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:30,760
confusing us with the growth hormone and IGF. We went to the UK Biobank, which has really changed

265
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:41,240
our ability to validate and to learn and to get hypotheses. And they have 440,000 people who have

266
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:53,640
actually IGF-1 measurements. And we looked at the young people that had high IGF-1 level.

267
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:04,040
And we saw that for young people, high IGF-1 was protective from variety of age-related diseases

268
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,880
and from mortality, although not from cancer.

269
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,040
Yeah, I was just about to say it's a very complex relationship. IGF seems to protect from everything

270
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:23,240
but cancer, right? Right, except that, by the way, I'll get to cancer in a second.

271
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:31,880
On the other hand, people over the age of 60, it's exactly the opposite. Okay, they had more of

272
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:39,240
every age-related disease except cancer. And they also had increasing mortality.

273
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,520
What I'm telling you now, in other words— Sorry, was that a linear relationship?

274
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,560
Totally linear. Totally linear relationship. Totally linear relationship. What I'm describing

275
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:58,760
to you is what we call the antagonistic pleiotrophy hypothesis of age. Okay? The things that are good

276
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:07,880
for you when you're young can turn against you when you're old. Or in this case, yeah, in order

277
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,400
to do reproduction and to do evolution, you need a lot of growth hormone to get there.

278
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,280
But after that, you have to switch the energy because now you're going to have breakdown.

279
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,320
It doesn't make sense for you to expand growth in any way. And I think it was beautifully

280
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,760
demonstrated, and it also explained the confusion in the literature. It depends

281
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,240
if you looked at young people or old people or took care of that at all.

282
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,560
Yeah, one thing that's confusing about that pleiotrophic relationship is that the cut-off is

283
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:50,920
quite old, right? So if you really think about this just through kind of a Dawkins lens,

284
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,520
you would think that that cut-off would be done by 25 or 30. At that point, evolution is done with

285
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:05,720
you. You've served your purpose. Now, anything that you get after that is gravy and really not

286
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,360
under the purview of evolution. Evolution sort of stopped caring about you. Unless you buy the

287
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,800
argument—and I think this is an argument—that there's an evolutionary benefit to you being a

288
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,520
caregiver beyond your reproductive capacity. So maybe there's something to be said for that. But

289
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,320
are you surprised by how late in life we see that switch flip?

290
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:35,560
You made this argument. By the way, I would say I believe in the grandparent theory. But still,

291
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:44,120
if you had your kid and died the next day or survived for 100 more years, I think it's too

292
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,640
late for evolution. Number one. Number two, we show one of the most interesting things that we

293
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:58,600
show, and it's true around the world. People with longevity, with exceptional longevity, have less

294
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:06,680
offspring. From an evolutionary point of view, you should be losing longevity genes. In fact,

295
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,560
I wrote a paper one year— By the way, anybody with kids will immediately find that

296
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:22,760
completely intuitive. Especially in COVID times. They just suck all the life out of you. They're

297
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,840
incredible. I love them more than anything, but I believe that they are indeed shortening my life

298
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:35,160
on some level. I think there's hormesis. They'll come back and you'll be more resilient. It's okay.

299
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,760
But I actually wrote a paper saying, when people in the Old Testament

300
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:50,680
are quoting Metusilla to be 969 and Moses to be 120, maybe they were right. Maybe we had this

301
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,560
capacity because we're losing longevity genes because of reproduction.

302
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,760
That's really interesting. Has there ever been a serious study about the biblical stories and

303
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,600
if there's any way to assess any validity to some of the age-related claims that were made

304
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,240
merely 2,000 years ago? You know why it's a problem? Because the Orthodox people believe

305
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,680
that every word in the Bible is true. Exactly. You ask them, and I asked many, believe me,

306
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:31,080
I ask many, you think really that's happened? They didn't know how to count. They're very

307
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,440
skeptical. That's why I wrote the paper that I'm not skeptical. I think that's true.

308
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,040
I want to ask you another question about growth hormone. It's a hormone that

309
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,720
I've prescribed to patients when they're healing from injuries. I've seen pretty good literature

310
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,040
that says you're having, you tear a bicep, you have surgery to repair it, growth hormone for

311
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:07,480
eight weeks fosters rehabilitation better than if you did nothing. That's the very narrow window

312
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,320
in which I've prescribed growth hormone is typically around the healing from orthopedic

313
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,720
injuries. A couple of things I'll say, every patient I've prescribed it to, and there hasn't

314
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,240
been many, maybe half a dozen over the last 10 years, they all say I've never felt better,

315
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:34,200
which then helps me understand why this cottage industry of doctors out there exists

316
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,160
who run longevity clinics prescribing growth hormone. I've drawn a hard line in the sand with

317
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,600
my patients that I don't believe in the literature that would suggest that prescribing growth hormone

318
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,040
is a pro-longevity tool, but if I'm being brutally honest, and I tell them this as well,

319
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,880
I can't tell you that it's killing you either. I can come up with theoretical arguments why

320
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,880
prescribing growth hormone is going to make you feel better, but it's going to shorten your life,

321
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,160
but I don't really see any data one way or the other. Even when you look at extreme cases,

322
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:20,760
which are basically athletes who use, growth hormone is the most abused drug in all of sports,

323
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,800
because we don't have a test for it. You'd think that the morgue of athletes would be much bigger.

324
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:41,320
So what is your view on exogenous growth hormone as not necessarily a pro-longevity tool, but as

325
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,960
an agent that clearly helps health span, but might be not as destructive to lifespan as

326
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,960
I believe it could be? I think you're absolutely right. Look, we're talking about

327
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,880
chronic environment, and that has nothing to do with the fact that there could be indication

328
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,280
for growth hormone. You mentioned one. There is a paper about growth hormone after strokes.

329
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,160
We were actually interested in growth hormone in the brain. There are more examples like that. So

330
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,600
I don't think those are mutually exclusive. Right. And I've often wondered, by the way,

331
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,840
I haven't seen the literature. If you know of it, I'd love to see it. Would growth hormone be

332
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:34,840
protective in stages of early cognitive decline? But anyway, putting that aside for a moment,

333
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:42,280
what about this idea of the 50-year-old who goes to the longevity clinic and they're being given

334
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,640
low doses of growth hormone every single day? Typically, it's somewhere between 0.4

335
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,440
and one milligram daily. I'm not going to answer you about the dose, but I'm going to make the

336
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,000
thing that I think is very important. And it's getting us back to this antagonistic

337
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,080
pliotrophy. And it's relevant to tame and metform. It is possible that things that you're doing are

338
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,560
good for you when you're young and against you when you're old. Right. So when people are asking

339
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:23,960
me on any of those gero protectors, gero therapeutics, vitamins, when do we start them?

340
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:31,480
Okay. The answer is I really don't know. I think you shouldn't get some elytics before you're 70

341
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,520
or 80 years old. I think problem with forming, although we start the study at 65, most of the

342
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,480
studies so far that showed really large effect of metforming are people were recruited above the age

343
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:54,760
of 50. So I think it's 50. So I don't know to tell you for a singular patient who chronologically,

344
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,800
chronological age is 50 and biological age. I don't know what it is. You can determine it better.

345
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,000
Well, what do I tell them? I don't I don't really know based on literature, based on clinical trials.

346
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,600
So last question on this near based on the number of people that are taking growth hormone out there.

347
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:19,160
And I don't know how you would quantify this, but presumably it's not rocket science to figure it

348
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,680
out. But let's just say that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone.

349
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,920
Who are taking growth hormone daily as part of a

350
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,160
Geroprotective regimen. Why aren't they all dying prematurely?

351
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,680
We don't know that.

352
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,720
Assuming that they're older.

353
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,720
We don't know that.

354
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Well, that's true. We don't know it. But wouldn't we see a signal of it?

355
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,880
I think not because the people who are taking growth hormone are probably taking all

356
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,520
some metformin and exercising and doing other things.

357
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,400
Yeah. So fair fair point. There's too many confounders.

358
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,600
Yeah. I mean, again, my view is still and probably will remain for the foreseeable future that it is

359
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:08,200
not a great Geroprotective agent because I do have these concerns. But this is an example of

360
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,920
something where I really wish we had data. I want to tell you another thing that also

361
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:21,080
is is a gray zone for me. Most of the negative effect of growth hormone IGF in humans we see in

362
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:28,040
females, not in males, actually in animals too, in animals too. So I'll describe two things.

363
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,160
When we look at our centenarians that's done by Sophia Millman who's running the longevity

364
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:44,520
studies now. And she measured IGF one in in all our patients. And she looked at our centenarian

365
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,800
in our centenarian. So they are already 100 years old. Okay.

366
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,240
Is IGF one level predicts their longevity? And remember, centenarians are likely to die. 30%

367
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:06,840
of them are going to die each year. So so those with the lowest half of IGF one

368
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,000
lived twice as long as those with the highest level of IGF one.

369
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And that's females only or both sexes? That's females only. Okay. Males. We don't have,

370
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,840
you know, the ratio of female male centenarians around the world is there 85 females for every

371
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:35,000
15 men. We have better results because most a lot of the female centenarians have never got married.

372
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,520
You know, nuns and other things going back to your problem with your kids, right?

373
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:48,040
But we need people with offspring. Our study is based on offspring because the phenotype,

374
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,880
the phenotype you capture in offspring and not in centenarians. In centenarians,

375
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,080
the phenotype is going down already. Okay. Those women also have better cognitive function.

376
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,840
And as far as muscle function, it's not different. In other words, they are not paying. I think a lot

377
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:13,960
of our problem when we come from sports, right? We're trying to preserve muscle. And I'm not sure

378
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,680
that low IGF is the best way to preserve muscle. I think maybe it's making the muscle

379
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,320
biology better, but it's not making the muscle any better.

380
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:31,720
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying that the women in the bottom quartile, say of IGF,

381
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,560
are no more likely to be sarcopenic than the women with higher IGF, but they do tend to live longer.

382
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,320
And smarter and cognitively.

383
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,000
They have better cognitive function.

384
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,680
Right. With male, it's not, there is a trend, but it's not significant. So I think that

385
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:56,360
if you have male, you know, and that's my way out of that. If you, it's lots of it is males that are

386
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,280
taking it. I haven't convinced myself in my study that it's not a major sex differences,

387
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
the sensitivity to growth hormone.

388
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,440
Yeah, I'm just reflecting on the few patients in my practice who do take growth hormone. It is

389
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,360
prescribed by other doctors. I've made it clear that I'm not thrilled about it, but they feel

390
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,880
strongly about it and it's their choice. I think it's an equal, it's a very small number. It's an

391
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,480
equal mix of male and female, which again, gets to a question that we are going to talk about today,

392
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,200
which is health span, lifespan trade offs. So let's continue down this path of double

393
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,520
clicking on the centenarians and their bucket three genes. That is to say they're good genes

394
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,680
rather than their absence of bad genes are centenarians more likely to have Apo E2 than

395
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,080
non-centenarians, which is the protective variant of that gene.

396
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:58,120
That's the most common general longevity genotypes that we have. And Apo E2, either

397
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:07,400
an allele frequency or the homozygosity of Apo E2 is the most validated longevity genotype that we have.

398
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,040
Okay.

399
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:16,680
First of all, it's the truth if you measure if you measure genotype. It was hard for me to accept

400
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:25,320
it and it's only recently that I convinced myself. And the reason is that Apo E2 genotype is also

401
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:34,680
associated with diseases too. It's not so simple. And I thought for a long time

402
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:47,560
that what we have actually, we have a problem, it's ascertainment bias. That to our study,

403
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,960
we don't get people with Apo E4 because they are demented and they're not getting to our study or

404
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:04,200
to any study. So that we increase the proportion of other genotypes. But what convinced me

405
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:12,760
is that it should have been equally distributed between Apo E2 and Apo E3. And it's not.

406
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:22,040
It's really an Apo E2 phenomenon. And so although I don't understand totally the mechanism,

407
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,760
I'm convinced myself that there is something true in this and that Apo E2 by mechanism

408
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,720
that I don't totally get is the longevity genotype.

409
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,880
Presumably, this is backtracking a little bit on something you said.

410
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,200
I'm guessing centenarians have less LPA genotype.

411
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:47,960
LPA genotype is really interesting. Remember we talked about how we are losing cloto with age.

412
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,400
Until we regain it.

413
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:56,840
Right. We are losing a little LPA and regaining that. Now, what we've done

414
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:05,480
is with computational biologists, the system biologists, we interacted every one of those

415
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:13,400
bad genotypes with the longevity genotype. And actually the people with high, the centenarians

416
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,040
with high LPLiL-A all have CTP. They're homozygous for the CTP genotype.

417
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,240
So they have some protection to counter it. And by the way, they might be getting some

418
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,520
benefit from LPLiL-A. There may be something that LPA, because you have to think,

419
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:37,000
LPA is common, right? It's about 10% of the population. So 10% of the population

420
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,800
overexpresses this thing. 10% of the population has an elevated phenotype for LPLiL-A.

421
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,920
And it's true that evolution wasn't selecting against atherosclerosis.

422
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:55,080
But there are arguments to be made that LPLiL-A could have played a role in managing

423
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:01,480
infections, for example, that this could have been a manner in which we fought oxidative stress.

424
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:09,160
So it begs to, you know, at least question the idea, do the centenarians who have it

425
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,680
get some benefit from it while having genes that offset some of its negatives?

426
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:21,720
Yeah. But you have to explain on a population base how all of a sudden at age 85,

427
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,920
you switch and this genotype becomes protective, you know? Yes, you're selecting a lot.

428
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,160
Yeah. Is that really necessary or is it just a denominator problem where at 85,

429
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,360
you've really eliminated so much of the population that you're now concentrating

430
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,120
the people who were never harmed from it. So in those people, they've never been harmed

431
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,920
by the gene. And now they are disproportionately rising to the surface because the population

432
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,480
around them has withered away so quickly. Right. So those are the two explanations,

433
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:04,680
either what you just said or that they're protected by other longevity gene and it makes

434
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,760
it irrelevant what this LPLiL-A. Although I don't think those are mutually exclusive. I think the

435
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,560
former is an explanation. I think that the latter is an explanation for the former. It's the

436
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,400
amplifier of it, right? It's what lets them get there in the first place is that using C-TEP as

437
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:29,880
an example, they happen to have a C-TEP mutation or a C-TEP variant that offers remarkable

438
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:36,280
protection against atherosclerosis, of which an interesting but kind of irrelevant phenotype is

439
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:43,800
high HDL cholesterol. And that's offsetting the damage of their LPLiL-A. And then eventually at

440
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,640
some point when everybody else has died because of their LPLiL-A, they're still standing. And they

441
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,240
might even be getting some benefit from LPLiL-A that everybody gets, but it's in other people's

442
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,320
cases, it's so dwarfed by the damage of LPLiL-A. Again, total hypothesis or speculation, but that

443
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:09,720
it's plausible, right? It is. Okay. Tell me about TSHR. I've never understood that one fully.

444
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:20,520
So the thyroid story is interesting because we found a correlation between high TSH and longevity.

445
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,880
And when I say correlation... As an endocrinologist, you're maybe give people the

446
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:32,840
two minute story on what TSH is and how it functions. You know, I promised to some of my

447
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,960
sisters are listening to you and I promised I'm going to be so simple. You want me to call me

448
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:46,200
again and ask me what did you mean? And now I'm falling into... I know. I'm doing a bad job of this.

449
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:55,800
I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. So TSH is really your control of thyroid function

450
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:04,360
in the sense that if you become hypothyroid, then this TSH, this hormone from the pituitary will

451
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:12,040
increase in order to get those thyroid hormones to be normal again. And they might fail and then

452
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:18,040
you'll be hypothyroid, but there's an effort to get those thyroid out of your glands. Okay. So

453
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:27,240
that's TSH. So when we see a high TSH in a normal person, we ask the first question, is their thyroid

454
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,640
gland not making enough T4 and or converting enough of that T4 to the active hormone T3,

455
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,880
which is the feedback loop that tells the pituitary how much TSH to make. So what you're

456
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:47,960
saying is we see a higher amount of TSH in long-lived people suggesting... And their children.

457
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:54,600
And their children. So maybe suggesting a subclinical or potentially a clinical degree

458
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:01,640
of low thyroid function or hypothyroidism. Is that a safe summary? Correct. And I'll tell you,

459
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:12,040
our discovery has led to several papers and to change in the thyroid association recommendation

460
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:18,200
of what to do with old people. The endocrinologist or the thyroidologist were looking for business.

461
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:25,640
So once TSH was above 10 and then they said, it might be subclinical at seven and we went to five.

462
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:32,360
And now if you are three and symptomatic, which we are always because we're tired.

463
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,960
So that's where the science came. And we pointed out to the fact, we did it in our study, then we

464
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,920
did it in a national study. And we said, you have to leave those older people because maybe

465
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:57,000
this is a physiological way for them to be well. And we don't need to increase their...

466
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,520
Tell me how high you're seeing the TSH. What is the difference when you age match them between

467
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:09,240
centenarians? It's like five to eight. Okay. So normal is like until five. Yeah. Okay. Or even

468
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:19,000
4.2 on our lab. Yeah. And changing baseline. So yeah. And look, their thyroid hormones

469
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,440
themselves are normal. Okay. It's really only the TSH. So normal free T4, normal free T3,

470
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,960
but they walk around with a TSH of five to eight. Right. Now here's the kicker. And this is where

471
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,040
I'm hoping the offspring can help us. Do you know what their TSH would have been in their 30s and

472
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,960
40s? Would they have also had a TSH of five, six or seven? Well, I think that's why we have

473
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,720
the offspring. And I don't have the answer for this yet, but that's why we have the offspring,

474
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:56,360
because we want to see the effects of those longevity gene as they get old, right? And to

475
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:04,360
see really what phenotype and what measurements are changed throughout. And I don't have the answer,

476
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:13,960
but a lot of them do have high TSH when they're 60. So they're U thyroid high TSH patients. Right.

477
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:20,840
Right. What's the hypothesis for that? Is this simply a biomarker of something else that is

478
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:28,200
unrelated to thyroid function? Or does it suggest that these people live right on the edge of

479
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,560
hypothyroidism without actually becoming clinically symptomatic? And that there's something

480
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:41,560
protective within running a lower RPM, running the engine a little bit lower, a little bit slower.

481
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:49,480
Right. So by the way, the growth hormone deficiency models are also hypothyroid.

482
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:58,440
Okay. So it might be part of the physiology of what we're seeing anyhow.

483
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,760
Have you looked at prolactin in these people and other pituitary hormones that tend to

484
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:11,000
move with TSH? We have prolactin. I'm not sure that we looked at TSH. You know, this TSH paper came

485
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:18,200
years ago. I don't remember that we're doing anything. It's a good question. I have two

486
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:24,200
endocrinologists that are looking at our data and analyzing it. And I'll be happy to come again,

487
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,840
or have them talk more about the endocrinology of those people. But

488
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:41,400
so we're just looking and so I don't have association with others, but the hypothesis was

489
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:50,120
that their metabolism is maybe slow. And although they're compensating by higher TSH,

490
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:57,000
still their metabolism, you know, it's like insulin resistant. You don't totally normalize the glucose,

491
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,720
although you have enough insulin for that, that there's a metabolic over metabolic advantages.

492
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:11,240
I'm saying it like that because I don't know that it's true. I don't really think that our data

493
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:21,240
supports low metabolism necessarily. But I do think as an endocrinologist that if an elderly

494
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:29,560
person comes and by incidental finding has TSH between five and eight, you don't have to go and

495
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:37,960
treat it straight away. Has anyone done Mendelian randomization on any of these clusters of genes

496
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,560
and looked for? Because we haven't really established a causal relationship here, have we?

497
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:54,040
In these genes? No. So we're trying to develop, you know, by the way, Peter, you just said another

498
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,640
word that nobody knows, right? Mendelian randomization. Okay, sorry. Do you want to explain

499
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:06,280
a Mendelian randomization? Well, I would just, I don't want to go long into that, but because we

500
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:13,320
have so much genetic data, and by the way, genetic data is disappointing because they're

501
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:19,080
not so predictive, most of them, you can find lots of genes for for obesity and you'll be lean for

502
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:25,240
lipids and you'll have normal lipids, right? But we have lots of genotype and we try to integrate

503
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:32,200
those genotypes in order to assess how much they are increasing the risk of us of getting a disease.

504
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:38,920
And usually it's not by much. What we're trying to do, we're trying to have an instrument that will

505
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:48,840
do Mendelian randomization to longevity. Okay, so we can see what's your genotype that fits

506
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:56,680
longevity more than anything else that's in evolution now. But otherwise, look, I have to tell you,

507
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:06,360
the reason this is not good is very simple. We're doing something so stupid in genetics.

508
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:14,680
We do lots of genotypes and we take each one of these genotype and we ask, is this associated

509
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:24,360
with obesity or diabetes or not? And we found many things and in order to, by the way, to make them

510
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,840
statistic significance without increasing their power much, we just need to get 100,000 more people

511
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:38,680
in the study. Okay. But we're not built with one genotype at the time. We're built with numerous

512
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:46,920
genotypes. And what we've started doing lately, and that's our latest nature paper, was to say,

513
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:53,960
just a minute, we're looking at the difference between centenarians and people without longevity.

514
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:00,680
And we're going to take all those rare genotypes, less than 1%, okay, because

515
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:08,360
to be centenarians, 1 out of 10,000. So we need to find rare genotypes. And by the way,

516
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:17,320
there are 80,000 rare genotypes just in our population. And then we take those genotype

517
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:26,600
and put them in pathways and look at the enrichment of the pathways rather with a specific

518
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:33,400
genotype. And then we get really important information. And by the way, the important

519
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:40,920
information that we got in the study in the summary statement is that the genetics of longevity

520
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:47,320
in humans is exactly what we learned from animals. It's the insulin signaling pathway,

521
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:55,000
it's the mTOR signaling pathway, it's the MEPCI pathway, it's exactly the same genotype, the

522
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:02,360
distinct centenarians and other people. And I think this is really very important for us because

523
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:08,440
people have blamed us that our animal models are not, you know, animals' models are not good. Yeah,

524
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,440
they're not good for diabetes, they're not good for Alzheimer, they're not good for other thing.

525
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,280
But for aging, actually, our models are really good because it's so conserving evolution. All

526
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,960
our animals, their skin, their hair, their skeletal, their get cancers, they get diseases.

527
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:31,160
So this is the same, but it's really the same pathways. And the first that comes out is the

528
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,960
IGF insulin signaling pathway. Yeah, which as you said, goes all the way back to C. elegans, right?

529
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:43,960
One of the simplest organisms we can study. All of this really points towards the importance of

530
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:52,040
polygenic risk scores. And, you know, when I talk to someone like Richard Isaacson,

531
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:59,480
who is so focused on understanding Alzheimer's disease, and Richard and I work so closely on

532
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,400
this, because it's obviously one of the most important things we think about in our practice.

533
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:09,800
I think of the evolution that we have had in our thinking over the past five years. In fact,

534
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:17,640
we're working on a paper now that's looking at this polygenic assessment of risk in dementia.

535
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:23,720
You brought up earlier APO E4. Obviously any listener to this podcast is no stranger to it.

536
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,960
We've spent so much time talking about it. One of the things that I would say is,

537
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:39,480
I would say is 10 years ago, we thought that being homozygous for E4, so being in that roughly

538
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:45,800
1% of the population that has two copies of the E4 gene, that was a death sentence, as you noted

539
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,480
earlier. That's a person who's going to have Alzheimer's disease by 60, and they're going

540
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:57,160
to be dead by 70. There's no way out of that. Their risk is deemed at about 20-fold that of

541
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:05,400
the general population. Then five years ago, we looked at the data again and said, it's still

542
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:14,200
awful, but it's not 20 times the risk of the E3, E3. It's 12 times the risk. Then we look at the

543
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,760
data again two years ago, and it's still bad, but maybe it's five times the risk.

544
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:31,320
And now we are looking at patients who have E4, E4, and they don't have, not only do they not have

545
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:37,320
Alzheimer's disease, more importantly, they don't have any of the early signs of it based on really,

546
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:42,440
really advanced cognitive testing that shows very subtle signs decades before.

547
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:49,720
And we're starting to look at other genes that are abrogating some of the effects of this.

548
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:55,800
And so now the focus has been less at looking at APOE4 and making a determination, and it's

549
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:02,680
looking at E4 plus Tom40 plus mitochondrial haplotype plus cloth though, plus a whole bunch

550
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:11,640
of genes and taking a polygenic approach to risk. It seems to me that this would be the most logical

551
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:18,040
way to do the same thing with respect to longevity, right? I mean, I think this is true with

552
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:23,160
cardiovascular disease. LPA is part of the story, but it's not the whole story, right?

553
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:30,680
Absolutely. Absolutely, you're right. You described the problem and the solution,

554
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:39,880
absolutely right. I would just tell you that in looking for those longevity genes that we just

555
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:46,840
published, 12 of them are associated, we're funded for that, but they are associated with

556
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:57,800
resiliency to Alzheimer's. And I think that not enough of the genetics is explaining not only the

557
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:03,960
genetics, but the resiliency or looking at the genetics of resiliency, which is what we're

558
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,720
calling longevity in this case, but the resiliency to diseases, which happens to diseases that you

559
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:15,560
get in young age too, not every genotype causes this disease. So I think you're right.

560
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:20,600
Would you put Foxo in that category as kind of a general resilience gene that is less

561
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,440
disease specific and more broadly protective?

562
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Yeah, I actually count the Foxo3A as in the insulin signaling pathway, insulin IGF signaling pathway.

563
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,920
We can argue about it, but that's my bucket.

564
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,280
What are the genes that you would put in the general resilience pathway, not necessarily

565
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,160
disease specific or system specific as in the endocrine system?

566
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:59,400
We have 750 centenarians in our study. Now, they are all Ashkenazi Jews, and they are Ashkenazi Jews.

567
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,120
Why is that?

568
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:08,280
Not because religious is important, but because Ashkenazi Jews are genetically homogeneous.

569
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:16,600
They went through a bottleneck, an expansion, and then a bottleneck, and very few survived,

570
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:23,880
and they lived in isolation and intermarriage, and their genetic pool is much more homogeneous.

571
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:33,880
In fact, we can measure it. It's genotype specific, but we need between 20 and 50 less

572
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:43,720
times, between 20 and 50 times less people in order to get the same data. So think about it

573
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:51,080
that not 750, but few thousands, but it's still not enough to find all longevity genes. And one

574
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:58,360
of the things that we realize is that there are 50 ways to leave your lover. There are 50 ways

575
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:05,240
probably to get to longevity. It's possible there's only one person who's 150 years old somewhere,

576
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:11,320
and if we knew his genotype, he will solve the problem for anyone. And the genotypes we are

577
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:19,720
discovering are things like that. We have 20 genotypes in centenarians and one in control.

578
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:29,480
But those for geneticists who are dealing with 400,000 people in study, they say, well, in 750

579
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:36,760
centenarians, this can change any minute. So what can we do? Well, what we can do is look at the

580
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:42,760
function of those genotypes. And you know our friend Yuxin Xu, that's what she's doing with

581
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:49,800
our studies. She takes those discoveries and either takes the lymphoblasts of our patient,

582
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:58,600
or she does construct and express those genes in cells and see how resilient they are to injury.

583
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:05,560
So there are a lot of genes, and I think the biggest news for me now is that

584
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:14,040
American Federation of Aging Research has gotten contribution from a single guy,

585
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:23,240
$2.8 million, to recruit 10,000 centenarians across the United States and their offspring and control.

586
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:29,720
And I think that this will give us such an acceleration of understanding longevity and

587
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:38,520
such an acceleration of getting drugs that probably are likely to work and also things

588
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:45,640
that we don't know yet. Like who knows, some of the things that we discovered are in pathways

589
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:53,080
that were not, they're not in our longevity lexicons.

590
01:07:53,080 --> 01:08:00,200
Nier, that's interesting. Only $2.8 million is required to recruit 10,000 centenarians plus

591
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:06,200
their offsprings plus appropriate controls? Well, let's see. Let's see where we get.

592
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,280
That seems like a very high ROI for that donor.

593
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:18,680
We hired two companies who have approaches, and actually there's a preliminary data,

594
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:25,160
a preliminary study to see what's the best way to approach these people, because it's all going to be

595
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,720
basically web-based, so we need their children and grandchildren, and we're going to send them

596
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:38,040
a swab so that they can do it with help and we'll get the swab at least as the first,

597
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:47,400
on the first pass, and be able to rapidly do the genetics and post it, by the way,

598
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:53,320
just immediately post it so people can start looking at it and making sense of the data.

599
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,760
And you're going to do whole genome sequence or exome?

600
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:04,680
Both. We're going to do mainly exome sequencing and maybe switch as the whole genome sequencing

601
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,920
price comes down, which it does. What's the current price of whole exome?

602
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:19,240
I don't totally remember that. The reason I don't remember is that our genotypes was done by

603
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:25,960
Regeneron, and they paid for that, so I don't remember how much it is now.

604
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,160
So let's talk about a thought experiment. You mentioned something earlier, which is what made

605
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:33,080
me think of this, right? So you said there's somebody out there maybe who's going to be 150

606
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,120
years old, one person that will concentrate all of these genes in perfection and they'll get to be

607
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:44,440
150. And if we could look at that person's genes, we might have an answer. I would push back and say,

608
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:51,560
or not, right? It might be that we're discounting the stochastic nature of this. And even if you

609
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:58,440
found that 150 year old person, and even if you identified which genes played a role,

610
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:03,480
the likelihood that you'll identify which environmental factors turned on those genes

611
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:11,320
or amplified some and attenuated others seems very low. So it begs this thought experiment,

612
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:24,040
right? If you took 10,000 identical people with whatever program you have of the perfect genotype.

613
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:31,480
So this is 10,000 people that have as many of the good genes as possible and is none of the bad

614
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:38,680
genes. We put them in a time capsule and we let them live their lives, but now we randomize them

615
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:46,040
to, I'm making this up, but three groups, right? One group is the base case. Go and live a normal

616
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:53,800
life. One group is the do everything bad that you possibly can. So I want you to start smoking when

617
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:01,000
you're 15. I want you drinking three drinks a day. Never exercise. You're only allowed to eat at

618
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,720
McDonald's. Oh wait, you go. And then the third group becomes the do everything right. We're

619
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:14,520
going to exercise. We're going to, we do the opposite. Give me your prediction of how long

620
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:22,040
each of those three groups lives. So Peter, I was trying to do things simple and you complicate me

621
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:31,080
again. And I'm taking back, first of all, when I said 150 human, I think the maximal of human

622
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:37,960
lifespan as a species for us is about 150 years, even if we argue, even if there's 122 somewhere.

623
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:50,120
And so I'm not sure. So this, and we die before the age of 80. So we're talking about 35 years

624
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:57,720
that we can realize it's a lot of years. We should realize that, but I think aging will improve by

625
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:06,600
other methods and mechanism that can break eventually this 115 years and maybe get us to 150.

626
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:14,360
The experiment, the experiment, they say, you know, when people are asking me, when will we leave 150?

627
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:23,160
I said, oh, in 150 years, because even if we start the experiment now, it'll take 150 years

628
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:29,800
to get there, right? We wouldn't know. So, so of course, this experiment, I don't know what.

629
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:37,560
I'll tell you what I'm getting at in the experiment. I want to understand how in the perfect genetic

630
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:45,160
makeup, how much can environment hurt or better? What is already a genetic lottery?

631
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:52,360
I totally understand. And I would take you back to the, and I meant to ask you that when you

632
01:12:52,360 --> 01:13:01,400
describe that ApoE4 was a 20 fold risk and became smaller and smaller, well, became smaller at whom

633
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:08,120
and how their lives were different than those that we knew 20 and 40 years ago that have the

634
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:14,120
ApoE4 genotype, right? Yes, it gets back to the point you raised about your grandfather versus

635
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:19,640
your father versus you. Right. The environment, both in what we do, both in medical treatment,

636
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:26,760
in surgery, in all those things. Absolutely. And so you're right. We think that there are

637
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:34,120
master switch to longevity and some of them we're doing with exercise and food, right?

638
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:41,640
So you don't really have a sense of how much longer the group three could live than the group

639
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:48,200
one when you basically put amazing genes in everybody. Yeah. You know, it's not the things

640
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,320
that I'm doing predictions on. No, it's just, it's interesting to me because where I'm really going

641
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:00,680
at a macro level is most people don't have these genes. So the only interesting question is the

642
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:07,880
contrapositive of that, which is once you have a sense of what that could be now for the rest of

643
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:16,120
us, the 9,000, 9,999 of us who don't have centenarian genes, how much does environment make a

644
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,320
difference? And I know the answer is significant, but I'm curious as to how much you think that

645
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:26,040
is. For me, it's more, you know, some centenarians are coming to me and said, okay,

646
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:38,360
what can you do for me? And I'm like, you're it. I don't do anything for you. So, so, so for me,

647
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:43,880
the question, if those centenarians are willing and I'm starting to exercise them and to change

648
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:50,840
their diet, am I going to kill them or, or, or, or help them? And I really, that's how I'm thinking

649
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:57,080
about it. And I don't know the answer. Fair enough. So Thomas Pearls has written quite a bit about

650
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:04,200
this idea of dividing centenarians into buckets. I think we have the escapers, the delayers and the

651
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:10,120
survivors. Are you familiar with that terminology? Yeah, yeah, of course. But you know,

652
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,720
I'll tell you two things about it. First of all, Tom Pearls and Paolo Sebastiani are,

653
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:23,560
did terrific job and we're collaborating a lot and, and, and, and they've been great. And I,

654
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:30,200
I don't hear Tom talking about it because this is the point. Some people,

655
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:37,960
average life expectancy is 80, right? Some people are going to be 81, 80 to 83. It's not that 100

656
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:45,560
years old is any special. You're picking at one time people who actually aged before or will age

657
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:53,560
later. And what we've done together to kind of overcome that is, and that's very important thing.

658
01:15:53,560 --> 01:16:02,520
We looked at our data in both studies and harmonized them and asked what is the health span

659
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:10,280
of centenarians versus by the way, cohort that lives now. It's not their cohort, their cohort died

660
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:16,600
before. And the answer is that it's not only that they live long, they get variety of age related

661
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:25,960
disease. 20, 30 years later, the people, the people, there are control group by age between 60 and 80

662
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:33,160
accumulate lots of diseases at 80. Only 10% of them don't have a disease in our centenarians

663
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:40,120
at after the age of 130% don't have a disease and are not treated with anything. But, but there's a

664
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:49,320
20, 30 years of health span. This is not really the important part, the important part that it's the

665
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:56,840
end of their life. They get sick and die. Some of them don't wake up in the morning. Okay. But they

666
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:03,560
have such a compression of morbidity. They are sick for months at the end of their life, unlike us

667
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:12,120
that are sick for years at the end of our lives. And I think this is, this is really the boundaries.

668
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:18,920
And so first of all, there is an example. There's example of humans that can live healthy and long

669
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:24,120
and have contraction of morbidity. And for me, it really says it's not that they didn't get older,

670
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:30,920
of course they got older, but at some point, they had great life, they have great health. And at some

671
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:37,320
point, they're checking out much quicker without diseases at the end of their lives. And this is

672
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:43,160
what we're trying to imitate. I completely agree. Although I'll throw a wrinkle into it near, which

673
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:49,800
is, could it be that, you know, the average person has their first heart attack at 70,

674
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:57,240
languishes with congestive heart failure for five years and dies at 75. The centenarian has their

675
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:03,720
first heart attack at 101. And, you know, they die six months later. Could it be that the reason that

676
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:09,160
the first guy languished for five years is he really technically had more resilience, given that

677
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:18,600
he was 25 years younger. And if so, you can now do a very grim thought experiment, which is,

678
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:26,520
we could easily replicate the health span, we could easily replicate the contraction of morbidity

679
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:32,600
and non-centenarians with a rule that says the moment you get a disease, you can't get a disease

680
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,800
you get a pillow over the head. Right? The moment you get your first heart attack, we're not going

681
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,760
to cat you, we're going to kill you. Right? I mean, I get a thought experiment, please, let's be clear.

682
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,560
But you would, you would immediately square everybody's longevity curve. For the most part,

683
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:54,120
you would contract that period of morbidity to replicate that of the centenarians, but you would

684
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:59,640
dramatically truncate lifespan as well now. And now you would even widen the gap between the

685
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:06,040
non-centenarian and the centenarian. So in my mind, it's been, it's very difficult to disentangle

686
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:14,360
the, the, the objective for someone like me, which is, I do want to lengthen lifespan, I do want to

687
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:22,760
delay the onset of chronic disease. And I want to compress the period of morbidity, not by having

688
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:29,560
you die quicker, but by having you live better, longer, if that makes sense. Absolutely. It makes

689
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:35,880
sense, Peter. And of course, your, your point is very important, but it's like, it's like the

690
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:45,640
podcast last week on the, on the COVID, you had a scientist and the advocates, right? That's how

691
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,120
you call them the scientists and advocates, which by the way, our mutual friend, David Allison,

692
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:56,360
that's, he was really the one who I think made me first realize we need to talk about these two

693
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,800
things totally separately. Absolutely true. And, and, and what you did, you really stopped me from

694
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:08,040
being advocate because you're absolutely right. I think that the reason that centenarians are dying

695
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:16,440
so fast is because they are already frail, they are aging, and so they are less resilient. But

696
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:23,800
on the other hand, without diseases, I mean, some of them are working as hedge fund managers until

697
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:31,320
107. Some of them are painting, as long as they have no pain and mobility, their life is good,

698
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:37,880
not like when they were 20, but their life is good. So I totally agree. But as an advocate,

699
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:44,920
I wanted to hide that, Peter, I didn't want to, but, but, but you're right. Why, why they are dying?

700
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:52,280
But you know what, I think it's still important for people. And I think this concept is probably true.

701
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:57,320
If you prevent aging and age related disease, you're going to compress morbidity too. One of

702
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,640
the biggest challenges I have with health span is I don't think that that we have great ways of

703
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:07,480
describing this in medicine. I think there's several issues with it. The first is our definitions,

704
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,360
I think, are not wonderful, right? We talk about freedom from disability and disease,

705
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:17,800
but that doesn't really capture it. I can tell you a lot of people who don't qualify for having

706
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,400
disability or disease, but their health span is still poor. And by the way, this gets, this

707
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,960
completely excludes a very important element of health span, which I think is emotional health.

708
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:33,080
So let's put that aside because it's not particularly age dependent. And it's, it's outside

709
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,760
of the purview, what we're talking about today. But if you just limit it to physical and cognitive,

710
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:45,560
in fact, if you just limit it to physical, right, you can, you can have people who can still carry

711
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:51,720
on activities of daily living, but one of them has a VO two max of 50 mils per minute per gig.

712
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:57,080
And the other is 30 mils per minute per gig. By the way, neither of those people would ever qualify

713
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:03,400
as disabled, because whether you're at 30 or 50 in VO two max, you can still do any activity of

714
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:10,120
daily living. But one of those people can clearly get more out of life, right? You can take someone

715
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:17,240
who can, you know, has the grip strength to hang on to a bar for 30 seconds versus hang on to a bar

716
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:24,600
for two minutes. Both of those people will see no immediate difference in their day to day activities,

717
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:32,040
but one person can do far more should they choose to, you know, one person can sit on the floor for

718
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:38,840
half an hour and play with kids and feel nothing. Another person, their back will ache for the rest

719
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:47,000
of the day. Neither of those people are debilitated or disabled. And therefore, health by health span,

720
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,160
you know, by traditional health span metrics, they're both equal, but they're nowhere near equal.

721
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:57,560
And so that's problem one that I have with the way we as a community talk about health span. The second

722
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,720
thing is nothing that you or I learned in our medical training even remotely prepares us for

723
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:11,560
how to help people be truly stronger late in life. It just wasn't part of our training, right? Like

724
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:21,480
there's nothing about that. So I guess my point here is it's hard for me to really interpret the

725
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:29,480
data and get at something I'm very interested in, which is do centenarians truly have better health

726
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:38,200
span or are they just dying later? And, you know, for the most part, they have this period of

727
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:44,760
compressed morbidity. So it looks like they have better health span. But do we really know that,

728
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:50,760
I mean, I think they do based on the literature, like I think a 90 year old who will become a

729
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:59,160
centenarian is functioning more like a 70 year old who will not. But it's still very difficult to

730
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:03,960
quantify. I don't think we have great metrics here. Do you disagree with me? No, I don't think that

731
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:13,640
health span is well defined. Definitely. But there so there so there are two comments that I will make

732
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:25,880
for the NIH right back to TAA. For them, what is aging is if we can prevent diseases,

733
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:36,520
that's their measurements, right? Which is not satisfying, not to geriatrician and not to

734
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:44,360
physician. OK, but that's how you get drug approved. For the economist, there are two issues.

735
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:52,360
One is what we're counting as the cost of medical cost, the medical cost of the last two years of

736
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:59,080
life. By the way, in centenarians, the CDC has data in centenarians, the last two years life

737
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:07,480
are third the cost in 100 years old and when you die in 70. OK. That is fascinating. I mean, to me,

738
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:13,480
that is something that speaks to what we're really aspiring to. And actually, that statistic

739
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:22,440
captures much more about the quality of a person's life. Right. But the David, sorry, Andrew Scott

740
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:30,920
had a paper in nature. I think I read it. Yes, he sent it to me. And he describes an economical term

741
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,400
that's called the value. And by the way, it's very hard if you want to know more about this paper,

742
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,840
we should talk. It's it. I had to sit with him in order to understand what he was saying, but

743
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:47,160
basically saying, hey, if you increase the health span of someone, it's not only medical cost,

744
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:55,240
because this guy is going to travel and spend money traveling and buy gadgets and buy houses

745
01:25:55,240 --> 01:26:01,400
for his kids. You know, it's going to be their value of the person life is going to be increased.

746
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,600
And all of a sudden and some of those people, by the way, are going to still work. Exactly. Right.

747
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:12,440
They're not just playing golf. Right. So the economical value is is is is huge. So you can

748
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:17,320
do it economically. And the third thing I wanted to tell you is this story

749
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:25,800
about the real story about this hundred and two year old guy that I met. And I'm sitting and

750
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:32,360
talking with him and he's the nicest guy I've ever met. OK, he's so considerate. He's so he's

751
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:41,800
thinking about life in such a nice way. Nothing bad about his daughter-in-law. Right. And and so

752
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:47,240
I'm spending time with him. I'm going out of the room and I'm bumping into his son, who's 80

753
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:52,920
years old. Right. Yeah. And I'm telling this 80 years old what I'm telling you, you know, your

754
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:59,160
father is just the nicest guy I've ever met. So he looks in my eyes and says, you should have seen

755
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:07,880
the son of a bitch when he was my age. He was a terrible, terrible person. So then I realize and

756
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:14,760
you'll see why it's connected to what you just told me. Then I realized that because we wrote

757
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:19,160
paper about the personality of centenarians and you have to be positive and stuff like that. But

758
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,640
apparently he became positive only when he was already years old, not when he was 80 years old.

759
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:30,520
And then then you see papers like in University of Pennsylvania, they took two groups of people,

760
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:37,640
young and old people and show them bed slides, you know, cockroaches in pizza and good slides

761
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:44,040
like islands in the Caribbean. And they asked them to repeat what they've seen. And the young people

762
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:52,680
knew, remembered a lot from both bad and good. The old people remember less, but mainly the good

763
01:27:52,680 --> 01:28:00,120
things. OK, so I'm waiting for this part in my physiology that I remember only the good thing.

764
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:08,360
But what I'm telling you is that think of the complexity now, right? Because your brain age,

765
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:15,240
you also retired, you lost your spouse, you moved from independence or you moved to somewhere else,

766
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:23,400
you moved several times, you get to 100 years old. So apparently there's changes not only in your

767
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:29,560
environment, but in your physiology where life can still look good to you. Is this wrong?

768
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,320
Actually, that's such an interesting point near. I know you mentioned already that a number of the

769
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:39,480
centenarians in your cohort were not married. What fraction were married?

770
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,240
No, my centenarians have to have offspring.

771
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,960
OK, so all of them were at least had a partner.

772
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,960
At least married for a while.

773
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,360
OK, and then what fraction of them have lost their spouse?

774
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:57,800
A lot of them, a lot of them, most of them, most of them. We do have.

775
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,040
And sorry, one other question here. What fraction of them have also lost children?

776
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,080
Also a lot of them.

777
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:09,800
This gets to something very interesting. Someone asked me once at a dinner party,

778
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,800
if you could wave a magic wand, how long would you want to live?

779
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,560
And I said, not that long, truthfully, because unless I could wave that magic

780
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,040
wand for the people around me, I think it would be an awful life.

781
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:28,840
Could you imagine if I waved a wand and said near, you have immortality and not just

782
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,760
immortality. I'm going to let you preserve your quality of life today.

783
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:38,680
So as smart and healthy and able as you are now, I'm going to let you do this for the next 500 years.

784
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:44,360
I would view that as an awful curse. Think of, you know, you'd have to watch your wife die.

785
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:48,600
You'd have to watch your children die, your grandchildren die. Sure, you could remarry and

786
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:53,400
do it all over again, but then they're going to die. So, you know, that's a silly thought

787
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:57,320
experiment, but I also think it gets to something I've never really considered with

788
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:06,120
respect to actual centenarians, which is the price of being a centenarian is giving up and losing

789
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,760
most of your friends. Right.

790
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,520
And how many funerals do you go to?

791
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:17,720
The most common thing that centenarian tells me, the thing that underlined their age is when

792
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,960
the children of their friends were long gone, the children of their friends started to die.

793
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:30,040
That's for them, kind of what's going on. We're losing now the second generation. You know,

794
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:38,680
what's coming next. You're absolutely right. I'm thinking about it for immortalists, right?

795
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:45,000
So immortalists, they have 12 billion years. We don't know, but one of the estimates,

796
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,160
12 billion years for this planet. I'm a little tired from some of the shit now.

797
01:30:53,240 --> 01:31:00,680
Really, 12 billion years, January 6th. I don't know, you know, wars and stuff.

798
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:09,240
It's true. But what I try to tell you in a different words is that those centenarians

799
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:17,000
have been adapting not only because what got them to be centenarians, but because of physiology

800
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:26,040
of aging that allowed them to harbor and maybe to put in compartments, lots of their stuff.

801
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,080
Yeah, lots of grief.

802
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,840
And it's not that you come to centenarians and they want to tell you, first of all,

803
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:35,720
about the spouse that they lost. That's not how they are talking to you. They're talking to you

804
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:41,800
about where they went and what they do and they're going to a concert and their grandchild is coming

805
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:47,560
to visit them. At least the centenarian, you know, it's the centenarians in my study, right?

806
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,000
So it's not all.

807
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,400
Look, NetNet, I think living to 100 with preserved health span would be a wonderful thing. And even

808
01:31:55,400 --> 01:32:02,600
if it meant you lost a spouse, a child, it means you probably have three generations of people you

809
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:10,040
know. One of the questions I love asking my patients is how many of your great grandparents

810
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:14,440
can you name? So we all have eight great grandparents and I say, tell me the names of them.

811
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:23,160
I've only had one patient who could tell me two of them. Most people can't tell me a thing about one.

812
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:29,960
I can't. I didn't even meet two of my grandparents. They died, you know, so young.

813
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:35,240
So if you think about that for a moment, and the reason I ask my patients this, by the way,

814
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:39,640
it has nothing to do with living longer. It's more about living better. It's basically,

815
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:45,720
it's a way to remind everyone, myself included, that we're not that important. Like, no matter,

816
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:49,960
you know what I mean? Like my point being is my great grandchildren will never know who I am.

817
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,080
Maybe in the age where they have video, they'll see a video of me or something, but like I'm not

818
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,240
going to be an important part of their life. Meaning the only people who I matter to,

819
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:04,440
are very narrow and close to me now. So let's not lose sight of that.

820
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:12,600
But these centenarians have a gift, right? Which is their great grandchildren will know them. And

821
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,480
when you use this example, when you can go to concerts with your great grandchildren,

822
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:25,160
that's amazing. When you could take a vacation with your great grandchild, and you're not only

823
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,960
able to give them money for college, but you go to their graduation, think about the implication

824
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,960
of how much of their life you've been a part of. So the flip side of everything I just said is,

825
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:40,520
I've never really met somebody who's dying at the age of 75. And that's a phenotype I've seen an

826
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:47,320
awful lot in my training, who didn't wish to have another year of life. It could, if it could be had

827
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:57,800
at a higher quality, which now brings this whole discussion full circle. 9999 out of 10,000 of us

828
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:05,160
will not live to 100, directionally speaking. But if we want to live an extra year, or five years,

829
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:10,360
what is the most important lesson we can take away from the centenarian?

830
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:18,520
That we can actually do something about. I want to start with what you mentioned before,

831
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:26,840
one of my darkest day in research, when Jay Leno in the Tonight Show said, you know, there's those

832
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:33,320
people at Einstein and they said the secret for longevity is don't exercise, don't, you know,

833
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:39,880
be obese, don't do. And you know what he said, if you die, you don't care anyhow. Right. And,

834
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:47,800
and that was the wrong lesson from the centenarian study. If you, if you're going to be centenarian,

835
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,960
maybe it's not important. By the way, it could be important for centenarians. Right. I mean,

836
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:58,680
this woman that I have that smoked for 90 years and died at 110, I just wonder, wouldn't she be

837
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:08,440
the next Madame Clement without smoking? So the lesson for most of us is still, right, exercise

838
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:14,200
and nutrition, whatever it means to everyone and everything else that you give, right? That's,

839
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:19,560
that's the lesson. And it's not the lesson from centenarians. The lesson from centenarians is that

840
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:28,120
there are longevity genes that could be translated into drugs. And I believe that they could afford

841
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:37,720
years of health spend, however we want to define that. And, and, and, and, and that's really what

842
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:46,280
I'm trying to, to say that is not an emotional part, but, but a clinical part. Would you agree

843
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:53,320
with my takeaway from this cohort, which is the, because the single most important lesson I glean

844
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:58,200
from everything we've said, and in addition to lots that we haven't said that you and I have talked

845
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:03,640
about elsewhere or that my own work has, you know, pointed me to based on my study of this problem,

846
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:13,000
their superpower is simply delaying the onset of bad things. Like bad things just happen to them

847
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,840
20 to 25 years later. So it's not that they don't get heart attacks. They just don't get them when

848
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:25,240
they're 65. It's not that they don't get cancer. They just don't get it when they're 60. It's not

849
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:33,000
that they don't even get dementia. They just don't get it when they're 75. And when the last time I

850
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,560
looked at the distribution of death for centenarians, it was shockingly similar to that of

851
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:44,920
non-centenarians with a couple of differences. They tended to have a little more atherosclerosis,

852
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:49,800
a little more heart attacks, a little less Alzheimer's disease, and I think a little bit

853
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:57,880
more pneumonia. But directionally, they had the same actuarial table of death as people dying in

854
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:06,440
their 80s. It was just a time shift. In fact, I reviewed the paper from Germany where they looked

855
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:13,480
at pathology. Okay. It's a pathological. They looked at a thousand centenarians that over the

856
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:19,480
years died in their homes. And they're right because in the hospitals, we kill them in other

857
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:26,920
ways. So died in their homes versus thousand. I'm not sure about the numbers of other people

858
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:32,920
that died at their homes. And basically the paper was funny because the title was like,

859
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:39,240
there's nothing special about the centenarians. They're dying for the same thing. But 30 years

860
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:46,920
later, okay, they missed the point. It was like a negative study. But you're right. You're right.

861
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:56,200
They're kind of dying from the same thing much later, much later on. So you can look at it about

862
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:02,280
what you said, the resiliency that got them there, the resiliency for anything that detect them to

863
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:09,560
get them there, or the fact that their aging was slow. And so what's the takeaway for us? To me,

864
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:15,320
the takeaway for us as physicians or people who want to have an extra five years of life or 10

865
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:21,240
years of life, even if we can't have an extra 20, is nothing matters more than prevention of

866
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:27,000
chronic disease. And by the way, you don't get to prevent it once you have your heart attack.

867
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:34,520
Secondary prevention is not prevention. We're talking ultra, ultra, ultra primary prevention.

868
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:42,920
And if health span is something that the medical system hasn't been poised to teach, ultra primary

869
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:50,200
prevention is also something that we haven't really been prepared to teach. So okay, let's

870
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:57,800
pivot to another topic that we visited last time. But I think so much has happened in the interim,

871
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:09,400
which is metformin. I probably get an equal number of questions near about the following three things.

872
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:17,880
So the frequency of this would be several times a week, a patient or a friend is asking me about

873
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:28,120
metformin, rapamycin, or some combination of NR, NAD, or NMN. Somehow those three things seem to

874
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:37,400
rise to the level of everybody's curiosity when it comes to Giro protection. Let's talk a little

875
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:42,600
bit about all of them. But let's focus on metformin. So for folks coming to this who

876
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,640
have heard of metformin, because I think at this point, many people have, but don't know much more

877
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:53,080
than that. Can you give a brief background of what metformin is? How long it's been around,

878
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:57,640
what it's historically been used for? And then of course, we'll talk a little bit more about why

879
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:02,680
we're going to talk about it. Oh, so boring. I also get those questions. What's the distribution,

880
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:06,920
by the way, what do you mostly get asked about while we're on that subject? The most common

881
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:15,560
question is, I hear you're doing metformin study. Can I volunteer? Can I be, can you assure me I'm

882
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:20,760
not on placebo? Yeah, I was just about to say, are you sure you want to volunteer? Okay. So,

883
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:29,800
so, by the way, I'll tell you something really interesting. I'm not, because I'm leading this

884
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:36,440
study, I'm not pushing metformin. Okay. Again, the difference between advocate and scientist,

885
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:43,480
okay. I'm doing this study. Okay. I believe in that, but I'm doing this study. So, I cannot tell

886
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:48,520
you that it's good. So, I'm not going to prescribe to anyone, even to my friends. I'm not going to

887
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:56,920
prescribe, but I have a method that works 100% of the time. There are two papers that I wrote,

888
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:06,440
one, I think in 2016 about metformin and TAME and the clinical data, and one in 2020 about actually

889
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:12,440
the mechanisms of action that was in cell, both of them were in cell metabolism, but the mechanism

890
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:18,760
of action, the fact that metformin actually hits all the hallmarks of aging, miraculously. I'll

891
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:28,120
explain it later. And I'm saying to those people, send it to your doctors and say, I asked the doctor,

892
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:33,720
what do you think about me taking metformin? And they're one of two things that always happen.

893
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:40,840
One could be that the doctors read the paper and said, oh shit, I should be on metformin myself.

894
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:47,720
Of course, I'll give metformin. Or the other is the doctor said, you know, I'm busy, but you know,

895
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:52,600
metformin is a safe drug and stuff. Let me just give them metformin. And that's the end of that.

896
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:00,040
And that's 100% success. Everybody can get metformin. Now I know that I'll get emails asking

897
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:05,080
for those papers. I'll put it in a box. We will absolutely link to those papers in the show notes.

898
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:13,320
But I think what people don't realize is that metformin is an extract of the French lilac. So

899
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:17,720
some people say it's nutraceutical. It is modified and it is a drug.

900
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:23,400
The three best drugs in the world are nutraceuticals, rapamycin, statins, metformin. There you go.

901
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:30,680
Right. But you need prescriptions. But also, look, one of the modifications was

902
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:37,640
metformin. It's an early form of metformin that kind of was a little too potent.

903
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:44,120
Too potent on the mitochondria and caused the trouble. But we're over that for 80 years.

904
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:54,200
But metformin was used initially to treat the flu and malaria and inflammatory diseases.

905
01:42:54,920 --> 01:43:01,240
And it's at that time that people noticed that people with type 2 diabetes have lower glucose

906
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:06,920
when they took metformin. So the whole metformin moved to diabetes.

907
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,560
And that was about the 1950s or 60s, right?

908
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:20,600
Right. 1950s and 60s. Interestingly, in the United States, it was approved only in 1993 or so.

909
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:31,800
I came as a fellow to Ralph de Frontso at Yale. And my mission was to describe the

910
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:38,600
metformin, the mechanisms of action of metformin in humans. You know, I did insulin clamps and I'm

911
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:44,520
the first to describe that metformin decreased the patix-lose production rather than increased insulin

912
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:50,360
sensitivity in the periphery. It's serendipitous. I didn't think about it as aging. I came to Ralph

913
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:56,360
de Frontso and I did aging in another way to insulin resistant and aging, but not metformin.

914
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:02,760
But the point is there are billions, billions years of use. Remember, every patient takes it

915
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,800
for years and there are people on metformin who are 90 years old. I actually know them.

916
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:17,480
So people, there are billions use of year and I cannot think of a drug with better safety record.

917
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:24,040
If there are any side effects to metformin, they happen usually in the first week of use.

918
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:30,440
And that's even if you didn't take them the way you should, which is small doses with food.

919
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:37,320
And when I say with food after the first bite, when your stomach is full and then usually there

920
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:44,120
is no side effects, but three to 5% of people and maybe more with elderly have diarrhea that

921
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:53,080
doesn't stop. And we basically stop metformin in those people, whether there's, well,

922
01:44:54,600 --> 01:45:01,240
yeah, to stop diarrhea. We don't know if there is something. By the way, in TAME study,

923
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:08,440
we're going to follow those patients that were sensitive to metformin and see if there's

924
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,960
something unique about them. That's one of the things we hope to do.

925
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:18,120
Well, we're definitely going to talk about TAME. So let's pick up the story 10 years ago.

926
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:26,680
All of a sudden, people start to notice things. People start to notice that diabetics who take

927
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:34,760
metformin when compared to diabetics who don't take metformin do better. And when I say do better,

928
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:41,720
I mean they have lower mortality from all causes and lower mortality from very specific causes.

929
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:49,720
And if you look at it in some extremes, if you compare the patients taking metformin

930
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:56,920
to the patients taking insulin, the difference could be 50, 80% difference in mortality.

931
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:04,040
Is that a fair assessment of where curiosity began to peak that this wasn't just a good

932
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:08,440
diabetes drug, but it might have some protection against aging?

933
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:14,200
Yes, absolutely. When one drug, we should just know that's the base of

934
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:25,000
gerotherapeutic. It has to be a drug that has effect beyond its disease, whether it's on other

935
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:32,200
diseases, whether it's on overall mortality, not a disease-specific mortality. That's when you have

936
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:39,640
to think this drug is a gerotherapeutics. And that's exactly where metformin fell.

937
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:47,560
And I would just add one thing. Look, some of those studies are association studies,

938
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:54,600
but some of the studies were clinical studies. The diabetes prevention program, the DPP,

939
01:46:55,400 --> 01:47:03,080
is an NIH-funded study where metformin was one arm. There was also an arm of lifestyle changes.

940
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:10,920
Both of them were preventing diabetes in about 30%. And by the way, the study was stopped early

941
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:17,400
because it was significant after four years, although the study was funded for five years.

942
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:19,960
The UKPDS and many studies-

943
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:23,400
No, I do want to talk about that study near, and some of this, of course, you and I have

944
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,560
already talked about, but I think it's just good for people to be able to hear our discussions on

945
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:32,440
this. One of the challenges of these studies, and I think this is frankly true of every single

946
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:38,040
study I've looked at for metformin, is when you squint your eye at the study, there's always a

947
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:45,720
problem. And in the case of the DPP, the problem is the patients in the metformin arm could easily

948
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:52,600
fall out of that arm and therefore not be counted. So if they progressed to a need for medication

949
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:57,480
beyond metformin, or if they couldn't tolerate metformin, or if they were not compliant with

950
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:04,040
metformin, they were no longer counted. And so when you compare, and this is true not just of the DPP,

951
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:10,600
but of course, when you compare the metformin patients to the other patients who are taking

952
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:17,160
other diabetes drugs, you always have this potential confounder, which is you are

953
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:24,120
disproportionately selecting the healthiest people, which are the people who, A, can be

954
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:29,560
compliant with medications, which might say much more about their behaviors outside of medications,

955
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:36,040
whose diabetes is maybe just mild enough that it's always kept at bay with metformin,

956
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:44,360
never requiring other medications, including insulin. So am I correct in saying we don't,

957
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:50,600
to date, and tame we will talk about in a moment, but we don't to date have any clean example of a

958
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:59,080
study that demonstrates metformins, zero protection. Look, you're right. You can say it on many studies,

959
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:04,920
but it's certainly true with diabetes. Diabetes is a problem because it's a progressive disease,

960
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:12,520
no matter what. And you can go and go back to the data and show whether the people were metforming

961
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:19,560
from the beginning versus other have done better and whether it stops. And there's a lot of things.

962
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:25,480
But first of all, you're right. You're also right about we had this discussion about the mortality

963
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:32,600
data, and you pointed out that maybe the control, we're not controlled enough for getting them out

964
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:39,160
for some reason. You watch them all the time. You're absolutely right. Even the clinical

965
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:47,320
studies are not perfect studies, but there are still enough of clinical studies or small studies

966
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:56,120
that gives you the confidence. So for example, there are two studies on people with mild cognitive

967
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:01,560
impairment that were treated with metformin, one for half a year and one for one year. And some of

968
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:09,240
the outcomes have changed. And there is no difference in how they were treated. In other

969
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:15,320
words, they didn't have diabetes, so it's not that they switched to other medications. So there are

970
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:29,240
lots of examples like that. But you're right. If this was compelling on its own, you could argue we

971
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:40,520
wouldn't have to have TAME even, right? And really, TAME is not that there were not studies for each

972
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:49,400
one of the diseases, but there were no studies to be agnostic of the diseases. We don't care. Look,

973
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:55,240
we're targeting aging. We don't care what disease you have. And we don't care which disease you're

974
01:50:55,240 --> 01:51:00,680
going to take to get. If you're obese and your mother's diabetes, you're going to get diabetes

975
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:08,680
next. We have to think in neuroscience that aging is going to drive your next disease. And therefore

976
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:15,000
it's the cluster that is going to count. And we're counting the clusters. By the way,

977
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:22,600
we had this discussion about mortality. Mortality, you get a point for mortality,

978
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:28,200
just like you get a point for a disease. And the important thing of the cluster

979
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:36,120
is that we cannot do TAME study. Imagine we do a TAME study, and in two years,

980
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:46,120
cardiovascular disease comes up as significant. As in significant reduction of cardiovascular

981
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:51,000
mortality. And the FDA will say, hey, we have to stop the study because we cannot go with the

982
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:59,320
study when with placebo, right? And it will ruin it for us. So the whole problem of the statistics

983
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:06,600
of TAME is to make sure that we're not getting to any significance in any disease, just to trends.

984
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:15,800
And the only way to stop, by the way, the one way to stop the study is if mortality is significant.

985
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:22,120
That will trigger a stoppage of the study. Otherwise, what will stop the study is the integral

986
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:28,280
approach of the cluster. Right. So statistically, you just can't, your biggest mistake here is

987
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:35,080
overpowering the study for mortality. And therefore, appropriately powering the study

988
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:39,480
for subs, subsets of mortality. Yes. Is that is that a safe assessment?

989
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:43,960
Subsets of mortality, you mean diseases. Disease specific mortality is what I mean. Yes.

990
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,800
Well, let's talk a little bit about TAME. This is something you and I spoke about,

991
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:58,120
God, two years ago. So this is a study that is going to look at people who do not have type 2

992
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:05,560
diabetes. Right. It's an exclusion criteria. And they are over the age of 65? 65 to 79.

993
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:12,680
Okay, so 65 to 79. No diabetes, no type 2 diabetes, any other exclusion criteria?

994
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:17,560
Yes, but it's not important for our discussion. So if you have cancer in the last year,

995
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:23,480
okay, things like that. Yeah, very specific. If you had the heart attack in the last three months.

996
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:28,600
But again, these people are going to be taking statins, they're going to be taking medication

997
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:32,840
for blood pressure, some of them will be overweight, some of them will be normal weight, presumably.

998
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:38,360
Right. The point the point here, though, is that, look, we don't want to recruit a bunch of

999
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:42,280
centenarians to get in our study. You don't want to be you don't want to recruit future centenarians here.

1000
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:47,000
You're not going to get an answer. So they have to have something, okay, they have to have,

1001
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:55,720
for example, walking speed less than six meter, you know, per second is is an inclusion criteria.

1002
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:00,040
You have to have something. I see. So you don't want you don't want exceptionally fit people in

1003
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:05,400
this group. Right. You know, it's almost like you want to take the patient population that

1004
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:12,360
PredaMed started with, because this was a primary prevention study for cardiovascular disease

1005
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:16,760
that found a statistical significant difference in under five years, I think it was four and a half

1006
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:22,760
years, they expected to go for seven. So so it's you're really looking for that type of population,

1007
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:27,480
you you really do want people who are going to I mean, it's morbid to say this, but you're looking

1008
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:32,200
for people whose risk of death in the next five years is is high enough that you're going to move

1009
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:39,640
the needle. Now, the the risk of that is you get a negative study, which means there is no difference

1010
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:45,960
in all cause mortality, or even disease specific mortality. And the counter argument might be you

1011
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:52,520
started too late. You know, that's like applying the brakes on a car that's driving towards a cliff

1012
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:58,840
when it's only 20 feet from the cliff. Should this be a lot longer study, where you start this at

1013
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:05,640
people when they're 50. And your your five year mortality expectation is very low. Again, I'm not

1014
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:09,880
saying this can be done, because that's a very expensive study, but it is a risk here. Correct.

1015
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:18,280
There are two arguments here. You know, first of all, we needed to do look to start to start a study

1016
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:27,000
at 50, where you have to show mortality is a 20 year study, we cannot afford it, right. So we needed

1017
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,680
to start it when people are starting to accumulate disease in order for us to have lots of events.

1018
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:43,720
Our hypothesis is that the the aging part of your biology doesn't stop working when you had your

1019
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:51,160
first disease, it's still going to get your next disease. Okay. And if we think biologically like

1020
01:55:51,160 --> 01:56:00,600
that, we should be able to intervene, as we do with animals quite late also. So that's that's one

1021
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:07,560
thing. The second thing is, there are metformin studies which included elderly people, for example,

1022
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:20,600
the DPP, the DPP, by the way, got 20% funding from the NIA in order to include 20% of the subjects

1023
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:28,120
over the age of 65, which they didn't, they had 20% over the age of 60, but there's still people

1024
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:38,920
over the age of 65. And their results were similar in prevention diabetes to younger people. So it's

1025
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:46,520
an example, but we have several other studies that tells us that metformin will still target aging,

1026
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:52,440
even if you started it, it's not it's not that the first disease canceled. Yeah, it just means

1027
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:58,600
that you have a lower period to apply the brakes on. And it suggests that if if tame shows a

1028
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:06,840
reduction in all cause mortality in a subset of people so old, in quotes, because when I say so

1029
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:13,800
old, meaning in five years is really what I'm saying. It would suggest biologically that there

1030
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:18,280
would be a benefit to starting sooner. But of course, then the question goes back to our original

1031
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:26,520
discussion, how soon? So Peter, you you you said an end point of mortality in tame. There could be

1032
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:32,200
only trend of mortality. So I'm sorry, I misunderstood. What is what is the primary

1033
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:40,440
outcome of tame? It's the cluster of bunch of cardiovascular cancer, cognitive and mortality.

1034
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:47,080
It's the cluster. Okay, you get one point for each one. I see. So let's define them again. So

1035
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:52,440
you get one point if you die. Right. For everyone. You get one point if you have a major adverse

1036
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:58,040
cardiac event. Right. One point if you have a cancer occurrence or recurrence cancer, right.

1037
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:05,560
And an MCI or dementia. Got it. Do you have any points for health span outcomes such as frailty,

1038
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:14,520
falling, breaking hips? This is in the 70 million program. Okay. So let me explain. We would like

1039
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:19,720
to start longitudinal study where we capture a lot of the other health span issues, you know,

1040
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:29,240
hospitalization and function and depression and all that. And we are still powered to do it at the

1041
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:37,080
end of the study or as the study goes on, we probably wouldn't have money to do it longitudinally

1042
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:43,080
through the whole study. But we have power at the end of the study to see if there are difference in

1043
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:50,520
frailty, etc. Just a statistical question. Why is mortality given equal weighting to disease

1044
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:56,840
occurrence? Is there a reason that mortality wouldn't be three points to one point for MCI,

1045
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:04,680
mace and cancer? Well, it was question for each one of them. And we decided just that

1046
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:14,360
we cannot rationalize that everyone is an outcome. You know, we basically said those are the outcomes.

1047
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:19,400
We don't know which one you're going, you're going to get an outcome, you're going to get the point

1048
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:26,840
for that. All right. It's by the way, it's the time until of course, right? Yeah. You're moving,

1049
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:35,000
you're moving health, health span. Now earlier you spoke about how animal models are not really

1050
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,800
great for Alzheimer's disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease, which I think any

1051
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:47,880
listener of this podcast is well aware of those limitations. But you note that look, animal models

1052
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:54,040
are pretty darn good for aging, given how conserved it is. And yet one of the challenges

1053
01:59:54,040 --> 02:00:00,440
metformin has had is in animal models. Now, Rich Miller was on this podcast a while ago. We spoke

1054
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:08,920
about the ITP where metformin was successful in the ITP when combined with rapamycin, but alone

1055
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:18,200
was not. Again, I think the ITP is a very rigorous type of experiment. I know you've

1056
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:23,080
probably thought a lot about this. What explanation do you think exists for why

1057
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:29,000
metformin did not succeed in isolation in the ITP study, which I'll just take for a moment to explain

1058
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,240
to people the ITP. If you haven't listened to that podcast with Rich Miller, you should go and do so.

1059
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:38,840
We'll link to the appropriate section here. But these are studies that are conducted using

1060
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:46,760
a particularly good model of mouse that is kind of less troubled by the usual difficulties mice

1061
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:51,880
studies have. It's also done independently at three separate laboratories concurrently. So I

1062
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:57,320
think those would be some of the... And then the final thing is they look at all-cause mortality.

1063
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:04,600
So tell us why you think that we could be misled by the ITP.

1064
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:14,760
Let me make a big picture statement now. It is possible that some of the drugs that had mild

1065
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:22,600
effect in ITP will have much bigger effect in humans. And vice versa. Maybe rapamycin is going

1066
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:30,360
to be not as effective in humans as it is in animals. We just have to accept that we're all

1067
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:39,080
Rich Miller if it's not true in mice, it's not true. Well, I don't think Rich says, by the way.

1068
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:44,760
I've never heard Rich say that. I think Rich just says, this is what it is in this model.

1069
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:49,800
I'm kidding. He started saying that initially and he took it back, of course.

1070
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:56,120
I think one of the problems with animals is the dosage that they are using.

1071
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:06,280
The dosage in animal where you were used, if you look back, as 0.1% in a solution to 1%.

1072
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:14,760
1% is deadly. Because, listen, metformin, after all, is a weak cyanide.

1073
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:23,720
Okay. It binds to a complex in the mitochondria. It probably affects complex one and also complex

1074
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:29,720
three. It's not totally clear, but if you give too much, there is a trade-off. So you have to give

1075
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:38,920
right. And I think that the studies in animals, except, by the way, mice, it's not true for

1076
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:44,520
nematodes and there are several other fish. There are several other animals that live longer,

1077
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:51,560
and healthier with metformin. But I don't think that 0.1% is really the appropriate dose.

1078
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:55,560
What do you think is the... So you think...

1079
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:58,120
I don't know. I don't know. There's no dose response.

1080
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:01,080
But you were saying 1% is clearly problematic.

1081
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:07,080
Yeah. I think 0.2% maybe will be better if we want to optimize that.

1082
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:12,120
Because there's a paper that gets a lot of attention. I think it's 2013, the Raphael

1083
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:18,840
Di Cabo paper, which gets touted as, oh, look at metformin. I got to be honest with you.

1084
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:23,960
If you look at that paper, I don't know how the editors let the title of that paper slide with

1085
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:30,840
the actual data. I mean, let's call a spade a spade. You had two groups of mice, one of them

1086
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:39,000
getting 0.1%, one of them getting 1%. The group getting 1% were assassinated, to your point.

1087
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:45,560
These animals were killed by the toxicity of metformin. The group getting 0.1%

1088
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:51,560
lived a staggering 4% longer. Right.

1089
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:59,640
It was basically a null trial that was touted as the definitive animal study for why metformin

1090
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:05,160
works. It was kind of like... It's like an Onion article when you dissociate the title from the

1091
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:12,280
actual data. Right. Look, the average when I took and make a table with all the longevity data,

1092
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:19,720
then the effect of metformin across studies were between 7% and 10%, not a huge effect.

1093
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:24,920
Well, that's pretty good. 7% to 10% in animal studies, if it's consistent, would be pretty good.

1094
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:29,160
But the effect, the nice thing with metformin, the effects on healthspan is much...

1095
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:33,720
What are the healthspan effects besides the metabolic effects?

1096
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:39,640
Cancer. Say more. Prevention of cancers.

1097
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:44,600
But isn't that effectively already captured in lifespan?

1098
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:52,120
Rich Miller will give you a better thing. I mean, animals... Look, the problem for us with animals

1099
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:59,080
is... By the way, it's the problem with centenarians also. They die with cancers. We don't know if they

1100
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,600
die from cancer. They die from cancers. Right. It's like the prostate cancer issue.

1101
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:09,240
Right. Cancer is several... As much as we say in humans, it's cardiovascular disease. Cancer is

1102
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:16,120
probably the leading disease for that for animals. And it's true. For sure. So the other point is...

1103
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:23,720
Which I think I'm trying to get to the bottom of that, but when you gave metformin to animals in

1104
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:32,920
the ITP, in two centers, they had 10%. One was 11% and one was 9% increase in longevity.

1105
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:46,040
But Rich Miller's point was minus 2%. And I just wonder if they're all actually delivering the same

1106
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:49,640
dose and what's going on. I mean, do you think that...

1107
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:55,160
So it wasn't significant, but it actually was... In two centers, there was a 10% effect.

1108
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:59,720
Yeah. There's always an issue that could be methodologic. Do you think that the animal

1109
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:06,440
studies in metformin are largely irrelevant once we have tame underway? I mean, one of the reasons

1110
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:13,320
that we rely so heavily on all of the animal data for rapamycin and why the ITP, which has studied

1111
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:18,760
rapamycin five ways to Sunday, starting at late in life, starting at early in life, high dose,

1112
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:24,440
low dose, pulsing it, not pulsing it, continuous. I mean, every way you study it, rapamycin works.

1113
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:30,920
And we have to look at that and really pay attention to it because I don't think we're

1114
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:34,600
going to get the human trial of rapamycin. I don't know that we're going to get the tame equivalent

1115
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:41,240
of rapamycin. And if we are, it's not going to be for some time. But now that we're moving to

1116
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:48,280
a human clinical trial of metformin, should we even care about this question in mice?

1117
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:55,000
Does it matter if it's 0.1% or 0.2%? No, I don't think, what I'm saying is that the preliminary

1118
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:01,400
data from humans overall, right, as you said, there are problems everywhere. But you know,

1119
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:07,640
it's the same story. It's a 20, 30% effect on each study, no matter how you look at it. It's a really

1120
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:15,160
very impressive studies, and there's no better studies that came with different results. So

1121
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:23,560
I think once tame is there, tame is there. I don't know that we need to go into animal studies and

1122
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:31,400
discover more about metformin at this time. Will tame allow you, on its current budget,

1123
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:38,520
which I think is 50 million, is the bare bones budget. Sounds crazy, right? On the 50 million

1124
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:46,600
dollar budget, how much will you be able to look at mitochondrial function and omics that are

1125
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:54,200
associated with other, you know, deeper markers that go beyond the hard outcomes that feed into

1126
02:07:54,200 --> 02:08:05,320
your primary outcome? Well, the NIA has given us a grant that is now delayed to do basically the

1127
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:12,920
biomarker part of tame. So even with this 50 million and with the NIH money and with the IFAAR,

1128
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:26,280
we're going to store lots of plasma, DNA, and other resources like cells and other things

1129
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,640
that will then be open for omics studies. And we wrote a beautiful grant about that. In part,

1130
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:40,520
it was preliminary data from our centenarian studies on proteomics. By the way, I just realized

1131
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:45,240
I used the word omics. Do you want to tell people what the full suite of omics means

1132
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:51,240
so that people listening to this know what we're talking about? Yeah. And it's really back to

1133
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:58,920
something that I said before when I talk about, if I said my study, I mean our study. And when I

1134
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:04,360
talk about teams, I'm talking about teams that have computational capacity. I talked about

1135
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:11,080
Zeng Dong-Deng that did a lot of my study about Yuxing Su that is doing functional genetics. I'm

1136
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:17,800
talking about Sophia Millman who are doing other studies. We're really big team. And the reason

1137
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:25,240
to have a big team is very simple. We have, you know, I was, all I knew when I started my training

1138
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:33,320
was insulin. I knew insulin. I know insulin signaling. Now I'm losing at billions of data

1139
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:39,000
set that are under my teeth. If you think of genetics only, whole exome sequencing for 3,000

1140
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:49,560
people, or my proteomics, which is 5,000 protein for 1,000 people, it's all big data. And in order

1141
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:56,120
to do something with the big data, you have to ask the right questions because what we know is

1142
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:05,880
the first paper that came out of the UK Biobank for Aging said that longevity is all about

1143
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:15,560
assortative mating. Okay. Now, yes, if you're a smoker, you may marry a smoker. If you're a beast,

1144
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:21,160
you will marry obese. If you're poor, you will marry poor. It all has consequence of health.

1145
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:29,960
But we knew that without the UK Biobank, we knew that obesity is a risk for diabetes without the

1146
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:38,040
Biobank too. So you have to ask the right question. And it's really only asking the right question

1147
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:45,560
that you get the answer. So the question that is very important for us, there are two questions.

1148
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:52,120
What are the biomarkers for aging? How can we do a test at 50 years old and know if we're 40 or we're

1149
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:59,880
60? If we're 40, we skip colonoscopy. Okay. If we're 60, we have to do something about it already.

1150
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:06,200
And the second part, and it's more important for me, is biomarkers that change with treatment.

1151
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:12,840
We want to make sure that we, when we try all those treatments that we have in two, three months

1152
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:17,960
and answer, are they likely to work? And then maybe we can get to phase two and phase three trial,

1153
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:26,760
but we need something more immediate. And that's what TAME will try to provide. Now, in my study,

1154
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:35,000
we did this proteomic and it was really incredible for many reasons, and I'll give you a tit beat,

1155
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:43,640
but we have those thousand people and 5,000 proteins. And we asked what changed between 65,

1156
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:50,600
the ages 65 and 95. This didn't include our centenarians. And the answer is a lot of proteins

1157
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:56,360
are changing, but this is, I think, the most important part. A lot of the proteins that we're

1158
02:11:56,360 --> 02:12:02,920
capturing, by the way, number one is IGF related proteins. Okay. Number one that comes up even in

1159
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:10,600
the proteomic, not only in the genomics, but then a lot of what you see is breakdown. You see

1160
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:18,200
breakdown of collagen, you see degranulation of the thrombocytes, you see breakdown of extracellular

1161
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:24,040
metrics, lots of things like that. And at first I said, okay, that doesn't tell me anything until I

1162
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:31,640
thought, you know, whatever it is, no matter what we do, we have to stop the breakdown. You know,

1163
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:38,200
this is probably going to be the best marker for any treatment. You just stop the breakdown.

1164
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:44,200
It's funny, that seems so obvious, doesn't it? I mean, like it's when you're talking about

1165
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:48,680
collagen breakdown and you think about this gets back to what we talked about earlier, you want to

1166
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:54,520
really know what health span is. It's not some nonsense definition that the NIA gives us about

1167
02:12:54,520 --> 02:13:00,600
freedom from disability and disease. Who cares? Who cares if you have cancer, but you're living

1168
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:05,080
in remission with it and you can climb three flights of stairs with a bag of groceries in

1169
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:12,840
your hands. That's living, right? It's yeah, when your collagen is breaking down, your knees aren't

1170
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:21,000
working. I mean, this is the essence of what we're talking about. Right, right. I think the proteomic

1171
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:27,400
story is very interesting and I hope it gets its appropriate funding. And by the way, the other part

1172
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:34,200
of proteomics, there are a few other aspects that are important. The proteomics that are the proteins

1173
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:41,880
that are 10 to the minus 80 significance, the two top ones, when you express them in animal, they

1174
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:48,920
live long. In other words, they're protective protein. When you get those proteins, you don't

1175
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:56,360
know which are protective and which are causing problems. And that's a challenge because we are

1176
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:02,280
saying, let's bring it to normal. No, you don't want to lower the protective mechanism. The third

1177
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:12,440
thing that is really cool is the proton of females is much more stable. In other words, it's only half

1178
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:20,200
of the proteins are significantly changing in women than in men between those ages. So you'd need to

1179
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:28,200
look at actually different biomarkers for women and men. And by the way, this is something,

1180
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:36,680
this was Eureka moment for all of us. From ITP and on, female and males have different biology as far

1181
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:43,320
as aging. Some of the geotherapeutics both work for both like metformin and rapamycin, maybe not

1182
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:52,520
equally, but work for both and some are not. Yeah, look at the 17 alpha estradiol, 17 beta

1183
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:57,320
estradiol. I mean, that's a remarkable story. And then the last thing that is interesting,

1184
02:14:57,320 --> 02:15:04,680
those thousand people that I had, 500 are what we called opus. They are offspring of parents with

1185
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:10,120
usual survival, no longevity in the family. And one are opal, offspring of parents with

1186
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:16,120
exceptional longevity. The offspring of parents with exceptional longevity have half of the

1187
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:26,360
biomarkers of the control group because they're younger, they'll get those biomarkers later. So

1188
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:37,000
I think, look, I don't know that methylation is going to be the best biomarker for treatment.

1189
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:46,840
I think methylations are complicated. They're kind of stable. They are going up, they're going

1190
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:53,240
down, but they're kind of stable. I think proteomic is going to be a better biomarker. I think

1191
02:15:53,240 --> 02:16:03,800
metabolomic is very complicated because it so depends on how you establish the sample. You know,

1192
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:09,000
if somebody was fasting less or more, if their insulin level was less or more, you're done.

1193
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:14,920
That's sort of my problem with these biomarkers is, and you know, I mean, I don't know, you've

1194
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:23,640
probably heard me rail on these biological clocks. I've never seen a worse biomarker than a biological

1195
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:30,920
clock. These are so easy to manipulate and game. In fact, I need to do this just to demonstrate it,

1196
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:38,120
but I'm too lazy, is get five copies of a biologic clock and do five different self-experiments. And

1197
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:45,160
I promise you I can change my biologic age by 20 years. Right? When fasting glucose and vitamin D

1198
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:51,880
level factor into a biologic clock, I'm sorry, that's useless. It might be valuable at the

1199
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:57,800
population level. It is as useful as a warm bucket of hamster vomit at the individual level.

1200
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:04,760
So we have to have things that can't just change on a day to day basis. Your fasting glucose,

1201
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:10,360
the difference between 95 and 105 has everything to do with the meal you had last night, how much

1202
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:15,080
cortisol was coursing through your veins if your water heater broke that night, if you got startled

1203
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:20,600
in the morning when you before you got your blood draw. I mean, I'm just amazed near at the attention.

1204
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:25,080
I'm sorry I'm going off on this tangent, but I'm amazed at the attention that is being given to

1205
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:31,880
these clocks and the entire cottage industry of businesses that are spinning out this type of,

1206
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:38,600
I think this is complete buffoonery. Peter, I have more positive outlook of life,

1207
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:41,480
maybe because I'm so much older than you. So much older, yeah.

1208
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,880
But you know, at least it's good for the economy.

1209
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:54,200
Yeah, exactly. Hey, Theranos was good for the economy until it wasn't. Right? No. The other

1210
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:59,960
thing is even with methylation and I thought methylation was very interesting until the

1211
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:04,680
twin astronaut brother experiment. Then I stopped thinking it was very interesting.

1212
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:09,960
Right? Remember you had the twins, right? The one astronaut went to the ISS for a year,

1213
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:16,360
his twin brother stayed down here. You then looked at methylation clocks of them after a year and

1214
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:21,240
they were vastly different. And then three days later, after the twin brother was back on Earth

1215
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:26,360
for three days, they repeated the test and it was right back to his twin brother. Right. I mean,

1216
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:33,080
come on, how biologically relevant can this be when it changes like that? Right. And I think,

1217
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:40,440
have you had Morgan Levine? No. And I do, of course. And I haven't had Steve Horvath on as well.

1218
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:44,920
I've communicated with him a little bit via email and I would certainly love the opportunity to

1219
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:50,600
speak with him about this. But there's probably something interesting there. I'm just having a

1220
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:55,080
hard time seeing that because again, what's the purpose of doing this? We have to never lose sight

1221
02:18:55,080 --> 02:19:00,680
of the purpose of biomarkers of aging. It's not so that you have bragging rights that, oh, I just

1222
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:05,960
took this test and it says I'm 37 when I'm 50. No. The only reason you do this test is if it can

1223
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:11,720
guide therapeutics. The only reason you do this test is if it helps you determine if I'm doing

1224
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:18,600
this thing, is it making me better or worse? And my fear is I haven't seen a single test

1225
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:23,880
that is validated at a level that would give me even a modicum of confidence in that. Right.

1226
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:28,840
Right. I mean, I'm saying this in a very deliberately provocative way because I'm

1227
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:33,800
waiting for you to say, oh, no, no, Peter, you need to look at this test. No. So I'm telling you,

1228
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:40,520
I don't want to be a spokesperson. All I'm saying is I don't think a methylation, because it's not

1229
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:46,360
mechanistic, I don't think it's going to help us when we come to gerotherapeutics, even if there

1230
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:52,040
are examples. OK, I don't know what the examples mean, just like the example you gave. I don't

1231
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:57,880
know what it means. Morgan Levine and Steve Horvat, by the way, they're really good and they're

1232
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:05,480
responsible and they understand exactly what they did and what they didn't do. And Morgan Levine has

1233
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:12,200
a mechanistic way of looking at epigenetics. Remind me what the inputs are to the Levine clock.

1234
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:19,880
The way they're moving is so one thing that Morgan Levine is doing is she's saying, well,

1235
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:26,040
if the methylation has a function, then I want to cause methylation and see that there's change

1236
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:33,080
in the expression of those genes. And that those genes are something that we know are relevant to

1237
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:39,160
aging, et cetera, et cetera, and then build a clock that is mechanistic, because the only

1238
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:47,240
way this clock was built was to measure chronological age. Will you guys be using

1239
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:53,320
any of the biologic clocks through tame as well? So what's going to happen with tame is there are

1240
02:20:53,320 --> 02:21:00,680
two things. We are going to have a committee that with time and we didn't decide, we're going to do

1241
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:07,000
the right epigenetic test. And by the way, we're going to do epigenetic, not the clock epigenetics,

1242
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:16,280
but enough epigenetic data on a genome, you know, on the genome wide in order to then

1243
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:22,520
discover which are the ones that have changed with treatment. OK, that way.

1244
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,680
But it would also be good near to have a clock running in parallel, wouldn't it?

1245
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:31,800
Because if you can do this longitudinally with multiple data points, you sample people every

1246
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:37,800
three to six months with multiple different versions of these clocks. And then you can look

1247
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:43,320
at how well those clocks predicted the actual outcomes you will see over five to seven years.

1248
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:48,920
That strikes me as a very valuable way to get at something that no one is doing today, because,

1249
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:53,320
you know, in other words, take advantage of the fact that you have two things going for you that

1250
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:59,960
nobody has today, which is a very large longitudinal data set with hard outcomes

1251
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:04,920
and an intervention that is relevant and interesting to study.

1252
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:11,960
If we're doing the metallation scan, we can obtain any clock from them. That's the idea.

1253
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,920
Yes, that's my point. I mean, you'll have the bio. I'm just saying just make sure you're

1254
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:21,960
collecting all of the data that goes into multiple clocks in a concurrent manner with it,

1255
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:28,840
not just at a time A and time B. Right. And the second point is the NIA is going to have RFA.

1256
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:35,080
Okay, for people who want to have sub projects in relation to what we collected,

1257
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:41,480
those RFAs can be in centers. For example, there's a center that wants to look at skin aging.

1258
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:48,680
Okay. If 250 people are enough, then for a project, then you have a center. If you need 500,

1259
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:54,680
you'll take two centers. In other words, there'll be a process by which application will be reviewed

1260
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:00,760
and people can come in and look at variety of things that they're interested in.

1261
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:05,160
If it's not too late, make some crazy suggestions. And I don't know if this changes your IRB,

1262
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:09,720
but are you going to be doing any bone marrow sampling even at time beginning and end?

1263
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:16,280
Because I'll tell you one of the other things I'd really, really love to see with a study of this

1264
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:23,880
magnitude is are you impacting immune function, specifically memory, T and B cell function?

1265
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:28,760
Obviously, this is a topic that's very interesting in germane to COVID at the moment, but I think it

1266
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:34,600
goes well beyond COVID. And it would be very interesting to know if metformin is having any

1267
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:40,600
impact on immune function, specifically memory function, because it doesn't just play an important

1268
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:46,120
role in infections, it plays a very important role in cancer. So look, the answer is mundane,

1269
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:52,920
we're taking elderly people into a study, we're not going to torture them, we're not going to

1270
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:58,840
have any excuse for them to leave us. It's the same with our centenarians. By the way,

1271
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:04,200
we are in the centenarian, what we're offering the offspring, we're offering MRI of their brain,

1272
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:11,800
we're offering them coronary CT, we're offering things, but we're not doing biopsies. That's in

1273
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:21,000
another study. Are you doing brain MRI and tame? No. Just because of cost? Yeah, look, you could do,

1274
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:31,080
again, we are powered enough to do things eventually, okay? Because it's not going to

1275
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:35,000
happen before and after, we're not going to have everything from before and after.

1276
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:41,880
This is only the things that we have to measure for the outcomes, but we'll have enough power

1277
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:49,160
for anybody to do MRIs in metformin. What about exercise function? Because one of the things I

1278
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:56,520
want to talk about before we leave metformin is the impact metformin may have as a negative impact

1279
02:24:56,520 --> 02:25:03,720
on cardiorespiratory fitness. So no, the answer is no. We're not going to have anything like that.

1280
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:12,680
Because of cost? No, because of how much time can you get an elderly to spend time with you

1281
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:19,960
every three months when really what you want to make sure is that they're taking their drugs.

1282
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:28,840
That's why. How many centers? You said 30-3500 subjects? Yeah, well, we have currently before

1283
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:36,520
before we get okay to expand the beat, we have 14 centers and about 250 people in each center.

1284
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:42,520
All in the US? All in the US. I don't know. I mean, I think that would be potentially a

1285
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:49,160
lost opportunity. Not that you have to do CPET testing every three months, but would doing it

1286
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:55,880
every two years be an issue? At a minimum, I would look at fasting lactate levels or resting lactate

1287
02:25:55,880 --> 02:26:04,200
levels. You know, everybody has their pet idea for you. Right. Everybody has possession. And

1288
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:09,720
but by no way, I'm saying it's not important. I'm just saying what are we practically ready

1289
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:16,600
because at the end, we want the FDA. Look, let me state it again. I'm doing tame,

1290
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:23,080
not because I don't believe in metformin because I need to have, we need to have

1291
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:31,160
a target that's similar to aging. Okay. That's the reason. So let's talk a little bit about this

1292
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:38,920
other issue, which is, you know, I've talked with you about my experience, right? So I took metformin

1293
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:47,240
for, I don't know, eight years or something like that. But three years ago, when I really began

1294
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:53,000
checking and constantly monitoring my lactate levels, both in and out of exercise,

1295
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:59,880
it became clear to me that my lactate levels were too high. So my fasting lactate level was

1296
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:06,280
typically above one millimole was between one and two millimole. And as a result of that, my

1297
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:15,320
perceived mitochondrial efficiency was lower. And there's ample data to suggest that fasting

1298
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:19,240
lactate level. Now, of course, this is not necessarily in people taking metformin, but if

1299
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:26,280
you take lactate levels in people at rest, there's a high association between what that tells you

1300
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:30,840
about their general health. So the less healthy an individual is the higher their lactate level is.

1301
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:38,360
So for me, I just said, well, boy, there sure, there sure looks like a lot of compelling reasons

1302
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:45,080
why metformin could be beneficial. But if I really stop to look at it, none of the cohorts of people

1303
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:52,440
in whom we would infer that look anything like me, right, these are not people who are exercising

1304
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:57,000
constantly doing all of these other things. So that was the decision for me three years ago,

1305
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:03,080
I'm not going to take metformin anymore until I have better data. So now we have a couple of

1306
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:08,360
studies that have looked at the impact of metformin on cardiorespiratory fitness, and we see that it is

1307
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:15,320
indeed impaired. And then we have studies that look at the impact on metformin of strength

1308
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:21,560
training. And we see a mixed response, we see that it does not appear to impact strength gains,

1309
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:28,120
it only appears to impact hypertrophy. The good news is we know that strength matters more than

1310
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:33,640
hypertrophy in longevity. I had a whole AMA on that, which you probably heard. So I think it was

1311
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:39,000
pretty clear that we can say strength matters more. So what do you make about these potential

1312
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:43,400
limitations with respect to metformin on cardiorespiratory fitness? And what do you think it

1313
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:50,360
says about people who exercise a lot? First of all, I think one point that is very important is

1314
02:28:51,160 --> 02:29:02,680
when we go from a drug that has certain capabilities to personalize medicine, and all of a sudden,

1315
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:09,720
it becomes about the person. And I think there's nothing I can say about what you're

1316
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:16,920
observing except that lactate is one of the biomarkers of giving metformin in every patient.

1317
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:25,240
In 1987, when I did the metformin study, metformin went from below one to above one in everyone who

1318
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:29,800
took metformin. Lactate, you mean, yes. Lactate, sorry, what did I say? You said metformin,

1319
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:35,400
yeah, lactate went up in every patient. It's almost a way that in, I hope in TAME,

1320
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:39,000
you are measuring lactate if for no other reason than determine compliance.

1321
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:45,080
Absolutely. By the way, there is a better test. The test is called GDF 15. It's one of those

1322
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:50,760
peptides that goes up with aging. It's a protective peptide. It goes by three and a half fold in people

1323
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:58,840
who take metformin. So there are other ways to look at it. So, okay, but this is the point

1324
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:06,280
with exercise. And let me make the most important point. Okay. We can talk about muscle, but remember,

1325
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:11,720
just like with exercise itself, exercise is not only about muscle. It improves brain function.

1326
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:18,840
Okay. It decreases cancer. Okay. Metformin has many other effects. Okay. So let's remember that

1327
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:25,080
metformin has other effects than its effects on the muscle. As far as the muscle is concerned,

1328
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:31,880
what we've done with Charlotte Peterson, which you reviewed two papers of her during the time,

1329
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:40,120
we took the biopsies and look at the transcript of the people who were on exercise and metformin

1330
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:48,600
versus exercise only, right? That's the only thing we had. And the reason we did that

1331
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:56,600
was because in supplement four of her first paper, she showed that the strength of the muscle

1332
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:04,760
didn't change, which means that per grand muscle you did better. Okay. And we try to understand

1333
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:12,200
what is the biology and it became very clear. Look, in order for muscle to grow, it needs to

1334
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:19,400
activate mTOR. Okay. So mTOR is good for muscle and for muscle growth. It's not good for aging,

1335
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:27,240
but it's good for muscle growth. A huge transcripts of mTOR has been decreased by metformin, which was

1336
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:32,840
not news for us. On the other hand, there are other transcripts that had to do with inflammation

1337
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:43,320
and autophagy and oxidative markers that were in people with metformin and not with exercise. So

1338
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:51,240
there were trade-offs. Okay. There were trade-offs. You get less muscle, but the muscle is healthier.

1339
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:57,400
Okay. So it's up to you. If you want... Is healthier, can we really say that? Or can we

1340
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:05,240
just say is as strong? It's biologically younger or as strong. Yeah, whatever. They're trade-offs.

1341
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:12,200
But how do we say it's biologically younger? Because the changing transcript that we saw

1342
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:19,480
is from an old transcript to young transcript. Okay. So in our studies, we have people with

1343
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:24,520
biopsies from people who are old and young and with every treatment and we've done it for

1344
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:29,960
sveratrol and we've done it for metformin and we've done it for acerbos and for exercise. And now

1345
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:35,800
we're doing it for fasting. We have young and old and we see if in old with intervention,

1346
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:44,840
the transcript goes back to young and it does. So the exercising people without metformin versus

1347
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:53,320
exercising with metformin, the with metformin group had a maintenance of the transcriptome

1348
02:32:53,320 --> 02:33:00,760
or it actually declined relative to the other group. No, no, it's transcript specific. Okay.

1349
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:08,120
It's which transcript, which groups of transcript changed and did they change other with decrease

1350
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:14,120
or increase? Did they change to resemble more young than old? And this was done on the patients

1351
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:19,960
in the master's trial? Yes. And what was the duration of that trial? 16 weeks, I believe.

1352
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:27,480
And what do we think we can learn in four months with respect to the transcript? Well, like how

1353
02:33:27,480 --> 02:33:32,760
much does it apply from what you've learned over a much longer period of time in a non-intervention

1354
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:37,720
setting? I don't know. I think, well, first of all, the answer is what we what we learn in four

1355
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:43,880
months. We learn what it is in four months, but I think it's a long it's a long period of time.

1356
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:50,280
It's also a dynamic period of time in this experiment because they were building muscle

1357
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:55,880
throughout time, right? So it is what it is in this experiment. But in this experiment,

1358
02:33:56,680 --> 02:34:02,520
the transcripts were younger by metformin and the emptor was increased by exercise.

1359
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:06,360
And this was the trade offs. And what about in terms of the

1360
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:10,360
cardio respiratory fitness differences? I'm listening to them. I don't have,

1361
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:15,640
you know, I don't have biology. I mean, I guess what I'm getting at is the most plausible

1362
02:34:15,640 --> 02:34:21,960
explanation here for a blunting of of cardio respiratory fitness would be what you said

1363
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:28,360
earlier, which is, you know, metformin is a mitochondrial inhibitor. It's a weak one at the

1364
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:35,320
doses we take it, but it nevertheless is. So it seems to me that that's the most obvious explanation.

1365
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:40,760
That's the place I'd be looking for the fire given where the smoke is. So do we think that

1366
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:49,400
the net benefits of that are probably positive in some people, but in others, for example,

1367
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:54,360
those who exercise a lot, it might not be beneficial because they're getting so many

1368
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:59,080
of those other benefits of exercise, as you point out. Yeah, I look, I'm taking metformin and

1369
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:04,920
exercise, but I have a different way. I'm thinking about it for me right now. We're very personalized.

1370
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:13,080
Yeah. And this is back to the issue of when do we start metformin? And or what is the biological

1371
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:19,240
age of those people who exercise and take metformin? And I would say that if you're young or

1372
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:25,320
biologically young, I don't think you should take metformin when you exercise at this level. Okay.

1373
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:30,520
And maybe Peter, Peter, you're, you know, you've been doing it for years. You're probably

1374
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:36,600
biologically much younger than most people. I don't know if metformin is for your age and

1375
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:43,400
for what you're doing for your health. I can tell you that I'm with metformin and fasting. My

1376
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:50,200
exercise capacity has increased significantly. I'm not measuring lactate. I'm not exercising

1377
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:57,720
the way you are. So I think those are good discussion. We'll find out eventually who can

1378
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:06,280
or who cannot, but we have to make sure that we don't generalize where we're being so specific.

1379
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:14,840
Yeah, no, indeed. I, you know, again, I said at the outset, I get asked about metformin constantly.

1380
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:18,520
And, you know, in the end, the only the only people who are asking me for whom it really

1381
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:22,680
matters are the patients. I don't particularly care what someone asks me on social media. But

1382
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:29,480
it has been a change in my practice over the past few years where I'm really reserving metformin

1383
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:35,880
only for people in whom I see an otherwise obvious indication, such as even a trace of

1384
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:45,080
insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia that is not otherwise, you know, treated with

1385
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:48,360
the right amount of exercise, nutritional changes, sleep and things like that.

1386
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:55,160
So it will be interesting to see what tame does and how it can change that practice.

1387
02:36:55,720 --> 02:37:01,320
But I also worry that it won't fully answer the question for our patient population,

1388
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:06,920
because the tame patient population is not a very healthy population. By definition,

1389
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:12,920
if they can't walk a certain speed, they're 65 to 80 years old, you're basically selecting

1390
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:16,360
people who we expect to have a bad outcome in five years.

1391
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:22,600
So it's a very important question for the for the world at large. But, you know, I think it's

1392
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:26,200
important that people listening to this understand we may not get the answer we want for them for

1393
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:32,040
the healthy 40 year old person. Absolutely. Remember, all I want with tail is an FDA

1394
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:37,320
indication for aging. OK, that's all I want. What do you think that opens the floodgates for?

1395
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:42,520
How does that change things now, assuming that we get there and that we now have an FDA

1396
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:49,880
indication for aging? What follows? First of all, pharmaceuticals will jump in, right? And they

1397
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:54,920
wouldn't make many mistakes because I think the biomarkers will be there from tame and others.

1398
02:37:54,920 --> 02:38:01,160
There will be more biomarkers, better biomarkers. And so that they could do testing two and three

1399
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:07,080
months and find out if their drug is working and then do a face retrial. Now face retrial,

1400
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:15,080
now face retrial. Think of it for any diabetes treatment. You need 12000 people.

1401
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:22,600
For 10 you need 3000 people. The study is going to be much, much cheaper. We think

1402
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:28,120
I think this is still a hypothesis that being tested, right? Is 3000 the right number? Yeah.

1403
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:36,040
Yeah. If if it were looked the 3000 is a question of when and not if for me, how many years

1404
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:43,800
will it take us? And I hope that we'll actually do the 3500 and not lose a lot.

1405
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:50,760
Not lose a lot. Also the question is who's stopping the study? That's another thing. So

1406
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:59,080
and in other words, that's administrative questions. But the reason we do that is to get

1407
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:06,920
an indication that for the FDA is not making aging a disease, which is another big topic.

1408
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:14,920
But for us, it's okay, you can call it whatever we want. But if there's a drug that targets

1409
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:20,440
variety of age related disease and mortality, that's for us a gerotherapeutics. And this is

1410
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:27,560
what we want to get all the other question when to use whom to use. You're absolutely right. And

1411
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:33,400
and the one thing I didn't with the one thing we don't want is not to kill anyone

1412
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:39,560
on the way to success, right? We're almost out of time. But one thing I want to just touch on

1413
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:43,720
before we go, we've talked a little bit about rapamycin a lot about metformin. We didn't talk

1414
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:48,520
about the other one, you and I probably get asked about a lot, which is the NAD precursors.

1415
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:54,920
Where are you and your thinking on the efficacy of these as general protective agents? They're in

1416
02:39:54,920 --> 02:40:00,520
a different class because they're not pharmaceutical, they're nutraceutical. How is your appraisal of

1417
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:07,480
the of the data in that space? You know, as a biologist, I have a problem understanding it.

1418
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:17,800
Okay. On one hand, you give it to animals, and the animals are doing better. Okay, not not in the

1419
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:23,640
ITP, but you're right. Not in the single most important animal study. They didn't write better.

1420
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:30,680
Yeah, when you ask people, okay, follow, you know, follow the drug. Tell me where it goes. Where can

1421
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:38,920
you measure it? You cannot measure it anywhere. And you cannot measure derivative of that.

1422
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:45,720
And so I don't know where is the biology. So Joe Bauer, do you know Joe Bauer from UPM?

1423
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:54,760
He's a really good NAD biologist. And he basically thought, you know what, the NAD goes,

1424
02:40:55,560 --> 02:41:01,560
we swallow that, it goes to our microbiome. Sorry, when he says NAD, you mean the NR or

1425
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:03,480
NAD? You're right. Yes, yes, yes.

1426
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:10,760
Right. Yeah. They go to the microbiome, and the microbiome either transfer the NAD or does

1427
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:15,800
something, the microbiome itself does something, and you know, there's indirect health benefit from

1428
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:22,840
a Dufferin system. And he actually did a really good study where he discovered that the NAD for

1429
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:31,400
the microbiome comes not from the food, but from the gut, the gut walls. Okay. Everywhere,

1430
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:37,720
everywhere you try to understand what's the biology, I don't get it. And when I don't get

1431
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:48,760
the biology, I'm a little bit more worried of what kind of a placebo is it. I actually, one of

1432
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:54,440
the studies I wanted to do, those short studies when I get elderly, do placebo control crossover

1433
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:01,240
and do biopsies and look at the biology, I wanted to do NAD. And then I said, I just have so little

1434
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:09,720
belief here that I'm now doing an intermittent fasting one, but I'm uncomfortable with it. Now,

1435
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:19,880
saying that, I started taking NMA at one point. And what I noticed is my REM sleep has improved

1436
02:42:19,880 --> 02:42:28,840
a lot. And I stopped it and my REM sleep wasn't so good. I restarted it and my REM didn't get better

1437
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:38,600
again. So, and then I tried another, there's a Japanese company, I don't remember the name of

1438
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:43,800
the top of my head, that has really the best preparation. David Sinclair tells me about that,

1439
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:55,800
has the best preparation of NMN, $900 a month supply for the low dose, $1,800 for the high dose.

1440
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:02,360
I got some of the supplement as a present. More expensive than a PCSK9 inhibitor and

1441
02:43:02,360 --> 02:43:12,760
Rapamycin combined. Okay. Right. And my REM sleep didn't return. So, I'm currently not taking

1442
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:22,680
anyone. So, what am I telling you? I'm telling you, I'm just not convinced. I don't know,

1443
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:27,640
it's not the whole truth. You never know the whole truth, but I don't know enough of the truth

1444
02:43:28,280 --> 02:43:36,200
to make anything about it. Again, if people want to know, it's good for the economy. I'm not sure

1445
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:41,720
that the preparations out there, look, they are very sensitive preparations. If they have a high

1446
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:48,200
time shelf, I think you lose a lot of it. And I don't know which to recommend.

1447
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:54,680
Yeah. I think it's always problematic when your rationale for taking a supplement is that it's a

1448
02:43:54,680 --> 02:44:01,080
mini stimulus program to the economy through the supplement company. I think as a general rule,

1449
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:06,600
if we're going to talk about principles for trying to optimize your health, I would put that very low

1450
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:12,360
on the list. Peter, I did many jokes. Do I have to go over and tell you which was a joke and which

1451
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:18,040
is not? I know it's a joke. This is my joke right back at you. Yeah, exactly. No, no, this is my

1452
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:25,480
sarcasm coming right back to you. Yeah, supplement company stimulus program, not a high on my list

1453
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:32,120
reason for it. Anyway, Nier, this has been great. Thank you again for the generosity of your time.

1454
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:38,920
And behind the scenes, people don't know how much I bug you and how much we interact on all matters

1455
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:45,720
that pertain to this stuff. You're one of the few people that I know listens to every single podcast,

1456
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:51,880
reads every single newsletter, and at least a quarter of the time sends me a note with something

1457
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:56,600
remarkable in it that expands my thinking on a topic. So I want to thank you for that. You're

1458
02:44:56,600 --> 02:45:02,280
part of the people who spread the gospels, and I think it's so important. In fact, you're one of

1459
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:08,440
the messiahs, really. That's an awful. I don't want to be a messiah of anything. And I want to come

1460
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:13,720
clean. You know, I'm usually not there for the last half an hour of the podcast, you know.

1461
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:19,000
It's a shame because I always say the best thing for the last half an hour.

1462
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:28,440
Okay, next time I listen to the last half an hour. It's a pleasure, Peter, and any time and good luck.

1463
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:34,200
And I'm looking forward not to this one. I'm not going to listen to, but to the next one.

1464
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:39,080
Very well. Thank you, Nier. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.

1465
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:43,480
If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership

1466
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:48,760
program that allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads.

1467
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:53,240
It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription.

1468
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:57,960
Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass,

1469
02:45:57,960 --> 02:46:02,440
comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person,

1470
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:07,080
thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is, nobody's show notes rival these.

1471
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:12,280
Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely.

1472
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:17,960
Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen

1473
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:23,560
to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday

1474
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:28,280
through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes

1475
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:33,160
of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and

1476
02:46:33,240 --> 02:46:39,000
necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not

1477
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:43,720
getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in

1478
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:47,800
as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits, you can head
