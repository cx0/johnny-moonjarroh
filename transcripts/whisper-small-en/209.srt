00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,780
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,380
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,120

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,400
today's episode. My guest this week is Marty McCarry. This name, of course,

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,240
sound familiar to you as Marty has been on this podcast a number of times. Most recently,

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,120
we spent a couple of episodes discussing COVID, which I can assure you barely comes up in this

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
episode. By way of background though, Marty is a professor at Johns Hopkins, which is where we

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,120
met many years ago. He's professor of surgery and also public health researcher. He's a graduate of

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,960
Harvard School of Public Health and served on the faculty of Hopkins for the last 16 years. He's

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,560
also served in the leadership at the WHO. He's a member of the National Academy of Medicine and

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,000
serves as the editor in chief of the second largest trade publication in medicine called MedPage Today.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,040
He writes quite regularly for the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Journal. He's also the author of two New York Times bestselling books, Unaccountable and The

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,520
Price We Pay. In this episode, we talk about patient safety, but of course, the real impetus

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
for this is the recent case of Radhanda Vaught. In case that name doesn't sound familiar, Radhanda

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Vaught is a nurse or a former nurse at Vanderbilt Medical Center who made a medical error that

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,600
resulted in the death of a patient in late 2017. This case has garnered a lot of attention lately

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,080
for reasons we will get into in this case. The headline is that for probably the first time,

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,440
certainly to anybody's recollection, a mistake of this nature was prosecuted criminally. The

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,800
implications of this are pretty significant. We talk about that a lot, but we really begin the

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
discussion by talking about the culture of patient safety. What is the risk to a patient when they

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,800
walk into the hospital? What are medical errors? How do they take place and how big a problem is

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,640
it? We also talk about how much has changed in the last 20 years. I think Marty and I were pretty

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,000
lucky to train in an era that actually witnessed the transformation or witnessed the changing of

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
the guard in terms of the attitude towards this. One thing to note about this podcast is that in

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,760
an effort to get it out as quickly as possible, it's going to be an audio only episode and the

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,680
show notes will be relatively sparse. Without further delay, I hope you enjoy my conversation

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:51,640
about this very important topic with Marty McCarry. Hey Marty, awesome to be talking with

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,160
you about this today. I'm kind of bummed that we can't do these in video, but I guess that's the

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,480
nature of your other life. Anyway, no one else gets to see your beautiful face except me right

36
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,440
now. Good to see you, Peter. This is a topic you and I have been talking about privately for about

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,360
two months now. I think we decided that it was an important enough subject that we should actually

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,680
bring it to the larger sphere and talk about this publicly. That's the issue of patient safety,

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,400
something that's near and dear to your heart. You've worked on this tirelessly for almost as

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,640
long as I've known you and I think we met in 2003, 2002 actually we met. This has been something

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,920
that you along with many of your colleagues, people who I knew like Peter Pronovost have also taken

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,080
up the mantle on. When I think back to my medical training, Marty, when I think of the beginning

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,640
versus the end, that's a five year stint. A lot of changes actually happened. Something as simple

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,720
quite frankly as a timeout was not something that existed before I entered my residency. When I was

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,560
an intern, there was no such thing as a timeout, a surgical timeout in the operating room. We can

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,520
explain what that means to people. Yet by the time I left my residency, you couldn't do an operation

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:05,360
without a timeout. Clearly, the culture of medical safety is something that the field of medicine has

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,520
been struggling with for a couple of decades. Can you give us just a little bit of a history of that

49
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,440
with more color than my sort of clumsy approach at it? When we were a residence at that time,

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,440
it was around that time that we entirely blamed the individual. I specifically remember one of

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,920
the M&M conferences. I don't know if you tell people what M&M is. I think I've talked about it

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,000
in the past. It's very important for people to understand, especially in surgery, what M&M is.

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,920
So M&M stands for morbidity and mortality. And it's a weekly or in some smaller hospitals,

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,720
a monthly conference where things that go awry or any death on that department service will be

55
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,880
reviewed and discussed. And it's part of internal quality improvement. It's legally protected under

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,120
a special clause under quality improvement so that it's not discoverable in court. And we can

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,520
have the liberty to discuss things honestly. And it's an amazing conference. My favorite conference

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,000
as a resident, truthfully. Well, sometimes it was also entertaining, but your eyes would pop out.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,080
I remember as a medical student, you listen to these stories. I mean, the Swiss cheese defect

60
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,560
of medical errors where everything goes wrong, the perfect storm of how you could this happen

61
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,240
and that happened and the patient ultimately was hurt by it or a near miss. And you see yourself

62
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,440
in these situations like, gosh, I could have done that. And I remember as a medical student,

63
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,000
my eyes popped out of my head. I'm just thinking, oh my God, can you believe that just happened?

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,280
And M&M after M&M conference, I would just be blown away. But I was also exhausted. And then as a

65
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,960
fourth year medical student, my eyes popped out a little less. And then as an intern, I was just so

66
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,760
tired, I would just kind of like raise my eyebrows as I'm half trying to get a nap in.

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,120
And then as attending, it'd be totally numb to it, completely numb to, yep, that stuff happens

68
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,200
and maybe we should try to do better. M&M is an incredible conference because you hear the

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,000
discussions of what we could have done better. Well, I think the point that it's not discoverable

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,120
in a court is also important. At least where we trained, I think at Hopkins, I always felt that

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,560
it was a very honest conference, meaning I felt that people really went up there and shouldered

72
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,760
the blame for mistakes. Yes. Without that, it becomes, if this were a conference that were

73
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,320
done in a court, you could never get to truth and reconciliation. What I loved about the conference

74
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,360
was the intense humility that you would see exerted by these powerful names in American surgery. I

75
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,560
mean, giants in the field say with all honesty, I didn't look carefully enough at the CAT scan

76
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,400
before the case. I should have recognized that there was an aberrant artery in that location

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,200
that I ended up getting into trouble with. I feel bad. I spoke with the patient and you'd hear these

78
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,280
incredible moments of honesty. And I thought that's healthy for the field. When we were residents,

79
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,200
the resident presenting who was often just completely getting fried for things that were

80
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,640
out of their control, right? You don't want to blame a nurse. You don't want to blame a colleague.

81
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,440
You don't want to blame your weak medical student who dropped something. You try to present it in

82
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,880
a neutral way and you jump on the grenade for the team. And I remember specifically there was a

83
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:38,280
trauma patient who died. And this guy had basically was dead on arrival and there's

84
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,280
nothing that we could have done medically. And when I say we as a profession, I was not in the

85
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,840
case. But the chief resident felt bad and basically just said, I should have pushed harder. I should

86
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,520
have just pushed everybody harder. And I'm thinking, yeah, we need to do our best, but you're beating

87
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,840
yourself up in this spirit of it's all about the individual's responsibility. Now we've matured to

88
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,440
recognize we need to have safe systems, right? We need to have the chest tubes in the operating room

89
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,120
or in the trauma bay so you can get to them quickly. We need to value non-technical skills

90
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,560
as doctors, not just the technical skills of doing procedures, but effective communication

91
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,480
and inspiring confidence in people around you and organizational skills. We just generally haven't

92
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,400
valued that kind of teamwork and communication skills. We've matured now to recognizing that

93
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,800
when something goes tragically wrong, we need to ask how can we do better? But how can the system,

94
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,240
how can the hospital be set up differently? How can the NICU be moved to be closer to the labor

95
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,680
and delivery ward? How can the elevator be held for the trauma team before they get there so they

96
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,480
don't have to wait for the elevator to come down? That's a systems approach and that is entirely

97
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,080
novel in the last 20 years of medicine. What was the impetus for this, Marty? When you think back

98
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,440
to before you and I trained, was there a single catalyzing event that somehow just finally took

99
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:10,200
hold literally during the time we were training or was it no single event but rather a gradual

100
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,760
progression? I'll give you an example. I think everybody's familiar with the story of how the

101
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,040
80-hour work week came to be a manner in which residents trained and that really came out of a

102
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,520
singular event. I don't remember the woman's name, Libby something. Libby Zion. A young woman who,

103
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,920
God, I don't even remember the story other than I think she went to a New York hospital. She was in

104
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,760
an ER and a resident took care of her, prescribed her a medication without realizing she was on

105
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,640
another medication. I believe it was a psychiatric medication. There was a huge contraindication to

106
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,040
this and I think she died of hypothermia or something like that. I mean she had a tragic

107
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,000
outcome in the ER as a result of unfortunately probably poor supervision on the part of the

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,720
resident as opposed to fatigue but it became a rallying cry around residents working too hard

109
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,840
and not getting enough sleep. Really, I believe that the family of Libby Zion carried the torch

110
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,000
on this and many years later obviously that resulted in the changes with the ACGME.

111
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Was there a similar event that precipitated the push to safety or was it more an accumulation

112
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,560
of events? I would say it was that Libby Zion case and it happened in 1984. It came to light

113
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:25,240
subsequent but it was her father who happened to be a New York Times reporter and it showed for

114
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,480
the first time to the world what many of us had known and that is you can die not just from the

115
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,840
illness that brings you to care but you can die from the care itself and that can occur at a rate

116
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,960
that may be higher than we appreciate. She was given a medication that should not have been given

117
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:51,080
to her. She had a interaction that should have been recognized and out of that case came a ruling

118
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,800
that you can't have people working 48 straight hours because that was credited to be a root cause

119
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,440
and around that time in the 1990s when there was attention around this New York state set up a

120
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,520
commission to make sure you don't have people completely sleep exhausted doing procedures and

121
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,440
making critical decisions that the Institute of Medicine put out a report in 1999. They issued a

122
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,920
report, a groundbreaking report where they essentially reviewed records independently

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,680
and found that about in their estimate 44,000 to 98,000 people a year in the United States die

124
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,640
from preventable medical mistakes. Sometimes it was sloppy handwriting, sometimes it was ordering

125
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,360
something that should have been done on another patient, sometimes it was forgetting something,

126
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,240
sometimes it was the patient falling through the cracks but they identified what is now known as

127
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,640
a preventable adverse event also known on the street as a medical mistake and people were blown

128
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,320
away. I remember as a resident being told hey this report just came out from this giant institution

129
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,440
highly respected Institute of Medicine now called the National Academy of Medicine saying that maybe

130
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,080
up to 100,000 people a year died not from the disease that brings them to care but from the

131
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:16,200
care itself and there was protest and anger and the residents were like this is BS and within a

132
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,880
couple years thanks to some big national names including a pediatric surgeon who's made his

133
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:29,960
career this topic and with a lot of humility talking about how he made mistakes as a surgeon

134
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,480
this really quickly became adopted doctors resonated with it the public it's almost as if

135
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,360
everybody had or knew of a story and quickly this Institute of Medicine report put into stone the

136
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,480
idea that dying from medical mistakes if it were a disease would rank as the eighth leading cause

137
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,160
of death now what's interesting is Lucian Leape one of the co-authors wrote a dissenting commentary

138
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,200
afterwards where he said look it's much higher look at the methodology that we used we're just

139
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,440
reviewing charts not every mistake is documented and he actually thought it was an underestimate

140
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,320
let me push back a little bit not for the sake of pushing back but just to sort of ask the question

141
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,400
in a probing way so let's say it's a hundred thousand people die a year in hospitals because of

142
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,600
medical errors is there any way to determine how many of those are deaths in people who were going

143
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,600
to probably die during that admission anyway so these were accelerated deaths versus people like

144
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,120
Libby Zion who she was a young otherwise healthy woman with an isolated psychiatric illness

145
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,760
probably was not going to die anywhere near that hospital admission and therefore that admission

146
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,640
so think of it as like people who are on the edge of the cliff for whom the medical error pushes

147
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,880
them over the cliff versus people who are 30 feet away from the cliff for whom the medical

148
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,360
error picks them up over the fence and shoves them over the cliff it's a great point and the

149
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,680
study did not distinguish the two and it's true many times like if you look at the people in the

150
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,640
hospital they tend to be older and many times the medical error hastened the death but was really

151
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,560
not the primary cause of death but any medical error that resulted in death even if it hastened

152
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,200
an imminent death was counted as a medical mistake and that's of course very difficult

153
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,840
as it should be as it should be i think back to all of the ones that i saw i'll just tell one

154
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,440
story i may have even told this on the podcast before at some point and you'll appreciate it

155
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,720
because it was during my intern year very early so august i'm guessing maybe july it was either

156
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,280
the first or second month of internship we were not at the mothership we weren't at hopkins we were

157
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,600
out at sinai which is one of the satellite hospitals and you don't necessarily have the same

158
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,080
quality of the support staff there that becomes relevant in the story so a resident wrote an order

159
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,040
for a patient who is in the icu she was in the icu but going to be transferred out so she was

160
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,680
not ventilated basically just waiting for a bed to move to the floor and she was having a hard

161
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:07,560
time sleeping so he wrote for one gram of ativan instead of milligram exactly ativan is a benzodiazepine

162
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,240
that would normally be dosed somewhere between half a milligram and maybe two milligrams you

163
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,440
know maybe five milligrams right and that would be in someone who's used to a lot of that medication

164
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,600
what he meant to write was one milligram and not one gram so he wrote for one thousand times

165
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:32,200
the dose so that was mistake number one now almost without exception any nurse because this is back

166
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,000
in the day when you wrote an order on a paper chart any nurse would immediately recognize that

167
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,960
as an error but this just happened to be a brand new nurse and so she took the order from the chart

168
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,880
exactly as it was written as one milligram pardon me as one gram and transmitted that order directly

169
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,080
to the pharmacy which again any pharmacist with any experience would recognize that's a

170
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:04,200
super physiologic dose that would be enough to kill an entire i don't know gaga enough a stadium

171
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,640
of people but again the pharmacist was also brand new it was a night shift maybe putting the new

172
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,560
person on at the night shift when there's less action so the pharmacist sent up all of the ativan

173
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:22,280
that he had in the system which was tens of milligrams and said look i'll get the rest later

174
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,160
i have to reach out to another hospital to get it but you know whatever it was here's 20 or 30

175
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,320
milligrams of ativan and i'll get the other 970 milligrams later which again should have been a

176
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:40,280
red flag but wasn't and then of course the nurse administered this dose of ativan to the patient who

177
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,040
very shortly after stopped breathing now fortunately this happened in an ICU and therefore

178
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,720
the nurse was able to see that the patient had stopped breathing called the doctor they

179
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,600
intubated the patient and the next morning you know she was ultimately extubated and fine this

180
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,080
was a near miss it's a huge medical error but it did not result in death though had this occurred

181
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,720
on the floor it would have resulted in a death that story illustrates exactly what you spoke

182
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,800
about earlier which is the horrible swiss cheese effect of how many pieces can you line up and

183
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,600
still fit a pencil through exactly what the swiss cheese model of medical errors is it shows how

184
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:27,080
when we look back and review these catastrophic errors oftentimes every single thing is a little

185
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,640
off and what happens is sometimes we refer to as a comedy or error sometimes we call it the perfect

186
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,800
storm but it happens so that's the terminology we're using now is if it avoids a patient harm

187
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,440
it's a near miss and if it involves patient harm it's called a preventable adverse event

188
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,320
let's talk about how things advanced going from the early 2000s until where we are now what have

189
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,560
been some of the biggest advances and do we have metrics to objectively talk about whether or not

190
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,280
improvements have come along well it's amazing you sit in those m&m conferences and you just

191
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:10,200
start thinking gosh that mistake that lab test was never conveyed to the intern that patient was

192
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,160
getting two feeds into a tube that did not go to the stomach it's almost as if you can't reproduce

193
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,880
it here's something that's insane and you think gosh you can't make this stuff up and every error

194
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,920
appears to be unique but there are certain basic principle root causes oftentimes the physician is

195
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,360
exhausted burnt out didn't have the support or help they needed may have had what we call alert

196
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,280
fatigue meaning they're being pinged with a lot of unnecessary alerts yeah such that when a real

197
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,680
alert comes along it's easy to ignore exactly like you feel like the pharmacy is crying wolf

198
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,280
and every time you prescribe something there's some alert so people just click through them

199
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,760
sometimes you're actually prescribing a therapy for someone and you have to override five or six

200
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:02,520
alerts just to prescribe one treatment path in 2006 our friend peter pronovost who was at johns

201
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:10,280
hopkins tackled one form of preventable adverse event which were central line infections and

202
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,560
basically we had known for a long time there's a protocol that if you use it reduces the risk of

203
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,640
infecting the central line you put a full length down on the person you wash and just for folks to

204
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,040
understand a central line is an intravenous catheter but it goes into one of the very deep

205
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,680
veins so typically either a deep vein in the neck called the jugular deep vein in the neck of the

206
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,240
subclavian or a deep vein in the pelvis or in the groin called the femoral vein and you know it's a

207
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,040
big deal procedure both from the risk of infection and the risk of hitting an artery or puncturing

208
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:47,160
the lung and we saw so many central line complications when we were residents in medicine

209
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,960
nationally not just to johns hopkins nothing was unique there about it having a higher rate

210
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,880
of central line complications but the lines would get infected they would get clotted you had to

211
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,600
change them frequently many people had lines they did not need so a protocol was developed by peter

212
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,480
pronovost and the nurses in the icu to say look try to avoid the groin whenever possible because

213
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,720
those femoral lines are more likely to get infected just being down there in the groin

214
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,120
use a full-length drape wash your hands extensively use sterile technique wear a mask and

215
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:29,720
face shield and so we saw this protocol rigidly adhered to and a dramatic reduction in central

216
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,720
line infections and then peter had a relationship with the michigan hospital association

217
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,880
which then adopted it broadly in an icu collaborative of dozens of hospitals and they basically got the

218
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,920
median central line infection rate down to just below 0.5 which if you round down is zero

219
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,040
and this news that and what was it before peter because i remember it was a huge reduction gosh

220
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,680
three to five percent somewhere in that range a log fold reduction in risk log fold reduction and

221
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,080
it's consistent with what we saw when we were interns gosh taking care of infected central

222
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,880
lines was routine this was celebrated as a major milestone in patient safety here is one form of

223
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,760
preventable harm granted it's less than one percent of all the preventable harm in health care but we

224
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:23,640
succeeded we standardized something we got broad compliance it was a rapid adoption not the typical

225
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,520
17-year lag between evidence and broad adoption in practice that we see with other things introduced

226
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,040
but i want to add marty there was another change that took place

227
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,680
at least during my tenure that i have to believe had a significant impact so when i was a cocky

228
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,960
aggressive medical student i don't know how i got away with this but it was the wild west back then

229
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,600
i was putting central lines in people as a medical student now i never did it without supervision so

230
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,640
i always had a resident supervising me but it's pretty unusual i think for a third and fourth

231
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,920
year resident to be putting in central lines by the time i finished medical school i'd probably

232
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,600
put in 25 central lines and in part that was because i did a stint at the nih and i got some

233
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,200
expert experience there in the clinical service in oncology so it's pretty good at putting in a

234
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,840
central line i show up as an intern i mean i probably put in a hundred central lines as

235
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,320
an intern unsupervised again i'm very fortunate i probably put in 400 central lines in all of

236
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,000
residency i had one hema pneumothorax that showed up four days afterwards we never saw

237
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,040
the original x-ray so that was my bad to miss that but i remember by the time i was in my fifth year

238
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:40,120
that wild west was gone interns were not allowed to put in central lines only the second year

239
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,160
resident in the icu was putting in central lines and they were doing it under the supervision of

240
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,160
the acs in a florolab such that you could immediately get an image right after now i

241
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,560
don't know if that procedure stuck and it sure seemed a little aggressive given how i came up

242
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,640
but i gotta believe it was for the best do you know how that sort of played out and what the

243
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,440
protocol is now at a teaching hospital for central lines we used to joke that i'd put a central line

244
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,480
in somebody in the parking lot if they looked at me wrong well it's amazing how good you could get

245
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,040
at that technique and the students that had a broad experience before they started their

246
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,000
residency were definitely more efficient they would get the job done more reliably the fact

247
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,640
that you did so many before your residency probably explains why you were one of the most

248
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,000
highly sought after and regarded residents in our hopkins program i had no idea what my line

249
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,440
infection rate was all i knew is i wasn't causing pneumothoracys but that's right i guess my point

250
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,760
is really i would guess that complications like pneumothoracys also went down with this change so

251
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,440
it wasn't just that the work that peter and others did fixed line infections i think it brought

252
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,440
a greater appreciation to the seriousness of this procedure and i'm wondering did anybody follow up

253
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,080
and say hey guess what the rate of pneumothorax went from one percent to point one percent do we

254
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,600
have any insight into that so what you're describing is the move towards dedicated teams

255
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,560
by the time we finished our residency they had a central line associated a central line team

256
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,120
and then that matured into a dedicated team and then it turned into a rule that you really were

257
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,840
not supposed to put in central lines at all you were only supposed to have the dedicated team do

258
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,480
it and they were so freaking good because they were doing just that and then they started using

259
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,280
ultrasound so it's not like you take 10 20 probes until you aspirate blood and so that you served

260
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,680
all the success of this protocol that peter pronovost introduced and that team of course used

261
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,800
the protocol so it wasn't for naught but i mean the fact that we could conquer something like

262
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,560
central line associated infections that nobody thought you could ever tackle and the cost savings

263
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,200
and the avoidable harm associated with that that was a major milestone in patient safety

264
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,720
and then two years later after the pronovost publication on the central line toolkit or bundle

265
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,400
which within three years was becoming standard in many icus around the country

266
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,360
medicare decided they're not going to pay for a catastrophic medical mistake what we call a

267
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,200
never event something that should never happen regardless of the circumstances you should never

268
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,720
leave an instrument or a sponge behind during surgery unintentionally what year was that marty

269
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,880
that medicare said that 2008 that was a major step up until that time financial system in

270
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,920
medicine was not rewarding but if you had to go back and do an operation to remove a retained

271
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,120
foreign object you were paid for that procedure as well and medicare basically said why are we

272
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,720
incentivizing why are we rewarding this financially let's just agree to not pay for this stuff and

273
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,640
then other insurance companies started to follow and now it's accepted that's on the hospital if

274
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:57,240
you have a catastrophic medical mistake and then in 2009 the who organized a committee to address

275
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,880
patient safety at this time patient safety was the hottest thing in health care and we were

276
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,720
recognizing again people die from the care not just from the disease i had just published at

277
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,520
hopkins the surgery checklist with peter pronovost as my mentor and we put out a bunch of articles

278
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,560
and the who basically said we're convening people interested in patient safety we'd like to invite

279
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,680
you to present about your checklist i presented it a tool goandhi was chair of the committee

280
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,280
it was not that interested in the idea initially warmed up to it wait didn't he write a book called

281
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,000
the checklist manifesto or something like that he eventually saw the great story in the checklist

282
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,840
and wrote a book but initially he actually presented a competing idea at the who which

283
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,400
was something called the surgery apgar score which nobody adopted it was discarded people thought it

284
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,160
was dumb idea it was not risk adjusted baby's born and you do a rapid test that predicts

285
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,200
the baby's survival and this has been an old school score that was used to be done on babies

286
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,440
and it was the idea that you could do a rapid assessment in a matter of seconds and assess a

287
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,560
prognosis and he just loved that concept it was a great story and he thought we should do that for

288
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,280
all surgical patients well people were saying hey if you have a breast biopsy it's different from

289
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,720
having a heart bypass like you've got to adjust for the severity of the surgery but he just loved

290
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,120
the idea of a rapid assessment the committee voted unanimously against his proposal i remember

291
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,000
a tool was frustrated and he thought i don't know if i'm going to continue as chair of this committee

292
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,640
and then the committee said you know a tool the checklist is simple pilots already do it look at

293
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,840
the success in aviation it's low budget for our who committee to adopt a checklist to go up on the

294
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,920
operating room wall and the committee loved it so it became the initiative our checklist became

295
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,520
known as the who surgery checklist and to this day it hangs on the operating room walls of most

296
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,960
operating rooms in the world and eventually he did a study i was a part of a study showing how it

297
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,360
reduced adverse events and had an impact so that was a another moment in patient safety was in 2009

298
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,920
what year was that not to derail us but a story that got a lot of attention which was a heart

299
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:22,600
transplant at duke where did they fail to do a cross type or yes do you remember that story

300
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,480
yep so that was a major milestone in patient safety and a lot of good came out of the lessons

301
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,600
learned there so they were doing a heart transplant on a young girl at duke university

302
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,480
which is just to put in perspective we're talking top five places in the world you would ever have

303
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,040
a heart transplant would be at duke university yeah cardiac transplant they're definitely top

304
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,640
three or four in my opinion so they did not check a cross match which just for listeners you take

305
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,560
the blood of the donor and the blood of the recipient and you see what happens in the lab

306
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,440
does it result in sort of this hyper accelerated allergic reaction if you will that you can see

307
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,240
in the lab if so that's what we call a hyper acute rejection signal you abort the transplant it's done

308
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,760
routinely it's a standardized procedure somehow it's done before even a blood transfusion that's

309
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,040
right so in other words you i guess people should understand this if you were getting a blood

310
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,880
transfusion and your blood type is a positive it's not enough to go to the blood bank and say just

311
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,640
give me any old bag of a positive they still have to do a cross match they still have to take a bit

312
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,240
of that blood that should match with yours and yours and do that test shouldn't they i don't

313
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,280
honestly know the protocol for blood transfusions but certainly organ transplants something i'm very

314
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:43,320
close to absolute 100 routine as you can understand why i mean there's nothing worse i've never seen

315
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,640
it but i know of surgeons who have you put an organ in a recipient you sew it in and all of

316
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,640
a sudden the organ fails right in front of your eyes you see swelling you see this sort of ischemia

317
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,920
that's why we do a cross match well the cross match was not checked unfortunately the heart

318
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,920
failed the universe the hospital doctors of course felt terrible did everything they could

319
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:13,160
to prioritize her as a status level one high priority the highest priority to get a second

320
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,920
heart transplant they attempted a second heart transplant the transplant failed and it was a

321
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,680
tragic case all the way around it's insanely tragic because the woman died and then you could

322
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,560
effectively argue two other people died who didn't get a chance to have the heart that would

323
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:36,840
have worked for them that's right the opportunity missed so it was and over what what kind of cost

324
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,800
are we talking about well over a million dollars but even more concerning the lost years of life

325
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,840
in a young promising human being so you had now this recognition and how did the mistake happen

326
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,960
marty what did the autopsy show like obviously this is something that gets done before every

327
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,480
transplant and presumably almost never gets missed where was the swiss cheese on that one

328
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,760
what went wrong to prevent that cross match it turns out that a nurse in the operating room

329
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:15,960
sensed something was not right there was this feeling among within this nurse that something

330
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,880
just was not correct and what she had was alluding to was that they had not done that cross match

331
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:29,160
and she did not feel comfortable speaking up she had the thought hey wait a minute what was the

332
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,920
cross match did not voice that concern or voice it to the appropriate head of the operating room

333
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,800
the surgeon and felt terrible about it and it created this notion that do we know why it wasn't

334
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,320
done i can understand that maybe her spidey sense tingled but like why wasn't it done something that

335
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,800
is so routinely done do we know why it wasn't done i don't know if it's known but i've certainly seen

336
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,160
patients go to the operating room in my career where something should have been done beforehand

337
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,400
and it wasn't and i'm sure you've seen that so the idea of creating a culture of speaking up

338
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,760
or an atmosphere in the operating room where people feel that there's collegiality teamwork

339
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,240
and they would feel comfortable voicing a concern that no longer was a soft science it now

340
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:25,080
undermined a gigantic operation in a young girl and had catastrophic consequences so all of a sudden

341
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,840
standardizing what we do became more of a science that was another major step and then the ubiquitous

342
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,480
nature of medical errors got documented in a 2014 Mayo Clinic study where in a survey of

343
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:48,200
6500 doctors 10.5 percent of doctors surveyed say that they had made a major medical mistake

344
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:55,320
in the last three months say that again how many 10.5 percent of u.s doctors report that they made

345
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,040
a major medical mistake in the last three months now i might have felt like that in the lowest

346
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,400
points of my residency but i was surprised when i saw that now it may have been caught what we

347
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,920
call the near miss but it did sort of democratize the idea of hey if you felt like you've done

348
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:18,440
something like this you're not alone it's actually sort of part of this crazy life that we have

349
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,760
as doctors where you're getting pulled in all these directions and there's pressure and stress

350
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,440
and that's assuming everything at home is fine people are dealing with external pressures and

351
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,480
then in 2015 Mass General Hospital had a study done by researchers there which Mass General is

352
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:41,160
embarrassed by they've taken down the study from their website most of their studies get put out

353
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,560
in a communication sort of press release the link doesn't work anymore but the study showed that

354
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,440
about one in 20 medications administered in the operating room involved an error and that meant

355
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,000
that about 50 percent of operations had a medication error so every other operation has

356
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,680
some medication error most caught but they did the sort of in-depth analysis of 277 operations

357
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:14,120
at Mass General not a small shabby you know chop shop one of the three best hospitals in the world

358
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,720
certainly in the United States as they like to call it man's greatest hospital i would say to

359
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:26,280
sort of round out the history of patient safety the modern history in 2016 we put out a report

360
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,640
from my Johns Hopkins research team said okay we've been citing this 1999 Institute of Medicine

361
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:37,880
report that about a hundred thousand people a year die from medical mistakes has that number

362
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:44,440
changed in the last 25 years what's the updated number let's look at all the more recent studies

363
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,760
so we did a review and we showed a range where that number had a broad range and the median

364
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,240
point of that range was 250,000 deaths which just would surpass the current number three cause of

365
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:04,120
death stroke and would put it after cancer and heart disease which are far higher 650,000 a year

366
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,400
medical error if it were a disease would rank as the number three cause of death using this

367
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,520
estimate now it's not a perfect estimate we didn't do autopsies on every death we don't have good

368
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,320
numbers but we basically said look if we were to update the number it might even be higher

369
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,760
but the CDC does not collect vital statistics on medical errors because you cannot record a death

370
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,120
as a medical error because there's no billing code for error and that's how we record our national

371
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,000
vital statistics they use the billing code system now but it could also be a lot lower so how would

372
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,800
we put a 95 percent confidence interval around that estimate 125,000 to 350,000 now Joe Johns

373
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,240
put out a study right just before said it was 400,000 and that was the most highly cited study

374
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,680
up until that time and he would argue that our estimate was low we didn't do any original

375
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,800
research we basically pooled together the existing studies which are not perfect but we're just trying

376
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,080
to bring attention to it and as Don Berwick commented on the study whether it's the third

377
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,840
leading cause of death or seventh or ninth it's a major problem so there was a lot of discussion

378
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,800
heated discussion about this estimate this review article a survey was done a third of doctors

379
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,120
believed the estimate a third didn't know and a third didn't believe it and we had this kind of

380
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:30,600
heated discussion or spirited discussion for about a year and then the opioid epidemic hit

381
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:37,560
and opioids emerged as the number one cause of death in the United States among people under 50

382
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,800
opioid deaths were a form of medical error when they were prescription opioids i'm guilty of it

383
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,000
myself i gave opioids out like candy i feel terrible about it that is a form of medical

384
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,720
mistakes we just this year surpassed 100,000 opioid deaths in a trailing 12-month period

385
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:05,160
for the first time yeah 107 so are you saying that that estimate of call it 300,000 deaths

386
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:12,840
is including that 100,000 no this was prior but the 107,000 deaths in the last 12-month period

387
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,440
were any opioids so a lot of that now is fentanyl heroin it would be included that's right so we

388
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,960
don't know the estimate of prescription opioids we think it's down because we've gotten smart

389
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,040
prescription opioid abuse is probably way down because it's more regulated and fentanyl laced

390
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,200
products is driving a lot of the opioid deaths now but we were prescribing peter let's say you know

391
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:45,240
mid-career for me one opioid prescription for every adult in the United States that's how much

392
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,240
we were giving out opioids people didn't need it it was the medicalization of ordinary life

393
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,840
for some people with mild pain a lot of countries said look we only give opioids to people with

394
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:05,000
second degree burns or cancer end of life cancer and acute major surgery in the perioperative

395
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,840
i remember giving a talk in lebanon and i remember offering hey we're doing a lot of work on reducing

396
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,560
opioid prescribing i'm happy to give the opioid talk at this conference and they're like what are

397
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,320
you talking about that's an american problem we've never prescribed opioids outside of extremely

398
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:28,840
narrow scenarios complications of unnecessary medical care normal complications of unnecessary

399
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,240
medical care is a form of medical error and that's where we really tried hard to say let's broaden

400
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:41,720
the idea that people don't just die from disease they die from the care itself so that's a bit of

401
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:48,680
our journey in patient safety which really encompassed our residency peter up until recently

402
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,800
that has been the modern era of patient safety before then no one would ever talk about it

403
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,280
now when you're on rounds people say you know we could give a blood transfusion but the patient

404
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,760
is kind of a borderline indication in terms of whether or not they should get a blood transfusion

405
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:14,440
but we have to consider the fact that one in 80 000 blood transfusions can result in the wrong

406
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:21,320
blood type being passed on from the lab and hurting a patient we never considered the role

407
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,360
of human error in the care of our patients but now like hey do we need to keep people in the

408
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,960
hospital for a week after surgery there's the added risk of falling a new environment tripping over

409
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,520
your gown wearing slippers that are very slippery and they don't make sense they're uncomfortable

410
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,720
and getting an infection in the hospital there are risks to being in the hospital that we have to weigh

411
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:50,760
with the risk where does nosocomial or hospital acquired infection rank in the causes of medical

412
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,960
errors nosocomial infections specifically you're talking about yes it's difficult because some

413
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,680
people consider any infection after surgical care to be a nosocomial infection but not all are

414
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,120
preventable so there was the study out of so like even a wound infection after surgery would be

415
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:16,360
considered nosocomial that's right it would be but it's not necessarily preventable so nosocomial

416
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,840
meaning you're getting it from the hospital may not necessarily be preventable because we're not

417
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,640
going to eradicate bacteria from planet earth and there's a feeling that say with knee replacements

418
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,600
we're pretty darn good you get a knee replacement the risk of an infection is eight tenths to nine

419
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,520
tenths of one percent pretty darn good now what should it be you don't know we may be at the

420
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,120
baseline level they're wearing spacesuits doing the procedure using sterile technique i mean

421
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,200
they're using glue to close the incisions now over the closure so maybe this is the level that

422
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:54,120
we have to accept now there's a debate in patient safety some people say we have to achieve zero

423
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,080
harm and you'll hear that model a lot i worry about that that sounds a little bit like zero

424
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,640
covid to me which is trigger word it creates sort of an unrealistic expectation it might detract

425
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,920
from focusing on bigger things your example of knee replacement is a good one orthopedics have

426
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,120
really figured out how to do joint replacement in the most sterile manner imaginable i'm kind of

427
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,080
curious as to what the bigger opportunities are that are away from this patients falling through

428
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:27,400
the cracks normal complications of interventions they don't need there still are medication errors

429
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,440
but they're not from sloppy handwriting anymore they're from a lack of visual cues in the

430
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,760
patient's chart so now you're entering an order you don't have a binder in front of you with the

431
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,120
patient's name and you know exactly whose chart you're in you're flipping screens you're in

432
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,880
different tabs and you write an order for somebody who didn't need it or the wrong person or something

433
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,000
like that this happened to me actually about a month ago so we use an electronic medical record

434
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,720
in our practice and i was in one patient's chart looking at a bunch of labs and looking at a bunch

435
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,520
of things and we had just switched to a new emr we used one emr for many years and then we just

436
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:14,520
switched to a new one which has a completely different look and when you switch to a new

437
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,040
patient it's not entirely obvious yeah scary again nothing came of it because i wasn't there

438
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:28,600
to prescribe a medication but i was blown away at how long it took me to recognize that i was in

439
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,240
another patient's chart yeah and you do prescribe through this emr so there is a scenario by which

440
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,200
i could have said and again in our practice this is pretty low stakes because we're not prescribing

441
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,640
that many things but i take your point which is you always used to know what mrs smith's chart

442
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,040
looked like because it was the biggest one and you recognized your handwriting in it and you had all

443
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,080
of those other cues that told you where you were i mean that was a pretty miserable system and had

444
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,720
a lot of problems with it but that's one thing it had going for it over an emr and it was cyber

445
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:07,800
secure yeah so the old-fashioned docs who had very good handwriting you can think of probably

446
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,840
one that we know charlie yo they are basically saying look we have a good system people need to

447
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,320
write more effectively another healthy movement that came out of this patient safety endeavor has

448
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:26,840
been the idea that sorry works and what drives malpractice claims is your honesty with patients

449
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,080
not whether or not you make a mistake and i found that to be true in my practice that

450
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,960
if you're very honest with people they're incredibly forgiving i remember ordering a

451
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,840
cat scan i was busy it was between operations it ended up getting done on a wrong patient similar

452
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,440
name done on the wrong patient i don't know if i mixed up the names or the nurse made a clerical

453
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,960
mistake and entering the order because we do a lot of verbal orders you know as attending physicians

454
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,760
and this patient was already angry at me they had a pancreatic leak they just were frustrated

455
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,720
with their care i think their expectations were unreasonable but of course you got to be polite so

456
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,320
this guy was already pissed at me i figure great he just got a cat scan he didn't need it's very

457
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,600
obvious he didn't need it he was recovering now he's going to sue me or something i immediately

458
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,480
hear about this i run up to the patient's room and i say look sir i want to tell you something

459
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,160
you got a cat scan you did not need it was not intended for you i'm not going to sugarcoat it

460
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,040
and say we wanted to make sure and look for something it was a clerical mistake i take full

461
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:38,040
responsibility i'm sorry if you want the results i haven't even seen it yet i just heard about this

462
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,680
and i wanted to tell you first i'll get the results and share the results with you this guy

463
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,920
who had a pissed off look on his face as i walked into his room smiled and looked at me and said

464
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:58,520
doc thank you for being honest with me i really appreciate that and our bond grew we he developed

465
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,160
trust in me and i'm proud to report that guy and i are facebook friends today because he never

466
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,000
sued me and people are hungry for honesty we saw it during covid we see it with so many aspects of

467
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,280
medicine let me share with you a counterpoint to that story i'm not telling something that

468
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,320
isn't already publicly known so very close friend of mine here in austin his name is eddie margain

469
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,440
a wonderful guy and i've gotten to be very close with eddie and one night over dinner we were

470
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,320
talking about this and somehow he brought up the story of his wife lorena at the time i didn't

471
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,760
know this but of course she's written a book about this so again nothing i'm saying here is

472
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,800
is not already publicly known lorena was having some medical issues and had kind of a big workup

473
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,680
and sure enough they found that she had a mass on her adrenal gland so the adrenal gland for listeners

474
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,080
is a small but incredibly important gland that sits on top of the kidney so you have

475
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,680
two kidneys and therefore you have two adrenal glands one on top of each the adrenal gland

476
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,520
produces all sorts of relevant hormones but certainly the ones that we think of the most

477
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:02,280
would be cortisol epinephrine norepinephrine and she had this tumor on her adrenal gland and

478
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,560
obviously the treatment for this is to have it removed and you can live with one adrenal gland

479
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,680
so this is you know a relatively straightforward operation so she had the operation this was here

480
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:17,400
in austin and in the weeks that followed she went from bad to worse she just felt horrible

481
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,760
she couldn't understand what was wrong to make a long story short she ended up eventually going

482
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,080
back to see the doctor only to discover marty that he had taken out the wrong adrenal gland

483
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:32,280
he had removed her healthy adrenal gland and the one with the tumor was still there so now they

484
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,920
needed to go back and have that one removed and so now she is a person who has no adrenal glands

485
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,440
which creates a lifelong challenge you can't live without your adrenal gland so now you are

486
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,320
dependent on exogenous forms of glucocorticoids the story gets even more difficult because there

487
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,200
were more surgical complications and things like that lorana is about the sweetest person you'll

488
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:01,720
ever meet not a negative vindictive bone in her body and she only wanted one thing wasn't money

489
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:08,920
she just wanted an apology and the surgeon wouldn't give it you hear these stories and you

490
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,520
understand the reputation that the field of surgery can sometimes bring on itself he had a

491
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:22,360
million excuses egos the arrogance the hubris he could not bring himself to apologize to this woman

492
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,680
and the lawyers don't help either because many times the hospital lawyers who are

493
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,720
make a lot of policy for doctors they've made a lot of covid policies have been driven by

494
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:38,520
hospital lawyers general counsels of businesses they tell you oftentimes don't talk to them at

495
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,000
all that's right don't talk to the patient don't talk to the family we're going to quickly negotiate

496
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,280
a settlement and we're going to gag everybody in the settlement so they rush to the family oftentimes

497
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,840
before the family even thinks about a claim they realize what happened they rush to the families

498
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,920
and say you know we feel for you and your family they won't apologize and we would like to provide

499
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,480
some compensation here just sign these documents and then everyone's gagged for life and we have

500
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,280
not had an honest conversation about patient safety in america because of that and that's why i wrote

501
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,280
when i wrote the book unaccountable about this issue of patient safety and how we can do better

502
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,280
i wrote in there that we should ban all gagging in medicine this should be an honest profession

503
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,120
no gagging Lorena and Eddie are incredibly successful well off she said out of the gate

504
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,240
we're not here to sue there's no amount of money you can give us it's going to change our lives

505
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,200
we just want to make sure this never happens to anybody again and that's an honest request i

506
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,280
mean it's reasonable if you look at other industries they've achieved high levels of reliability

507
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:49,960
i'm too practical i'm a clinician as you are so i don't subscribe to the zero harm approach

508
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:55,400
i mean sure it's it might be a goal but we have to be honest and look for reasonable improvements

509
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:02,600
in this problem but look at aviation in the last 25 years how many plane accidents have we seen

510
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:09,240
in 2009 there was the flight going to buffalo where 50 people died that's about it in the last

511
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,560
20 years in 2018 there was a woman partially ejected through a window who died but say in

512
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:23,560
the interim nine years 2009 in the u.s in the u.s in the nine years from 2009 to 2018

513
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:31,160
six billion passengers without a single fatality rate today about two million people a day

514
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,760
pilots are not just jumping in the cockpit and start barking orders at each other they have a

515
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:43,080
systematic way to use checklists and pathways and have safety nets and they've created what they

516
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,840
call crew resource management that encourages people as part of the discipline to voice any

517
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,680
concern about safety and not to ridicule anyone who brings up that concern that's a life lesson

518
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,320
that can be used in any setting that you want people to ask questions and even challenge some

519
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,120
deeply held assumptions you may have without ridiculing them if you make fun of them once i

520
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,720
found if you mock a nurse once or yell at them for bringing something up because you're busy

521
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,240
they will never feel as comfortable voicing a concern to you and your patients suffer you

522
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,600
suffer from that lack of safety culture so marty we wouldn't be probably even having this discussion

523
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:29,960
if it weren't for a case that has gained a lot of notoriety slash awareness over the past year and

524
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,760
certainly in the past couple of months since the verdict on his trial but let's assume that a lot

525
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,600
of people aren't familiar with this case from vanderbilt can you walk us through in detail the

526
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,880
timeline of events if my memory serves me correctly this all took place in was it 2017 or 2018

527
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:51,240
2017 all right so take us back to that fateful day in 2017 so this is an amazing story on so

528
00:50:51,240 --> 00:51:00,600
many different levels redonda vat is a 36 year old nurse who was hired at vanderbilt in 2015

529
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:09,480
now christmas eve 2017 she was taking care of a patient named charlene murphy 75 year old woman

530
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:16,120
who was admitted for a subdural hematoma or a brain bleed actually improved quickly and two days

531
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:23,400
later she was ready to leave and they ordered the doctors ordered sort of one last scan while she

532
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:31,240
was in the hospital the nurse redonda took her to the scanner and ordered some versed there was

533
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:37,960
some versed ordered which is a sedative to help people stay still during the scan this was ordered

534
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,480
in the icu before she came down or who ordered the versed presumably the physician who was caring

535
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,840
for her and the nurses will often say look can i have an open order for versed if i need to use it

536
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,680
in the cat scanner and every now and then the radiologist will order it while they're down

537
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,480
there they'll say hey this person's having trouble staying steady can we get a versed order

538
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,160
i mean how many times have you and i said yes to that request so it's a commonly used medication

539
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:10,360
in that scanner she goes into a system relatively new system that's got automated dispensing

540
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,440
there had been many complaints that there are too many alerts and you often have to override the

541
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,840
system because there was not good coordination between the electronic health records and the

542
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:32,200
pharmacy so in this system you frequently had to override alerts well she types in v e to order the

543
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:40,840
versed and up comes maybe through a default vecuronium which is a paralyzing agent it's a potent

544
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:47,560
paralyzing agent and gives it to the patient so just to be clear so she's typing in ve it

545
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:55,400
auto populates v ec vecuronium instead of ver versed she doesn't realize this she clicks on it

546
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,880
what is this like a little mobile pixus device that she's traveling with i'm assuming she's in

547
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,760
the radiology suite when this happens or is she doing this back in the icu i'm not sure the

548
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:12,600
location but it's clear that she typed in ve vecuronium comes out now she had to override the

549
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:20,360
alert there was an alert and the vecuronium came up as a powder when most people would know versed

550
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:26,120
as a liquid but there are other things that come up as powders and you just have to inject some

551
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,560
saline to suspend the powder that was a warning flag you know we talked about the swiss cheese

552
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:39,880
model she reportedly was distracted and she suspends the powder into a solution the cap

553
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,840
should routinely and by the way just for folks to understand why would vecuronium even be

554
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:50,280
there it's really only something that can be used when a patient is either in surgery

555
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:57,080
and they're fully anesthetized and on a ventilator or in the icu under the same conditions there's

556
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,840
no other need for vecuronium other than in a patient who is on a ventilator that's right so

557
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,240
presumably because this patient was in the icu i mean otherwise you shouldn't even have vecuronium

558
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,920
in the pixus system right that's right and the cap routinely has on the cap emergency drug

559
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,800
warning it has a little warning on the cap so there are a bunch of these sort of and it had that

560
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:23,320
did have that it routinely has that i want to be very careful with my words i didn't see

561
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,320
documentation that that one had it but it routinely has that as a standard thing now

562
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,720
she immediately because this is a potent paralytic agent paralyzed the patient and she died now they

563
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:40,120
were not in the icu to immediately resuscitate the patient it's a tragedy the woman was 75

564
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,920
otherwise going to go home van der bilt had documentation where two neurologists

565
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:55,000
listed the cause of death as basically the brain bleed and it was deemed essentially a natural

566
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,840
cause of death this was reported to the medical examiner and how is that even possible the woman

567
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:08,040
was presumably wide awake when she went down to have one more scan before leaving the hospital

568
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:15,960
that's right she dies on the scanner and the cause of death was stated as cerebral hemorrhage or

569
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:23,480
subdural hematoma that's right so the family was told what she just died on the scanner the family

570
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:29,160
has been gagged and basically is not speaking about the case although one family member told

571
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:37,000
the media that they want to see the maximum penalty to her and the grandson said that the

572
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,280
woman who died would have forgiven the nurse now the nurse immediately feels horrible says exactly

573
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:52,360
what she did recognized her mistake as the patient was deteriorating felt this i may have caused this

574
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:59,880
and admitted reported this whole thing was 100 honest i mean in an incredible way has even said

575
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:06,920
subsequently that her life will never be the same that she feels that a piece of her has died i think

576
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,520
we've all been a part of medical mistakes where we still think about that the medical examiner does

577
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,400
not investigate the case because the report is a brain bleed so in other words the death certificate

578
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,480
which is usually filled out at that moment let's walk people through how this works marty because

579
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,720
again you and i take this for granted because we've done it a thousand times i don't think people

580
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,360
understand how this works so this woman stops breathing in the MRI scanner i assume it was an

581
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,920
MRI not a CT if they were trying to paralyze her or trying to sedate her but whatever it was so they

582
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,720
declare her dead there or maybe they would take her up to the ICU and try to resuscitate her

583
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,600
further but certainly within minutes she's going to be declared dead do we know if they intubated

584
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:54,040
her and kept her alive for a little while longer until they declared her brain dead i don't know

585
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,080
the timing of the death but they attempted a full resuscitation right you would as soon as you

586
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,760
recognize this anybody who's recognized to be unresponsive like this and desaturating would

587
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:11,880
immediately be resuscitated the point is at some point when they cease to resuscitate her and or

588
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:18,600
when they declare end of life usually a resident fills out a death certificate at that point now

589
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,040
i don't know how many of those things i've filled out in my life but it's a very painful process

590
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,280
nobody wants to do it no no nobody wants to be the one to have to sign the death certificate

591
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,080
and fill it out you have to be very careful in what you write on it because it wants a primary

592
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,040
cause of death a secondary cause of death and you have to write on the right line and it has to be

593
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,600
i remember it has to be i don't know maybe this is done electronically now but certainly at the

594
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,320
time i remember having to redo many of these things they get sent back to me for months and

595
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,880
months and months until i got it just right but somebody had to write on that death certificate

596
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:58,440
subdural hematoma is the proximate cause of death well two vanderbilt neurologists issued this report

597
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:06,920
and this came up later the medical examiner down the road two years later changes the cause of death

598
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:13,000
to accidental they get tipped off by whom by a report that comes out so it'll be clear here

599
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,680
as i progress basically within a month vanderbilt this is per investigative reporting by the tennessean

600
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:27,720
quote unquote the tennessean reports that vanderbilt takes several actions to obscure the fatal error

601
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:34,120
from the public okay it was not reported to state or federal officials that's required by law you've

602
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,920
got to report it to the state and you've got to report it to cms center for medicare and medicaid

603
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,480
services was not done report any death or any death that is deemed accidental any what we call

604
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,320
sentinel event which is clearly a preventable adverse event related death it will be referred

605
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,200
to as a sentinel event they've got to be reported not reported to the joint commission you could

606
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,520
argue that's an accrediting body it's private you can break their rules it's not a violation of the

607
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:07,960
law but vanderbilt basically takes these actions to hide or obscure the error according to the

608
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:14,520
tennessean from their investigation they fire the nurse and vanderbilt this is two years after no

609
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:21,000
this is a month after a month after okay vanderbilt immediately negotiates an out-of-court settlement

610
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,800
with the family gags the family from saying anything about it everybody is gagged in the

611
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,920
family except for the grandson who is legally not included in the gagging he ends up speaking up

612
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:36,920
later the hospital when they're asked subsequently about the case say oh we can't discuss it because

613
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:43,160
of this legal settlement that we have by the way they don't say anything publicly fast forward a

614
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:48,520
couple months so just to make sure i understand we're a month after this woman dies the death

615
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:55,400
certificate and the neurologists all agree she died of subdural hematoma but clearly the family

616
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,760
has been told the truth which is why they're receiving a large settlement and asked to sign

617
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:08,360
a gag order and the nurse is being fired that's right the nurse redonda vaught gets a job at another

618
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:14,520
hospital as a bed coordinator which all hospitals have bed coordinators it's a hospital called

619
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:21,000
centennial in nashville and then you go all the way to the fall in october remember this happened

620
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:29,560
christmas eve so you're almost a year out an anonymous person reports to the state and cms

621
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:35,080
that there was an unreported medical error okay they basically got tipped off by some whistleblower

622
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:42,360
who's anonymous then the tennessee health department which is tipped off formally states that they're

623
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:50,040
deciding not to pursue any action on this tip off the agency actually said in a letter that the

624
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:57,560
event did not constitute a violation and therefore they're not going to do anything now just as an

625
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:03,400
interesting side note many of these state medical boards are basically sleepy organizations if you

626
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,560
know the story of dr death tell the story neurosurgeon in texas multiple horrific catastrophic

627
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,680
outcomes all believed to be sentinel events catastrophic avoidable medical mistakes

628
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:21,640
negligence and people dying in this practice over many years documented by laurel beal in this famous

629
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:27,880
podcast maybe at one point it was the most popular single podcast in the entire world of

630
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:34,520
podcasting titled doctor death and basically everyone knew of this doctor's problems

631
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:40,200
the residency program knew but they just graduated him to sort of get rid of him he had problems at

632
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,440
numerous hospitals nobody would say anything and this kind of speaks to this problem of

633
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,600
the old culture of patient safety finally there's something so egregious that happens that he gets

634
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,080
arrested and goes to jail now the state medical board didn't want to touch it for the longest

635
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,200
times that's typical of state medical boards they generally don't want to touch anything now

636
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:05,880
ironically you can meet dr death and kill people and they don't touch it but if you prescribe

637
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,560
ivermectin all of heaven and earth is coming down on you now i don't believe ivermectin has any

638
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:18,280
activity against covet i should just state that but it has no downside and i don't recommend it

639
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:25,240
i'm not but i mean right now they're going after people with who prescribe ivermectin with warnings

640
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:32,920
and they want your hide if you prescribe ivermectin just an irony so they basically say that she does

641
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,120
not violate the statutes and or the rules governing the profession they put out a statement

642
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,000
tennessee department of health this is late 2018 yeah this is almost a year after the event

643
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:49,400
and can you imagine what she's thinking like you just want it to be over things are escalating

644
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,560
did she ever speak to the family was she permitted to apologize to the family

645
01:02:54,200 --> 01:03:01,160
she was under orders by vanderbilt never to speak to the family but she had said through the media

646
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:07,000
several times that she takes full responsibility she even said in her trial that she was a hundred

647
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,440
percent at fault which is i think beating herself up over something that was probably a combination

648
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:20,840
of her mistake and a system but i'll leave my commentary out of this so cms starts investigating

649
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,760
medicare when they send they take this seriously this whistleblower complaint they do a surprise

650
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:34,280
investigation at vanderbilt end of october early november they spend about a week investigating

651
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:41,720
vanderbilt they are pissed vanderbilt clearly did not report this clearly a violation and they

652
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:50,200
get so serious about this they basically conclude that the medical error was not reported in

653
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:57,160
violation of their rules and they threaten all medicare payments to the institutions

654
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:03,640
to vanderbilt they are serious and that's when this becomes public about a year after the event

655
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:10,520
because vanderbilt would not discuss it but a journalist was able to get a hold of this report

656
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:16,520
from medicare because it's public document it's public agency they have to request a follow-up or

657
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,160
did they just get it on their own that was not through a foya that was public information but

658
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:27,560
no names were in there so redonda void is still basically not a name in the united states at this

659
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:35,640
point now cms told vanderbilt if you cannot show that you have taken system-wide actions to prevent

660
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,760
this in the future we are going to suspend all medicare payments to vanderbilt university medical

661
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,320
center if you talk about a threat it's maybe the biggest threat in health care in the modern era

662
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:50,360
vanderbilt gives cms a so-called plan of correction you know here's what we're doing

663
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:56,520
we're taking this seriously and they don't release that to the public a journalist then

664
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:03,000
got that plan of correction through a foya request freedom of information act request try to get it

665
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,240
from vanderbilt directly but they were denied then on february 19th the name redonda thought

666
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:18,600
became public information when she was arrested for reckless homicide and impairment abusing an

667
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:24,440
adult now that's when people found out about what happened just to make sure i understand that she

668
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:31,720
was arrested she was arrested tell me how that happened so a d-aid saw the case and said we're

669
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:38,920
going to press charges that's right the district attorney in davison county basically said

670
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:45,320
we're gonna go after her let's stop there for a second how often does that happen that a medical

671
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:52,840
mistake happens and a district attorney presses criminal charges against the doctor the nurse or

672
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:58,440
technician or whoever is involved i have been in this field of patient safety my entire career

673
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:06,600
i've never heard of it with a nurse i have heard of outright fraud resulting in arrests for example

674
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,400
the doctor death story there's a doctor in michigan who was giving chemotherapy to people

675
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:17,160
who didn't have cancer i mean that's sort of cold-blooded fraud if you exclude two types of errors if

676
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:23,960
you exclude fraud so all financial crimes that are fraud and if you include like doctors who are

677
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:30,440
raping patients where they're just breaking the law i'm talking about a medical error that was not

678
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,280
made deliberately never heard of it never heard of an arrest for an honest medical mistake

679
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:41,720
and in fact one of the principles of patient safety that we have been advocating throughout

680
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:47,880
the entire 25 23 years of the patient safety movement in america has been the concept of

681
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:56,600
just culture which is a doctrine which says that honest mistakes should not be penalized they

682
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,240
should be penalized if there was mal intent or substance abuse or somebody should be suspended

683
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:08,120
from their role if they are an ongoing threat but honest mistakes should not be penalized and that

684
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:14,920
is a doctrine that has enabled people to speak up about this epidemic of medical mistakes in the

685
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,800
united states and that has been celebrated as these sort of giant milestone of the american

686
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,600
patient safety movement and it's a worldwide concept i've traveled the world and people

687
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:33,720
believe in the just culture doctrine the arrest of redonda voight undid in my opinion 23 years of

688
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:41,000
advancement in patient safety it undermined the very fundamental doctrine of just culture she

689
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:49,000
was arrested by the way she had the entire time in documents that subsequently came out immediately

690
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,800
admitted what happened at the moment this woman died and throughout and ever since and to this day

691
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:01,960
and i've had a recent interaction with her i can touch on that but basically the victim's family

692
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,360
one of the members of the family had basically said the patient would have forgiven her so the

693
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,400
trial started when right now we're about a year after but because of covid the trial doesn't start

694
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,640
until i think it was like this past fall right three months ago march 21st to 25th about a four

695
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,640
day period so in the interim there was a meeting of the tennessee board of licensure basically the

696
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,680
department of health you remember they had said they're not going to pursue this they then flip

697
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:34,280
the executive at vanderbilt university c right pinson who's actually a pancreatic

698
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:42,200
billiary surgeon i know him he sort of admits to this board that looks into vanderbilt and says

699
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,720
yes the death was not reported essentially i'm paraphrasing and that our response at vanderbilt

700
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,480
was too limited now at this point redonda vaught is getting a lot of national attention that she's

701
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,760
got big legal bills and she goes on a go fund me campaign raises over a hundred thousand dollars

702
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:04,200
and basically says in the go fund me campaign that look she made a mistake and she needs legal costs

703
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,880
i mean this woman could not have been more honest about what happened also around that time nurses

704
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:16,520
nationwide take notice there's millions of nurses in the united states they start getting

705
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,800
very emotionally connected to this they start showing up at some of these hearings in front of

706
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:28,440
the department of health and they say i am redonda that becomes a slogan that nurses around the

707
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,440
country take on they put it on social media they stand outside hundreds of them around the time of

708
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:42,360
her trial with signs i am redonda basically saying what you and i were saying it's every doctor every

709
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:49,960
nurse i talked to was talking with zubin debani same reaction i see exactly what may have happened

710
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,640
gosh that could have been me look at the study from mayo clinic 10.5 of people admit to a major

711
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:02,520
medical mistake in the last three months people reconnect with redonda vaught several dozen people

712
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:09,160
are out every appearance she makes her court plea in february of 2019 just about a year after

713
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:15,080
the incident year in a month she pleads not guilty now her lawyers argue that vanderbilt shares part

714
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:21,080
of the blame now several months later the tennessee department of health which said they're not going

715
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:27,480
to pursue action against her they flip they reverse their position and they go after her

716
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:33,480
and they use the argument that they must immediately investigate what they describe

717
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,600
as a threat to the public her lawyer knowing that they're going to go to trial for the criminal case

718
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:46,360
for murder or homicide he asks the judge to postpone the tennessee department of health hearing

719
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:51,160
because he sees wait i'm sorry marty i just missed something i don't think i was paying attention

720
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:58,680
this was homicide not manslaughter homicide this is homicide reckless homicide and abuse

721
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,400
now she has two hearings and for two legal proceedings ahead of her about a year after

722
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:11,080
the incident year and a half out she's got the tennessee health board and she's got the criminal

723
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:16,520
case to go so her lawyer says look tennessee health board they're acting like a bunch of clowns i'm

724
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:22,360
paraphrasing they said they're not going to take any action and then over a year later they suddenly

725
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:28,680
reverse their position what's going on so he makes this argument and the tennessee department of health

726
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:34,120
says very fishy they say no we must do this immediately we cannot postpone it till after the

727
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:40,040
criminal trial because she may pose an quote-unquote urgent threat to the public you can't believe what

728
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:46,600
you're hearing here the administrative judge elizabeth cambron decides not to delay her

729
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,760
department of health hearing and it goes ahead of her criminal hearing and she ends up going in

730
01:11:52,760 --> 01:12:00,920
front of this board at the same time vanderbilt is just hanging out arguing they can't say anything

731
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:06,200
about the case this tennessee investigation says that they've obscured the circumstances

732
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:13,640
of her death and this grandson is so frustrated he makes a statement around then that says that

733
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:19,560
vanderbilt is engaged and remember he's not under the gag order he says quote-unquote that there's

734
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:27,640
a cover-up that screams there's a cover-up that screams covid comes hits this country if you

735
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:35,640
haven't remembered that's a coronavirus that resulted in two pandemics a tragic pandemic which

736
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,640
killed about a million americans and then a subsequent pandemic that followed called a

737
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:46,680
pandemic of lunacy but in july finally they get their trial the first one is the department of

738
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:53,320
health she says that the department of health hearing this is completely my fault her license

739
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,800
is revoked even though the board says things that we would sympathize with they say the vice chair

740
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:07,000
of the board says we all make mistakes and there have been many mistakes and failures in this case

741
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,480
suggesting basically that vanderbilt has part of the blame but they say our role is just to evaluate

742
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:18,280
the role of the nurse here and they revoke her license kind of ridiculous what their statements

743
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:26,920
are then three months ago it goes to the criminal trial and the davison county d-a glen funk has

744
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:35,000
his three assistant d-a's go to the mat in court and they aggressively and viciously went after her

745
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,920
these three assistant d-a's debbie household chad jackson and britney flat recently became

746
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:51,000
assistant d-a's it's kind of a new job for them and they go viciously after her and argue that

747
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,640
there was negligent homicide now she does everything she can to try to defend herself

748
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,920
now what's their argument their argument is this was such an egregious error i guess i'm just trying

749
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:08,120
to understand how this is homicide maybe i just don't understand the law well enough but if you

750
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:12,600
kill somebody while you're driving let's assume you're not under the influence of alcohol or

751
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:19,560
anything like that and you're not driving recklessly you're driving safely and you kill a cyclist

752
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:25,160
i'm not aware of a driver in that situation having i certainly know this was the case in

753
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,400
california when i lived there but i know that there was no instance in which a driver who killed a

754
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:36,680
cyclist faced criminal charges unless there was reckless behavior involved or alcohol so what

755
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:43,160
rises to the level of even manslaughter vehicular manslaughter is presumably what is that when you're

756
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,560
driving recklessly and another person dies as a result of it like i guess i'm just trying to

757
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:53,560
understand what the da's argument was here legally and then separately politically i don't

758
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,240
know if you can speak to either of those of course these are broader questions those are the same

759
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:02,120
questions i had i'll tell you what i know and that is that she was charged with quote unquote

760
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:09,160
negligent homicide and abuse of an impaired adult and found guilty of both of those charges now in

761
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,080
the arguments that they made they had cited 10 mistakes that she had made and it was kind of the

762
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,720
swiss cheese model that we had talked about with patient safety this is the perfect storm if you

763
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:28,200
will it was she was distracted she overrode the warning alert even though nurses at that hospital

764
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:35,320
say that they do that every day nurses said every day they override alerts that it was a powder and

765
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:40,920
not a liquid that the cap should have said it was a paralyzing agent there's so many things that they

766
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,720
point to that you can frame somebody you can make somebody look like they are doing something

767
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:50,760
that is can you imagine if they had the insights that we have at our m&m conference it would just

768
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:56,760
look really bad on the outside they did everything they could to paint these are aggressive young

769
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:03,000
lawyers now glenn funk who's the da who was getting a lot of attention around this time

770
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,120
because this is his office that was bringing the charges against a vanderbilt nurse for a medical

771
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:14,600
mistake that was an honest mistake that she admitted to immediately he had two other vas who

772
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,480
are running against him condemn this saying you know this is a farce what's going on something is

773
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:27,560
fishy here there are rumors conspiracy theories in nashville that maybe there was some entity

774
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:34,040
behind this oddly aggressive action against this nurse a competing health system andrebellt

775
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:39,480
university itself to bring attention away from its error and not reporting and other errors

776
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:44,280
related to this case i don't know i have no opinion on any of those but those are definitely

777
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:50,040
circulating ideas because to have a da so aggressively go after a nurse for an honest

778
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:59,080
mistake was such a significant charge it is odd it is odd now she was found guilty and sentenced

779
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:05,160
very recently and in the sentencing she was convicted of homicide that's right found guilty

780
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:12,680
negligent homicide and in the sentencing what was the possible range of sentences she could

781
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,560
receive i know what the sentence was and we'll talk about that but coming out of the trial

782
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,920
what was the potential the judge had considered three years of jail time but of course the judge

783
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:28,920
could have said whatever the judge wanted to say they could have said 20 years or a lifetime

784
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:35,320
negligent homicide is not something where i think there's a ceiling on how many years you can give

785
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:42,680
somebody did legal experts have a point of view on what was expected i've not heard any experts

786
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:48,120
comment on what was expected i think at every stage in this entire case people expected

787
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:54,280
the thing to end the da would say she's been through the ringer now we're going to basically

788
01:17:54,280 --> 01:18:00,120
slap her on the wrist and do a settlement or something like that never happened and so as

789
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:07,640
this grows nurses around the country are finding they connect with her a bunch of letters that came

790
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:13,800
out just after this sentencing after the sentencing or after the conviction after the sentencing okay

791
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:19,320
let's tell people what the sentence was so the judge was merciful to give her three years of

792
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:25,000
probation and so there'll be no jail time for her but she's a convicted felon for the rest of her

793
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,440
life well not for the rest of her life because she got something called judicial diversion which means

794
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:37,080
that they can expunge her criminal record if she serves the probationary period on good behavior

795
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:44,040
so you know an act of mercy from god there and god i'm not referring to the judge i'm referring to

796
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,760
you know so the prosecution i'm sure was very upset with that sentence it sort of undermined

797
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:54,920
a lot of their efforts yep here is what one vanderbilt physician you know these letters of

798
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,680
support started coming out of the public here's what a vanderbilt physician wrote and i think

799
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:05,240
this vanderbilt physician speaks for many of us he said we cared referring to the nurse that he

800
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:10,600
worked with redonda voigt we cared for so many patients together what was notable what was the

801
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:16,440
consistent high level of attention i saw her to provide to so many of our patients and their

802
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:23,400
families when we worked together she was very conscientious and aptly cared for many complex

803
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:28,120
patients all these letters of support of people she worked with at vanderbilt come out lots of

804
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:34,440
vanderbilt physicians pissed off at what's happening they're not happy that their impeccable

805
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,400
medical care is getting characterized nationally by the actions of their administration here's

806
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:44,760
what the da's office did in response to these letters that were released they released this

807
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:52,360
letter i am sickened by those who rallied around her as a hero i thought she was a horrible

808
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:59,000
anomaly but now i think there are hundreds of thousands of nurses who must also be dangerous

809
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:07,960
practitioners since they defended the indefensible so readily that was lisa bergelko she is an

810
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:13,160
assistant professor at newman university she wrote that letter in support of the da's prosecution and

811
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:18,360
the da put that letter out in the public domain almost as a and who is this professor she's a

812
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:25,960
professor of what she's a professor of nursing i see she's a nurse herself so this is the saga

813
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:33,320
that we live with now and in my opinion we have had decades of progress in patient safety about 23

814
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:39,240
healthy years of significant improvements in the culture of safety in the way we approach safety

815
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:46,920
undone with a single group of assistant young district attorneys that decide to go after

816
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:55,160
one individual at the exclusion of doing anything about a hospital that unlike the nurse did not

817
01:20:55,160 --> 01:21:01,240
admit to anything initially and broke the law what do you think is the fallout of this have you

818
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:11,000
spoken with nurses or doctors in the interval since the conviction explicitly about this and

819
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,320
do you have any anecdotal evidence that that's going to change the culture of reporting an open

820
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:24,200
and honest dialogue around medical mistakes there's a preliminary statistic that one in five

821
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:29,240
nurses in the profession are quitting during the pandemic now some of that is pandemic burnout

822
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:36,440
some of its a number of factors but a lot of nurses are leading the profession and there's

823
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:42,920
this feeling that they don't feel valued and this has been a bit of a smack in their face and so

824
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,720
hospitals around the country who are dealing with real critical nursing staffing shortages

825
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:53,720
are trying to pay attention to the concerns that nurses have about this case they're trying to make

826
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:59,800
it clear that this is not their approach i have talked to lawmakers at the state level in different

827
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:05,960
states we're thinking about passing protections for nurses to try to encourage people in nursing

828
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:12,600
if you look at the protection that police officers have they have an immunity intrinsic to their jobs

829
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:19,560
and should that immunity be extended to people like redonda vod it's delicate but this is now

830
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:25,640
a new conversation that has surfaced i also had an interaction with her and that is that she had

831
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:33,080
reached out for help to our friend zubin and zubin had passed that information on to me now i get so

832
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:39,000
many of these requests you know i've been unfairly sued or i'm going to court or i have a deposition

833
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,840
can you help i honestly just did not see the email i felt horrible once i saw that this blew up and

834
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:51,880
zubin had pointed out to me that he had sent me this email and i reached out to her and just

835
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:58,440
basically told her like if i can be an expert witness or help i'm happy to do so on your behalf

836
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:06,520
so i found her to have an incredible spirit good attitude i feel bad for her she was crying at the

837
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:12,280
trial when she was found guilty but that is my interaction that i've had with her maybe to put

838
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,520
a bow on all of this if you're someone listening to this and you're thinking about how you can

839
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:21,320
interact with the healthcare system it seems that the majority of medical errors take place

840
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:27,800
inside of hospitals is that a fair assessment yes it makes for a frightening experience when

841
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,080
you're going to a hospital because usually if you're going to a hospital even if it's

842
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,320
electively you're going to have an elective surgery or you know you're going there non-electively

843
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,680
which is even more frightening the medical side of it is bad enough in terms of what you're worried

844
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,600
about and what could happen but i think this discussion we've had over the last you know

845
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:51,400
whatever 90 minutes speaks to another threat that might even rival that threat my personal view is

846
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:56,600
it's less than that but we'll never know that answer potentially what can a person do if they

847
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:02,920
or their loved ones are going to be admitted to the hospital either electively or emergently to

848
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:09,320
reduce the odds of any of these medical errors they run the gamut from incorrect medicine

849
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:16,360
administration to unnecessary procedures there's no end to what these mistakes look like is there

850
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,680
anything that the patient or the patient's family can do to reduce the risk of that there's a lot

851
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:25,960
so first of all things are much better in my opinion hospitals are safer there's more awareness

852
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,520
when you bring up these questions or issues there's attention to them every hospital has

853
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:36,280
a patient relations department and if things just don't seem right if you feel that you're not

854
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:42,520
communicating effectively with your care team you feel care is not coordinated you have a concern

855
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,720
or there was an error you can call the patient relations department they've got somebody on call

856
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:53,960
24 7 that's basically a standard thing in the hospitals now it's important to have an advocate

857
01:24:53,960 --> 01:25:01,000
with you anytime you get medical care you've got a loved one in the hospital it's amazing how it

858
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:07,080
seems that the care is just overall much better holistic comprehensive and coordinated when

859
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:13,160
there's a family member or loved one there could be a friend but they're they're taking notes they're

860
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:18,440
asking questions when you come in for rounds they're asking to talk to the doctor who's in

861
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:24,360
charge of their care at least once a day they sometimes set an appointment where they say look

862
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,360
i'd love to talk to the doctor and you can communicate this often through the nurse or

863
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:33,480
the nursing assistant to say is there a time i can plan to be here where i can speak with the

864
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:40,040
doctor caring for so and so it's important to ask about alternatives we've generally had this sort

865
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:46,920
of burnout mode response to any questions in medicine as residents where if they ask any

866
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:52,520
question you just tell them they could die if they don't have something done and you don't get into

867
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,200
the details and it's like look we got to just ship and load and unload the trucks if we're told

868
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:03,960
this person needs a CAT scan on rounds we're supposed to see that it gets done and we may not

869
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:11,000
have a good breadth of knowledge as a young trainee of the alternatives some people do a good job

870
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,280
other people may not be able to present those options well if you ask the right questions

871
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:24,280
and ask about alternatives so for example you're supposed to go down to have a filter put in your

872
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,040
large vein in your body called a vena cava and you might say wait a minute you know typically

873
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:36,440
we decide on rounds this gets done the intern explains hey the doctors want to put a filter in

874
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:41,160
they may or may not even explain it sometimes you get patient transport shows up to take you down

875
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:46,360
there and patients not really in the loop you know they're getting medications they don't even

876
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:51,080
know what they're getting what's getting infused what they're taking by mouth the more they can be

877
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:58,040
aware of what's happening ask about the reason for those and the alternatives the better the

878
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:03,960
care is going to be yeah that's a hard ask though marty medicine really is a foreign language and i

879
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:10,120
think back to when i was a trainee i'd like to think i was pretty good at explaining things

880
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,440
but you were you're laying there in a bed you've got an iv a nurse is coming in and

881
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:20,600
usually putting something into an iv or giving you a little cap with pills in it patients are

882
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,760
really intimidated to say can you tell me what each of these pills is and tell me what each one of

883
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:33,080
them does we now have a protocol if you will that our nurses are supposed to explain to the patient

884
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:38,520
every medication that they give them so let's say it's time for your twice a day

885
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:46,600
lasek medication which is laseks is a medication that's given to move body fluid from the third

886
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:52,680
spaces in your body into your urinary system so if you've got too much fluid in your body it'll

887
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:58,760
cause you to urinate some of that fluid out so the nurses will actually explain to the patients

888
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:06,120
i'm injecting some laseks medication this is a medication to address the swelling in your body

889
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:12,280
and it will cause you to urinate more and so this is actually a big effort right now in patient

890
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:18,440
safety and we actually had a protocol for a while where we had one of our doctors actually peter

891
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:24,600
pronevos say on the closed circuit television in the patient rooms ask us questions ask about the

892
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:31,400
medication that's being given to you you should know what it is and what it's for and you should

893
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:37,320
ask your doctor or whoever walks in the room nurse if they've washed their hands and it became this

894
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:42,040
sort of partnership where we want you to ask hey have you washed your hands before it was kind of

895
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:48,120
like how dare you ask me of course i washed my hands of course we didn't always do it but this

896
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:53,800
is the sort of new dialogue that we are trying to promote to make the patient a participant in their

897
01:28:53,800 --> 01:29:00,120
care and not just a bystander and when you do it what i've noticed the more educated they are

898
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:05,960
or their surrogate the better the care is you know many times they just say wait wait this does not

899
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:10,600
make sense you know what we're doing here they were supposed to have this and this why not do

900
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:16,920
it at the same time this doctor wants to do this and this and so i do see improvements a change in

901
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:23,640
the culture a awareness and this effort to educate people and the more people can do it i mean you

902
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:28,760
are in the middle of a very complicated system of care when you're in the hospital i mean the more

903
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:33,320
you can be aware of what's happening the safer the care what's the biggest thing that has to

904
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,440
change or biggest three things that have to change to be sitting here in 10 years and say

905
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,760
we've cut that medical error death rate down by 50 what would have to happen payment reform number

906
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:50,520
one so there's not really a great financial incentive for better safety if a hospital is

907
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:57,000
safer what is their financial reward we know there's an altruistic moral reward and we know

908
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,160
people generally like that but a lot of times the cfo's are making the decisions they want to see an

909
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:07,960
roi and you bring in something to a hospital that say is going to reduce the number of misses in

910
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:15,480
radiology let's say there's a software program that will take a second look at chest x-rays and chest

911
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:22,520
CAT scans to look for lesions that the radiologist missed and if it's identified with the AI that can

912
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:29,240
pick up lesions now pretty sensitively but that lesion is not noted in the report by the radiologist

913
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,480
this is all sort of digital this is all computers are doing this they do the AI they look for the

914
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:41,560
reports look for the keywords that there's a tumor lesion coin size lesion and they can reconcile

915
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:47,000
in our systems whether or not there's a discrepancy and by the way what i'm describing is a real

916
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,160
product out there that's used at Sutter Health AI is used to look at the scans as sort of a second

917
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:58,360
check the same thing has been done with EKGs and then they look for discrepancies in the reports

918
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:05,560
and if the AI picks it up and the report doesn't then that list of that patient having an unreconciled

919
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:11,640
difference goes to the radiologist and they're to review that list of non-reconciled differences

920
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:18,760
between the AI and the radiologist now what is the ROI to the hospital on adopting that technology

921
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:27,160
zero negative it's a cost that's not rewarded and so what we've done is we've relied on the

922
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:33,640
values of executives to adopt technologies that they believe in many times the doctors are the

923
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:37,960
champions for this the head of radiology says you know i know this is not going to be great for our

924
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:43,160
bottom line but we're doing well financially let's adopt it let's be honest many hospitals had their

925
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:50,200
most profitable year last year and some hospitals have so much cash reserves reserves are so great

926
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:56,120
that they have investment arms and they're basically hedge funds with hospitals on the side

927
01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:01,640
at this point some of these medical centers they have so much money in cash so we rely on

928
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:07,720
individuals and innovators to say there's no formal ROI that you're going to see on the bottom

929
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:14,680
line immediately but we believe this is better care and you're seeing that adoption very sporadically

930
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:20,920
and very haphazardly there's a lot of the patient safety innovations that make sense but they have a

931
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,720
tough time getting in so we've got to change the payment model that i think is the number one

932
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:30,840
but i thought you said that CMS was already saying we're not going to reimburse for

933
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:37,960
cases where there are errors that's a stick more than it is a carrot but has that changed the

934
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:45,720
culture that has changed the culture but it's only not reimbursing three specific types of errors

935
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:53,480
which are three types of what we call never events which is death of an ultra low risk person

936
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:59,560
in the operating room at the time of surgery a retained sponge or retained foreign object

937
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,320
there's an airway never event which you know nobody should die of an airway

938
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:09,000
lack of an airway exposure so these are very narrow events they're rare events and so yeah

939
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,840
CMS is not paying for it which has put a ton of attention on these issues and the reporting to the

940
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:20,120
state on these issues has created a ton of scrutiny around these events and those events are

941
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:26,120
i mean the counting process we do now coming out of surgery is intense you know it started off when

942
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:31,640
we were residents like yeah i think we got all the sponges and instruments out okay and then it went

943
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:37,160
to the nurse do we have all the sponges and instruments out on the set yeah we've got them

944
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:42,280
all then it was count them to make sure it's the same number we started with and then it was a

945
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:50,520
formal count that was recorded and now it's an RFID or scanned barcode scan system and so we've

946
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:56,600
matured a lot with that that's because of this intense scrutiny around this particular type of

947
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:03,800
mistake now if you over prescribe opioids after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery i mean OB doctors

948
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:08,440
will tell you you should not be giving opioids through uncomplicated vaginal delivery and yet

949
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:15,560
women will go home with a bottle or other minor procedures and so if you prescribe 30 opioids when

950
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:22,600
we know best practices would never allow more than 10 opioid pills in a narcotic naive adult

951
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:29,960
that's an error but are we even measuring it now at hopkins just began the measurement and data

952
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:35,400
feedback process for that type of error i wish there was more attention and if i could say one

953
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:45,160
more thing i probably shouldn't but what the heck during covid we saw this intense bias towards

954
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:51,560
laboratory research that the only real serious type of research is laboratory research done

955
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:58,360
under a hood in a laboratory at places like the nih and that's how we solve disease that all this

956
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:05,080
other stuff the stuff marty's interested in systems change standardizing processes that soft stuff

957
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:11,880
culture speaking up and that's not really science and so what you have is all of our health agencies

958
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:18,200
really entirely focused on laboratory medicine and what happens is you get young investigators

959
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:24,760
faculty they can't get grants to do research on this stuff they're not rewarded they don't get

960
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:29,080
promoted they're told by their department directors they got to you know have a lab or do something

961
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:34,520
lab related there's one small government agency that funds this kind of stuff called the agency

962
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,920
for healthcare research and quality massively underfunded fair amount of cronyism and how they

963
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:45,960
fund their grants as well but during covid we wanted to know the behavioral aspects how does it

964
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:51,800
spread when are you most contagious do masks work none of those questions were answered with good

965
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:57,880
evidence instead we had massive efforts going on in the lab appropriately it's not downplaying that

966
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:06,360
we need that but we need both and so the nih cdc never did a study to say is it airborne or surface

967
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:13,000
transmission instead they let that debate linger in the public domain for months from january until

968
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,600
april letting people argue opine on tv they could have done that study in 24 hours natural immunity

969
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:25,240
cloth masks and 95 masks the reduction in transmission all those studies could have

970
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:32,840
been done immediately they didn't because they were entirely focused on laboratory pathways and

971
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:38,600
blocking and medications and pharmaceutical solutions we need those but you saw the it come

972
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:44,680
at the complete exclusion of basic clinical research and we see the same thing with patient

973
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:51,480
safety that bias towards laboratory research is hurting us badly and as you know better than anyone

974
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:56,680
in the united states in the world where's the nih research for food is medicine and the

975
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:02,600
inflammatory state and environmental exposures that cause cancer and school lunch programs

976
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:07,240
instead we're talking about bariatric surgery and throwing insulin at people and second line

977
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:13,880
anti-hypertensives where's the science of sleep medicine at the nih so these are the giant blind

978
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:20,280
spots in our current national funding mechanism and patient safety is one of those blind spot areas

979
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:25,160
still i'm surprised i guess based on the recent reports over the past five years that it still

980
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:28,840
remains kind of in a blind spot because if you just looked at it through the lens of even if

981
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,400
it's the eighth leading cause of death and not the fourth leading cause of death that would still be

982
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:38,920
enough presumably to justify a more systems-based approach to the problem solving now i guess i will

983
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:44,840
say this it's a very different type of research and it's not really the type of thing that they've

984
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:51,640
mastered there's a well understood playbook for how you go from idea to grant funding cycle

985
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:57,640
results publications etc within the sphere of the type of research that they're currently funding

986
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:02,280
both translational and basic and clinical for that matter but this is different i don't know

987
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,960
i gotta be honest with you i don't come away from this discussion particularly optimistic

988
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:12,520
that either the system is going to get that much better or that an individual can do much to

989
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,000
protect themselves i feel like you or i if we're in the hospital with a friend or family member i

990
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
think we're lucky because we really know what questions to ask and we can probably reduce the

991
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,120
damage potential by a little bit not entirely i think back of the case of this woman who died

992
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:32,120
at vanderbilt i mean even if that was my grandmother it's unlikely i would have been in the

993
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:36,120
scanner with her i would have been waiting back in the icu there's nothing i could have done to

994
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:40,920
have prevented that mistake yeah and so that's what i'm kind of curious about is like where is

995
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:48,760
the innovation there what makes it impossible to give vacuum ronium to a person who is not

996
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,400
intubated that's kind of what i want to understand and you might say peter that's not the mistake

997
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,920
worth creating an enormous system around because that only occurred 10 times last year in the

998
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:02,680
united states we got to worry about the one that killed 50 000 people last year the movement is

999
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:08,200
formalized into a group called the institute for healthcare improvement which was started by don

1000
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:14,360
burwick and he is a hero of patient safety he has spoken at every major medical center probably in

1001
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:19,080
the united states talking about the culture of safety and all these issues we talk about safety

1002
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:27,240
on rounds and now almost every hospital has a chief quality officer and their job is to oversee

1003
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:33,880
these root cause analyses that's routine now for any sentinel event if the hospital is honest

1004
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:40,120
which most are our hospital doesn't let things slip because they settled with a family who

1005
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:47,400
had a 75 year old parent die in a scanner it doesn't matter where or when if there's a catastrophic or

1006
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:52,200
sentinel event it's going to get a root cause analysis at johns hopkins i think that's the

1007
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,560
case at most hospitals but to have a c-suite level executive focused only on quality and

1008
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:03,080
safety within an institution i think that's progress i mean we're seeing now safety used

1009
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:09,720
in a constructive way when we decide hey there's too many patients hanging out in the hallway and

1010
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:15,720
broom closet in the emergency room that's not good for patient safety it is now part of that

1011
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:21,720
conversation so i am a bit optimistic at the direction hospitals are also sitting on

1012
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:27,080
tens of millions of dollars of surplus now every year many of them you know not half of the rural

1013
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:31,880
hospitals and not all hospitals but what do you do with that money when you're a non-profit you've

1014
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:37,240
got to reinvest it into something and so you're seeing more willingness now to invest in safer

1015
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,680
technology and patients love it when they come into a hospital and they hear hey we do this this

1016
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:47,000
and this for safety the fundamental problem in health care is that we have non-competitive

1017
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:54,280
markets and the hospitals are competing basically on billboards and nfl advertisements and not on

1018
01:40:54,280 --> 01:41:00,120
quality and safety and so now with more public reporting that is starting to change when i wrote

1019
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:06,440
unaccountable gosh 10 years ago it since turned into the tv show the resident i called for public

1020
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:12,840
reporting of sentinel events and other infection rates and complication rates and readmission rates

1021
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:19,640
and much of the medical establishment said no way this absolutely will never and should never

1022
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:25,080
happen now we accept it nobody challenges or questions that we have public reporting of those

1023
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:30,600
adverse events and when readmission rates became publicly reported guess what happened to them

1024
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:37,080
they plummeted across the board because hospitals went to their doctors and nurses and said what do

1025
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:43,480
you need to ensure that your patients don't bounce back after you discharge them and we started having

1026
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:48,760
discharge coordinators and clear instruction sheets written at a sixth grade english level

1027
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:55,480
so it's mixed in some areas we haven't made much improvement in other areas we do see

1028
01:41:55,480 --> 01:42:02,760
an army of people now dedicated to quality and safety that we never saw before well marty i guess

1029
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:09,400
we'll be cautiously optimistic here but i really am as are i think many people in the medical

1030
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:15,160
community deeply troubled by what took place in tennessee at all levels at the level of the nursing

1031
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:18,680
board at the level of the hospital and certainly at the level of the da i think it's all a bad

1032
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:26,360
precedent if your objective function is to improve outcomes none of this was in service of that yeah

1033
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:34,440
it was a tragedy the silver lining is the groundswell of opposition to what happened to her is

1034
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:39,560
encouraging and i hope people keep speaking up about this case yeah likewise all right marty well
