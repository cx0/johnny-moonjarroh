00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Well, Chris, we've been talking about doing this for probably two years now. So I'm really

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,500
happy to finally sit down with you though. We had always thought we'd be doing it in

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,300
person, but decided just didn't want to wait any longer.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,800
I agree.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,300
But no, I miss you dearly. And I think during our discussion today, people are going to

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,300
get to understand why you've played such an important role in my development. I guess

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,300
let's just, I'll just state for everyone that you were one of my senior residents, what

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,400
we call chief residents when I was going through my training at Hopkins. And I think on other

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,660
podcasts, people have probably heard me mention you. I've certainly talked about you on Jaco's

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,160
podcast several years ago. I've talked about you on this podcast and usually in the context

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:07,660
of what I consider to be the most remarkable leadership. Residency was not without its stresses

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,760
and stressors. And I think we have lots of great memories from it, but also some not

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,660
so great ones. And therefore anything that could have been done by those around us to

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,360
make the process better was always appreciated. And I think we'll get to that later, but let's

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,360
just start by telling folks like how you even got interested in medicine, let alone

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
surgery.

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for the invitation. It's awesome even virtually

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,940
to get to hang out with you and reminisce a little bit, but also talk about our work.

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,020
And I'm really proud of the work you've done with this podcast. It's been so impactful

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:54,840
to patients, providers. It's just a cool way to see your leadership and impact extend.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:07,900
Yeah, medicine for me was something I stumbled to. So I grew up in the DC area. My dad is

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,260
a retired Presbyterian minister. My mom was a medical social worker. The only other physician

24
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:23,960
in my family is my grandfather, who was an internist and researcher in St. Louis. And

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,960
I went to college without a clear plan other than wanting to play college soccer, which

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:40,540
is what I was fortunate enough to do. And I had imparted to me by my parents that they

27
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,460
would support whatever I chose to do, but wanted it to be something that served other

28
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:58,840
people. And through the course of my studies did come to medicine for some of the somewhat

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,280
cliche reasons. It was a really exciting, challenging field that appealed to the problem

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:17,360
solver or the scientist in me, but first and foremost was a way to serve people. And

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,240
came to surgery very late too. In medical school, I was one of those people that liked

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:31,320
everything and was fascinated by all fields, but really became attracted to what fortunately

33
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:39,820
I think still sustains me today. And that is that being a surgeon provides this really

34
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,020
unique opportunity to enter people's lives in their scariest kind of darkest moments

35
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:53,620
and to have the privilege to be able to walk that with them and try to help them navigate

36
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,740
that time and to have skill in some cases to solve the problem. And I think that was

37
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:11,840
remarkable to me. I was struck by the challenge of it and was fortunate to make the decision

38
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,120
to train in surgery and end up at Hopkins, where as I totally agree with how you described

39
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,880
it, it was like the one hand kind of forged us into the people we are today, but also

40
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,000
was difficult and challenging. And that's partially also what made it the experience

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it was.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,920
Yeah. How did you pick Hopkins? I know everybody who, I mean, I guess you could say Hopkins

43
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,900
sort of picks people and not the other way around, but how did you at least have the

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,540
desire to go to such a rigorous program? Was it something that said, Hey, once I've committed

45
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,140
to doing this, I might as well go to the best place.

46
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,820
Yeah, it was a combination of things. As I mentioned, I decided a little late in medical

47
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,780
school that I wanted to train in general surgery and I went and consulted with the

48
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,840
program director at my medical school, who was John Tarpley, kind of a legendary general

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,900
surgeon at Vanderbilt, who had spent a lot of his career in Africa actually doing mission

50
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,640
work and surgery. And I went to meet with him and to be honest with you, the goal of

51
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,760
that meeting was to have him tell me that I even had a shot at staying at Vanderbilt.

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,540
That was my kind of what I thought would be the best I could do. And we talked for a long

53
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:41,680
time. He's a wonderful person, wanted to hear about my goals. And he said, I think partially

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
a jest, but he said, you know what? I think we need to send you back to the mothership

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,320
because he had trained at Hopkins and he still carried with very passionate memories

56
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,840
about the training there and the kind of standard of clinical excellence that the training programs

57
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,820
there represented. And so I was fortunate enough to get an interview and was obviously

58
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,160
impressed with the history and the emphasis on clinical excellence. But like you, I think

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,880
I was also really attracted to the idea of mentorship and one individual in particular,

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,640
Keith Lillemoe, who was the program director at the time, now the chair of surgery at Massachusetts

61
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:36,500
General Hospital. I really got the feeling that he was invested in the development and

62
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,000
training of his residents, not only as surgeons, but also as individuals and as leaders. And

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,880
exactly like you said, kind of once I got that sense, I wanted to swim in that pool,

64
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,840
so to speak, figuring that I would gain as much from obviously the terrific history and

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,420
mentors and training environment, but also the individuals who we were lucky to train

66
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:08,100
next to. I mean, I think when you feel like you're just running with superstars every

67
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:16,480
day, that does push you to be the best possible physician, surgeon, person you can be. And

68
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:24,940
I can think of so many individuals just like you that inspired me to push myself to beyond

69
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,000
kind of expectations that I probably even had for myself at that period of time.

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,600
Yeah, I mean, there's no doubt during this discussion, Chris, I'm going to have to embarrass

71
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,060
the hell out of you because the reality of it is you were definitely, and you're just going to

72
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,660
be too modest to accept it, but you were certainly in a league of your own, even amongst that caliber

73
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:53,300
of individual. So it's one thing to say you played for the Yankees, it's another thing to say you

74
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:01,260
were Mickey Mantle or Joe DiMaggio. And I think to me, one of the things I want to dig into today

75
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:09,120
is for many of us, certainly myself, I'd put in that category, you show up with all of these ideas

76
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:17,460
about what you can be and what this process is like. And some role in the way, a tiny piece of you

77
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:25,120
gets a little broken. You lose a little bit of your humanity, your tolerance for distress goes

78
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,720
down, the empathy goes down a little bit, your tolerance for others around you, even on the same

79
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,040
team goes down a little bit, whether it's your tolerance for an error that a nurse makes, your

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,800
tolerance for an error that the lab makes. I mean, I just watched in myself over five years, a degradation

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:55,000
of humanity that in my case led to a very extreme outcome, which was departing. I can safely say

82
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,480
you're the only person in whom I didn't witness that. And simultaneously, you were the best of the

83
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,280
best. So it's it's to me, that's just an unusual combination that I definitely want to understand

84
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,240
that a bit more.

85
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,440
Well, I mean, that's very kind of you. I didn't feel that way. Which is, I guess, true of all of us,

86
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,960
you don't. The battle you're waging within is, you know, different than what everybody sees on the

87
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,160
outside. You know, I mean, I think, you know, one way of asking that question is kind of what

88
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,320
sustained me during that time period, what, you know, kept all of us going, but me in particular,

89
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:51,040
you know, I, I definitely had a, you know, overwhelming sense from day one of arriving in

90
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,800
Baltimore. And this speaks to kind of my medical training in general, but certainly specifically

91
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,760
our residency, that I felt like, you know, I was very lucky to be there, you know, that there were,

92
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:14,280
there were hundreds of qualified individuals who could have taken that spot. And, and other and

93
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,240
probably thousands of other individuals who, who didn't get the opportunities I did to get to that

94
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:28,760
spot. And so I felt, you know, obligated, if that's the right word, to kind of maximize that entire

95
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:40,720
experience. You know, I also felt the, the burden, if you will, of, of the expectations of those

96
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:49,400
around me, you know, I mean, the, the, the expectations of those that were training us, our

97
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:57,520
colleagues, etc. You know, I always, I, one of the things I said to Dr. Little, Dr. Cameron, when I

98
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,560
left was, you know, thank you for your high expectations. Like, that's really what drove me

99
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,240
to achieve things that I didn't necessarily think were within me. I will say though, that the last

100
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,440
thing, and this, this is true to this day, so it's not specific to residency, is that I have always

101
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:28,320
found, fortunately, that what recenters me when medicine gets hard, because it does get difficult,

102
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,720
whether you practice in a, you know, busy primary care practice, where you're cramming through 40

103
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,440
patients a day, or you're doing operations where a wrong move leads, can lead to somebody's death,

104
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,000
you know, there are, there are good days and bad days, and there are pressures that can do all the

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,440
things to you that you alluded to. But what has always re-centered me is the patience. I mean, to

106
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,960
be honest, that, that privilege that I was speaking of earlier of being invited into people's lives,

107
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,280
in these crazy moments, and actually having the opportunity to intervene. And somehow, even in the

108
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,560
thick of residency, when you're like, how can you know, why is it that this lab I ordered 14 hours

109
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,800
ago has still hasn't been done? Or, you know, why can't I find the x-rays that were just on this desk,

110
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,720
like two hours ago? You know, or what are all the other crazy things that we had to deal with? Or why,

111
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,840
why is there no food to eat at 11 o'clock at a 24 seven operation? You know, the thing that always

112
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:40,960
kind of re-centered me is reminding me that, you know, the people upstairs in those beds,

113
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,680
headed a lot worse off than I did. And, you know, I think that, that the privilege of being involved

114
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,280
in their care is kind of what re-centered me and still does today. You know, when I have

115
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,760
days like that, that is always what is able to kind of pull me back to the right frame of mind.

116
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,920
Another thing that I think made you very special, that wasn't, that I think was actually distinct

117
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,920
from everything you're describing, everything you're describing was on incredible visible display.

118
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,800
But you could have, I think had all of those characteristics, and you wouldn't have created

119
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,960
the magnet that someone like me felt. Now, I can't speak for the other residents, but I just,

120
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,280
it would be hard for me to imagine. I'm the only one that felt this way. But I just remember any

121
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,720
time my rotation card showed I was going to be your junior resident, it didn't matter what the

122
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,680
rotation was. I couldn't wait for that month to arrive. And so that speaks to something a little

123
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,320
different. And I mean, like, let's go back to, you went to Northwestern, if I recall, right, for

124
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,600
college. And so you're a division one athlete, you're playing soccer. Were you the team leader?

125
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:58,480
I was a captain. You know, I think I was not the best player on the team, at least on my college

126
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:08,960
teams, for sure. But I do feel very lucky that I was, you know, elected to represent the team and

127
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,480
to serve in, you know, a leadership role, at least as it as it is within the context of an athletic

128
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:23,680
team. You know, I do think that one of the things that has always been true for me, you know, and

129
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,800
this dates back to, you know, sports as a kid, and, you know, and to be honest, as part of the reason

130
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,000
why I chose to be a transplant surgeon, is that I always migrated to team, you know, collaborative

131
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:47,680
activities. You know, I was, I was never an individual sport athlete, you know, I swam a

132
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,040
bit, I played tennis a bit, but I never kind of like was captivated by those sports in the same

133
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,000
way that I was of just being on a team. And in fact, you know, both, there were multiple times in my

134
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,720
development as a young kid, playing soccer in the DC area, which is a very competitive kind of

135
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,120
soccer environment, you know, where I was lucky to kind of be on the some of the teams that I was

136
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,760
on playing with, you know, elite players. But being on that team being in that environment, you know,

137
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,400
seemed to pull the best out of me. And, and I think that was true in residency, too, you know,

138
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,440
what I relished the most was like, you know, yeah, it was five in the morning, but you showed up and

139
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
there was Peter and there was Megan and there, you know, it was your team. And it was like, you know,

140
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,200
this like you felt like you were, you know, unstoppable to some degree, even though you

141
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,440
were, you know, doing what at times seemed a possible task. And, and I feel the same way

142
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
about transplant, you know, I feel like the part of the reason I chose that it was clear that

143
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,440
no one can accomplish what it takes to take a liver transplant patient from, you know,

144
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,560
from their diagnosis to listing to to operation to recovery to, you know, transform and

145
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,360
transform them to a new life afterwards, without, you know, a really highly functioning team. And

146
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,880
that that is what always has kind of inspired me to, you know, give my best because I feel like

147
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm in a team where other people are doing the same thing. I mean, there's a story I'll tell that

148
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,400
I would imagine you don't recall because it was so commonplace. But it, it really stood out to me

149
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,000
as an example of what like a great leader would do. So you'll have to you'll have to forgive me for

150
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,960
explaining a process that you understand Oh, too well, but most people don't, which is actually

151
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm going to have you explain it. Tell folks what the M&M conference was every Tuesday morning.

152
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah, so. So you're referring to what what it Hopkins was called morbidity and mortality

153
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,440
conference, which is a, you know, I think there are versions of that throughout medicine, but in

154
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:12,960
surgery, it is a unique part of the culture. So I think one of the things that makes surgeons

155
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:21,600
and surgery unique as a discipline is the sense of ownership, accountability, responsibility for

156
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:30,240
the outcomes of the patients that you're privileged to care for. And so morbidity and

157
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:38,800
mortality conference was a weekly conference where we reviewed essentially patients' stories,

158
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,400
patients' cases, particularly patients that had suboptimal outcomes, whether it was a

159
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,920
a complication as, as hopefully routine as a wound complication or something that they would,

160
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:59,360
would extend their recovery, but they would recover from fully to a, to a death related to

161
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,360
a surgical procedure or, or at least to a diagnosis that we tried to address with a

162
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,240
surgical procedure. And I think, you know, every my former chair here at Michigan, Mike Mahon,

163
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,000
used to say that, you know, you can look into this into a department soul by attending their,

164
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,960
you know, morbidity and mortality conference. It is, it becomes the kind of cultural event

165
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,400
of the department because you get a sense for what that level is of accountability is,

166
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,760
is the conference spent kind of blaming the anesthesiologist or the nurse or, you know,

167
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,920
or the patients' comorbid conditions, or is the, is the discussion about what we could do better

168
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,960
next time to make the patient's outcome better. And I think, you know, there are

169
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,520
lots of examples that, you know, I'm sure you and I could regale for four hours of kind of how

170
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,160
lessons learned in that room, you know, in the morning, you know, shaped the way we think about

171
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,920
medicine, the way we think about responsibility, you know, all kinds of other things. One thing I

172
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,160
always admired is that the chair who was there for most of the time, we were there, John Cameron,

173
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,360
he would often be the, the moderator of morbidity and mortality conference. And he always led,

174
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,320
as you recall, with his own cases, which is, you know, a remarkable example of

175
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,320
the level of accountability that I think he was trying to, to encourage among the, the faculty and

176
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,920
residents there. Yeah, that's one of the things that stood out to me because I went to medical

177
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,320
school at Stanford, and it was just a different culture. It wasn't nearly as rigorous. And so even

178
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,480
in medical school, you would still attend that during your surgical rotations. But it, it was not

179
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,280
the conference that I saw at Hopkins, which was, I mean, this was the most intense hour of the week,

180
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:13,200
and it was taking place outside of the operating room. So this, this was kind of the story that,

181
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,400
that I'll, that I'll tell that kind of always, it just remains to this day etched in my mind. So

182
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,480
you and I, this is by this point, you're now the trauma fellow. So you have now finished residency,

183
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,760
you are now staying at Hopkins for another year to do what can only be described as the craziest

184
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,040
fellowship ever. It's a hepatobiliary oncology fellowship combined with trauma every third night,

185
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:45,440
as if that weren't enough. And it's either July or August. So it's very early in the academic year.

186
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm the third year resident, so I'm kind of your most senior resident on that service. And

187
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:03,920
you're the ACS. And so you're functioning like the attending. And we had just come on that

188
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:11,840
morning to receive sign off from the team that was leaving. And, you know, we both recall just how

189
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,400
chaotic that could be, right? You know, you've got people that are just getting shot two hours

190
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,120
earlier, you got to run to the OR with them, and you're being told about these all this patient,

191
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,840
this patient, this patient. And I mean, almost as a matter of fact, one of those patients was being

192
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,560
discharged that day. And it was sort of like this person on this floor is going to go home in a

193
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:37,120
couple of hours. Nobody needs to go and even see that person. You not only went and saw that person,

194
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,000
but realized something was wrong. And it pains me that I don't remember what was wrong. But

195
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,920
either you sense that this person had a compartment syndrome that got missed. I think they'd been hit

196
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,720
by a car that day before or something like that. You sensed something that was missed.

197
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,520
For you to be the one to go and catch it was out of this world, right? Never would the attending go

198
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,520
and be the one to go and check on the patient whose discharge paperwork is already signed to

199
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,840
go home. But you did that. You caught the misdiagnosis, took the patient to the operating room,

200
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,480
operated, you know, probably saved his leg. You then presented that case at M&M several weeks later.

201
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,280
But the part that blew my mind was you never mentioned the circumstances around which

202
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,600
this patient came into our care. In other words, there was no blaming. There was no,

203
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,200
well, you know, Mr. Smith was about to be discharged, but I decided to go and make sure

204
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,560
he was okay and realized he actually had a compartment syndrome and needed surgery to save

205
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,760
his leg. Instead, it was you presented it as though it was your fault, as though you had missed it.

206
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,120
And I honestly, it sounds crazy. That was one of the moments when I realized I don't I'm not good

207
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,240
enough to be in this profession. You know, maybe none of us are. But but I don't know if you remember

208
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:07,040
that case, but yeah, I do actually now that you recall it. And it was the circumstances were as you

209
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,200
described, it was one of those crazy days where 35 things are happening. And, you know, we we were

210
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,240
all over 34 of them. Unfortunately, the 35th was this poor guy who was, you know, getting ready to

211
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,600
be wheeled out of the hospital. And yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I don't remember the circumstances

212
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:37,760
of the M&M discussion, but I but I do certainly carry the, you know, philosophy in my work

213
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,960
currently. And, you know, certainly that, you know, there is not value in kind of assigning

214
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,480
blame to individuals, there's only value in recognizing opportunity for us as a system,

215
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,040
as a team to get better. And, and partially, it's because, you know, I think, you know,

216
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,520
if I were to throw stones in that case, you know, I could walk out of that conference and an hour

217
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,280
later be the one responsible for kind of generating, you know, a similar or worse complication. So I

218
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,200
think there's some humility that has to enter into understanding that no one has all the answers,

219
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,080
nor should be expected to kind of catch everything. In fact, one of the things that I think has one of

220
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,000
the, as you know, one of the criticisms of the M&M morbidity mortality culture is that at least

221
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,760
historically, it had been a little bit too much about assigning individual blame and not about

222
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,520
recognizing opportunity for change. But I do think that that over time, I've seen that change. And

223
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,040
certainly the way morbidity and mortality conferences are run now, for example, at my

224
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,360
institution and others I've visited are much more focused on what's right for the patient than

225
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,800
rather, you know, who can we, who's, you know, who do we have to kind of string up for, you know,

226
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,760
this particular mistake, which is, which is number one, better for patients. Number two,

227
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,600
sets a better example for the, for the trainees and learners in the room that are, that are

228
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,800
trying to do this and just as a, is an important piece of creating the right culture where

229
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,640
everybody's kind of oars are moving in the same direction. At what point during residency,

230
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:26,960
did you decide that it was going to be transplant medicine versus the other things that you had

231
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,960
clearly shown, you know, a fantastic predilection for such as pancreatic surgery, liver surgery,

232
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,400
and all facets of surgical oncology in the GI tract? Yeah. I mean, honestly, I was, I was greedy.

233
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:48,000
I kind of wanted to do, do it all. You know, I, I, when I entered Hopkins, I had developed an

234
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,760
interest in, in diseases of the hepatobiliary system and upper GI tract. So that was another

235
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,120
thing that clearly drove my, my interest in that residency where they had such expertise and, and

236
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,760
kind of a, you know, concentration of experts in those diseases. It was, you know, I, I did my

237
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,360
intern year rotation in transplant, and then again, a third year rotation in transplant.

238
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:24,080
My fellow as an intern and then my junior attending as a third year was one of the people

239
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,320
who's men, you know, one of the most important influences on my professional career,

240
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,560
who's Bob Montgomery, now the head of transplantation at, at NYU and a, you know,

241
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:41,760
and a transformative figure in our field over the last couple of decades. And, you know,

242
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:49,440
partially it was his example of, you know, what I thought I could aspire to be as a transplant

243
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:57,280
surgeon. Partially, it was realizing that the distance from kind of bench to bedside and

244
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,800
transplantation is really short. You know, it was unlike anything that I had, had seen even in,

245
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,960
in a very innovative, progressive, you know, surgical department. And finally, you know,

246
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,920
specifically speaking to my previous interest, I did see liver transplantation specifically as

247
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:26,960
being completely complimentary to, to being a comprehensive about abiliary surgeon and, and,

248
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,800
physician for patients with, you know, have had abiliary disease. You know, it's interesting.

249
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,360
In other parts of the world, it's pretty commonplace for a patibiliary surgeons and

250
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,160
liver transplant surgeons to be the same individuals, you know, in the U S just with

251
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,560
training tracks changing over time and such, there are, there tend to be surgical oncologists

252
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,880
who do a patibiliary surgery and transplant surgeons who may do some abatibiliary surgery,

253
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
but I clearly thought it would make me a more complete surgeon and physician to,

254
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,640
to train in both. And I've been very lucky. I mean, this isn't something that can happen

255
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,880
necessarily at every institution, but I've, I've straddled that line in my career too.

256
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,920
I, about half my clinical practices is, uh, a patibiliary surgery, surgery of the liver,

257
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,600
bile duct and pancreas for mostly for cancer, but other benign diseases and then liver

258
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,360
transplantation. So, you know, I feel like I won the lottery, you know, I'm kind of walking

259
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,120
that line, you know, uh, to be able to combine those disciplines.

260
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Um, tell folks a little bit about what you mean by bench to bedside and that,

261
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
that distance being short. Uh, it's a term we throw around a lot in medicine, but

262
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,720
its significance is huge. I want to make sure people understand it.

263
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,280
Yeah, no, it's, it's a great point. I mean, I mean, part of it is just understanding the history,

264
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:55,680
right? So, you know, transplantation as a field is very young, you know, so the first kidney

265
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,080
transplants were done in the 1950s. The first liver, heart, and lung transplants attempted in

266
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,880
the 1960s, none of which were particularly successful until the 1980s related to, uh,

267
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,680
all sorts of important changes, but particularly the development of effective immunosuppression.

268
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,960
And then all of, once it became a, a feasible and successful, uh, medical intervention,

269
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,160
then developing all of the systems around, uh, uh, making that a reality for more people and

270
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,360
extending that to people with organ failure, uh, of various causes. So, so here we are,

271
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,680
you know, surgical residents in the 1990s in a field that really is about 10 years old in terms

272
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:48,320
of kind of being operationally, uh, uh, you know, expanding enough to, to, to really be a reality

273
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,080
at most major medical, you know, uh, major medical centers. And so, you know, you would see,

274
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,080
you would see things being discussed kind of in morning reporter rounds or like, you know,

275
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,640
now this is a really tricky case of acute rejection. We haven't tried X yet. And then

276
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,440
you would see we try X and, you know, it would work or not work. And we just, or there were

277
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,520
surgical techniques, you know, living donor liver transplantation, basically part of a major part

278
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:25,040
of my practice now was created in the, you know, 1990s and early 2000s. So, so I think the ability

279
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:35,360
to see innovation become reality in very, um, you know, uh, rapid form was, was number one, inspiring.

280
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,560
I mean, you felt like you were doing something that was, that was new and innovative and just

281
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,880
really incredible, but also, um, you know, I think to be honest, it made you feel like you could

282
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:54,480
potentially have some impact in the development of, uh, of a field that, um, was nascent. And, you know,

283
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,880
uh, I would put myself in maybe the second or third generation of transplanters, you know,

284
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,960
in terms of its history, which is, which is a very, you know, I feel very fortunate to be

285
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,240
kind of a witness to that history and participate in some of it, um, moving forward.

286
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:20,160
Let's use kidney as an example to explain to people kind of the challenges today. Um,

287
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,640
you know, we take kidney transplants almost for granted because the success rate is so high. In

288
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,560
fact, even when I was a resident, um, you know, if, if, if, if you demonstrated that you had enough

289
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,240
of this skill and the interest, you know, even the transplant fellow would let you as the,

290
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,640
you know, mid-level resident or the senior resident general surgery do kidney transplants.

291
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,520
You mentioned Bob Montgomery. There was a stretch on transplant where Bob and I did 13 consecutive

292
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,040
kidney transplants together in a period of like four days. Um, so the fact that, you know,

293
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,160
kind of a knuckle dragger like me could have been doing this speaks to how well it works today.

294
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,560
But as you said, this is a procedure that even in the 1960s carry carried with it a mortality of,

295
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:15,040
you know, more than 50%. So let's break down for people the evolution of this, uh, from sort of

296
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,000
the technical evolution, right? There was, it was only what maybe a little over a hundred years ago

297
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,960
that the anastomosis was even understood, um, to then the complications of acute rejection,

298
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,480
chronic rejection, and even understanding what the immune system is, is doing. So,

299
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,920
and then we're going to get to liver after, because of course, liver takes it to a whole

300
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,080
new level in all regards. Well, I think, you know, kidney transplantation is kind of the,

301
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,320
the best example of all the, the challenges that you just alluded to. It was also, um,

302
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:59,760
the, the first solid organ at least that, that, um, appealed to, you know, the earliest pioneers

303
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,920
in the field as something that, you know, it seemed feasible to give someone an extra kidney

304
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,800
like that. You could kind of imagine a way technically to make that work as opposed to

305
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,640
doing, you know, what we now do for say, harder liver transplantation, where you're doing an

306
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,760
orthotopic transplant, you're literally taking out the prior organ and putting in the new one.

307
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,000
That's a little different than a heterotopic kidney transplant, where you're giving them an

308
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,120
extra organ and hoping that replaces the function. Yeah, we should, people probably don't understand

309
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,040
that, but when we do kidney transplants, we don't go in to the retroperitoneum, take out the old

310
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,200
kidneys, we're putting the new kidney basically in their pelvis, attaching it to the blood vessels

311
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,080
in the pelvis and taking the little tube that drains urine and just putting that into the

312
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,320
bladder, the ureter. And obviously that's much easier than if you were going to remove the old

313
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,240
kidneys and put the new kidney in their place, given the location of the kidneys. Yeah, I mean,

314
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:10,000
I think it really was, to make kidney transplantation feasible was a collision of, you know,

315
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,600
lots of hard work by multiple individuals, some of whom thinking about what you just said, literally

316
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:24,320
what are the technical details of taking an organ out of a either living or deceased donor,

317
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,280
mitigating the injury that goes from cutting off its blood supply until you're able to restore it

318
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,040
into the recipient's body. So there's this whole concept of kind of the technique,

319
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,600
the preservation, and then the implantation. And then parallel to that was this whole question of,

320
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:53,280
well, how do we handle the immunologic consequences of that? And so the series of events that occurred

321
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,960
and allowed kidney transplantation to be a reality were really that the kind of technical and

322
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,560
preservation elements came to fruition before we figured out the immunologic elements. And in fact,

323
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:16,960
the first kidney transplant, as you know, performed in 1954 at Brigham and Women's Hospital by Joseph

324
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,640
Murray, who eventually won the Nobel Prize, was in identical twins, right? So he had two brothers,

325
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,200
one brother who had kidney failure, another brother who was healthy, took one of the healthy

326
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:38,560
brother's kidneys and transplanted it into the sick brother. And, you know, that proof of principle

327
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:47,120
was what created even kind of the possibility, the vision that transplantation could work,

328
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,880
because we understood the technical and preservation challenges of actually taking

329
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,760
an organ out of one person's body and putting it into someone else.

330
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Murray was a plastic surgeon, wasn't he?

331
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,440
Yeah, Joseph Murray was a plastic surgeon. And interestingly, although he and his colleagues

332
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,120
figured out this technical piece, what attracted him to transplant was the concept of tissue

333
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:15,040
transfer and the immunology of that. So a lot of the early work in immunology was done with skin

334
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,920
grafts and kind of understanding why you could take a skin graft from your own body and put it

335
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,240
somewhere and it would live. But if you took a skin graft from someone else's body and put it

336
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,000
on a site, it would generally not live. And so there was this whole kind of cadre of

337
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,720
clinician scientists who were interested in that question, including interestingly plastic surgeons

338
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,880
like Joseph Murray. So he became involved in that with a group of other surgeons, including

339
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,520
some folks who had vascular expertise and others and kind of conceived and developed

340
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,280
in preclinical models and animals, this idea of putting a kidney in the pelvis and attaching it

341
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,800
to the blood vessels and bladder, and then pulled it off in a human. And a lot of, if you look at

342
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,240
the history of kidney transplantation through the 1950s and into the 1960s, most of the kidney

343
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,920
transplants performed were between twins, which, you know, there's a limited supply of available

344
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
organs there. So you can see right there that that was going to be a capacity problem. But,

345
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,640
you know, for example, the first kidney transplant at the University of Michigan was performed in

346
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:31,280
1963 between two twin sisters who a few years ago we were celebrating our 5,000th transplanted

347
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,920
organ at the University of Michigan. And those two sisters came back, you know, to celebrate that

348
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:47,040
event. So, I mean, it was a remarkable achievement, but it was a little bit of a false pretense because

349
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,160
none of the immunologic barriers were being confronted. And really what happened over the

350
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:00,160
next four decades were the development of effective immunosuppression to make that a reality. And as

351
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,360
you alluded to, it's pretty remarkable to think that, you know, in the 1960s and 70s and into the

352
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:16,320
early 80s, kidney transplants were being done and there were success stories. The field worked out

353
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,760
how to understand who had preformed antibodies to particular donors so you could avoid those and

354
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:31,760
pick kind of pairs that might be more successful. There were increasingly sophisticated immunosuppression

355
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:40,720
strategies that did work, you know, and drugs that were available like steroids and azathioprine,

356
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,720
you know, were making transplantation a possibility. But it's pretty remarkable to think in comparison

357
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,560
to what we expect now that in the 1960s and 70s, if you look at some of the published series,

358
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,160
there were mortality rates, mortality rates, meaning the patient died after kidney

359
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,480
transplantation of 50, 60, even 70 percent. So it's not only that they lost their graft,

360
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,880
but the consequences of the operation, the immunosuppression, subsequent usually infections,

361
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,880
you know, was making these procedures highly morbid and unsuccessful, at least at rates that

362
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,480
we would think of as acceptable now. And what was the life expectancy if you opted for dialysis in

363
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,480
the 1960s? How long could you be expected to survive? It's a great question. And, you know,

364
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,360
the first and most important kind of answer to that question is the assumption that you could

365
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,520
get dialysis, you know. So dialysis was not available everywhere. It was largely centered

366
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:55,200
around hospitals that had the ability to provide that service. You know, dialysis care was not

367
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,480
routinely covered by insurers. In fact, it wasn't until kind of a quirky rider to the

368
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:10,960
act, to the law that created Medicare in the 1960s that patients with dialysis even had the

369
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,640
option, the ability to get health insurance. So it was hard to get dialysis. And then the

370
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:27,200
survival on dialysis, due to the challenges of infection from repeated access, the hemodynamic

371
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,040
consequences and cardiovascular consequences, we know of what were then, you know, more crude,

372
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,480
primitive dialysis machines, was such that the life expectancy was probably measured in months

373
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,560
to years, you know. So two to four years might be, you know, a very successful outcome for someone on

374
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,520
dialysis. You know, the average life expectancy if you take all commerce for an individual on

375
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:01,600
dialysis now is about 10 years or so. But again, that is partially affected by the fact that

376
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,480
dialysis is more freely available. You know, people, elderly individuals and people with

377
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,680
other comorbid disease have access to dialysis. They wouldn't have had. So it was, there were no

378
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,960
good solutions, you know, for patients with organ failure in those times.

379
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,720
So I want to make sure people really get a sense of what these immune based challenges were.

380
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,840
We take it all for granted today because we can rattle off all MHC-2, MHC-1 complexes,

381
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,040
and that stuff's been worked out in the most elegant manner. But in the 1960s, that was not

382
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,440
the case. Maybe start by explaining ABO incompatibility, because I think that's something

383
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,680
people understand. If you came in the hospital and you'd lost blood and we wanted to give you a

384
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,520
blood transfusion, we couldn't just willy-nilly give you anybody's blood. We'd have to make sure

385
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,400
that the blood type matched. That's not entirely true. If you had, you know, we could give you O

386
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,360
negative blood no matter what. But walk people through kind of ABO, which would be the, in my

387
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,280
mind at least, the simplest form of antibody mediated rejection. And then let's use that as

388
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,040
a way to explain what was actually happening to all those non-twin transplants.

389
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:25,680
Yeah, so that's a great model to start with. So if you think about it in really basic forms, you know,

390
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:37,040
our immune system has evolved to recognize self, recognize our own tissues, and has been primed to

391
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:45,040
recognize things that do not look like us, mostly to be able to fight off viruses and, you know,

392
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,640
other environmental challenges. But that unfortunately makes it difficult for something

393
00:42:50,640 --> 00:43:01,360
like transplantation. So in the case of blood compatibility, we carry a blood of a particular

394
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:09,600
type. It has to do with the kind of the protein signature on the coating of those red blood cells.

395
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:18,480
And we know that if you give someone who carries blood of a certain type a blood type that is

396
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,760
incompatible, so let's make it the simplest, someone who has blood type A, someone who has blood type B,

397
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,840
and you give the individual with blood type A blood from an individual with blood type B,

398
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:41,040
they will have antibodies that attack those blood cells and essentially destroy the blood cells

399
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,240
because they think they are recognized as foreign. It's more complex than that because there's also

400
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,240
these things called the the RA chantogens, which are kind of what make blood positive and negative.

401
00:43:52,240 --> 00:44:02,960
And you're correct that blood type O, individuals who do not have blood type O, do not have preformed

402
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:13,440
antibodies to that donor pool. So that is kind of the universal donor pool. But it was figuring out

403
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:21,920
that incompatibility understanding that was kind of the first step in understanding how you would

404
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,680
potentially take an organ out of one individual and place it into another. And this is still true

405
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,520
to this day, that kind of step one in matching a donor and recipient is knowing their blood type

406
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:40,320
because that's kind of the first step. It gets more complicated than that for all the reasons

407
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,240
you alluded to, because it turns out those are not the only proteins on the surfaces of those cells

408
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,360
that are recognized by our immune system. And in particular, this group of protein called

409
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:01,200
human leukocyte antigens, which is what you were alluding to, or HLA types, is what kind of in a

410
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:08,240
very crude way determines one individual from another, that profile. And so the history of this

411
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,360
is pretty interesting, going back to my skin graft analogy. So what investigators around the

412
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,320
turn of the century were figuring out is again, so you could take a skin graft from elsewhere in your

413
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:25,360
body and it would tend to work. You could take a skin graft from somewhere else, from another

414
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:31,280
individual, it did not work. Then even more interestingly, if you took a second skin graft

415
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:39,760
from that same individual and put it on, it died faster. It's as if the body was primed to destroy

416
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,360
that new skin graft. Kind of sounds like a vaccine, huh? Yeah, exactly. So it was kind of the second,

417
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,000
exactly, it's the same principle. So it was just kind of the second hit hypothesis that the body,

418
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,320
the immune system, learned to recognize this foreign tissue and the immune system was even more

419
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,200
effective in eliminating it. And it was that whole series of experiments that led to this,

420
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,200
these concepts right in the middle of the last century, where the question was, and this was

421
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,320
debated by individuals much smarter than us, many of whom now have no Nobel prizes after their name,

422
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:27,440
but you know, so was there something circulating in the donor, in sorry, in the recipients

423
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:38,480
serum that found this tissue antibodies, was the theory, attacked this tissue, set off the

424
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,720
immune cascade, destroyed the tissue? Or was it more complicated than that? Was there kind of like

425
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,720
we've learned about in embryology from thymic development, was there some sort of priming event

426
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:57,280
that had to take place where the body presented this foreign tissue to the immune system and then

427
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,720
the immune system learned how to recognize it as self or foreign and destroy it. And that debate

428
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,000
went on for decades. So just to separate that, right, in the case of blood incompatibility,

429
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,520
it was pretty easy to figure out that it was just these soluble circulating antibodies. They weren't

430
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,960
quote unquote smart. They were just floating around and you could do it in a test tube. That's

431
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:28,880
right. So you have a blood type A with its little A antigen and if the recipient has an anti A,

432
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,640
it grabs onto it and these things precipitate out a solution to this reaction. And of course,

433
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:41,600
now the question that you're posing is, is that how it works on organs or is there something more

434
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:48,080
complicated where there's another actor? Correct. And the reason that that was such a

435
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,760
kind of fundamental question, because if you believed it was like the blood analogy and that,

436
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:02,960
okay, so if we could identify the patients that had preformed antibodies, preformed proteins in

437
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,800
their serum that were going to ruin this opportunity, then, well, that's great. Then we

438
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,160
can select out the patients that have that reaction and use the organ to transplant others.

439
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,360
So that's the concept of what is now called and transplant a cross match. So the idea of taking

440
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:26,480
donor cells, recipient serum, mixing them in an assay and determining whether or not

441
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,440
that serum lices those cells. And that is more or less the technique that is used to cross match

442
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:43,040
individuals to match, you know, as you'll hear people talk about, oh, I want to donate a kidney

443
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,080
to my uncle or something. I wonder if I'm a match. That's to some degree, what they're talking

444
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:55,600
about is whether or not that assay says that they have, that their uncle in this case, doesn't have

445
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,080
preformed antibodies that are going to destroy their cells. So that would explain kind of that

446
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,160
initial screening step. But what was, and the other thing that that helped explain is why

447
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,560
sometimes when you would do a transplant, either in animals or eventually in humans,

448
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,320
there was this phenomenon, which came to be known as hyperacute rejection, where you would put the

449
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:28,000
organ in, you would take the clamps off, the organ would fill with blood, it looks like you've won

450
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,080
the game, and then it would immediately start to thrombose and die, essentially. That process called

451
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:43,040
hyperacute rejection was figured out was because of the circulating antibodies to those HLA engines

452
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,640
of the donor. So that made some sense. We can try to figure that out. What didn't make sense is you

453
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,280
would do the transplant, you would get past that hyperacute stage, the organs working, and then

454
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:04,240
a day later, three days later, six months later, the organ would fail from acute rejection.

455
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,680
So basically the same process, but with a different kind of lead time. And it was after

456
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:19,600
much debate in the field, the nuances of which are more sophisticated than I can explain, but it was

457
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:27,360
figured out that what was actually happening was not this circulating, what we came to call antibody

458
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:34,080
mediated or humoral rejection, but actually was happening on a cellular level, so-called cellular

459
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:41,120
rejection. And as we learned eventually over time, that had to do with kind of what we now learn in

460
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:47,920
basic immunology, antigen presenting cell with carrying an antigen from the foreign tissue,

461
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,640
in this case the donor tissue, immune mediator cells. And we discovered and learned eventually

462
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:06,000
they were T cells, that recognition priming the immune system to form injury either by various

463
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,160
means, cytokines, eventual antibody formation, etc. And that was what was destroying organs in

464
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:23,200
that kind of subacute phase. And as we figured out over the course of decades, the drugs that we had

465
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,760
to blunt that initial immune response, high dose steroids, I refer days of thioprine, they tried

466
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,480
total body irradiation at some of the early stages. That was Franny Moore that was doing that.

467
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,000
Exactly. At the Brigham. Those weren't effective in preventing that cellular level rejection.

468
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:51,280
And it was only later, really the 1980s, that we developed immunosuppressive agents

469
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:59,280
that were selective enough to interfere with that cellular reaction. And it was then that transplant

470
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,800
really became a reality because now you had the ability to sustain an organ beyond just weeks to

471
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:12,880
months and you're looking at more long-term survival. So really the turning points are twofold,

472
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,800
right? One, it's the knowledge of what's happening because certainly by the 80s it was not a technical

473
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,200
challenge to be able to remove a kidney, transport a kidney and put it in. By the way,

474
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,800
was Wisconsin's solution already around by the 80s or did that come later?

475
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,720
Yeah. Yeah. So the, or at least the predecessors of Wisconsin's solution and the other.

476
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,320
Tell folks what that is and why that matters so much as well.

477
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:45,360
Yeah. So the theory is, you know, you take an organ out of the donor body, whether deceased or living,

478
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:54,320
you flush the blood cells and such out of it so that it doesn't clot. You then store it on ice

479
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,640
and transport it to the recipient and put it in. And there were all kinds of initial thoughts

480
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,440
about, well, do you just put it in saline essentially and transport it to the other room?

481
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,160
And what they found was that, and this was experimentation that happened over decades,

482
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:20,560
was that there was, there were cellular processes occurring both as kind of at the time from

483
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,080
when ischemia begins, when the vessels are clamped and the organ is coming out

484
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:34,560
and before blood flow and oxygen is restored to the organ. There were cellular processes occurring

485
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:42,800
that could be mitigated by creating preservation solutions, essentially saline, that was fortified

486
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,360
with particular molecules. And, you know, the history of all this is beyond me, but literally

487
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,240
they tried, you know, it's like making Gatorade. They tried, you know, different electrolyte

488
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:04,160
solutions and additives and other nutrients until they figured out which mitigated that ischemic

489
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,240
time the best. And the crazy thing to think about, and this gets to alludes to something maybe we

490
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,040
could talk about later in terms of, you know, where is preservation going in the future? But

491
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,400
the crazy thing is we're pretty much more or less doing that now, you know, so some of the fluid

492
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,840
solutions and some of the, you know, minor details of what additives are in the fluid has changed.

493
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,600
But that's essentially the way we've been preserving organs since the 1960s, 70s, you know,

494
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,440
which is pretty remarkable that that was one, as you said, one of the early barriers figured out

495
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:46,640
in the field. So once this notion of the HLA system is understood and we understand these different

496
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:55,200
types of compatibilities, a drug is discovered and it's, you know, my favorite drug on the planet

497
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,200
happens to come from basically a fungus. This is another drug that came from a fungus, but a

498
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:07,360
different one. The drug is called Cyclosporin. And I think you could make the case, but I'd like

499
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,600
to hear your take on it because you know this field so much better than I do. But if I were

500
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,840
telling the story, I would say that was the turning point was the advent of Cyclosporin. Do

501
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:26,320
you agree with that or do you think that I'm overstating that? No, 100%. You know, so as

502
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,120
you said, and similar to the stories of drug development that happened in other circumstances,

503
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:40,560
you know, this was a recognized compound that, you know, had been experimented in a number of

504
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:48,560
different lines of investigation. And an investigator who's really one of the central

505
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,640
figures in the history of transplant named Sir Roy Calm in Cambridge

506
00:55:52,640 --> 00:56:03,520
performed a series of preclinical experiments that showed that using this medication

507
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:12,400
prevented rejection in transplant models. And what eventually was discovered is that it was

508
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,880
interfering with the cascade that occurred when that foreign antigen was presented to the

509
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:31,440
recipient T cell. And in other words, it was a more selective immunosuppressant, so directly

510
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,440
interfering with the cascade of events that happens downstream of the T cell receptor.

511
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:45,920
And it specifically inhibited IL-2 secretion? It affects IL-2 secretion, but there's actually

512
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,720
some interesting debate about how the calcineurin inhibitors, so Cyclosporin and then its eventual

513
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:02,080
cousin, Taq-Lymis, works. You know, they both function at the level of what are called

514
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:10,160
immunophilins, these, you know, soluble intracellular components. And although they affect

515
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:18,000
both kind of the activation of cytokines after that T cell recognition, including IL-2, they also

516
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,120
seem to have other effects on the affinity of the binding of the T cell receptor. They have

517
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,640
systemic effects that are kind of interesting, like for example Taq-Lymis, the other medication

518
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:36,400
I mentioned, you know, has a potent vasoconstrictor effect in certain organs. So we probably don't

519
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:43,840
fully understand its impact, but certainly the central component of its mechanism was

520
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,600
interfering with the cascade that occurs after T cell receptor binding. And you're absolutely

521
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:56,240
right, like it literally was a game changer overnight. So, you know, if you look at papers

522
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,360
written in the 1980s about kidney transplant outcomes, there's literally an inflection point.

523
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:08,960
You went from recipients having one-year graft survival rates, even with kind of the best

524
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,000
immunosuppressive regimens that had been figured out at that point, one-year graft survival rates

525
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:22,160
probably in the 70-ish, 60% range. Boom, you know, 90% overnight just with the addition

526
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:28,320
of cyclosporine and then, you know, eventually refining kind of some of the multidrug regimens.

527
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:37,520
So it was a complete game changer. It not only revolutionized the impact of kidney transplantation,

528
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:44,080
which from a public health standpoint is clearly the most impactful organ we transplant, you know,

529
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,440
the number of patients with end-stage renal disease, the number of patients with chronic kidney

530
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,520
disease, you know, from a public health standpoint kidney transplantation is just a fundamental

531
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:03,040
important medical therapy. But so not only did it make that a reality and make it a preferred

532
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:15,120
alternative to dialysis, it also reinvigorated the other solid organ transplant,

533
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,200
other solid organ transplants as being a reality. So, you know, liver transplantation, which is

534
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,440
essentially had been on a more or less enforced hiatus through the 60s and 70s,

535
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,760
heart transplantation similarly, lung transplantation as well, the confidence that

536
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,640
now that we understood some of the technical and kind of patient-related factors that dictated the

537
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:46,240
success of the operation to now also have the promise that those organs would last more than,

538
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:55,200
you know, 90 days, you know, reinvigorated those fields completely. And, you know, again, you know,

539
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,640
almost overnight over the course of years, you started to see liver transplant programs,

540
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,120
heart transplant programs, lung transplant programs pop up at major medical centers all

541
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:10,720
throughout the country in the 1980s and into the early 1990s. So that was really the revolution

542
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:17,760
that occurred because of that drug development. When we look at the demand for kidney

543
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,120
transplantation today, what percentage of it is chronic versus acute kidney failure?

544
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:32,720
Yeah, so the vast majority is chronic. So there are occasions where patients can get acute

545
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:42,000
renal injury from, you know, traumatic events, other medical catastrophes, or they get acute

546
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,640
kidney injury in the chronic in this case of sepsis or something that they otherwise recover from.

547
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:53,200
And that does, you know, we still see, and we still see occasionally patients who get,

548
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,440
for example, post-reptococcal glomerular arthritis or other diseases that are more

549
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,040
linked to kind of an acute event. The vast majority of kidney transplants in the United

550
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,000
States, the primary indication is diabetes or hypertension. So this is chronic kidney disease

551
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,480
as a consequence of those comorbid conditions, which is one of the reasons, again, from a public

552
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,240
health standpoint, that the impact of kidney transplantation is massive, you know, so you have

553
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,120
a hundred thousand people roughly waiting for a kidney transplant in the United States.

554
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:32,640
You probably have four fold that are there about on dialysis, and then probably ten fold that number

555
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:39,520
with chronic kidney disease. So the potential impact of having an effective and durable

556
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:46,400
therapy for chronic kidney disease is remarkable. And I think it's really important to consider as

557
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,960
a public health problem. Yeah, I can't agree with you more, Chris. And about three years ago,

558
01:01:52,960 --> 01:02:00,560
I sort of had this obvious epiphany. I say obvious because I'm sort of thinking, why did it take me so long to do the math?

559
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:07,280
But I realized if my interest clinically is trying to figure out how to help people live longer and live better,

560
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,240
you've got to start thinking about what are the things that you have to plan for. So if you're

561
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:19,680
flying a glider where you know you want to cross a 200-foot chasm, but now all of a sudden you say,

562
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:25,120
well, I want that chasm to be 300 feet, you have to start thinking about how much higher does that

563
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,480
glider need to fly. And one of the things that really occurred to me was kidney function.

564
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:37,040
We sort of have in the back of our minds, you know, look, if a person reaches the finish line of life

565
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:42,320
and their glomerular filtration rate is 40, great. You know, they don't need dialysis, they're doing

566
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:49,120
just fine. And if we think that an average life expectancy should be 71 or something, and we think

567
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:54,880
that, hey, we're going to tolerate a person's GFR being in the low 40s when they're in their early

568
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,040
70s, that's great. But if we're trying to figure out a way to help people live and live well into

569
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:07,360
their 90s or beyond, that becomes a very unacceptable GFR. You're going to run into trouble.

570
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,880
And so, you know, looking at cystatin C beyond just creatinine and other biomarkers and looking

571
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,440
at microalbumin in the urine twice a year, I mean, we do all these things, but even though they seem

572
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:26,080
kind of crazy, because it's how you sort of start to catch that early, early, oh, look, you know what,

573
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:32,800
your blood pressure of 130 over 85 is not really acceptable. That's that's that's going to take you

574
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:39,360
from a GFR of 95 to 85 in the next decade. And we consider that to be too precipitous a decline.

575
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:46,240
So unfortunately, my view is that I think the demand for kidneys is only going to go up as we

576
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:53,040
see the rampant explosion of prediabetes and metabolic syndrome. Yeah, I totally agree with

577
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:58,480
you. I think, and there's so many kind of wrinkles to that question to think about. I mean, the first

578
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:05,200
is that is the obvious statement that as you preach better than anybody, we don't do preventative care,

579
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:12,320
you know, in this country very well. And we particularly don't do it for things where we

580
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:19,120
don't have reliable measures, you know, so to your point, you know, we use serum creatinine as kind of

581
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,560
our best guess at kidney function. There's lots of reasons why that's a poor indicator. You know,

582
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:35,360
it's not it's very dependent on muscle mass and other variables that that allow you that prevent

583
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:40,880
you from using some sort of kind of normalized number as an acceptable range. There are more

584
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,800
sensitive markers, as you alluded to, there there's now I think, fortunately, finally being recognized

585
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:53,120
the whole question of how creatinine and GFR and race interacts and how that needs to be accommodated

586
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,920
for. So, so you're right. So number one, we don't measure it well. So therefore we don't appreciate

587
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,760
the size of the problem. Number two is we, again, this is kind of a situation where transplant is a

588
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:10,640
victim of its own success. You know, as transplantation has gotten more successful, transplant centers

589
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:15,360
around the country, transplant providers and and just the medical community in general has started

590
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:21,200
to say, well, you know, why don't we provide kidney transplants for 70 year olds if there are

591
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:28,400
otherwise, you know, healthy individuals because their life expectancy might be 20 years from that

592
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:35,600
point. So and that's that, I think, the collision of that and then the what you alluded to this

593
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:43,200
pre-diabetes metabolic syndrome, you know, progressive kidney dysfunction in an aging

594
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:49,920
population is going to create an enormous demand for kidney transplantation. You know, we

595
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,240
transplanted an 81 year old a few weeks ago. And I remember as I was looking at the

596
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:02,320
census, I don't do kidney transplant very commonly as part of my clinical practice.

597
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,480
I was looking at the census, I was like, wait a minute, is that is this gentleman 10 years out

598
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,760
from a transplant back in the hospital for some other reason? Or did we actually transplant this?

599
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,400
But the point is, there are individuals who are healthy, functional people otherwise who have

600
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,360
whose life, you know, part of what we're talking about is survival benefit, right? You compare

601
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,400
their survival on dialysis to their survival with the transplant. Transplant is going to win almost

602
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,560
every time, you know, as long as they can tolerate the operation of the immunosuppression. So,

603
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,840
so it isn't it isn't it kind of remarkable to think of the scope of that problem, and particularly

604
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,760
to take a longevity lens on it, you know, it's it's really kind of an interesting

605
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,960
challenge to think about for the next, you know, 20-30 years of transplantation.

606
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:51,120
So before we get on to liver, which is such an amazing story as well, I want to I want to wrap a

607
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:58,080
few things up on on kidney. So let's let's talk about the evolution from cyclosporine to to

608
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:05,440
Prograph or Tacolimus, as you discussed, and where we are today on some of the most common

609
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:12,240
immunosuppressive regimens. And then I also want to touch on this idea of not just living donors,

610
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,560
but the live donor swaps and stuff, because I'll tell you one of the things that I'll never forget

611
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:24,640
from my intern rotation on transplant, which like you captivated me beyond words, I mean,

612
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:32,560
transplant was never even something on my radar before residency. And for the entire time I was

613
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,040
in residency, it was always one of those things was like, I could see myself doing this. This is

614
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:42,160
so cool. And it was actually, I think it was Bob Montgomery as well that shared this with me,

615
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:51,360
which was a live donor zero out of six HLA match is always going to be six out of six cadaveric

616
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:58,080
match. And I remember thinking, how is that possible? Now, tell folks what I just said,

617
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,240
explain what I just said to people. And more importantly, explain why it's true.

618
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah, so it's, it's pretty remarkable to consider the impact of living donation. And, and the

619
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,960
to your earlier question, kind of figuring out the appropriate place for living donation

620
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,400
as transplantation moves forward. So kidney transplantation, encounter distinction,

621
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,040
deliver transplantation, but in kidney transplantation, living donation has been part of

622
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,000
kidney transplantation from its origins, you know, so as I alluded to already, the

623
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:43,840
first transplant done between identical twins, living donation remained a part of the development

624
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:50,160
of kidney transplantation, and then really took off in the 1990s, we witnessed it happening.

625
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,280
With the development of the laparoscopic donor nephrectomy operation,

626
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:04,560
a procedure pioneered by two individuals at Hopkins, Lou Cavusi and Lloyd Ratner, who, and that,

627
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,400
you know, having a procedure that was of such tremendous benefit to the recipient,

628
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:16,240
that then was safe, and, you know, a smoother recovery for the donor, you know, really allowed

629
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,920
that to explode. And if you look at kidney transplantation in the United States now,

630
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:29,840
you know, so let's say 18 to 20,000 patients a year undergo kidney transplant in the United

631
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:36,240
States, and it's actually about half and half living donors and deceased donors. And, and that's

632
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:41,840
probably with under realizing the potential of living donation for all the reasons you said. So

633
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:48,160
part of what you're leading to is if you kind of compare head to head, let's say you have a patient

634
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:53,360
on dialysis, a patient who receives a deceased donor kidney transplant, and a patient who receives

635
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:58,320
a living donor kidney transplant, you know, let's say the starting line is the same for all three

636
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,480
of those. And let's say that they're similar age, similar comorbid conditions, similar misappressive

637
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,240
regimen for the transplant recipients. So the benefits are pretty clear, the dialysis curve is

638
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,000
going to drop off pretty quickly. So the, in fact, the studies that have shown that where the

639
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,040
dialysis and transplant curves cross, even with the risks of undergoing a surgical procedure and

640
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,800
starting immunosuppression occurs in less than a year. It's probably in somewhere between 90 and

641
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:33,120
250 days, depending on patient characteristics. So, so that's clear dialysis loses. What's

642
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,440
interesting then is that there's a difference between the deceased and living donor curves.

643
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,640
And that's what you were kind of so fascinated about. And the reasons for that are many,

644
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:48,720
but it probably speaks to the fact that even with all of the best technique in advances,

645
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:55,120
there is really no way to mitigate the fact that a deceased donor that goes through the process and

646
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:01,840
the trauma of brain death or donation after cardiac death gets removed from that individual's

647
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:08,240
body preserved, put on ice, transported to another center, and then sewn into the recipient.

648
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:17,120
And that interval of time can be six to 48, 72 hours in some circumstances, as opposed to a living

649
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:24,480
donor elective operation, side by side or sequential operating rooms, you know, the, the,

650
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:31,120
that kidney is in a healthy environment with a healthy normal person, normal vital signs.

651
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,720
We dissect out the kidney, clamp the blood vessels, take it out of the body, flush it,

652
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,440
walk it over to the recipient's room. And sometimes it's sewn in in under an hour,

653
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,320
you know, so the time, the ischemic time from coming out of the donor's body to into the

654
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:55,600
recipient. And it turns out that ischemic period is critical and is really almost linearly related

655
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:02,000
to the graft survival. Part of that is probably due to the, the consequences just of the ischemia

656
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,160
reperfusion injury and kind of literally knocking off some nephrons just from that process. Part of

657
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,320
it, it also is, as we've learned, is that that ischemia reperfusion injury cascade that starts

658
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:20,880
is a priming event for the immune system. So not only do deceased donor kidneys kind of pound for

659
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:27,280
pound compared to living donor kidneys take that initial hit from the ischemia reperfusion injury,

660
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,640
they're also more prone to rejection. You see more immunologic injury. They, they, they're,

661
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,080
it depends on the circumstance. They often require more immunosuppression, you know,

662
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:42,160
greater frequency of rejection. So it really is almost like two different products from a

663
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:49,360
recipient's point of view. And so, you know, I think if you had your druthers, you know, as a person

664
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,720
in need of a kidney transplant, you would want to have the access and the opportunity to get a

665
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:02,960
living donor any day of the week, if that is possible to you. And this other point though,

666
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:10,160
is to narrow that gap between the two. It's that with the, with the deceased donor,

667
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:16,480
you at least try to maximize the immunocompatibility. And with the living donor, you have much more

668
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,000
flexibility. Correct. That's exactly right. So, you know, what you were describing is kind of

669
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:30,960
the situation that you, the story you alluded to with Bob, is you're comparing a, a living donor

670
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:38,160
kidney, so optimal conditions of the transplant, but not a perfect immunologic situation, at least

671
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:45,120
from looking an HLA alone, versus a deceased donor kidney that immunologically is a home run. That's

672
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:52,080
about as good a situation as you can get, but still takes that ischemic hit. And, and we can't

673
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:56,880
make up for that. So even the best immunologic situation can't mitigate that, which I think is

674
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,920
a realization that doesn't always kind of come to fruition, but is again, one of the reasons why we

675
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,880
feel comfortable really pushing every kidney transplant candidate to, to think very seriously

676
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,320
about exploring options for a living donation. It's also what's led to some of the things you

677
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,360
alluded to, you know, paired kidney exchanges and other things to try and expand the, the

678
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,760
compatibility of donors and recipients. Let's, let's use an example to, to explain that to people,

679
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,960
because it's really quite fascinating. And, and we trained very close to some of the people who

680
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,720
really did a lot of the work behind optimizing the mathematical algorithms around that. So

681
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,480
let's pretend that, you know, you called me tomorrow and said, Peter, you're not going to

682
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:47,440
believe this, but you know, I'm kind of at the end of my rope with my kidneys and I'm gonna,

683
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:52,720
you know, I'm gonna need to have a transplant. And, and I, you know, I was sad. I thought about it.

684
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:57,440
I decided, you know what, I, there's, there's no greater way that I want to be able to thank Chris

685
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,840
for all he's done for me than to give him a kidney. And I've got two and I'm perfectly healthy and I'm

686
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,400
willing to part with one of them. So I call you up and I say, Chris, I want to give you one of my

687
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,360
kidneys. I want to be a living donor to you. So we would go and meet with the transplant team and

688
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:17,280
they would do some tests. And what if they discovered that I was a lousy match for you?

689
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:22,560
We didn't even have the same blood type, nevermind HLA compatibility. What would be some of the

690
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,560
options we would explore? Yeah. So that, so the circumstance you're talking about is this really

691
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:34,560
kind of frustrating scenario where, where a kidney transplant candidate has done the right things.

692
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,040
They've taken care of themselves. They've gotten to a transplant center. They're listed, you know,

693
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,960
for transplant, we think they're a good candidate. They've even gone to the effort that you just

694
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:50,400
described of identifying living donors and the living donor or donors that they identify are not

695
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:56,960
compatible with them or at least safely. So as you said, they might be of a different blood type.

696
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:03,360
Let's say, you know, I'm an A and you're a B. That's just not a barrier that we're used to

697
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,320
crossing at least with any kind of reasonable likelihood of the success rates we were discussing

698
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:18,960
earlier. It may also be that, that you, you know, I have preformed antibodies to HLA antigens that,

699
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,360
that you have. And as it turns out, there's certain populations that are more prone to that,

700
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:27,840
to that challenge. So it's a, it's a really frustrating challenge because here it is,

701
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,960
it's like you have this, you know, you've got this diamond in the rough, but you can't apply it,

702
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:39,360
you know. And so what some really smart people figured out, well, if I've got two pairs

703
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:47,120
and they're incompatible with each other, but happen to be compatible with the opposite. So let's say

704
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,280
that, you know, we're an A and a B and there's another pair over here that's a B and an A and

705
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:58,080
by all other measures are compatible. Is it reasonable to swap those kidneys and, and those

706
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:05,680
sorts of swap, kidney swaps or paired exchange began in the 1990s and really took off in the

707
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:12,720
2000s because it allowed people to avail themselves of broader opportunities for transplant.

708
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,920
Now, what you're alluding to in terms of the kind of the mathematics of it is you can imagine

709
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,360
there's some ethical quandaries there. So let's say, so you come forward to donate me a kidney,

710
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,880
you're an extremely healthy person, you've taken good care of yourself. I assume Jill has approved

711
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,920
this at some point. I haven't asked her, but you know, she can't wait to say hi to you after this

712
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,960
podcast. So I think she would let me donate to you. That's, that's an important part of the discussion.

713
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:47,280
But then let's say the pair that we were talking about exchanging with is, you know, someone about

714
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:54,480
our age who needs a kidney and their 75 year old father, you know, so I swapped to them this,

715
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:00,160
you know, perfectly healthy kidney from someone who's in good health and younger.

716
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:05,200
And I get in exchange for that a 75 year old kidney. Now, for some of the reasons we just

717
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:10,560
talked about, it might still be in my best interest to take that living donor kidney,

718
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,200
but you can imagine that there are differences in quality and then to add even more complexity to it

719
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:24,000
what if let's say the individual that you would be donating to across the swap,

720
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,320
you just by coincidence are a perfect match for, you know, HLA match across the board.

721
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:36,480
But that individual that I'm swapping for, I have, it's three out of six.

722
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:42,640
It's exactly or, or, or maybe there's even, you know, we, there's very sophisticated

723
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,760
assays that actually can look for low levels of what we call donor specific antibodies that

724
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,880
let's say that I've got some, you know, low level antibodies to that individual.

725
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:59,200
Is it worth the, the swap? Is it worth the extremis oppression? I would need to make that

726
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:06,640
a reality to make that pair exchange work. And so some smart people, including colleagues of ours

727
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,400
that we both know, Dorie Segev and his wife, Summer Gentry, who's a mathematician started

728
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,880
thinking about that. Like, so could we, could we start putting some value on those exchanges

729
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:24,160
and create networks of individuals? It's kind of like the dating game for kidneys where you

730
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:29,520
come forward with your donor and the algorithm looks at all the other possible pairs and tries

731
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:37,760
to match individuals in a way that maximizes predicted outcome. And there are now net national

732
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,520
networks that facilitate those sorts of exchanges and have really expanded kidney

733
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,280
transplantation in ways that I don't think even we would have predicted watching it back in the

734
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:56,560
1990s. You know, for example, there was a day, maybe three weeks ago where I did a laparoscopic

735
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:02,240
donor and a frectomy operation. So removed a kidney from an individual. That morning,

736
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:07,680
one of my colleagues was doing a similar operation in another room. Both those kidneys shipped out.

737
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,800
To other institutions, two kidneys came back later and our colleagues put them in later in the day

738
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:21,280
into two of our recipients. So it was like, you know, we've completely dissociated the donor

739
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,360
operation from the recipient operation, which from a patient's perspective is great, you know? And so

740
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,480
the donors don't have to travel. The recipients have more access to organs. And, you know, I think

741
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:37,520
thinking about how that is applied and expanded has really been a game changer for kidney

742
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,720
transplantation access. Chris, is there any serious discussion about opening up a market

743
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:50,880
for kidney donation? So everything we just described is it's happening through altruism.

744
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:58,080
I would give you my kidney because I love you. But is there a serious discussion that says,

745
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:06,560
look, what if I've just decided, you know what? Like, I'm willing to gamble, but I don't need a kidney.

746
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,760
I don't know a given individual, but for a big enough sum of money, I'm willing to part with my kidney.

747
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
Are those discussions even entertained?

748
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:22,000
Yeah, so it's a great question. And this is a frequently debated and

749
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:30,560
never resolved kind of debate in transplantation. So to put some framework behind that question,

750
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:39,600
so when transplantation started to become a successful medical intervention, so we're talking

751
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:48,880
now 70s into the 1980s development of Cyclosporin, we then started to think about, so, okay, this is

752
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:57,440
a successful venture. We now have organ donation laws that exist around the country. We need to

753
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:06,080
create networks to make sure that a liver that becomes available in Utah is accessible to the

754
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:12,560
patient in Michigan, as it to California or other circumstances. So there was a whole infrastructure

755
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:22,240
put around that challenge. The legality of it was, and the decision that was made at the time

756
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:31,440
these laws were passed, that it was illegal to sell an organ. And the reasons that that principle

757
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:37,040
was upheld is kind of central to transplantation, particularly in the United States, but in most

758
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:45,760
countries around the world, is that the belief was that organ donation was a gift. It was a

759
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:53,520
decision. So the kind of ethical decision was, or principle was, that the donor has autonomy over

760
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:00,560
that decision and makes it freely. The concern about allowing people to pay for organs, like

761
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:09,200
on an open market, was that can potentially be coercive and can create markets where individuals

762
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:16,400
who have lower standing in society or are economically disadvantaged, then are put in

763
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:23,120
this position where they can be selling their organs to achieve some game. And actually,

764
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,400
just literally this last weekend, there was an article in the New York Times about

765
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,760
the growth of kidney transplantation in Afghanistan, and that is exactly what happened.

766
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:39,600
They have kind of turned away from understanding relationships between donors and recipients,

767
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,360
and that's what's happened, that wealthy people who have the resources are paying

768
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,080
poor people for their kidneys and then not certainly caring for them afterwards. So

769
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:56,080
as a general principle, the transplant community has decided against paying for organs

770
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:02,480
as the principle being that it's coercive. Now, there's lots of people that disagree with that

771
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,920
on general principle and say, well, why don't we just create a better system, allow some exchange

772
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:15,840
of compensation to donors? And I think we are slowly migrating towards some version of that.

773
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:23,840
So to give you a few examples, the legality of this has been so tight that it's been impossible

774
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:31,280
even for donors to be reimbursed for transportation to the transplant center or time off work or other

775
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:37,360
sacrifices that they had to personally make that had nothing to do with the actual donation,

776
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:47,600
but just to facilitate that occurring. And there are now laws being passed in states and other

777
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:54,800
and other initiatives, either through advocacy groups. There's a national group that does

778
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:01,600
advocacy for living donors and provides resources and support for travel to transplant centers and

779
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:09,360
reimbursement for time away from work and such. But what if we created a principle where, say,

780
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:18,000
for example, a living donor is compensated with some agreed upon amount of money that compensates

781
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:27,760
for the time of their recovery? And I think there may come a time that some version of that becomes

782
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:36,080
a reality. There's also principles of should living donation provide special kind of health

783
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:45,360
care benefits to individuals over time. Maybe it qualifies you for discounted public insurance

784
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:50,480
or something so that you can never lose health insurance if you were to, God forbid, have a

785
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,880
problem yourself down the road. So I think there are some versions of this that will come to fruition

786
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:00,880
gradually. But I think at least in the United States, our medical legal environment and the

787
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:10,000
principles behind transplantation will not permit an open market for buying and selling of organs.

788
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,800
I like that idea about providing ongoing medical coverage. It's funny, whenever the debate comes

789
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,560
up about whether we should be paying NC2A athletes, especially football players, they generate so much

790
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:29,680
revenue for the university and then they get spanked if they accept a $50 gift from a booster.

791
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,400
I've always thought one solution to that is fine. If you don't want to pay athletes for playing

792
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,560
sports at a university, you should at least cover their medical bills for the rest of their lives.

793
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,600
Like if an athlete suffers some consequence as a result of playing sports, which many of them do,

794
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,400
we should at least make sure that we take care of them if we're going to profit off them to the

795
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:56,720
course of that. Tell folks a little bit about if it's still the case, I assume it's still the case,

796
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,800
there are some states in which you're better off and more likely to get an organ, like a liver,

797
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,920
for example, than other states. How does that work? And what would be the best states to live in if

798
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:14,720
you're vying for an organ versus the worst? Right. So fortunately, that is changing rapidly. And it's

799
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:21,440
changing rapidly because it's been a focus of intentional policy change. So it's not like when

800
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:29,040
we were in residency where it was almost comical. Correct. So I think part of the issue is simply

801
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:36,320
a supply and demand issue. So if you look, for example, at California, a state with a huge

802
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:49,440
population, and there is such a demand for transplant that if you kind of imagine California

803
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:56,000
is just its own unit, it's almost like the organ donation supply in California would never meet

804
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,840
the demand. That's true in other major, particularly urban population centers like New

805
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:07,600
York and parts of the East Coast. There are other parts of the country, and they tend to be in the

806
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:14,880
Midwest, but there's some other locations in the South as well, where just based on population size,

807
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:21,920
the amount of individuals in need of an organ transplant is modest compared to the supply of

808
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:29,840
organ donors. And I think that has created this disparity where depending on where you live,

809
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:36,560
you may have better access to organ in various places. The solution to that, obviously,

810
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:44,640
is to change the system. So in other words, the way that organ donation is coordinated nationally

811
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:49,200
is through these organizations called Organ Procurement Organizations, or OPOs. There's

812
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:55,760
58 of them in the country. Some of them are pretty easily understandable, like Michigan has,

813
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:01,920
for example, one OPO that covers the whole state. There's like six in Texas. So it's a little bit

814
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,880
of a confusing network. But the point is those are the organizations, nonprofit organizations,

815
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:15,040
that are responsible for identifying organ donors and facilitating the gift from procurement

816
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:22,720
to transplant. And then the waiting list, you hear people say that they're on the waiting list for

817
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:28,720
an organ. The way that an organ is actually placed is every time an organ donor becomes available,

818
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:35,840
the list is run according to a predetermined algorithm of how that particular organ is

819
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:42,320
prioritized. And the problem, at least historically, is that that list has been run

820
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:49,200
largely locally or regionally first, and only then kind of offered out more broadly. And so

821
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:57,120
what has changed in heart, lung, and liver transplantation and is about to change in kidney

822
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:02,640
transplantation is those kind of relatively artificial state or regional boundaries have

823
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:08,320
just gotten destroyed. And so now the way organs are allocated are literally by concentric circles.

824
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:15,520
So they offer it based on distance from the donor hospital. And that has created some interesting

825
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:24,800
phenomena. I mean, the good news is, to your point, is that the geographic variation that exists across

826
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:30,720
the country has decreased. So it's not as important now to go to a certain place if you know you need

827
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:37,360
a liver transplant, for example. It also has created a system where if you're really sick,

828
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,760
you know, at the top of the list for liver transplantation, for example, you're going to

829
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,320
get transplanted quickly because you've got access to this broad swath of organ toners.

830
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:51,600
The challenge is kind of the people that are medium sick, some of whom are still quite ill

831
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:58,080
from their disease, who have all these sicker people kind of ahead of them on the list getting

832
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:04,880
transplanted. And that speaks to the kind of need for expanding the donor pool, alternative donor

833
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:10,560
sources, more living donation than a case of kidney and liver transplantation to kind of meet

834
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:17,040
that need. So the system has gotten more fair, but it's only exposed the need even more, I guess,

835
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:22,560
is the best way to say it. That's good to hear because it definitely struck me as a pretty unjust

836
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:29,920
system, you know, 20 years ago, especially with liver, where you could, you know, it was almost

837
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:37,920
like the yeah, it reminded me of some great injustice. You alluded to brain death earlier,

838
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,920
we've been remiss in not, I think, explaining to people a little bit what that means. And

839
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,960
especially now as we sort of talk a little bit about liver, where a much greater number of the

840
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:56,000
transplantations are from non-living donors, the donors are non-living. So what does it mean to be

841
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,440
brain dead? And how does that factor into, from a legal standpoint, what does it mean? And then from

842
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:09,280
a physiologic and biologic standpoint, what does it mean? Yeah, so it's interesting. You would think

843
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:13,920
that this would be like something you could flip to page one in, you know, medical textbook, and

844
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,920
there would be, you know, but it's actually been a relatively kind of complex set of definitions to

845
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:30,640
come to. And the importance of establishing brain death was in many ways driven by the development

846
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:38,560
of transplantation. Because if we were going to use organ deceased organ donors for transplant,

847
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:48,320
we needed to establish clearly defined ways that these were individuals that could not recover,

848
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:56,640
you know, we're not going to be salvageable such that they could then go on to be organ donors.

849
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:04,960
And to be even more specific about that, the whole question of what defines death, you know,

850
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:12,800
so is death when the heart stops or is or do we consider death when the brain has lost function

851
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:21,600
and control? And what has developed over time? And so just to clarify that for people, right, the first thing you said is when the heart stops is what we call

852
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:29,680
cardiopulmonary death. So a person has a heart attack, the heart stops, cardiopulmonary death. A person has cancer,

853
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:37,680
eventually leads to cardiopulmonary death. Correct. This brain death thing, how does it show up?

854
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:41,680
Give people examples of the physical way, the physiologic ways people get there.

855
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:50,560
Yeah, so it's a kind of confusing concept. How can the body be alive but the brain be dead? And there are

856
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:56,560
a whole number of circumstances where that can occur. But essentially the kind of central

857
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:06,000
component of the definition is that the brain sustains an injury. That could be from anoxia,

858
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,920
from an anoxic event. It can be literally from a traumatic event, you know, a penetrating injury,

859
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:20,000
a devastating head trauma. It can be from an intracranial event, a bleed or such, such that

860
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:27,680
the pressure in the brain and the injury that evolves in the brain increases to a point that

861
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:35,920
blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain stops. And so all the cellular processes that are occurring

862
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:44,560
kind of from literally the skull base up have stopped. And, you know, there are clinical ways

863
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:53,440
to define that diagnosis. So there are characteristic neurologic manifestations of brain death.

864
01:34:54,240 --> 01:35:00,240
You know, the kind of classic ones that you see on TV are the, you know, the blown pupils as someone's

865
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:08,320
brain has swollen to no longer allow blood flow into the skull.

866
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:16,960
You know, there are core bodily functions that the brain drives, such as respiratory drive,

867
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:23,600
that are part of that definition as well as a bunch of additional primitive reflexes. And

868
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:29,040
really what evolved over time is a clinical definition of brain death that includes multiple

869
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:35,600
elements, including that the donor has, or sorry, that the individual has to be, you know,

870
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:41,440
hemodynamically stable. They can't be hypothermic. They can't be in some metabolic condition that

871
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:48,320
could confuse the issue. But then the central focus of it is this thing called an apnea test,

872
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:54,000
where they literally stop the mechanical breathing support and see whether or not the individual

873
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:01,440
generates the drive to breathe on their own. And so there are clinical brain death exams that

874
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,360
that physicians are used to doing to document that. And then there are ancillary studies that

875
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:14,480
can actually show that blood flow has stopped into the brain. And I think coming to a consensus

876
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:22,720
on that definition was really critical to allow the establishment of what equates with death.

877
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:28,320
So the loss of the function of that individual, even if their other physiologic functions,

878
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:35,360
like their heart beating, are maintained. And establishing that diagnosis then allowed the

879
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:42,560
step to go from, well, if they are brain dead, but they still have present circulation, can we then

880
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:51,040
move to organ procurement? Because in the absence of that, you could kind of ethically equate organ

881
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:57,680
procurement as prompting death, right? So in other words, if these individuals are not yet dead,

882
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,000
organ procurement is expediting their death, which with their death, which violates all the

883
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:10,080
principles of kind of autonomy and the principle of organ donation that transplantation is built on.

884
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,800
So there's a couple of things there I just want to highlight before you go on, Chris,

885
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:20,240
just so people understand. Brain death still requires cardiopulmonary support, right? That's

886
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:24,240
the very important thing people need to understand. A brain dead individual is not going to be laying

887
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:30,320
in a bed, their brain not functioning, yet somehow they're alive. By definition, if your brain is

888
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:35,680
dead and you are not on full cardiorespiratory support, you will be dead within moments.

889
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,560
So that's why this APNIC test is done while they're hooked up to a respirator that is just

890
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:46,960
turned off, but not disconnected. They will fail to breathe as you point out, they will fail the

891
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,080
APNIC test, and then they'll be resumed on cardiopulmonary support because of course the goal

892
01:37:52,720 --> 01:38:00,080
is to continue to oxygenate their body perfectly to maintain the appropriate levels of tissue

893
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:07,040
health. The other thing that's worth mentioning, if you watch TV, you might be lulled into thinking

894
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:12,240
that the same set of doctors that are trying to understand if you're brain dead and trying to take

895
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:18,320
care of you after whatever accident you had that led to the situation you're in have anything to do

896
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:23,760
with the doctors that are coming along to take the kid in your liver. Because that would seem

897
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:34,320
a little grotesque. Explain that sort of line between those two teams of physicians because

898
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:39,120
you and I have been multiple times on both sides of that. We've been taking care of those patients

899
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:43,760
in the ICU that are going to become donors, and then we've been on the other side where you're

900
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:51,360
now part of the team that's harvesting organs. Correct. It's a clear ethical principle that is

901
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:58,960
central to not only the kind of effective operationalizing of transplant, but also to

902
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:07,840
the establishment of the public trust that is critical to allowing transplantation to exist.

903
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:14,080
And the way I explain that to transplant families and organ donor families is that

904
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:23,280
the systems are completely separate with an opportunity for integration in between that only

905
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:34,000
occurs when certain events has happened in the individual's care. So number one, the concept of

906
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:43,600
brain death has to be thought about to begin with. That's part of the diagnostic evaluation of

907
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:55,520
that individual. The brain death exam needs to be confirmed. The family and or patient through

908
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:02,800
previous documentation has identified that individual as an organ donor, and only then

909
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:10,400
after those steps is the transplant machinery or specifically the organ procurement organization

910
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:16,880
involved. So I think some people have the concern, well gosh, are the people that want more organs

911
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:22,160
for transplant going to somehow interfere in the decisions that are made about this

912
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,560
individual who's undergone some tragedy that's leading to the end of their life.

913
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:33,520
And the reality of that is fortunately that we have no impact on that on that decision.

914
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:44,560
The I think the other principle that occurs is that then the care of that individual body,

915
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:50,800
because if there been declared brain death we consider the individual, then passes from the

916
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,800
caregivers, the health care team that's been caring for them, to the organ procurement

917
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:02,000
organization and their team and then eventually to the transplant teams and to the procurement.

918
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:08,160
So there's a clear transition from when they go from an individual under the care of the ICU team

919
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:15,600
or the teams that are caring for them to the individual's responsibility it is to facilitate

920
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:23,120
the gift of transplant. And I think in situations that fortunately occur more and more often where

921
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:28,960
either the individual themself have already identified on their driver's license or through

922
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:34,000
conversations with their family that they in the event of a tragedy they want to be an organ donor

923
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:41,200
or families come forward and I always think this is incredibly generous. I mean this usually occurs

924
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:48,320
out of the worst day of their life and they come forward to say that they would want their loved

925
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:55,680
one to be an organ donor. Nothing happens on the transplant side until all those steps have occurred.

926
01:41:55,680 --> 01:42:02,480
And so I think it's really kind of critical to understand that it is worth alluding to the concept

927
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:07,200
of donation after cardiac death which is where that gets a little more confusing. So there are

928
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:16,800
there are individuals who have suffered a life-threatening event, a devastating head trauma,

929
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:24,080
but that has not caused brain death, other medical conditions where the care team and the caregivers

930
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:31,280
have decided that their life is not salvageable but they're not technically brain death and that's

931
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:36,640
always been a conundrum because what if those individuals want to donate their organs but they

932
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:43,440
don't meet this very strict criteria that we've established as a important principle to allow

933
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,880
organ donation. And what has evolved in the United States and around the world

934
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:58,320
over time is this concept of donation after cardiac death. And importantly there still needs

935
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:06,880
to be the establishment of death before we can procure organs to again separate the process of

936
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:12,640
declaring death from the process of procuring organs. And so what happens in a donation after

937
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:21,040
cardiac death situation is the family chooses to withdraw care, care is withdrawn, the individual

938
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:28,160
then expires over some period of time and then depending on the circumstances of that individual's

939
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:36,240
death, how quickly it happens, etc. If we then believe it's appropriate to still utilize those

940
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:43,600
organs, organ procurement can occur and those decisions are all made before withdrawal of care.

941
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:50,720
So in other words the family has decided to proceed with pursuing organ donation,

942
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:54,880
the arrangements have been made to have the teams and individuals available there

943
01:43:55,680 --> 01:44:01,200
to procure the organs and preserve the organs appropriately but nothing happens until that

944
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:06,960
individual is declared dead by a provider that has nothing to do with the transplant team. So I think

945
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:12,240
even in the case of donation after cardiac death we've kept that very clear delineation between

946
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:20,400
individuals caring for the patient and individuals processing the gift of the donor for transplant.

947
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:26,800
You alluded to something earlier which reminds me of one of the sadder stories when I was

948
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:34,480
in residency actually when this happened. So my mom, one of my mom's closest friends,

949
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:43,680
her son who was five years younger than me so I grew up together was driving home

950
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:51,040
one morning after a night shift and fell asleep, crashed and died an immediate brain death

951
01:44:51,760 --> 01:45:00,000
and his mom, single mom, no relationship to his father, had to make this what can only be

952
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,960
described as you said the worst day of your life and now you have to make a decision and

953
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:13,040
you know I'll never forget she made this decision to have every single aspect of her son

954
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:19,840
donated you know cornea, skin, his liver was split into two so two people benefited from his

955
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:30,240
liver as both kidneys, heart, lungs. It's always stuck with me and if that wasn't enough a couple

956
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:36,320
years later I would go on to meet a friend that I ended up working with actually who lost his son

957
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:42,240
to his he was in a jeep accident, rollover jeep and same thing you know he and his wife had to

958
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:48,800
make this awful decision about their 21 year old son who had just died and without hesitation they

959
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,600
did the same thing which was you know every piece of our son Aaron it was his name is going to be

960
01:45:56,160 --> 01:46:01,520
you know donated to help someone else and what was especially amazing in the case of

961
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,320
of this couple I think I can say their names I don't I think they're actually quite vocal about

962
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:12,880
this Jeff and Tina Webster is that they got to know every one of the recipients

963
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:22,880
and as I got to know them and got to know the stories I was just you know I was just blown

964
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,400
away by it and again I'm someone who's been around this stuff right like it's not like I

965
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:33,840
haven't seen these things before but you know the the man who got his liver has a tattoo of their

966
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:40,000
son on his arm you know it's that kind of stuff right and it's it's just it's it is hard to believe

967
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,920
I mean do people ever ask you Chris hey should I should I check that box on my driver's license

968
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:51,200
and and like how do you talk to people about those decisions? Yeah it's a great question and it is

969
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:55,600
one that I that I get asked and actually my oldest daughter tells me she occasionally gets

970
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:01,520
asked now I guess because people know her dad's a transplant surgeon but you know I think you know

971
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:08,240
I think so what are the reasons that people hesitate to to do that and I think some of it is what

972
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:15,200
we already alluded to is kind of the the concern or the mythology that somehow it'll affect their

973
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:21,040
own health care and and you know sometimes I'll answer questions about that but but I always try

974
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:30,320
to focus on the the profound impact that transplantation can have and try to share with them

975
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,840
what I've learned from donor families over the year and one of the privileges of the

976
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:41,600
position I am in now is that I do get to occasionally do advocacy work and other

977
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:48,960
other opportunities to meet donor families so families like you just told of the Webster's that

978
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:57,440
have a history of a family member who was an organ donor and many of them can you know poignantly

979
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:02,960
tell of the the process they walk through with that decision making and the memories of their loved

980
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:13,680
one but one of the things that donor families you know really universally share is that their

981
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:21,680
experience of organ donation whether or not they were able to meet the eventual recipients of their

982
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:28,880
loved one's organs but that the experience of organ donation and knowing that their loved one's

983
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:38,560
organs went on live on in another individual and saved their life is the only good thing about

984
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:44,480
what was otherwise the worst day of their lives and I've heard that actual phrasing repeated

985
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:50,880
by multiple families by multiple individuals who had to say goodbye to their you know son daughter

986
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:58,560
sister brother you know husband wife but took some solace in the fact that you were honoring

987
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:04,880
their life by passing on the gift of their organs to another individual so I think it's important

988
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:12,160
for people to hear that it is really a can be a transformative gift I think the other thing I share

989
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:18,880
with people and let them make their own decisions is that you know there is an incredible need for

990
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:26,480
organ donation you know so there are currently more than a hundred thousand you know people waiting

991
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:34,480
on the waiting list for the various organs and and you know each year there are you know less than

992
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:41,920
you know 40 percent or so of that number done you know and the the need only grows each year the gap

993
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:51,200
between donation and supply grows each year furthermore the outcomes of the individuals

994
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:57,920
who get transplanted improves each year so not only do we have this tremendous need for individuals

995
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:04,080
dying of organ failure but the life that they can look forward to is in most cases you know

996
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:11,200
incredibly good you know restoring them back to you know life expectancies that approximate

997
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:17,280
normal and qualities of life that in many cases are totally normal so I mean I think that's the

998
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:22,480
vision I try to share with people when they're considering organ donation but acknowledge that

999
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:28,240
it's a very personal decision and people have to be comfortable with that I do encourage people

1000
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:33,200
if they feel passionately about it to make the decision themselves because I can tell you

1001
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,720
like you said you know we've been on both sides of this that that walking through that decision

1002
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:46,080
making with someone's loved one who is in you know the middle of the night in a foreign hospital

1003
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:52,160
trying to make the decision about the wishes of their loved one isn't is an impossible task so

1004
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:58,240
the more that you can you know register yourself or and communicate that to your family the actual

1005
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:03,600
easier you make it on your loved ones god forbid they end up in that situation having to facilitate

1006
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:08,240
that gift yeah I think that's the point you can think of this as an advanced directive which

1007
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,840
actually is the biggest service you can give to people around you so that they don't have to

1008
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:22,720
there's no ambiguity about what your wishes are so we've talked a lot about kidney but I you know

1009
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:27,360
I think I'd be remiss if we didn't spend some time talking about the liver which is really the bread

1010
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:33,120
and butter of your clinical practice and it's certainly one of the most technically demanding

1011
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:40,080
operations in the field it's no surprise then that the most amazing surgical resident I ever

1012
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:48,080
got the train alongside is doing the pinnacle of what surgery offers let's go back to the 1960s

1013
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:53,840
there's a young guy it's 1963 there's this guy nobody's ever heard of thomas starzel

1014
01:51:54,400 --> 01:52:01,680
um he's he's plugging away at this operation he actually I think if I'm not mistaken was the

1015
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:06,720
first guy to figure out that you could add prednisone to imuran and actually increase survival to levels

1016
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:12,560
that were still abysmal by today's standards but reasonable you know I think he was getting 70

1017
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:20,000
survival at one year but four years later a three-year-old boy dies on the operating table bleeds to

1018
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:26,000
death and at that point people sort of had enough and there was kind of as you alluded to earlier

1019
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,880
this moratorium on liver transplants until we figure this out more let's start with the technical

1020
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:41,600
aspect of it what is it about the liver that is so difficult to surgically implant yeah so I mean

1021
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:50,400
the liver is the largest solid organ in the body it has some interesting anatomical nuances it has

1022
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:58,160
a dual blood supply so it's supplied by the hepatic artery which is a major branch essentially off the

1023
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:05,680
aorta as well as the portal vein which is the blood drainage of all of the intestinal blood flow

1024
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:11,680
and the reason that returns through the liver is the liver is the filter essentially the metabolic

1025
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:21,040
filter for the the metabolites absorbed in the GI tract it then lives on top of the vena cava the

1026
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:26,400
major vein returning blood from the lower part of the body back to the heart and actually sits right

1027
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:31,520
below the diaphragm right below the right atrium where it has this complex venous network that

1028
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:40,800
drains into the vena cava so it's it's anatomically made not to be messed with in some ways is the

1029
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,640
way you'll hear people talk about it I mean and in addition to that you then have all the intrahepatic

1030
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:52,960
anatomy which you know which can be profoundly complex as well but the thing that makes liver

1031
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:59,920
transplantation really the challenge that it is surgically is not so much the anatomy which you

1032
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:06,320
know fortunately with experience you learn how to navigate it's the fact that liver failure

1033
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,800
at least the the diseases for which we most commonly transplant so the development of

1034
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:21,440
cirrhosis or the end stages of chronic liver injury and fibrosis leads not only to synthetic

1035
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:26,800
failure of the liver so the liver loses the ability to process some of those metabolites

1036
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:31,600
it loses its ability to make new proteins including some of the proteins that help your

1037
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:39,200
blood clot and other important functions but because the liver is become this scarred

1038
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:45,360
fibrotic organ all of that blood flow that's returning from the intestines has to make its

1039
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:52,560
way through what used to be this soft compliant sponge and is now literally the consistency of a

1040
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:59,520
rock and so the what happens is you develop this condition called portal hypertension where the

1041
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:06,960
the blood the pressure in the portal venous system increases such that it tries to find

1042
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:13,280
other ways back to the heart and so it it forms collateral channels that's those collateral

1043
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:19,440
channels are what what form the varices or varicosities that that develop in the GI tract

1044
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:25,120
that can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage in liver patients it's what leads to the formation

1045
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:29,920
of ascites or the fluid retention that you see in patients with liver disease with these huge

1046
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:37,920
protuberance distended abdomens and it also makes the surgical field this kind of rat's nest of

1047
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:45,280
collateral venous vessels so so you've got the challenge of a large you know organ with

1048
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:51,600
challenging anatomy you have the challenge of this condition that makes the dissection and the

1049
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:56,960
predilection towards bleeding even higher and then you have the synthetic function which is

1050
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:02,000
occurs in the setting of a you're doing this operation the setting of an individual who's

1051
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,840
not making normally normal clotting factors so it's really both the circumstance of the

1052
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:15,760
technical challenge but more more often the the the circumstances and the in which you're doing

1053
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:22,160
it and you know as you know liver failure leads to cakkexia and muscle loss so these are debilitated

1054
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:28,640
sick patients that you're then doing a big operation on in suboptimal conditions and so

1055
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:36,800
the fact that tom starzel and his contemporaries took that operation on in the 1960s when

1056
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,080
electrocottery wasn't really a thing most hospitals didn't really have blood banks

1057
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:47,200
we didn't even have kind of critical care anesthesia at least with any you know

1058
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:54,480
resemblance to what it is now i mean it's pretty remarkable that that was even conceptualized much

1059
01:56:54,480 --> 01:57:02,880
less achieved technically and as you alluded to it was really their realization that not only was

1060
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:09,680
the procedure so technically demanding that the risk of early mortality was quite high but you

1061
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:15,600
were doing it in a immunologic setting that just was not successful and so you know even the patients

1062
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:21,840
that survived the operation in the early recovery there were really no survivors past 90 days in

1063
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:26,800
the first you know dozens of transplants done which is what led to the moratorium on liver

1064
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:31,840
transplantation that occurred in the late 60s and i would add one other thing to punctuate everything

1065
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:37,280
you said chris which is not only are these the sickest patients i've ever seen i mean these

1066
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:45,360
patients are staggeringly sick but they lack something that every other sick patient has

1067
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:49,760
prior to a transplantation so whether we're talking about cardiac transplantation

1068
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,920
pulmonary transplantation pancreatic transplantation renal transplantation

1069
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:59,600
all of those organs have some form of extracorporeal support that is offered to them

1070
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:08,640
to at least bridge the gap or tune them up a little bit prior to surgery the liver remains

1071
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:15,200
the only major organ with no form of extracorporeal support now i i could spend an hour giving you my

1072
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:20,240
theories as to why that's the case i think it speaks i'll give you the punch line i think it

1073
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:25,280
speaks to one particular function of the liver although i think there are many but i think the

1074
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:31,760
one that just can't be done by a machine is the regulation of blood glucose it is so complicated

1075
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:36,560
to manage gluconeogenesis glycogen storage i mean you have to be able to regulate something to

1076
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:42,480
the milligram level with with seconds to spare there are probably a dozen other reasons but

1077
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:48,640
you know every attempt at extracorporeal liver support has failed including some crazy stories

1078
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:53,760
that you know i heard from god one of our one of the transplant surgeons i remember it might have

1079
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:58,960
been montgomery even told a story about the baboon yeah that's that's a mel williams story

1080
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,560
oh that's right that's right mel williams why don't you tell folks that story actually it's

1081
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:09,920
just the scariest thing so um you know what you're alluding to is exactly correct so there have been

1082
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:17,120
all kinds of uh both mechanical and even you know in atomic models trying to address

1083
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,560
liver dysfunction or to bridge that gap you know from liver failure to transplant and nothing has

1084
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:31,280
worked real well i mean essentially we've tried you know uh what's been called liver dialysis

1085
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:35,200
so in other words trying to remove some of the toxins from the bloodstream that the liver is

1086
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:40,400
responsible for filtering we've we've tried things that do address the portal hypertension

1087
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:45,280
so at least you kind of alleviate that problem but nothing has replaced the synthetic function

1088
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:53,280
that you describe so one of the obvious kind of conjectures well what if well then we need a

1089
01:59:53,280 --> 02:00:01,600
physiologic solution to this could we support patients particularly patients with acute liver

1090
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:07,840
failure where the injury is acute and the liver is this incredible organ in that it does have this

1091
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:13,840
regenerative capacity hepatocytes will replenish over time so the thinking was well if someone

1092
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:21,680
comes in with a tylenol overdose or an acute viral toxicity to their liver could we just bridge them

1093
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:27,760
long enough until those new hepatocytes start to come into play and so it was under that principle

1094
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:34,400
that the concept of well can we do some sort of extracorporeal model to support these patients

1095
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:42,640
and so Mel Williams who was the he was a contemporary and a student of David Hume

1096
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:47,600
who was one of the godfathers of liver or excuse me of transplant and transplant immunology

1097
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:53,280
specifically Christian Barnard who did the first heart transplant actually trained in his lab

1098
02:00:53,760 --> 02:01:00,000
and Dr. Williams you know worked there as well and then eventually came to Hopkins and started

1099
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,360
the transplant program at Johns Hopkins he was a kidney transplant recipient eventually himself

1100
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:11,200
received a living donor kidney from his wife and unfortunately died recently you know later in age

1101
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:18,640
not related to his transplant a remarkable kind of luminary figure and one of the best storytellers

1102
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:24,800
you know you've ever heard but he tells the story of that they decided well why don't we address

1103
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:32,720
acute liver failure by hooking up the patient to a extracorporeal essentially you know bypass circuit

1104
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:39,840
and put a baboon on the other side of the circulation so the baboon's liver would

1105
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:45,680
essentially filter the toxins out they'd be the blood would be returned to the individual

1106
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:52,880
and that would address their acute liver failure and so they worked on this prep and they did all

1107
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:57,680
kinds of preclinical studies and eventually they had somebody come in with acute liver failure

1108
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:03,760
and you know I don't know the specifics of IRB regulations at that time but sure enough they

1109
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:10,560
got approval to to do this and one of the things they quickly realized is and I don't know any of

1110
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:15,600
the veterinary medicine behind this but you can't sedate a baboon very easily you know it takes her

1111
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:23,120
culean doses of you know sedatives so and you can't have a baboon running around the medical ICU

1112
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:30,000
unit at Johns Hopkins hospital so they decided and maybe what wasn't the most ingenious method to

1113
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,120
put the baboon in a body cast so they would at least the baboon would be frozen to the bed

1114
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:43,600
so they do the preparation and you know unbelievably it starts to work so the the

1115
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:50,560
patient's encephalopathy clears the patient starts to wake up so this poor individual wakes up in the

1116
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:55,520
ICU at Johns Hopkins he doesn't know what's happened to him looks over and there's a baboon

1117
02:02:55,520 --> 02:03:00,640
lying next to him in the bed next to him so what does he do he tries to get up and start pulling at

1118
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:06,080
lines so the solution they decided to that is they actually put him in a body cast too so there was

1119
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:11,840
a baboon and this poor individual in a body cast in the ICU next next to each other at Johns

1120
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:18,800
Hopkins and that that was a short-lived series of experiments but it did prove the principle

1121
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:25,920
that that would work you know that the that if you had an actual functional liver

1122
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,800
in cross circulation with an individual and actually he went on to do some preparations

1123
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:35,360
between for example family members if a family member came in with acute liver failure you

1124
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:40,560
could put him in cross circulation with you know a sibling or something and some of those did

1125
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:46,720
did work and maintain those patients it also led to the principle that is part of a

1126
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:54,320
investigational product now that created this essential a dialysis column populated with

1127
02:03:54,320 --> 02:04:01,280
hepatocytes you know with with kind of a hepatocyte stem cell line that populates the hepatocytes and

1128
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:07,520
that has been shown at least in some studies to at least provide some limited short-term support

1129
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,600
as well so but the principle behind what you said is absolutely right that we have not figured out

1130
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:18,880
how to provide extracorporeal support for liver patients so they really are the patients that

1131
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:26,800
face death if they are not able to be transplanted in a timely fashion one of the most stark memories

1132
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:32,720
i have from residency on the on the side of patients that would ultimately need a transplant

1133
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:40,720
was probably my second year in the old sick you and a young woman came in she was 21 years old

1134
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:48,240
she'd overdosed on tylenol and it's funny when you realize how dangerous tylenol is and yet how

1135
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:54,960
willy-nilly it's available you know the you know this of course but just for folks listening the

1136
02:04:54,960 --> 02:05:01,520
ld50 the lethal dose at which 50 of the population would be dead from a drug that's a you know that

1137
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:06,320
one would know that for every drug out there what's the ld50 of fentanyl what's the ld50

1138
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:11,680
well the ld50 of tylenol might only be 10 to 20 times beyond what you would normally take for

1139
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:18,640
your headache and so the ease with which a person can end their life with with tylenol is is is

1140
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:23,840
staggeringly high and as was the case in with this with this girl you know i think she broke

1141
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:31,920
up with her boyfriend and took a bottle of tylenol and by the time she sort of realized

1142
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:38,160
that this was a bad idea it was too late and there was the saddest memory i have chris as the

1143
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:45,680
following before she really went into acute liver failure and and then suffered sort of the

1144
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:51,360
encephalopathy that would then rob her of her cognition while we waited for a transplant

1145
02:05:51,360 --> 02:06:00,160
there was a lucid period of time when her pt you know inr ptt were through the roof lft's were

1146
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:06,480
through the roof and it was very clear she was going to die without a liver transplant and yet

1147
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:12,240
she was cognizant enough to know that and i don't remember how big that window was but it it was it

1148
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:18,320
it existed now we could have been wrong maybe she was going to recover but but it turned out

1149
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:26,720
she ended up getting transplanted um and it was it was just amazing to see her wake up from that

1150
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:32,000
and realize like she had another lease on life and you could say i mean look someone could say well

1151
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,920
she made a dumb mistake you know and maybe she didn't deserve another chance but of course

1152
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:44,080
i would say who among us hasn't done really dumb things yeah um it's so true it's it's you know

1153
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:48,320
fortunately acute liver failure only accounts for about five percent of the liver transplants

1154
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:55,200
done in the united states so it's a relatively uncommon situation in part because the liver is

1155
02:06:55,200 --> 02:07:02,080
pretty resilient so sometimes even a catastrophic you know overdose if with good critical care and

1156
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:08,960
other measures many of those patients will recover but um you know we are often faced with the

1157
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:15,600
situation where just exactly like you described a person comes in with a tylenol overdose it's an

1158
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:21,760
intentional overdose or at least as you know suicidal type gesture um and we have to make

1159
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:26,320
the decision with limited information about whether or not we think they're an appropriate

1160
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:30,720
transplant candidate and you know occasionally there are reasons why they're not you know

1161
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:37,680
uncontrolled comorbid disease or maybe you know other factors but usually it's exactly the

1162
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:44,880
circumstance you described it's a young distressed person who reacted badly to a

1163
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:52,560
you know a particular event and it makes a very impulsive decision impulsive decision with a with

1164
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:58,400
a freely available drug like out of their medicine cabinet you know and i think the approach of our

1165
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:04,000
center which i think is true of most transplant centers is to give those patients the benefit of

1166
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,240
the doubt and try and get them to transplant rapidly and then use all the appropriate resources

1167
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:13,280
afterwards to help support them and make sure that any mental health issues and such are addressed so

1168
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:20,480
they are tragic and dramatic circumstances they can be incredibly rewarding you know transplants

1169
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:26,880
as you would imagine though to see them literally get transformed you know from the transplant

1170
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:32,560
transplant chris when you and i were in medical school and residency for that matter

1171
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:40,160
it seemed abundantly clear that hepatitis c was going to overwhelm the liver transplant

1172
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:47,200
infrastructure within the united states today there's good news and there's bad news the good

1173
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:52,000
news is that hepatitis c is not going to overwhelm the liver transplant infrastructure of the united

1174
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,440
states the bad news is that something else is going to do that and that's naphaldy and nash

1175
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:04,800
can you tell us the twin stories of these two things and and uh how is it that that uh that

1176
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:11,440
something that we believed could never be cured got cured yep and then how is it that this thing

1177
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:17,520
that we didn't know existed 20 years ago is going to be if it not already is the leading indication

1178
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:24,080
for liver transplant in the developed world it's such a kind of at once compelling but also

1179
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:29,760
humbling story and i'll in telling it i'll add even a third actor that you know is is part of

1180
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:38,880
this as well so um hepatitis c as as you alluded to uh you know a viral illness um blood-borne

1181
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:45,440
illness that can um this has kind of an interesting history some people that are exposed to to

1182
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:52,160
so hepatitis c rarely causes an acute illness fortunately some people that are exposed to it

1183
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:59,520
can clear the virus so spontaneously clear the virus but the majority are left with chronic

1184
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:07,600
viremia and subsequent uh inflammation which is which is silent for years and in some cases

1185
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:13,520
decades so the the kind of history of this in the united states is that people were exposed to this

1186
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:19,760
you know in the 70s and 80s either due to a time when the blood supply was not really tested for

1187
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:24,720
as stringently and they acquired it through blood transfusion or they acquired it from

1188
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:32,880
use of ivy drugs or other exposures but then went about their life and then here they are

1189
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:39,200
20 30 years later with cirrhosis and eventual complications of cirrhosis and indication for

1190
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:46,400
transplant and the and for about 20 years that was the predominant indication for transplant in

1191
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:52,320
the united states which was a challenge because the medications we had to treat hepatitis c were not

1192
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:58,720
particularly effective you know response rates of 15 to 30 percent or so so every one of those

1193
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:05,200
patients got recurrent hepatitis c after their transplant and many went on to develop graft

1194
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:10,560
failure you know and cirrhosis essentially of their transplant graft so it was a it was a

1195
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:15,680
particularly frustrating clinical problem because there was this enormous need but also we were only

1196
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:22,240
kind of partially solving the problem and you know what has happened and what you're alluding to is

1197
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:30,400
in the last 10 years essentially was the development of these direct anti antiviral agents that have

1198
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:36,640
transformed the field of hepatitis c and it's you know you can make some arguments about what's

1199
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:41,920
the greatest medical advance we've witnessed in our you know medical career but that's up in the

1200
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:48,880
top two or three yeah i don't i don't think i could think of something more impressive in my

1201
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:56,880
i mean maybe you could argue the the you know retroviral regimens that made hiv a chronic disease

1202
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:03,760
instead of a could rival it but but i mean this is transformative so you take patients who were on

1203
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:09,600
a certain path towards liver failure and death cure their viremia and what we what we actually

1204
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:15,920
anticipated would happen was that all the patients who already had cirrhosis would eventually go on

1205
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:21,120
to need transplant anyway but what we've seen is a precipitous drop in the number of patients needing

1206
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:27,440
transplant for hepatitis c because once they clear the virus their liver does you know

1207
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:32,240
re-compensate and repair somewhat and the patients that are not cirrhotic or with advanced

1208
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:40,720
fibrosis yet are never going to get there so it is it is truly a curative situation so that drop has

1209
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:47,360
happened precipitously over the last you know three to five years it has been replaced you know

1210
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:55,200
nearly completely by actually two diseases the the first and the one that has this kind of

1211
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:02,640
incredible broad public health impact is is the is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or the concept

1212
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:09,200
of fatty deposition in the liver that leads to chronic inflammation and kind of just like a

1213
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:16,640
chronic virus you know ongoing inflammation fibrosis eventually cirrhosis and with the

1214
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:25,760
obesity epidemic and other associated diseases the prediction is that by 2030 or so it will become

1215
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:33,760
the leading indication for liver transplantation and we've already seen that curve start to

1216
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:39,360
inflect up pretty highly the only thing that makes the story a little more interesting or

1217
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:45,200
frustrating is there's another curve that over the last several years has inflected even you know at

1218
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:53,600
a steeper slope and that is the the incidence of alcohol related liver disease which is has always

1219
02:13:53,600 --> 02:14:00,000
been you know a important cause of liver disease in the united states but unfortunately and you

1220
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:07,440
know whether you blame it on the economic downturn in the late 2000s or other factors you know really

1221
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:13,040
have seen an explosion of alcohol related liver disease made worse by the way by the pandemic

1222
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:19,920
and i think that has occurred at a time when transplant centers have adapted their approach

1223
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:27,280
to patients with alcohol related liver disease to make it a little less of kind of this

1224
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:33,520
terrible spanish inquisition kind of approach to you know you're either in or out you know if we

1225
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:42,000
think you're committed to sobriety to a system where we have developed resources mental health

1226
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:47,600
professionals counselors and such to support people in their sobriety to allow them to get

1227
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:55,600
transplanted successfully so you know i hope that that curve plateaus we unfortunately don't have

1228
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,960
an intervention for fatty liver disease that i see breaking that you know the slope of that curve

1229
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:08,880
quickly and you know it has changed our field because you know the the population of patients

1230
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:13,200
with fatty liver disease is much different than the patient the population with chronic liver

1231
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:17,600
disease of other causes whether it's alcohol hepatitis c you know most of those patients have

1232
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:23,840
liver disease and the consequences of liver disease but usually fortunately not much in

1233
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,480
the way of other morbidity whereas you take the fatty liver disease patient population

1234
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:35,360
they are first of all often obese which you know poses surgical risk and other challenges but on

1235
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:40,320
top of that they have all the other manifestations of their metabolic syndrome they have cardiovascular

1236
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:46,240
disease hypo-lipidemia etc which poses you know medical management challenges both for

1237
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:51,920
making sure we select patients that are likely to be successful with transplant but also with

1238
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:56,720
caring for them afterwards i mean the you'll hear the comments said that we're we've kind of

1239
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:02,000
converted our liver transplant population to look a lot more like our kidney transplant population

1240
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,400
because they're dealing with these cardiovascular comorbidities and other things that are just

1241
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:11,600
that are threatening their long-term survival as much as their liver disease and immunosuppression

1242
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:19,440
is you know i sort of think that the the the uptick in alcohol associated liver disease or

1243
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:27,440
affoldy say is kind of the parallel but gets less attention than what we're seeing with the

1244
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:35,600
opiate crisis so i think the the opiate crisis is i i think it's easy and understandable that you

1245
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:40,720
would throw the manufacturers under the bus and in truth they deserve to be thrown under the bus

1246
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:47,680
and you can throw the physicians under the bus who make who prescribe them to freely and that's

1247
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:54,800
fair as well but the elephant in the room is the why right like why is it that people are

1248
02:16:54,800 --> 02:17:03,200
self-medicating with opiates that are made too freely available etc and i think with opiates

1249
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:08,480
because the outcomes can be quite binary and stark in the nature of the overdose the nature

1250
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:15,600
of the death it becomes very easy to focus on that but acute alcohol toxicity is virtually unheard of

1251
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:21,280
very few people will drink themselves to death in a moment right much more common of course is

1252
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:28,560
the chronic toxicity of alcohol and i think that you know you're one of the few specialists within

1253
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:33,920
medicine as a transplant doc or a hepatologist who actually gets to see what that looks like

1254
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,560
but i think it doesn't really register for most people that they're basically two and two sides

1255
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:48,000
of the same coin yeah i totally agree with you and i think we unfortunately um it's it's that

1256
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,760
perception that they're different or the fact that we kind of both medically and society-wise treat

1257
02:17:53,760 --> 02:18:00,480
them differently has prevented us from addressing the problem with the appropriate attention it needs

1258
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:07,280
you know one of our hepatologists here at the university of michigan jessica melinger who's

1259
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:11,520
who's really dedicated her career to understanding alcohol related liver disease

1260
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:19,360
as she has refined kind of her approach to the evaluation and management of these diseases you

1261
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:26,400
know she really makes the sense that the the um emphasizes the point that this is a behavioral

1262
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:32,080
disease you know uh you could argue nash can be a behavioral disease in some cases as well

1263
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:36,320
but therefore the resources have to be put forth to address the behavioral disease

1264
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:45,200
um and i think you know we have kind of largely turned a blind eye at um the impact of alcohol

1265
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:50,800
related liver disease and alcohol use disorder in our society because of the just the factors you

1266
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:57,360
said it's a it's a freely available you know substance you know it's you don't have to go

1267
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:03,600
you know the the machinations and just kind of destruction that people have to go through their

1268
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:09,120
life to get opiates that's that's not the case for alcohol you can go to the 7-eleven and get you

1269
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:15,920
know that the the kind of equivalently damaging dose you know there and i think it's made the

1270
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:22,800
problem much harder to address and i i am glad to see the transplant community and the medical

1271
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:29,840
community kind of re pivoting in our focus towards trying to help people address the the the reasons

1272
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:34,560
you know why they're involved in this cycle because it is tragic and one of the things

1273
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:40,240
that's most notable about the alcohol related liver disease population now is they are ridiculously

1274
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:45,680
young you know so not only have they drank enough to destroy their liver but they've drank enough to

1275
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:52,640
destroy their liver in their 20s and 30s and you know which is a which is a little different than

1276
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:59,360
kind of the kind of classic you know 65 year old guy who's been drinking all his life and you know

1277
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:04,560
gets to the end of his life that's right most of us think of the mickey mantle story where

1278
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:11,600
you know it's it's exactly what you described but no i think i think it is the same disease

1279
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:21,200
and yet one uh one population numbs with an acute numbing agent opiates that have an acute toxicity

1280
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:27,840
and the other numbs with a chronic numbing agent that has a chronic toxicity and yeah to consider

1281
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:33,440
to somehow put those into different silos um yeah when i think the underlying conditions are

1282
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:42,720
similar is is probably slowing our progress yeah i totally agree i totally agree chris i think

1283
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:45,360
the last thing i want to talk about from a transplant perspective and there's so much

1284
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:48,640
i want to talk about but i want to be respectful of your time and i know you've got to head off to

1285
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:55,120
a meeting shortly um you talked about the team right one of the things about transplant that

1286
02:20:55,120 --> 02:21:01,920
attracted you to it was the team and i think it's probably not obvious to people how big that is

1287
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:07,760
it's obvious to me because i got to see it during residency but i don't think there's a field of

1288
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:13,200
medicine that has a bigger team when you encompass i mean the only one that i could maybe think of

1289
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:17,760
would be like that would rival it might be pediatric cardiac surgery where you just have

1290
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:23,120
such you know the the overlap is huge but but even that might not be as big as what we're

1291
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:28,320
talking about here in terms of the perfusionists and the surgeons and the anesthesiologists and

1292
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:34,800
the nursing and the icu and then the logistics associated with organ procurement it's an enormous

1293
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:44,720
team um and you lost a number of team members a while ago shortly shortly after you got to michigan

1294
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:52,560
um i think that story is obviously tragic but also highlights the incredible risk that goes into this

1295
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:58,320
do you mind telling that story a little bit yeah sure so what you're referring to was a

1296
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:10,640
in june of 2007 we had a team that had flown from michigan to wisconsin to retrieve lungs for one of

1297
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:18,720
our recipients they had actually procured the lungs they had just taken off from milwaukee and

1298
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:26,960
um you know had a tragic set of circumstances that happened to the plane and tried to

1299
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:30,560
turn it around and get back to milwaukee and essentially crashed into lake michigan

1300
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:42,480
that shortly thereafter and all six individuals on board died and it does

1301
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:49,200
um there's a there's a story in there about how important teamwork is in

1302
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:57,520
transplantation you know so six people lost their life as one small part of trying to get this

1303
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:03,280
uh set of lungs to a recipient there were two pilots on board who passed away

1304
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:13,200
um two of our perfusion staff so individuals who are responsible for the the coordination of kind

1305
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:19,280
of the procurement operation the handling of the organ its preservation transport back to the

1306
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:26,720
recipient team and then two surgeons there was a cardiac surgeon and actually a fellow um who died

1307
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:34,720
in that accident as well and i can tell you that um you know first and foremost it's it's hard to

1308
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:43,680
speak about it now without um getting emotional it was the uh you know most devastating event that

1309
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:50,800
i've ever witnessed professionally you know directly um you know there was a patient on the

1310
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:55,680
table chest open on the table as the lungs were flying back that operation had to be stopped

1311
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:03,520
uh you know one of our coordinators who was the person responsible for you know sorting all these

1312
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:07,840
logistics was the person who figured out that the plane had gone down and that had to tell our team

1313
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:16,160
you know what had occurred it was uh devastating you know to to to put it mildly not to mention

1314
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:26,240
most importantly the loss that those families sustained um you know i think um it it shook us

1315
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:31,760
all in a way that i think is still relevant we still celebrate the lives of those individuals

1316
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:39,840
here at michigan every june um it did uh you know if there is any good news about that event

1317
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:46,800
um it did two things one of one of which i think was um kind of more immediate and personal and

1318
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:52,800
that is it really made apparent to all of us here and i think in the broader transplant community

1319
02:24:53,360 --> 02:25:00,160
how precious you know the each member of our team is and how important their contributions are and

1320
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:05,840
how much they put at stake to make these incredible you know events of organ transplants happen

1321
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:13,520
the second thing is it made our field pause and figure out you know do we need to be doing things

1322
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:18,800
differently you know do we need to be shipping teams all over the country to procure organs

1323
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:24,080
when there are qualified surgeons you know right next to where that that organ may have come from

1324
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:31,520
do we need to reconsider how we travel you know in terms of the the um the expertise of the flight

1325
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:41,600
teams and such and the and the actual flight uh um the planes themselves um and it's and it has

1326
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:47,440
motivated differences for example in the liver community now we used to fly out every time there

1327
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:53,760
was an organ to dig it you know we would go to wherever that donor hospital is now more than 50

1328
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:58,400
percent of the time you know one of our colleagues at another center procures that organ for us and

1329
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:03,920
ships it to us which which is the way that it should be i mean i think if you were a lay person

1330
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:07,200
looking at the system you're like wait a minute why are you shipping teams all over the stuff when

1331
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:13,280
you have qualified people right there so it has motivated change in our community that that i think

1332
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:22,800
needs to continue to evolve but you're absolutely right that it it puts a it's a it was a terrible

1333
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:28,560
event to remind us of the kind of sanctity and importance of our teams for sure

1334
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:35,920
chris i want to thank you for for for sharing that story um it's hard to believe it was 13 and

1335
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:40,960
a half years ago i i mean i remember like it was yesterday so i can't imagine how approximate it

1336
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:47,600
feels to you as well um this has been wonderful to sit down with you and talk about this um i

1337
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:56,000
i always enjoy our times together and i have the fondest memories of sitting in that empty cafeteria

1338
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:01,200
two in the morning between traumas and again as long as i was sitting there with you it was always

1339
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:05,040
enjoyable it was never like i can't wait to get back to the call room and try to get 10 minutes

1340
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:10,480
of sleep it was like i'd rather be sitting here with chris absorbing his wisdom even if it means

1341
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:17,200
getting no sleep tonight so um that wisdom continues and i know that you're you're surrounded

1342
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:23,280
by patients that are i hope they realize how lucky they are to have you as their doc i'm sure they do

1343
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:31,360
