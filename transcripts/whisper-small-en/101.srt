00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,000
today's episode. Welcome back to another episode of The Drive. My guest this week is Ryan Holiday,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,760
a previous guest and a close friend. In addition to the conversation we released on Tuesday with

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,560
Sam Harris, I also wanted to bring back Ryan to talk about stoicism and how it can help us

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,400
during these current times. We talk in this episode in particular about some of the measures

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,200
of stoic philosophy and how moments like this are sort of tailor made for examining those principles

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,400
and more importantly, figuring out how to apply them to our lives. But worry not, this is not an

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,040
episode that gets deep or philosophical in any way, shape or form. It is mostly about us talking

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,200
about balancing the challenges, trying to think through other things that folks are experiencing

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,560
that perhaps Ryan and I are not experienced. For example, Ryan and I happen to live in largely

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,560
rural areas and therefore, at least we're not space constrained during this period of time,

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,000
but we're aware that many people are. And the question then is, okay, well, what would you do

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,800
if you're stuck on the 17th floor of a 600 square foot apartment in New York? How can you apply some

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,840
of these principles? We revisit some of my absolute favorite stories from some of his books, including

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,800
the one that I think about the most, which is that of Winston Churchill during the Second World War.

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,280
And basically we extract insights and lessons from a number of Ryan's book. Again, his most recent,

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Stillness is the Key, Obstacle is the Way, Ego is the Enemy, etc. Let's just get right to this one.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
It's about 90 minutes long and I think most of you will find at least something of value in here.

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,520
So without further delay, please enjoy my discussion today with Ryan Hawley.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:33,760
Ryan, thank you so much for making time on pretty short notice.

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,920
Yeah, of course. Anytime. How are you doing?

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm doing okay. Overall, I think I'm doing pretty well. I feel pretty fortunate to be with my family

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,320
during all of this. I think sort of reflected on it the other day and thought, man, this would be a

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,920
lot worse if all this were going on and I wasn't with my family. So despite the inconvenience of

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,680
this, which I think is, it's obviously inconvenient in different extent to different people. Yeah,

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,760
I don't know. I'm doing better than I was a week ago of seeing the potential upside of this.

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Now from the beginning, Ryan, I mean, I was in contact with you right away and you seem to

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,280
immediately find a way to be productive in this. And I think part of that is you're one of the

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,160
people that has the luxury of being able to work from home. But aside from that, does this also

37
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,880
pose for you a new laboratory in which you can examine your own reactions to this sort of thing

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,520
and then that of others? Yeah, I mean, to me, that's the only potential positive of any sort

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,480
of dramatic setback or adversity or obstacle or whatever it is, is that it is a chance to sort of

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,440
see things differently or look at things differently. Almost always this status quo is something we had

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,680
some sort of part in setting up. So we kind of like things the way that they are. So sort of given a

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,160
choice, I'd probably have left them exactly as they were. But then when you sort of experience

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,360
these sudden shocks, suddenly you're working from home or suddenly you're not doing this anymore,

44
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,480
in my case, like a whole bunch of stuff that I was planning to do later this month and then

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,840
in all of April was suddenly canceled. And so obviously the economic hit of that is very large

46
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,920
and very unpleasant. But at the same time, so I never would have canceled them sort of deliberately.

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,720
But then when you find yourself feeling relief that they got canceled, you're like, oh, maybe

48
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,920
my feelings on this were a little bit more mixed than I understood. I mean, for me, I am very

49
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,520
lucky. I work from home. Not only can I work from home, but I live on a fair amount of property

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,720
outside of a major city. So, and I had some mutual friends, you being one of them, that sort of gave

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,440
me some heads up on stuff that was happening. So I was able to prepare. So I wasn't sort of caught

52
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,280
off guard or as harmed by it as some people. So I have a little bit on the hierarchy of needs,

53
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,440
because I'm not that worried about food, let's say, or not that worried about where my parents are or

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,520
how my kids are doing or whatever. I do have some time to think about it, but I have been feeling

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:23,280
this weird feeling of, oh, maybe this pace and this setup is actually closer to what I want my

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,920
life to be than what the life I had that was supposedly disrupted was. Yeah, that's an

57
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,840
interesting thought, right? Because as you said, there are a lot of things that there's probably

58
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,000
nobody listening to this who hasn't had to make an enormous sacrifice in something with respect to

59
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,240
their professional life and their personal life. And for many of us, those changes, like the example

60
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,120
you gave, are not things we would have done on their own. If someone came to me in January and

61
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,080
said, from March 1st until, I don't know, I'll just make it up and say, July, you cannot get on a

62
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,760
plane. I would have said that's impossible. I'd just say, look, that's incompatible with my job.

63
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,080
That's incompatible with what's expected of me by the people I help. I could have come up with a

64
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,840
hundred reasons why that could never have been done. And yet, guess what? That turned out to be untrue.

65
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,080
Yes. A lot of the things we think are non-negotiable, we're just actually not willing to

66
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,080
negotiate, but of course, are non-negotiable. Weirdly, that is something that kids teach you

67
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,440
as well, I think, is suddenly all these things that you thought you couldn't do, that you thought had

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,840
to be a certain way get blown up, and then you're forced to question them. But yeah, I'm in the same

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,200
boat. Obviously, this is the way that it had to be. Obviously, this is the system. It only works this

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:52,560
way. But so much of that is just sort of a status quo bias that we have, or a sense of what's normal.

71
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,440
One of the really great things about being a writer, of course, although I think there's

72
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,560
probably a metaphor in it, I remember early on in my life, Robert Greene told me he was all material.

73
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,320
He's like, every shitty thing that happens to you is material. Everything you mess up is material.

74
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,920
Every person that breaks your heart, every dollar you lose, every sort of missed opportunity is

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,120
material. There's a Jorge Luis Borges quote, it's similar words, but you got to use it all,

76
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,440
basically. And so the one thing that I think in situations like this is like, how can I channel

77
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,560
what I think and feel about this into the output or the work that I actually do? And I think there's

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,600
probably an analogy there, if you're an investor, if you're a psychologist, whatever it is that you do,

79
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,640
and this is not at all a full redemption for the tragedy and the enormous losses that are going to

80
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,600
come from what we're experiencing. But it's almost sacrilegious, I think, to decide not to study this

81
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,800
and understand it and sort of realize a deeper understanding of humans, of yourself, of leadership,

82
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,000
of clients, whatever it is. I think deciding that you're going to experience this in a way that

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,800
you emerge from it, at least sort of wiser and better at what you do, to me, is sort of the way

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,880
to think about it. So you've been writing a lot of really great stuff, Ryan, in the past three weeks,

85
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,880
building on obviously the themes that you've written on in the past, namely around stoicism.

86
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,240
What are some of the most important things that stand out to you, specifically with respect to

87
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,560
this type of uncertainty around pandemic? And as you point out, it's really now sort of reared two

88
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,840
very ugly heads. The first is the head of the pandemic itself and the risk it poses physically

89
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,720
to people and all of the uncertainty around that. I mean, we still don't actually know how bad this

90
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
virus is, unfortunately, because we don't know the denominator of testing. We don't really know if

91
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,920
this virus kills 1% of the people it infects or 0.1% of the people it infects. So that's a

92
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,280
tenfold difference that makes all the difference. But if that weren't enough, as you alluded to,

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:18,240
there is now an undeniable economic tragedy that's being imposed on many people that itself and by

94
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,320
itself would be problematic, just as it was in 2008, 2009. So if you could bring Epictetus,

95
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,040
Marcus Aurelius, and Seneca back from the dead, bring them here today, walk me through what you

96
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,440
think they would say about this specific example and situation we're in. My instinct is typically

97
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,240
to do that, right? There's this quote from Churchill. He's talking as sort of World War II

98
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,760
is breaking over Europe. He's not quite been brought back into power. There's this letter

99
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
he writes to his friend and he says, the last couple of days he says, I've been trying to put

100
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,240
a thousand years between me and the 20th century. And he was just talking about reading and writing

101
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,520
about history. And so he was trying to sort of get perspective. And I think we can do that really

102
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,800
easily. And in a way, it's more informative than watching CNN. Like, obviously, you need to watch

103
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,600
CNN to know what the local authorities are telling you to do this day or that day. There is

104
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,960
value in the news in that sense, although the news is also sort of compounds hysteria and it

105
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,040
passes on propaganda and misinformation. But I think looking backwards gives us in some ways

106
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:37,360
more insight because as unprecedented and new as this is, it's also like one of the oldest things

107
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,080
ever. I mean, Marcus Aurelius, who I write, probably the main character in most of my books,

108
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,560
died of a pandemic in 180 AD. So it's not as if humans have not experienced pandemics and

109
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,160
plagues and sort of massively contagious viruses. And I think Marcus Aurelius is a particularly

110
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,200
interesting example. What they call the Antonine Plague hits Rome and it lasts for 15 years. So

111
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,000
you want to talk about sort of a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportions and then massive

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,600
economic and geopolitical ramifications. When Marcus Aurelius writes meditations, he is writing

113
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,720
in the exact scenario that a lot of us are in right now, trying to keep ourselves from being

114
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,160
exposed, but also trying to do our jobs at the same time. He was a leader in a time where they

115
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,360
had a lot less visibility into this thing that was horrifically deadly, very contagious, and

116
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,600
spreading fear almost as quickly as it was spreading disease. And what I found in Marcus'

117
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,960
example particularly was just sort of calmness, clearheadedness, sort of courage. My favorite

118
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,280
story for Marcus, which I've told in a lot of my different books, but like at one point, the

119
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,800
sort of treasury of Rome is starting to run dry. And Marcus walks through the Imperial Palace and

120
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,840
he starts selecting various treasures that belong to the emperor and their family, and he sells them

121
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,000
on the palace lawn to pay down Rome's debts. When I say that, it just makes me feel so sad at sort of

122
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,280
how far we've gotten from that, from a leadership perspective. But Marcus Aurelius talks about,

123
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,680
he's like, look, plagues are very bad. No one would say that they're not, but he's like, a plague can

124
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,800
only threaten your life. The real problem, the thing we actually have to be worried about is sort of

125
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,360
selfishness and greed and panic. These things sort of ruin your character as well as your life.

126
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,320
And I think what we're seeing now is people kind of struggling with that tension when

127
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,360
we're so sort of removed from mortality, from danger, from anything that makes us not do what

128
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
we want to do at the moment we want to do it, that people are really struggling with how to

129
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,440
sort of temper themselves and how to limit themselves and have self-discipline and put

130
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,040
other people's needs above their own. So I think from history, we can see that these are sort of

131
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,920
timeless struggles that we've always had. I read something a few weeks ago, I think it was a column

132
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,240
that David Brooks wrote in the New York Times. And the gist of it was that there are certain

133
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,680
externalities that are very difficult that can be uniting. And certainly Sebastian Younger has

134
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,960
written very eloquently about this in his book, Tribe. So in a post 9-11 New York, the suicide

135
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,800
rate went down. People were united in a common sense of urgency and a common sense of having

136
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,000
been wronged. And it also probably helped to diminish some of the sort of useless pettiness

137
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,360
that defines our existence and showed us what really mattered and what didn't. But the point

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
I think that Brooks made in this article was, hey, pandemics are different. It still has all of

139
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,880
those same things of telling you what matters, what doesn't, what's a threat, etc. But it comes

140
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,800
with this bit of isolation that actually tends to be quite negative. Now, I'm not sure I actually

141
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,480
agree with David in that setting, because I think that might be true historically. But I wonder if

142
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,600
connectivity today is making it a little less so. In other words, it'd be one thing if it's 1918,

143
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,400
Spanish flu is ripping through the world. And it's clear that you basically have to hunker down and

144
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,600
be fully isolated. But today, even if we had to resort to those levels, you and I have the ability

145
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,560
to speak right now. Look at each other on a computer screen. There's much more intimacy today

146
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,760
than there was then. So what is your take on the specific nature of a pandemic that causes

147
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,640
physical distance between people and how that factors into the sort of the challenges that we

148
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,840
face as humans being quite social creatures? Yeah, I read that piece too. And I think the

149
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,280
sort of the seed of the point is right. But there's some you could argue against it in a lot of ways.

150
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,880
I was in high school during 9-11, but I remember concerts got canceled and sporting events got

151
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,920
canceled and travel got canceled and people were scared and they stayed inside their house. So there

152
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,320
is an element of social isolation in those tragedies. It doesn't last as long. But I think

153
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,840
we forget very quickly how we were all hunkered down for a short period of time. What I think the

154
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,640
difference between I think it's actually less a nature of is a pandemic a particularly vicious

155
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,040
kind of tragedy or sort of crisis because you can't see it in a sense it almost pits people

156
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,600
against each other. It forces you inside. I mean, I think that that's an element of it. But in a way,

157
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,240
it also connects us in that it affects everyone all at the same time. Like the world wasn't

158
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,880
suffering from 9-11 at the same time, even World War II did not actually affect large swaths of

159
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,120
the planet. So it evens out. I think to me, the defining feature and when I sort of look at these

160
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,480
things historically, the defining feature between whether it sort of makes us better or makes us

161
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,360
worse or how it manifests itself culturally is what the leadership does. And to me, when I look

162
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,640
at this crisis, I think it's ahistorical in the sense that very rarely has there been such a

163
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,240
failure of leadership at essentially every level from the geopolitical level to the specific world

164
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,800
leaders to the governors to the government agencies. It's been sort of quite horrendous in

165
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,200
every sense. And I was just reading Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Leadership in Turbulent Times,

166
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,640
which is very good. And she had a story in there that I remember from Robert Caro's book on LBJ.

167
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,800
But he talks about when LBJ takes over for Kennedy, it's a crisis, at least on the US level,

168
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,400
that it's difficult to wrap your head around. I mean, like a beloved president is assassinated,

169
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,720
then the assassin is killed. And it was done on television and everyone saw it. And nobody knew

170
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,760
who was responsible. Nobody knew what would come next. We were just a few

171
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,240
months past the Cuban Missile Crisis. This was a traumatic event without precedent. And here you

172
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,280
have a vice president who's not particularly LBJ was everything Kennedy was not. He was a

173
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,360
smoke filled room guy. He was not photogenic. He did not have charisma. He was not a good speaker.

174
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,920
And most importantly, he was not elected. And LBJ tells this in his sort of folksy Texas way,

175
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,960
he says, like, look, when I was a kid, he was like, the cattle would get stuck in a crevasse or a

176
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:55,600
ravine or mud. And he was like, it's in these moments that the foreman has to charge in and

177
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,880
sort of lead the cattle out of the swamp with confidence and aggression and clearness and sort

178
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,160
of all the things that you associate with somebody coming in, taking charge morally, physically,

179
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,160
in all senses of the word. And I think what we're experiencing now is less to do with the pandemic.

180
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,440
And to me, more a result of what happens when something really scary and bad and alarming

181
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,640
happens. And you realize we've been operating, we've been in a rudderless ship and remain in a

182
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,600
rudderless ship. I think that's what everyone is experiencing right now. And I think you can say

183
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,400
that wherever you happen to sit politically. I don't think it's a political question. I think

184
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,520
it's a leadership question. What is a person to do? It's funny, you and I spoke in, God, we probably

185
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,160
sat down in late October, early November. That was released in January. I mean, basically at the time

186
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,520
that you and I spoke, we didn't actually know what this was. Nobody, there hadn't even been a single

187
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:07,280
case. And yet so many of the things that we talked about seem even more relevant than they did at the

188
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,960
time. We spoke about kind of consequences of having an overly secure life and how that gives you this

189
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,680
false misconception of unlimited time. Well, certainly we're realizing that's not true.

190
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,920
We spoke a lot about stillness and I want to come back to that because I tell you if there's one

191
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,360
character you've written about that I can't get my mind off as I struggle, it's Churchill, but I

192
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,520
want to come back to that. And then there's kind of this idea of dying well and how it helps you

193
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,480
live better. So let's just start with let's assume someone hasn't listened to us speaking before and

194
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,760
they don't know anything about stoicism. Let's go back and kind of encapsulate a little bit about

195
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,640
what this philosophy or as Tim, our mutual friend, likes to call it. I think he calls it an operating

196
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,320
system. How would you describe it in the context of that? Well, I think the sort of central precept

197
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,240
of stoicism is basically that we don't control what has happened or what is happening, but we

198
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,440
control how we respond to those things. And so in a way it's kind of this resignation or it's seeding

199
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,400
a lot of the things that we would like to be in control of in favor of focusing on the things like

200
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,320
that we actually immediately are in control of. So and you might think like, oh, you're talking

201
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,960
about the reactions. Does that mean be reactionary? No, it's just saying like, okay, what is in my

202
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,520
immediate purview? And I'm going to start on that. I'm going to make sure my family is okay. I'm going

203
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,400
to make sure financially that I'm making some good decisions here. I'm going to focus on, hey, even if

204
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,880
I did get caught off guard or I was naked when the tide went out, how am I prepared for this to get

205
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,920
worse? How am I prepared for what may happen after this? So it's this kind of focus on the immediacy,

206
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,960
but it's focusing on doing what you can, where you are with what you have. And so you can see like for

207
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,680
the stoics, yeah, they are dealing with pandemics like we're talking about. They're also dealing with

208
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:19,280
exile and war and mob rule and all sorts of plus just the normal stuff, whether it's a problem in

209
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,120
a marriage or a business partner that's a cheat, or it's that they fell and broke their leg and

210
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,560
now they're stuck in bed for six weeks. Life is capricious and random and Murphy's law is real.

211
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,840
What can go wrong does. And so obviously ideally you want to be prepared for those things the

212
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,160
stoics say, but it's more about what do you do when stuff goes wrong? How do you respond and how

213
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:52,160
do you focus not on who's to blame, how unfortunate it is or any of those things? How do you instead

214
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,720
focus on, okay, here's how I'm going to move the ball forward. I talk about that in the books and

215
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,840
I've read about that, but I'm also just a human being who's trying to figure that out day to day,

216
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,000
just like everyone else. What happens when 30% of your income disappears or what happens when

217
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,840
you've got to now pay for employees that can't work or what happens when you watch your years of

218
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,120
retirement gains disappear? What happens when you can't go visit your grandmother one more time?

219
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,920
Shit happens to people. Philosophy isn't supposed to be this kind of abstract theoretical thing

220
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,360
that you do in a college classroom. It's designed for this. It's designed for when you're hold up in

221
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,120
your house and you don't like how things are. Yeah, I think that last point, Ryan, is so essential.

222
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,080
People like me never found philosophy that interesting in college, probably because I

223
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,760
wasn't smart enough. And now my attraction to it is not academic. It's what can I extract

224
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,560
from this way of thinking that will help reduce my suffering? Yeah. So going back to the point I

225
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,600
brought about Churchill, I've read Stillness as the Key three or four times. I absolutely love it,

226
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,640
Ryan. It is actually of the 57 books you've written. It's my favorite. No, I'm just kidding.

227
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,240
It's only 12. How many books have you written, Ryan? I think it's 10. I think it's 10. Okay. Well,

228
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,640
I have probably gifted Stillness seven or eight times in the last three months. As I said,

229
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,760
I've read it three or four times. And this section on Churchill really speaks to me. And rather than

230
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,600
me try to explain for folks who haven't read it, the story of how Churchill went about creating

231
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:46,240
routine and ritual during what I can only imagine is the most stressful experience any one person

232
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,600
could have really contemplated for a sustained period of time in the last 100 years. I mean,

233
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,960
maybe that's not true, but boy, it would be tough to make a case that there was somebody that for

234
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,520
months and years on end felt the angst that Winston Churchill felt. So I find myself thinking,

235
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,480
and I want you to kind of explain what that was and how he managed it because I was floored by

236
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,480
sort of the ability that he had to maintain Stillness through that. And that's something

237
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,840
I've thought about, which is Peter, as upset as you are about this, as much as the uncertainty

238
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,880
torments someone like you who's a control freak and as much as you feel the obligation to your

239
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,960
patience and you want to make sure every one of them is okay and blah, blah, blah, blah. That's

240
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,600
a pittance compared to what Churchill experienced. And oh, by the way, Peter, you're like three weeks

241
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,200
into this. You better buck up and get ready for it. So tell people a little bit A, if they're not

242
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,680
familiar with exactly how the war unfolded and B, with Winston Churchill, the man prior to the war

243
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,280
and then during the war, give us a bit of a story because it's just such a beautiful story.

244
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,120
Yeah. I mean, Churchill's life obviously is incredibly privileged in some senses, but then

245
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,720
is an unending stream of adversity in pretty much every other sense. I mean, he's born early enough

246
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,840
in the 19th century that as a young war correspondent, he witnesses the last cavalry

247
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:19,120
charge of the British empire and he dies sort of well into the space age. You just see that the

248
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,480
scope of history that he experiences, I mean, Churchill's first talk in America, he was very

249
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,760
well received and it was highly anticipated. He's introduced on stage in New York City by Mark Twain.

250
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
And then basically after having sailed across the Atlantic.

251
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,560
Yeah. In a boat, right? And the last time he visits America, he flies in a like a 727 or

252
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,720
something like that. So you get this enormous scope and span of history that's punctuated with

253
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,880
he's not a bright kid. Nobody has high hopes for him. His mother is sort of promiscuous,

254
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,600
has terrible relationship with his father. His father dies. They think of syphilis when

255
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,360
Churchill's like 20, assuming that his son will never amount to anything. Churchill has taken a

256
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,960
prisoner of war at like 22 years old, nearly dies in Africa in this prison camp, escapes.

257
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,320
He writes a series of books. He stands for his first election and then sort of climbs his way

258
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,840
to the top of sort of British politics and ends up being sort of the fall guy for the Gallipoli

259
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,760
campaign in world war one has a nervous breakdown, thinks his career is over, sort of emerges a

260
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,240
little bit back and then ends up sort of destroying his political career by advocating

261
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,320
very strongly against the rearmament and the rise of Germany and spends what they call sort of 10

262
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,720
years in the political wilderness. He spends basically 10 years sort of run out of town.

263
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:58,320
He's radioactive. Everyone thinks he's an idiot. They think he's lost his mind. And he is 100%

264
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,200
right and no one listened to him. And Hitler rises to power. Germany rearms. World war two is

265
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,600
the inevitable result of this and it could have been prevented and nobody listened to Churchill.

266
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,160
And Churchill is only brought back in after he is ignored for 10 years. And then yeah,

267
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,720
he sees himself, he basically saves the free world, puts Western civilization on his back,

268
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,040
draws the United States into the war famously wins the war and then is rewarded for this

269
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,480
by promptly being thrown out of office days after the war comes to an end. And that's not even the

270
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,280
end of it, right? It goes on and on. It ends up dying as a very old man, having sort of another

271
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,000
series of triumphs and setbacks in that. And then I would say, if you just look at, so that's the span.

272
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,320
This guy wrote 10 million words in his lifetime, was one of the highest paid, most successful

273
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,400
writers in the world during his lifetime, holds office for 60 years, Nobel peace prize,

274
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,360
invents the tank. It's just an incredible life. Probably one of the most ambitious, busy people

275
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,680
of the age. I think proof of the great man of history theory, like the world we live in today

276
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:17,040
is a result of Churchill saying, fuck Hitler, I will give my absolute last breath, defying this

277
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,040
person. There's a famous story I love. His daughter-in-law says, as it looks like the Nazis

278
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,600
will certainly land and invade Britain, his daughter-in-law says, what could we possibly

279
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,600
do, Winston? How could we possibly, what do you expect us to do if this happens? And he looks her

280
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,240
in the eye and he sort of growls and he says, I expect you to go in the kitchen and get a butcher

281
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,280
knife and take one of them with you when they come in the front door. His point was like, we are going

282
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,840
to fight this thing down to the absolute last man. And that stand, which was partly a bluff,

283
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,040
but also sort of a hundred percent real courage and commitment turns the tide of history. And so,

284
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,520
I'm fascinated by Churchill because that is an epic life. I want to add one thing to that,

285
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,680
Ryan, before you get into the next part. So, I don't want to distract the thought, but

286
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,440
the other thing that is amazing to me is here's a guy who a decade out

287
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,520
calls Hitler. He basically says, this guy's a fascist and he's going to do really,

288
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,640
really bad things. And your point, he is completely exiled. And by the time Chamberlain

289
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:34,560
is finally forced to resign and they very reluctantly bring Winston Churchill back

290
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,880
as the prime minister, I mean, the Germans are basically knocking on their door.

291
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,480
And what I find, it's another subtlety of this, which I have to remind myself of.

292
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,680
I have a tendency in a situation like this to say, this was inevitable. How did we not see this

293
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,560
coming? How is it that we shut down the branches of government that should have and would have

294
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,480
had us prepared for this? How is it that we didn't put testing? I can rattle off all the things we

295
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:12,160
did wrong. And so when Churchill inherits a huge mess, it seems almost unfair. It's like,

296
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,200
well, now I have to be the one to fix the mess that I told you for the last eight years was going to

297
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,320
be the big mess. But again, the great ones don't seem to dwell on that because there really isn't

298
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,840
a lot of benefit that comes out of that backwards looking thing. So do you want to say any more on

299
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,480
that in addition to sort of everything you've already said? Yeah, Churchill had this sort of

300
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,400
code that he lived by, and I'm forgetting the exact phrasing of it, but it was basically,

301
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:44,080
it was like savage in fighting, magnanimous in victory, sort of gracious in defeat. And part of

302
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,960
that, what I think is not only did nobody listen to him, but they like viciously punished him. They

303
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,400
like destroyed his life basically, and then said, Hey, now that the battle is already lost, we're

304
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,880
willing to sort of put you in charge. What I find remarkable is was Churchill's sort of

305
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,080
empathy and compassion, even for those leaders, he kept some of them in his cabinet, he managed

306
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,120
to work with them. There was no recriminations, no punishments. He was Lincoln-esque in his ability

307
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,720
to sort of go, okay, this is just the hand I've been dealt. And there's a famous expression,

308
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,120
a famous statement he makes about the French general who surrendered to the Nazis.

309
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,280
Obviously, he's like, this guy's got to go. We're not collaborating with this guy. But he says

310
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,600
something like, let us be sympathetic that we never faced the predicament under which he broke.

311
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,960
And so there was this, for all of his combativeness and determination, there was also an

312
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,680
understanding, I think, in him having experienced along tumultuous life, shit happens, what matters

313
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,080
is, how are we going to solve this? And I think when you look at what he did was like he rolled

314
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,080
up his sleeves and got to work. And even those 10 years, it's not like he spent 10 years of idle

315
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,840
time. One of the reasons, ironically, that Churchill was so able to understand Hitler,

316
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,600
Churchill was like the only one of the leaders in Britain who like took the time to read Mein Kampf

317
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,920
and actually study it and look at it. And so Churchill had, in a way, that 10 years of exile

318
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:20,720
was the best thing that could have happened because it put him in a position to not be tainted

319
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,080
by the incompetence of the people that sort of brought everyone into this mess. It gave him a

320
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,800
much longer and larger perspective. And it put him in a position to sort of figure out what to do next.

321
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,720
And what I'm fascinated by, even if you sort of take out the war stuff, how was Churchill,

322
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,960
just to write 10 million words in your lifetime, just to do that in addition to a political career,

323
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,920
how does he pull this off? He was a sort of a creature of habit and routine. He had this sort

324
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,880
of ritual. He would write at the same time every day, he would nap at the same time every day,

325
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,640
he would eat and dress for dinner. He had this rule that I've been joking with my wife about.

326
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,160
He said spouses should not see each other before noon. That was the secret to a happy marriage.

327
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,720
He took long walks during the day. I was actually just in, this is maybe two months ago, I was in,

328
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
three months ago, I was in London. I had a talk in London. I was in London for maybe like 18 hours.

329
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,280
And I went, landed at Heathrow, took an Uber to Chartwell, which is Churchill's estate,

330
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:29,040
and then went back, gave my talk and flew home. But to experience, when you look at where Churchill

331
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,760
lived, it starts to make sense. He had his goldfish pond that he would visit every day. He had the

332
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,560
swans that he would feed. He had a little studio that he attached to his house that he did his

333
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,480
painting in every single day. He had even his estate or his house is surrounded by this brick wall.

334
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,280
He laid the bricks for the brick wall himself. He would write every day. He would paint every day.

335
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,120
He would lay bricks every day. And he would work every day. And this sort of rhythm or ritual,

336
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,880
I think was what allowed him to get into the head space, to get into the, tap into the

337
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,840
flow state required to do what he did. I find, and you wrote obviously about this in terms of

338
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,760
JFK during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but to me, it's something about the way Churchill handled

339
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,160
this because it was much longer. Maybe it's in terms of the normalized value of stress,

340
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:29,520
the Cuban Missile Crisis was greater, but it was over in 13 days. This was years. And I just find

341
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:36,720
that amazing the discipline in making time to be still and how that mattered. And obviously he

342
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,840
wasn't writing, he wasn't as prolific from a writing standpoint during those bombing campaigns

343
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,880
and such, but he took his bath every day, for example. And it's funny, I was sort of talking

344
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,920
to my daughter about this the other day, because we see like every kid around now, she's going

345
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,760
through, you sort of, she's homeschooling effectively, right? And she was lamenting

346
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,080
how much work she had to do. And I was like, I sort of introduced her to, I can never remember

347
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,280
if it's Parkinson's or Peter's law. I think it's Parkinson's law, which is work expands to fill

348
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,920
available time. And I kept trying to say like, you have to make room for moments of detachment

349
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,320
every day, regardless. I mean, it's just non-negotiable. Because otherwise you could spend

350
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,560
the whole day buried in your history lesson or whatever other thing you're doing. And

351
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,040
as important as that is, it would be very easy to say whatever it is I'm doing right now, whether

352
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,040
it's trying to stay in touch with my coworkers or trying to figure out a way that we're going to

353
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,000
pay that next bill. I mean, those things are vitally important, but it's not necessarily clear

354
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,440
to me that you're going to do a better job of those things if you neglect that sort of self-care

355
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,320
that comes from being in nature, being still detaching from it, right?

356
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,360
It's like a bipartisan complaint we have about presidents that they, it's like, why are they

357
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,520
playing so much golf? They're spending so much money playing golf. It's so much taxpayer money

358
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,760
playing golf. And I don't think it's a coincidence that presidents choose that game and that they

359
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,680
pretty much all universally play it. Going back at least to Eisenhower and before, it's because

360
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,960
what other excuse, and I think CEOs similarly gravitate towards golf. Because if basketball

361
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,520
is your game, you get maybe 30 minutes of basketball, right? Or if running was your

362
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,080
game, you get five or 10 miles, but golf is a game that takes three or four hours.

363
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,440
And it's three or four hours where you're not supposed to be on your phone, where you have to

364
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,440
sort of mentally focus. You have to be present. It forces you to control and master your mind in a

365
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,600
non-work context. And Churchill happened to be famously terrible at golf. So he painted instead,

366
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,280
but he said, actually, like the most important thing that powerful people can do is have one or

367
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,960
two hobbies. I would argue that's something that's a problem for Trump. If Trump had more interests,

368
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,840
whether it was reading or sports or even socializing, he'd be watching less cable news and be able to

369
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,720
see the bigger picture. As a nonpartisan example, I was the director of marketing at American Apparel

370
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,720
for a number of years. And that was a company that self-inflicted. And then also the financial

371
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:18,640
crisis was sort of in a perpetual state of crises and sort of chaos. And I remember talking to one of

372
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,960
the girlfriends of the CEO, his name was Dove, we're in his sort of huge mansion. It's like totally

373
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,880
empty of furniture. He's not married. He works 24 seven 365. He's sort of perpetually on the,

374
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,680
never taking a vacation. He's perpetually on the edge of sort of descending into insanity.

375
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,760
And I said something like, does he have any hobbies? And they were like, just sex. Like sex

376
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,960
was his only hobby. And I think that was directly correlated with a lot of the self-inflicted

377
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,520
unforced errors that he made as a leader because he was never stepping out. He was never

378
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,720
disconnecting. He had no structure. Everything was always urgent. Very minor example. There's

379
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,000
something I'm dealing with some supply chain issues with my company. And it was like someone

380
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,920
who works from me called me, they were asking me about it. I was sitting down for dinner with my

381
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,480
family to be able to go like, Hey, I'll call you back in an hour. I'm having dinner with my family

382
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,280
right now. Obviously that's what you should do from a family perspective. But that forced one hour

383
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,600
break made me handle that situation better. Cause if you'd forced me to deal with it at that moment,

384
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,320
or if I was a bachelor eating Chinese food in my house, when I got that call, I would have lost my

385
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,120
temper. I probably would have made a rash, emotional decision. I would not have forced

386
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,040
myself to take an hour to sort of let it sit. Right. And so one of these things, these hobbies do

387
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,640
and relationships do and a little bit of sort of order and structure in our lives do is they kind

388
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,600
of just protect us from just reacting and reacting and reacting all the time.

389
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,040
You've written both in your book and in your newsletters about a lifetime versus dead time.

390
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,320
And even though you didn't use those terms a moment ago, you basically gave a great example

391
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,800
with respect to my favorite Churchill, which is he's booted out. He's an exile. He's a political

392
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,720
pariah. He's the scum of the earth. And you'd think, I mean, he could have done the equivalent

393
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,600
of watching Netflix every day in the 1930s, but he didn't. What did he do? He's reading

394
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,920
everything that he can read about this crazy guy in Germany. He's writing, he's being as

395
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,400
prolific as anyone can be. And it prepared him for when the chance came that he was going to

396
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,680
come in and basically help save the world. And so what advice could we offer people,

397
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,160
myself included, by the way, I'm just going to be completely transparent about my own selfishness

398
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,080
and having this podcast with you, Ryan. It's mostly just a therapy session for me.

399
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:57,120
It's really tempting sometimes to just turn on YouTube and Netflix and take a break from the

400
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:03,200
news. The news is pretty upsetting, but is there any harm in just watching Breaking Bad for the

401
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,880
fourth time? How would you help us guard against the temptation to seek pure distraction? And how

402
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,920
would you counter that and why? What's interesting about Churchill is it's not like he was only

403
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,520
preparing. Churchill also, by nature of his writing and the speeches that he gives and the radio

404
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,240
broadcasts that he does, becomes almost more famous in America than he is in the UK. And I'm not sure

405
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,240
he would have been able, his credibility with Americans was so great, greater than it was with

406
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,640
his own people at that time, that when it comes time to sort of sell the transatlantic alliance,

407
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,200
that work that he did was sort of very paid enormous dividends. And this idea of a lifetime

408
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,960
dead time, it's like, look, you didn't control the fact that you're stuck in your house. You don't

409
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,680
control that. Most operations are set down. You don't control any of this, but you do decide what

410
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,240
you're going to use this time for. I guess the question is, when else are you going to get?

411
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,760
The good news is basically for a lot of people, very little is expected. I mean, some people,

412
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,920
nothing is expected because they are unfortunately not employed at the moment. But what's unique about

413
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,200
this period is we are being, I think, pretty understanding about the fact that things have

414
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,480
ground to a halt without anyone's consent. And so nothing is expected of you. So how are you going

415
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,080
to use, you've essentially been gifted time and how are you going to use that time? I think it's

416
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,400
absolutely appropriate to use some of that for self-care, for relaxation, for tuning out, because

417
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,160
that's not a terrible use of this time. Anyway, if Churchill had emerged from those 10 years in the

418
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,920
wilderness and the only advantage had been he was well rested, I think that would have been beneficial.

419
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,080
Right? Like how is he able to basically be active in politics up until his death, when I think most

420
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,520
people would have burned out, I think that 10 year period was not a vacation, but it was, what do

421
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,600
they call it in the NBA, load management. It forced him to recharge and rest and sort of figure out

422
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,760
what was important. So I think at the very least we can use this time for that. But now is also time

423
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,960
to really question a lot of things about our lives, about the decisions we make, about the

424
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,960
businesses that we have, about the goals that we've been striving towards. It's also a chance to

425
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,440
experiment with new things, to try new things. I mean, like as a very small level, right? I don't

426
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,680
know about you, but I've got like a million requests to be on like people's Instagram lives.

427
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,840
And I saw this meme where they were like, it took a global pandemic to get anyone to try Instagram

428
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,760
live. But that's sort of what I'm talking about. It's only in the sense, it's like, oh, because

429
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,400
people now have a minute, they are experimenting with and trying things that under ordinary

430
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,120
circumstances, they would have never allowed themselves to try. And so I think that's a good

431
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:05,280
use of this time for people. What I'm trying to do is focus on writing, on reading, and just sort of

432
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,480
spending time with my family. Those are sort of my big priorities. I'm also using it as practice to

433
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,960
like the financial blow has been so significant. It almost makes everything seem comical. And so

434
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,680
I'm almost using it as practice to like say no to stuff. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's like,

435
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,760
oh, if I can take this, I can do a lot less generally. Do you know what I mean?

436
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,880
Yes, it gets back to that point earlier, which is, if you had said to me in February, Peter,

437
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,040
you know, I think it would be a good idea if from late February until late June, you did not travel.

438
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,640
I would have said, Oh, that's a beautiful idea, Ryan, impossibility. Don't you know?

439
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,760
Fill in the blank, right? Don't you understand? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And of course,

440
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,960
then it's imposed on you and you realize, well, actually, these things are much more possible

441
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:03,280
than we believed. And therefore, we've kind of imposed our own barriers to sanity at times.

442
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,160
And that means, yeah, we could probably live with less and we can do less. So as awkward as this is,

443
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:18,160
this feeling, this helplessness, a, there's not a huge amount of value in just being upset about it.

444
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,600
I mean, it feels good in the moment, but it doesn't really produce much benefit in the long run.

445
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,200
Stoicism says so much about this. And one of the things that it talks about that we don't like to

446
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,280
think about is having a plan if things get worse. How do you think about that personally? And how

447
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,160
can others kind of apply that insight to themselves? Yeah, it's certainly not pleasant to think about

448
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,720
how it could get worse when it's already so bad. But again, we want to focus on moving forward

449
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,800
rather than sort of staying in the same place or looking backwards. I think what this is teaching

450
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,000
a lot of people, myself included, is that we thought about everything but this. There's a great

451
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,640
line, Seneca quotes Fabius, who's one of the great generals in Roman history. He defeated Hannibal.

452
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,240
And he says the only inexcusable thing from military commander to say is that I didn't

453
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,120
think it could happen. It's not that you can't lose, it's not that you can't mess up. But what

454
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:24,400
you can't do is confidently say, here's the realm of what's possible and what's not possible. And so

455
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,600
I think what this is reminding me of what we're sort of making plans at my house for is just like,

456
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,840
hey, look, don't be prepared for a rainy day where you're out of work for two months,

457
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,440
in a sense, that's almost something that you're more able to quickly adapt to and resolve. But

458
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,920
are you prepared for shit to really, really hit the fan? And I think that's where a lot of us were

459
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,160
more caught off guard. Actually, here's a great example of this. And I think we're going to have

460
00:45:52,160 --> 00:46:00,240
to figure this out as a country. The American system of being sort of 50 strong states backed

461
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,920
by a stronger central government. It was designed to be really adaptive and resilient because,

462
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,800
okay, a hurricane hits New Orleans. Now New Orleans can get the full benefit of the American

463
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,080
federal government. Florida gets hit by a hurricane. California gets hit by wildfires.

464
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Wall Street is struggling. Our system was designed for isolated but serious short term

465
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:35,360
black swans. What we are really clearly struggling with is massive interconnected problems that are

466
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,200
affecting everyone at the same time. And I think you could argue that on an individual level, hey,

467
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,720
I've got life insurance in case I die, or I've got some savings in the bank in case my wife loses her

468
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,600
job, or we have a babysitter on call in case there's an emergency. We have a couple things

469
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:02,160
here or there, but what we're much less prepared for is everything to go wrong at the same time.

470
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,480
And I think that's something we're going to have to adapt and figure out how to do,

471
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:14,560
especially because it's that same weakness that sets us up to be very poorly equipped to respond

472
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,280
to say climate change or an invasion from a foreign threat. We are just not in a position

473
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,320
to deal with serious catastrophe. It's like we're set up only for minor catastrophes.

474
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,080
Yeah, the difference between centralized and decentralized organization. Again,

475
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,800
I try not to spend much time thinking about all the reasons we're in this situation,

476
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,000
but I can't help but sometimes think, I hope we don't forget this. I hope we don't go back to

477
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,120
business as usual when this is over. I hope that a year from now, this lesson hasn't been forgotten.

478
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:00,320
Does stoicism tell us anything about the likelihood that we as a society will learn from this?

479
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,120
If you really look at history, the truth is like, yeah, we don't learn very much.

480
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,920
But I think stoicism is, there's a Hemingway quote I love, and it's in Farewell to Arms. He says,

481
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:19,600
the world breaks everyone. And afterwards, sometimes the broken people are stronger

482
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:27,520
in the broken places. But the people that don't break the world kills. And so that's something

483
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,560
I've been thinking about because the myth of stoicism is that it makes you unbreakable.

484
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:39,600
It's the David Goggins thing. You can't hurt me. It's the James Stockdale superhero, unbreakable,

485
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:47,760
sheer, almost inhuman strength and endurance under crisis. And in a way that's almost

486
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,920
too aspirational because it doesn't feel real. I don't think stoicism is about making you unbreakable.

487
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,680
I think it's about making you stronger. But I think the reality is really bad stuff happens,

488
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,600
and we have no choice but to sort of assent to it. No amount of defiance, as we are seeing from

489
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:14,160
a leadership standpoint right now, no amount of defiance and denial stops a pandemic. No amount of

490
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,240
invective stops a pandemic. You roll over and you take it to a certain degree. It's about sort of

491
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:26,880
damage mitigation more than anything. But where I think philosophy really comes in, what it's

492
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:37,920
actually about is emerging from that better and stronger. And so to me, the ultimate tragedy would

493
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,480
be for the people that are unfortunately going to pass from this. And that could be you or me or

494
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,560
people we both love, or just sort of countless faceless strangers we've never met. The worst

495
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,600
thing we could do to those people would be to emerge from this and essentially learn nothing,

496
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,680
to go back to business as usual. And I don't just mean that in, are we going to have better

497
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,840
preparation for disasters? The thing I keep coming back to the thing that makes me sadder and that

498
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:15,040
I'm sort of struggling with trying not to be resentful about and trying not to be angry about

499
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:23,520
is that we, I don't just mean in the United States, we put these leaders in charge, even though

500
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,240
their flaws were very well advertised, even though their lack of competence was almost something they

501
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,480
bragged about, even though the sort of obvious holes in their strategies and skill sets were there,

502
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:43,840
we put those people in charge because they agreed with certain policies we wanted because we thought

503
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,320
they would juice the stock market because we wanted to stick it to the other side. We made a

504
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:57,840
deal with the devil and I'm talking about a lot of different countries. We put woefully unqualified

505
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,040
leaders, but more importantly, even if they were qualified, because some of them were, we put leaders

506
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:11,360
with enormous character flaws, people of genuine bad character in charge. And we knew it and we knew

507
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,680
it and we said to ourselves, I would never want to be this person. I don't want my kids to be like

508
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,680
this person. I don't like what they say. I don't like what they do in their personal life. And we

509
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,400
said, I know that they don't actually believe in the things that I believe in, but they're paying

510
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,960
lip service to them. We said all of that is okay. It doesn't matter that they're a shitty human being.

511
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:42,800
What matters is they're going to get what I want accomplished or they are going to make me more

512
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:49,600
money or reduce my taxes. And as you're seeing now, because what leaders are actually supposed to do

513
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,320
is be there when shit hits the fan. We are seeing the ramifications of that. Look, it wiped out all

514
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,160
the gains of the market. And there's nowhere to go but down from here. And so I think that's really

515
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:08,320
what we have to learn. To me, I think it was a betrayal of my parents' generation to my

516
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,960
generation. But I also think I hold myself responsible too. I think we mortgaged our

517
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,280
children's future by not wanting to get involved, by not wanting to say anything. This doesn't just

518
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,040
affect us. It's going to have generational impact. And to me, that's what's got to change.

519
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,680
Bringing it back to right now, because at the time that we're recording this, which is very late in

520
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:41,120
March, my kids ask me every single day, how much longer, how much longer? And I think honestly for

521
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,000
them, it's mostly just they miss their routines and rituals. They miss going to school. It's not

522
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,040
like they're suffering. And I say, I don't know. I really don't know guys. It could be this long,

523
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,280
could be that long, but I really don't know. I'll have a better idea in two weeks, blah, blah, blah.

524
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,400
You're fortunate. You live on a farm and you live outside of a city. So you can always spend time

525
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,320
outdoors. And I know for you personally, even before this came along, that was the epicenter

526
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,360
of your grounding. You and I sort of have that in common, which is, I think we sort of like solitude

527
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:19,760
outdoors. What about the people who are listening to this, who don't have either of those options?

528
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,880
You are living in a small apartment in New York City or you're living in any city and you look out

529
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,240
your window and you can see people locked up in their house. I mean, from a medical standpoint,

530
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,520
my view is everybody should still be outside every day, regardless of where they live. And one just

531
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,920
has to take extreme care when those are areas that are high risk like New York and in which you have

532
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,640
to be careful what you touch and how close you get to people. But what other sort of practical

533
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,000
insights do you offer people that don't have the luxury of being on a farm and being able to work

534
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,280
from home? So we're back to the, you're thinking about applying for unemployment. I just read today

535
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,680
that over a million people in California have filed for unemployment. At least that's according

536
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,640
to a story that I read. Who knows at this point, half the things I read, I don't even know if they're

537
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,960
being taken out of context. But there's no doubt that there is a staggering number of people that

538
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,120
are in the process of filing for unemployment, managing a life at home with kids that are out

539
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:26,640
of a routine. That means you now have another job, which is trying to help educate your kids

540
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,920
and basically homeschooling them. And just none of this seems amenable to stillness, right? None of

541
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,080
this seems amenable to letting your mind get out of its own way. So how do we force it?

542
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:44,400
Yeah, my sister is in an apartment in Park Slope and I've been trying for a month now. It's

543
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,080
probably too late. I was trying to get her to leave. That's one of the interesting things to me,

544
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,040
I think a lesson that we have to learn. And again, putting this at it, sort of following the health

545
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:01,280
authorities, et cetera. But just the sort of amount of sort of passivity about it's like we saw the

546
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:09,760
train coming and we froze or we just went about our normal business as if we had no agency.

547
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,800
I would say one in 20 of the people I talked to had any sort of plan for how they were going to

548
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,800
weather what was so obviously coming, some form of quarantine, right? And if people had been a

549
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,000
little bit smarter about it, sure, there might have been some spreading of the virus, but maybe

550
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,560
New York wouldn't be so overloaded if the people who didn't have to be in New York right now were

551
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,120
not sort of going about their business, doing the de Blasio strategy of working out into the last

552
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:45,120
possible moment at the gym and then accepting the quarantine. Do you know what I mean? So I think a

553
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,000
lot of people are unfortunately stuck in less than ideal situations. What I'm trying to think about,

554
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,520
I'm trying to message friends of mine that I know, at least in Austin, it's like, look,

555
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,920
you can come to my house and walk around the farm or go in my pool. I will wave to you from

556
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,240
inside and then I'll wait for you to leave before I go back outside. I think that's something we're

557
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,400
going to have to figure out sort of culturally and relationship wise is like, how do people that have

558
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:17,200
resources or have sort of access to things, how can we get in a place where we share them sort of

559
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,600
effectively? So without endangering anyone, I've got a place in Florida that's sitting there empty

560
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:29,200
that would be better than a place in Park Slope, but that's sort of reality of the situation.

561
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,960
For me, a couple of things that one of the last purchases I bought on Amazon before,

562
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,360
as this was starting to sort of happen, is you're stocking up as up. I bought like an old school

563
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:45,840
alarm clock and I have young kids, so I always get up early, but for a long, I don't keep my phone in

564
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,840
my room because I try not to use my phone in the mornings. But so it would be like, okay, yeah,

565
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,280
if I have to get up by 5am to catch a flight, I would set the alarm in the other room or whatever.

566
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,920
But I was like, you know, as part of this part of sort of the routine, and I was like, I'm going

567
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,360
to set an alarm and I'm just going to wake up really early every morning intentionally. I don't

568
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,400
have to, I could just wake up and drag myself through the morning and just be kind of like

569
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,440
killing another day. But one of the things I wanted to do was just decide to be like,

570
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,560
just deliberate. It's like, I can't be deliberate about where I'm spending the time. Like I have

571
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:27,440
to spend the time here, but I want to be deliberate about the order that I have in that. I don't know

572
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,240
if you read anything about Hurricane Carter. He was this-

573
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,400
Yeah, Reuben Hurricane Carter. I know his story very well.

574
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,040
Yeah.

575
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,560
My brother actually met him.

576
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,000
Really? I think he's a fascinating person. He was sort of wrongfully accused, spends decades in

577
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,440
prison for this triple homicide that almost certainly did not commit. And one of the things

578
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,840
I remember reading about him doing just as a more extreme way of what we're talking about, he was

579
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,440
like, okay, I'm physically in prison. That's not my call. He's like, but I'm going to rebel in every

580
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,880
other way that I can. He's like, I'm going to be awake at night and sleep during the day. I'm going

581
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,280
to wear my uniform this way or that way. I'm not going to ask for this favor or that favor. He

582
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,200
decided that how he was going to wrap his head around the lack of control that he had was he was

583
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,640
going to assert control in other ways. And I think that's an interesting approach that might be worth

584
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,800
thinking about for people. So how can you find some ways to assert agency in the midst of all

585
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:28,320
of this powerlessness? And I think you'll find that that's really reassuring.

586
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,600
I like that idea a lot. I mean, those of us with kids, I think are naturally in a point where we're

587
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,960
still getting up at the same time and things, but when you wake up making your bed first thing in

588
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:45,280
the morning, these things sound stupid and trivial, but I agree with that. I think having a schedule

589
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:51,440
allows you to maintain some control over something. Exercise to me is also a really big one. I think

590
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,160
obviously for most people, it's harder to exercise now because for most of us, it's going to the gym

591
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,600
that is exercise, which has now been taken away. But there are tons of great apps out there that

592
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:09,040
are basically saying, look, here's how we're going to modify this and here's what you could do with

593
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,960
limited equipment or here's what you could do with simply only your body weight. And to simply take

594
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,080
20 minutes a day and do that no matter what and say, hey, like a 10 o'clock this morning, I am

595
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:26,080
absolutely doing my app based workout. Even if worst case scenario, that's a day that I just can't

596
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,640
get out there and take a walk for whatever reason. It's hard to imagine not being able to

597
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,840
make 20 minutes to do that and yet it's much easier to spend that extra 20 minutes tooling

598
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,120
around on Netflix or YouTube. And yet the dividends of that 20 minutes are huge, not just

599
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,480
sort of physiologically, but I think psychologically. And I think, I mean, I hate the word spiritual

600
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,600
because I'm not really, but I think you know what I mean when I say spiritually as well.

601
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,880
No, no, I think that's right. My wife likes future, which is like a sort of remote,

602
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,200
you have a personal trainer that gives you a workout every day, but you don't actually see

603
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,480
them and they design it based on what you have in your house. I hope it drives people towards

604
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,560
some of the, like the more sort of solo endurance sports too, because I think there's all sorts of

605
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,240
psychological and philosophical benefits to distance running or distance bike riding or

606
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,880
swimming. If there's some way that you could do it. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to do

607
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,560
swimming since this has all happened. There's no real like rivers or lakes that are available at

608
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:32,800
the moment or oceans. But I think realizing like, oh, just sort of practicing that muscle of like,

609
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,480
I'm going to tell my body what it's going to do, I think is probably as important or relevant as

610
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:45,200
ever in this moment. And I like, yeah, in New York, the one or two exceptions to the quarantine is like

611
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,480
going outside for your physical or mental health. You've got to take advantage of that.

612
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,480
And when we're talking about sort of a lifetime dead time, like what good can come out of this,

613
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,840
you were saying like a lot of people are sort of already on a schedule with kids.

614
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,600
We were always on a schedule with our kids, like they had to go to school at a certain time, but

615
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,640
we just sort of always had sleep training was really tough for us. We made a lot of allowances.

616
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,560
We sort of just leaned into the chaos of it a little bit. There wasn't a ton of structure.

617
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,080
What we use this for was a chance to really force that and practice it. And I would say like,

618
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:22,320
it's weird. We're just experiencing. So it's crazy and disrupted as our lives are in some

619
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,200
respects. In other respects, the machine is operating more smoothly than ever. We're doing

620
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:34,960
the same things every day, eating better, where bedtime is more on the dot. And so, again, no one

621
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:41,680
would say like, Hey, global pandemic is now a positive because I've got a better routine at home.

622
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:49,520
That's cold comfort, but you can find redeeming qualities inside of the shit sandwich, so to

623
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,840
speak. You can say, Hey, you write off the losses as a sunk cost, but where you're able to find some

624
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:01,200
good is that you made these marginal improvements across a bunch of aspects of your life that will

625
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,840
hopefully last longer than however long this goes on. Ryan, how has your journaling changed in the

626
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:13,600
past couple of weeks? You're a prolific journalist. Well, journaler, I don't know what the word is there.

627
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,880
Have you noticed anything in your journaling of late that maybe wasn't there prior?

628
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:29,200
Yeah, journaling is weird for me too, because my writing is also an outlet where I get to work at

629
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,720
a lot of thought. So I really have just felt on fire as a writer recently. I'm currently

630
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,600
researching some books, but I'm not writing for any book projects. So I found that the daily

631
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,920
stoic email that I do every day and daily dad, like I've just been like in the zone, more

632
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,840
productive than usual. It's better than usual. So I've really felt good about that. For journaling,

633
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:56,800
I felt I'm really trying to think about, I'm really trying to use it as a place to sort of

634
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:03,920
remind myself and reiterate to myself how I want to be inside this sort of reminders of, Hey,

635
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,720
you're worried about X, Y, and Z. One way not to think about that is to think about other people

636
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,440
instead. So I'm trying to, I'm trying to just sort of buck myself up a little bit in the morning,

637
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,440
kind of remind myself of what's important to me. I'm trying to use it. Again, I think journaling

638
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,960
is not this, just this stream of conscious sort of thing you're doing. It's not performing for

639
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,600
history. To me, it should be, it's like playing scales on the guitar or on the piano. You're

640
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:37,840
running yourself through it over and over again so that it gets more imputed into your memory and

641
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,440
into your being. Yeah, it sort of makes sense. Again, I think you get to write every day.

642
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,960
For those of us who don't, or when we're writing, like for me, I'm writing all the time, but it's

643
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:58,000
usually kind of technical stuff. This outlet has become something that I think is a, I don't know,

644
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,880
I'll tell you what brought it to my mind recently. So when maybe about three weeks ago, when

645
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,360
we sort of pulled our kids out of school and just decided we were going to do something that at the

646
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,960
time seemed outrageous, but basically play the lesser of two risks. My daughter was like,

647
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,040
this is crazy. There's no way I'm not going to be able to go out and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

648
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:24,400
And I was like, Olivia, what do you think about Anne Frank? And of course she didn't know who Anne

649
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,480
Frank was. So I was like, all right, well, I want you to tell me by the end of today who Anne Frank

650
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,400
is and let's talk about her. So of course she goes about read about her and stuff. But the

651
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,320
interesting thing is my daughter didn't know what an attic was. I said, Olivia, do you want to come

652
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:44,880
see our attic? She goes, we have one. I said, Oh yes, we do honey buns. So I got the ladder out,

653
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,840
took her in the closet, took her up to the attic. I mean, she just about had a cow. She couldn't

654
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:55,600
believe how small and miserable the attic was and that this girl spent years up in an attic

655
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:01,680
writing this journal. And of course, yeah, yeah. And like you read what she wrote in her journals

656
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:08,320
and it's unbelievable. You cannot believe a child could have written this. You can't believe how

657
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:13,680
she could turn to that journal and say, you are my best friend. You are the person to whom I can say

658
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,240
all these things. I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable. And again, it just, I don't say that to sort of

659
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:23,440
begrudge the way we've raised our daughter to not appreciate how good she has it relative to

660
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,120
a girl growing up in the second world war, but it is a little bit of a phase shift. And it just

661
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:35,040
brought back to my mind a few weeks ago, how powerful this tool can be. And it brought me back

662
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:40,880
to our first discussion actually about it. Yeah. It would be difficult to be a 13 year old girl at

663
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:46,960
any time. And then to be a 13 year old girl in an attic in a country you're not from, right? Because

664
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,320
she'd already fled Germany to the Netherlands. Then you're trapped in this attic with another

665
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:57,280
family. It would have been horrendous. And her journal is so good that it's actually something

666
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,480
like Holocaust deniers used. They're like, it's impossible that a 16 year old girl could have

667
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,000
written it, but she was just a precocious, brilliant girl. And what I think is interesting

668
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,720
is that she wrote that journal partly inspired. I think it was the queen of the Netherlands wrote,

669
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,800
put out a call over the BBC saying like, Hey, we're eventually going to get through this.

670
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:28,160
We want your help. Please keep a record of what you're experiencing and doing. And so that idea

671
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:34,320
of finding purpose in something that you're doing, even if she had no idea the impact that her journal

672
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,960
would actually ultimately have, she had no idea that it would be sort of final legacy, that it

673
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,240
would be the sole sort of creative work that she would be allowed to do, which is all tragic and

674
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,000
totally unfair. But I'm sure that because she not only wrote the journal, but then she would

675
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,800
go back and revisit the journal and she clearly edited it and she responded to parts and she

676
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:01,840
organized it. It was a project. And so I think that is something we're thinking about with our kids

677
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:10,640
is just what goals or things can we give them to throw themselves into that allows them to sort of

678
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,440
escape from this in a little bit. And I don't think that's terrible advice for adults either.

679
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,040
So what's a PR you're going to try to make in your deadlift? If you have weight rack at home,

680
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,840
are you and your wife going to try to lose five pounds? Are you going to try intermittent fasting?

681
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:32,480
Are you going to try to read the entire Harry Potter series as a family? You can create things

682
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:39,760
to throw yourself into that allow you to feel some momentum and accomplishment and purpose.

683
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,520
And if I knew how to do this, it'd be something I was doing. But like, you know, just the people

684
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:49,520
that are making masks right now. I mean, that's to me another great example of trying to find

685
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,760
where you can contribute and where good can be done rather than wallowing in your resentment

686
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:01,920
or anger or boredom. You're generally a pretty disciplined guy when it comes to social media.

687
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,800
Have you created any new rituals or routines around avoiding it or selectively utilizing it for

688
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,160
some benefit but not getting sucked into it? Yeah. So I don't check Twitter because I've

689
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:20,240
found that it sort of triggers me the most. And I don't have Instagram on my phone and I don't

690
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:25,840
check Facebook either. So I've been sort of very actively not using those platforms. At the same

691
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:31,600
time, I have been sort of stepping up what I put out on those platforms. So I've been,

692
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,120
I've been starting to do sort of lists of things or explaining stoic topics on the different media.

693
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:43,920
I've been enjoying the creative element of them, but trying to distance myself or protect myself

694
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:53,760
from the, let's call it the sort of manipulative and anxiety inducing sort of characteristics

695
01:08:53,760 --> 01:09:00,320
of social media. Yeah. What are you most optimistic about in the next couple of months? And what are

696
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:05,440
you most concerned about in the next couple of months? And that can be either about you personally

697
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:12,160
and your family or just broadly your fellow citizens. I mean, upside, I hope this redefines

698
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:17,920
the role of the president for a lot of people. Hopefully this redefines the importance of a lot

699
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,120
of the alliances and relationships internationally that we have with a lot of different countries.

700
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:30,000
And those things were people were, Trump was not wrong in sort of questioning some of them,

701
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,880
but also sensing that the public wasn't that possessive of them. Hopefully this redefines

702
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:42,240
internationally how we operate in just our understanding of China, our relationship to

703
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,840
other countries. I'll say like, I'm very glad that for daily stoic, all of our products we

704
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:54,960
manufacture in the United States, because it is dramatically protected our supply lines and allowed

705
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,880
us to have inventory on hand. It's allowed us to keep the lights on in the business. It's allowed

706
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,240
us to connect with and sort of work more collaboratively with the people we work with.

707
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,880
I wish that maybe some of the stuff was even closer to home. Like I wish I had even more

708
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,800
oversight or control. I think positively, I think this is a wake up call in a lot of ways.

709
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,320
I think it sort of knocked people out of the stupor or the slumber that we were in. I hope that's

710
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,680
a positive. Tyler Cowan wrote an article and I think he's crushing it, by the way, anyone who's

711
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:30,560
looking for smart stuff, I think Marginal Revolution and Tyler Cowan is putting out awesome

712
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:37,120
stuff as always. But he was saying he thinks the pandemic has killed the sort of progressive woke

713
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:43,680
left, that it sort of woke us up. Like, why are we arguing about transgender bathrooms and neglecting

714
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:49,680
this or that? Why are we fighting about cultural appropriation and not sort of coming together on

715
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,800
things that matter? Why are we talking about healthcare for illegal immigrants and not,

716
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,480
do we have enough ventilators in emergency rooms? At the same time, I think one worry would be

717
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:08,160
actually it doesn't kill the sort of revolutionary extremes on either end of the party, but they

718
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,840
seize upon the wreckage that emerges from this and are actually empowered. That's something I'm

719
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:20,240
worried about. And I think a little bit selfishly, but I also think it's going to have big ramifications.

720
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:27,040
I'm a millennial sort of smack in the middle of the millennial generation. My generation, 9-11,

721
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:34,560
catastrophic wars in the Middle East, which wasted trillions of dollars, the financial crisis,

722
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,960
and now whatever we're going to call this financial crisis. I mean, it is a betrayal of one

723
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,880
generation to the next generation that I'm not. We talk about the lost generation in the 1920s.

724
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:55,360
I mean, people I know were just getting their shit together. They just bought their first house

725
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,960
in already expensive markets. They just started putting money away for their retirement. They

726
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:10,160
were just recovering from the last time the world was melted down by irresponsible adults. And boom,

727
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:15,520
it just fucking happened again. I'm going to be okay, at least right now, but I'm certainly not

728
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,800
so okay that I'm not thinking about, yeah, what does it look like? What does it do to Medicare

729
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,840
and Medicaid and Social Security that even the people that survive this are going to have long

730
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,200
term health damages? What does it do that people who are about to retire just watched years of

731
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:35,840
their gains evaporating? If there's anything I'm worried about, it's actually more the economic

732
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,240
than the medical. Yeah, I don't disagree with that. What are you worried about? I think in the

733
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:50,720
short term, I'm certainly worried about a handful of geographies that I don't think under non-optimistic

734
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:59,440
scenarios will have this supply to meet the ICU demand. So I think New York is very likely going

735
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,600
to be overrun. And I think that that's obviously disconcerting because it puts doctors in a position

736
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,880
that I don't think anybody ever signed up for when they went to medical school, which is, and again,

737
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,720
it's something that's so foreign to us in the United States, but it's not foreign to doctors

738
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:19,680
outside of the United States, which is the truest form of triage. How do you look at two people that

739
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:25,920
if you had endless resources, you could probably save both, but in a situation where you don't have

740
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:31,280
endless resources, you have to prioritize one over the other. There's no, you didn't take a class in

741
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,840
that. And even if you did, it wouldn't have helped much. I'm just, I guess I'm glad I'll never have

742
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,240
to make that decision, I suppose. But a bunch of people might have to make those decisions. And

743
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:46,240
I find that very, I find that frustrating through the lens that we've discussed, which is

744
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,840
a little bit more preparation, not a lot, believe it or not, but a little bit more preparation could

745
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,320
have thwarted that. I think the economic consequences of this are, as you said, at least

746
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,600
as staggering, if not more staggering than what comes of it, though, again, it's still so

747
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:10,800
unclear what is coming of this. And unfortunately, you can make a model say anything. And that's a

748
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,120
little frustrating because there's models out, you can basically find a model that will say whatever

749
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,760
you want it to say. So that's not entirely helpful. But there are scenarios under which this thing is

750
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:28,320
a problem that could, on the one end, result in a million deaths in the United States, which would

751
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:34,320
be enormous, right? That would be a third of the total. That's like basically adding a third or 30%

752
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,800
more deaths to the all-cause mortality we experience. That's hard to fathom through this lens.

753
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,080
At the other end of the spectrum, this could end up being a small fraction of that. It could end

754
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:51,520
up being the same number of deaths that you would get from influenza. Again, I don't think either of

755
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,800
those extremes, by the way, are what's going to happen, but they could. And in the latter case,

756
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:04,560
it would be, boy, we paid an enormous economic price for that. You bring up an example of

757
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,520
comparing this to the 2008 recession. Well, it's going to look and feel a bit different.

758
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,960
And that scares me a little because I don't think we have a playbook for this one.

759
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,960
Maybe it's not as necessary. I mean, as of when we're recording this, the federal government has

760
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:28,320
announced basically a $6 trillion stimulus package of which $2 trillion is in hard assets and

761
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:34,400
$4 trillion of that probably less so. But that's so much money. And it gets to the point you raised

762
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:41,200
earlier, which is unless you can keep interest rates at zero, the debt service on debt we've

763
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:49,120
accumulated over the past 18 years is unbelievable. And I've asked people that I think are some of the

764
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,280
smartest people on earth when it comes to fiscal policy, I just asked them point blank,

765
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:00,880
tell me what we do when we can't pay our debt. Tell me what it means for the United States to

766
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,560
default on its debt. Those things are troubling. So all of that said, I still come back to something

767
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,200
which Sam Harris and I talked about a few days ago on the podcast, which was,

768
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,000
it's okay that those things are upsetting. And it's okay that I can worry about them a little bit.

769
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,560
I'm trying to check myself to make sure I'm not worrying about them at the point where it ceases

770
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,480
to be productive. Worry is only productive when it motivates me to do something. And at this point,

771
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:35,600
I'm pretty frickin motivated to do something. I'm doing everything I can with my little narrow band

772
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:42,560
of skill set to do everything I can. And therefore, I realized that there is little to be found in

773
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:48,320
worry. And so what I've been doing is making a point to spend time with my wife and kids every

774
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,400
day and reiterate to them how happy I am to be home with them. And in part, that's just telling

775
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:03,040
myself that as well. It's sort of trying to combat that anxiety that still slips into me, especially

776
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,720
when I'm sleeping, frankly, and my dreams are pretty distressing. But I'm just trying to basically

777
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:14,640
curb the worry and focus on what's here and what's here at the moment. And believe it or not,

778
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,040
I've actually had weird thoughts, which is when this thing's over and I have to get on a plane

779
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,320
and go back to New York, I don't think I'm going to look forward to it that much, not because of New

780
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,600
York, but because it's like, back to traveling again. Yeah, no, this could be a new normal that

781
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,040
we appreciate more. Maybe we all were flying more than we needed to be and working more than we

782
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:39,440
needed to be. And yeah, saying yes to things we didn't need to know about because we'd never sort

783
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:47,040
of been fully forced to appreciate what home and life was. And to me, yeah, that is a positive that

784
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:53,760
emerges from it. Again, not worth trading a million lives, but certainly a positive we can sort of

785
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:59,440
pull from the wreckage of this. Yeah. Well, Ryan, I made a plug for it in the past and I'm going to

786
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:08,880
do so again. If I was very bullish on people becoming daily subscribers to the Daily Stoic,

787
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,840
even more so today, what's the best way that people can sign up for that if they haven't done so?

788
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:19,600
Yeah, you can sign up at dailystoke.com or dailystoke.com slash email. And then the other one I

789
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,080
do every day that I've actually been liking just as much as DailyDad, which is dailydad.com.

790
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:32,320
And people can follow you how on Twitter? Yeah, I'm at Ryan Holiday and then also at Daily Stoic

791
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:39,920
if you want a piece of stoic wisdom every day as well. Okay. Any of your books at this moment,

792
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,600
you think people should go back and reread or read for the first time?

793
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,720
Yeah, I mean, I think obstacle is the way is probably particularly well suited if you're

794
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,560
especially if you've sort of been knocked on your ass here and you're trying to figure out

795
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,400
what next that's what that book is sort of designed to try to tackle. And then if you're

796
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,640
maybe more like you and I are and some of the things you and I were talking about are just the

797
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:09,200
stress and anxiety and worry and calming that kind of racing part of your mind stillness is the key

798
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:14,640
is the most recent book and that one sort of talks about a lot of things we were talking about today.

799
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:20,320
Well, Ryan, thank you for making time today to talk and thank you for sharing your insights. They

800
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,440
mean a lot to me personally, and I think they're going to mean a lot to folks listening.

801
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,280
Oh, I appreciate that. Now, this was fun. And again, by the way, this is a I don't know about

802
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,640
you, but I didn't think my mind was not racing. I wasn't distracted. I wasn't catastrophizing

803
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:38,160
because we spent an hour and a half actually engaged with each other. And I think not everyone

804
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:44,160
has a podcast, but one way to calm that racing mind is to go have a real long conversation with

805
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:49,760
a human being. And I think you'll be surprised at both what you find and then how much you get out

806
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:56,080
of that experience. Yeah, I think that's a great point. Connectivity matters. Yes. All right,

807
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:02,720
Ryan, best of luck rested today. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you for listening to this week's episode
