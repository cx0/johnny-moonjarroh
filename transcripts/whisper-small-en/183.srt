00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Hey James, thanks so much for making time to sit down today. It's been a while. I've

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,640
wanted to sit down and chat with you.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,560
Yeah, of course. Thank you so much for thinking of me. I'm excited to talk more.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,680
So I'm trying to think when I first read your book, because I read it twice, and like all

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:33,560
good books, you get more out of it I think the second time. In part because I think the deeper

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,400
you get down the rabbit hole of trying to create habits, whether it's in yourself or helping others

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,600
form habits, the more you realize how challenging it can be. But maybe for folks who haven't read

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,880
it, because I suspect there's going to be a bunch of people listening to this who have read it, and I

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,160
want to be able to go deeper for them, and then I think there's going to be some people who haven't

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,120
read it. Maybe give us a bit of the history as to why this even appealed to you.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,400
Yeah, well first thank you for saying that. I feel like that's the ultimate measure of whether

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,160
a book is good or not is it worth rereading. And that's a high bar. There are many books I've

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,560
reread, but yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time to do it twice.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,960
So what excited me about habits? I think there are a few things. The first is you're building

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,200
habits all the time, whether you're thinking about them or not. So you know, depending on

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,000
which study you look at somewhere between 40 and 50% of our behaviors seem to be automatic and

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,680
habitual. But most of the time, those studies are looking at things that are like, you know, more or

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,240
less automatic brushing your teeth, tying your shoes, unplugging the toaster after each use.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,480
But I think the true influence of your habits is even greater than that. Because a lot of the time,

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,840
the behaviors that you're taking are shaped or influenced by the habits that preceded them.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,680
So you can imagine standing in line at, you know, the grocery store or having three or four minutes

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,920
free in your kitchen, and you habitually pull your phone out of your pocket. Well, you know,

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,120
the next five or 10 minutes might be spent thinking carefully about what email you're responding to,

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,800
or the video game you're playing or scrolling social media. But that conscious, you know,

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,880
maybe non habitual behavior was shaped or set by the habit of pulling your phone out. So the the

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,440
reach of our habits is very wide, and it's influencing our behavior all the time. So that's

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,720
one reason why it's important. And I think that if you're going to be building habits anyway,

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,480
you might as well understand like, what they are and how they work and how to shape them.

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,760
So that you can be the architect of your habits and not the victim of them.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,680
A lot of people feel like their habits are happening to them, like they don't get a whole

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,680
lot of influence on it. And partially, I think it's just because you know, it's this process,

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,720
your brain is going through all the time, to try to automate and make behaviors more efficient.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,400
But if you don't really know what's happening, or where to adjust it, then it kind of feels like

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,600
it's happening to you rather than happening for you. And then I would say the second thing that

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,400
kind of really got me diving in deeper and thinking about it more carefully is just the

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,560
realization that most of us in life want some kind of results, you know, we want to get better

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,880
at a skill, or we want to lose weight, or to make more money or reduce stress and gain peace of mind.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,440
And whatever the results are that you're looking for, most of the time, your results are a lagging

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,280
measure of the habits that preceded them. So, you know, your bank account is a lagging measure of

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,960
your financial habits, your weight is a lagging measure of your nutrition and training habits,

42
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,200
your knowledge is a lagging measure of your reading and learning habits, even like the

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,240
clutter on your desk at work or in your garage is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. And so,

44
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,400
you know, habits are not the only thing that influence outcomes in life, you know, you have

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,760
luck and randomness, you've got misfortune, but by definition, randomness is not under your control.

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,840
And I think the only reasonable approach is to focus on what's in your control.

47
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:21,560
And over long time horizons, your results tend to bend in the direction of your habits. And so I

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,400
think, because your brain is building habits all the time anyway, and because your results are

49
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,720
heavily influenced by the habits that you repeat, those are two primary reasons that I feel like

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,520
got me interested in the topic, but also just good reasons for anybody to be fascinated with habits.

51
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm guessing there's a lot of sort of, well, probably evolutionary rationale for why we're

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,800
creatures of habits, right? I mean, I think the presumably the less energy we had to devote to

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,600
things that would help us survive and procreate the better. And obviously, that's why we have an

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,560
autonomic nervous system that allows us to function, you know, things like breathing and having your

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,920
heart go from, you know, beating fast or beating slow to be completely out of your voluntary

56
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:18,520
control. I'm curious as to whether or not we have a sense of, you know,

57
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,720
ancestrally, what types of habits were people ever trying to deliberately change?

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,560
Maybe it's not an answerable question. I don't know if you ever contemplated that. Like,

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:38,200
when did this idea of being proactive in either breaking a habit or creating a new habit? Do you

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,600
get the sense that that is a recent luxury of our species? Yeah, I kind of, so I don't know the

61
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,520
answer to the question, but I do have some thoughts on it. And I feel like it probably does skew

62
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,200
somewhat recent for one particular reason, which is, generally speaking, our ancestors lived in

63
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,920
what was primarily an immediate return environment. The majority of the decisions that you would make

64
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,600
that meaningfully impacted your survival were ones that were relatively immediate in nature. So

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,960
taking shelter from a storm or avoiding a lion on the savannah or foraging for the next meal in

66
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,520
a berry bush. These are things that like had a pretty quick payoff in your life. If you fast

67
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,840
forward to modern society, though, and we could define that however you want, but probably say the

68
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,480
last 500 years or something like that, certainly the last hundred years, modern society seems to

69
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,080
have created quite a few structures that favor not an immediate return environment, but a delayed

70
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,160
return environment. So you go to work today so that you can get a paycheck in two weeks,

71
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,320
or you study at school today so that you can graduate in four years, or you save for retirement

72
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,920
today so that you can, you know, not have to work a couple decades from now. And there are a lot of

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,200
structures that are like that in modern society that that tend to reward delayed gratification.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,400
And so I think in a sense, we're kind of walking through this modern society that rewards ourselves

75
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,720
for patients. And we still have this like paleolithic hardware, where we prioritize instant

76
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,560
gratification and immediate returns in a lot of ways in some kind of evolutionary sense.

77
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,560
And you can see how there's a little bit of a mismatch there. And I wonder if it's that

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:33,560
modern mismatch that has led to the desire to, to change our behavior, and to adjust habits,

79
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,320
and perhaps it wasn't something that we thought about as carefully or cared about as much

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,160
in, you know, 1000 years ago, or 5000 years ago, or longer.

81
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,560
It is interesting, though, to say that some aspects of modern society are mismatched with that,

82
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:57,800
with that ancestral wiring. But some of them are not like, why do we care about delaying

83
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,440
gratification to get a PhD or delaying gratification to save more money, primarily because it affords

84
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,840
some form of status, which is very hierarchical and very, we think, you know, evolutionarily wired

85
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,640
in. So there's, there's still connections there. It's just that not all of it is aligned.

86
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,960
Yeah, it seems that the the the vehicles that we would have used to attain status

87
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,960
earlier were much quote unquote simpler. And today, we're looking at other ways to do it.

88
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,160
You know, hearing you talk about habits that way makes me compare two activities I like very much.

89
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,000
And contrast the challenges of learning each of them. So one is riding a bike and the other is

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,800
learning to swim. So if you took a 20 year old who had never done both, and admittedly, it's easy

91
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,160
to find a 20 year old that's never swim, it's probably hard to find a 20 year old that's never

92
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,280
ridden a bike, but I would posit that it's really easy to teach a 20 year old to ride a bike,

93
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,840
if they haven't done it. And let's assume for a moment, this isn't someone who had never been

94
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,240
able to do it before. But some, you know, you sort of found somebody who'd never ridden a bike at 20.

95
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,560
And the reason I would argue that is in a bike, the the object is balanced, right? It's really

96
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,160
about balance. And you get your feedback immediately. So you know, the second you're out of

97
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,720
balance on a bike, because you're in the environment of the air, and the air has a density such that

98
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,120
it's not forgiving, you basically are out of balance, you're going to fall. Conversely, although

99
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,080
most people don't think of it this way, swimming is also about balance in the water. You're, you're

100
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,600
trying to balance yourself this way versus this way, most people would naturally sink feet first,

101
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,120
and you're trying to balance yourself this way so that you can breathe. And those things are not

102
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,320
easy to do, because the feedback loop is very long, and it's very hard to make the connection

103
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,720
that you're out of balance, it also doesn't hurt as much when you fail. So when you fall off your

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,880
bike, it's very uncomfortable. But when you're out of balance and swimming, you just have to work

105
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,440
harder, but you don't realize why you're working harder. Anyway, that's why I think it's very hard

106
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,680
to learn how to swim, and it's not very hard to learn how to ride a bike. And therefore, it

107
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,600
requires much more deliberate practice to learn to swim than it does to ride a bike, at least at

108
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,040
some basic level. As a fascinating question, it's really good raises a lot of interesting details

109
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,920
about why we form habits and how they form. So first, I'll kind of give a roundabout answer here,

110
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,240
but I'll come back to your question. So what is it that determines whether a habit is good or bad?

111
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,480
You know, we use these phrases a lot of the time in conversation, we say, Oh, it's a bad habit,

112
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,640
it's a good habit. And sometimes people will ask me like, well, why do I repeat this habit? If it's

113
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,800
bad for me, you know, if it's so terrible, then how can I keep coming back to it? And I think we can

114
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,360
divide, you know, in a sense, some, you know, if you want to get really pedantic about or really

115
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,800
academic about it, some researchers don't even like to use the word good or bad, because they're

116
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,280
their habits, and they all serve you in some way. So we could just say basically adaptive or

117
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,800
maladaptive. Right? Yeah. And I think we could make a meaningful division, in the sense of how

118
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,440
we use it in most conversation and say that pretty much all behaviors produce multiple outcomes

119
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,520
across time. And broadly speaking, we could lump it into an immediate bucket, an immediate outcome

120
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:28,040
and an ultimate outcome. And what you find is that for most bad habits, the immediate outcome is

121
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,960
actually pretty favorable. Like, you know, the classic example, smoking a cigarette, but if you

122
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,440
smoke a cigarette outside the office at 10am with a friend, well, then immediately you get some

123
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,560
socialization. Maybe it curbs your nicotine craving, or just lets you like de stress for a couple

124
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,720
minutes or get a break from work. There are all kinds of things that you might be benefiting from.

125
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,560
It's only two or five or 10 years later, that the ultimate outcome is negative. With the good habits,

126
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,160
especially the first time you perform them, it's often the reverse, like the first week of training

127
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,520
in the gym, your body looks the same in the mirror, you're sore, you don't really have much to show for

128
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,840
the effort that you're putting in. You feel kind of stupid in there, you're wondering if people judge

129
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,280
you, or if you're doing it the wrong way. There are a lot of upfront costs. And it's only two or

130
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,040
five or 10 years later that you get the outcome that you're looking for. And so in a sense, the

131
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,960
cost of your good habits is in the present. The cost of your bad habits is in the future. And that

132
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,560
misalignment between when you feel rewarded and when you feel punished, helps to explain why we

133
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,600
tend to fall pretty easily into a lot of things that we would categorize as bad like eating donuts

134
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,000
or smoking a cigarette or whatever, and fall less easily into things that we categorize as good or

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,360
you know, it feels like I have to force myself to write or whatever. Now, that's very similar to

136
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,000
what you just mentioned about this, like the immediacy of the feedback. You know, bad habits

137
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,760
are giving you pretty immediate feedback, kind of like riding a bike, good habits are giving you

138
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,880
pretty delayed feedback, maybe, you know, a little bit analogous to swimming. I think that example of

139
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,840
the medium that you're in air versus water is fascinating to think about water as being like a

140
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:15,480
feedback dampener. But there is another element to it, which you also mentioned, which is the

141
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,720
strength of the feedback. So you know, falling on the ground off a bike and skinning your knees,

142
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,840
like pretty painful, you learn quite quickly. Technically, making a bad stroke in the water,

143
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,920
you don't really pay too much of a cost if you're being sloppy with your form. And so it's unlikely

144
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,240
that you rectify that quickly. And this is a phenomenon that I think is so critical or so

145
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,480
important to behavior change, I call it the cardinal rule of behavior change in atomic habits,

146
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,400
which is behaviors that get immediately rewarded, get repeated behaviors that get immediately

147
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,440
punished, get avoided. And it's really about the speed and the intensity of that feedback. And

148
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,200
generally speaking, the quicker you can get feedback, and the more too intense is maybe a

149
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,360
bit much. But you know, at some point you need it needs to be high enough to move the needle can't

150
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,960
be so low that, you know, it doesn't register. So you need both meaningful feedback and quick

151
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,400
feedback if you want behavior to change. Yeah. And well, actually, I want to come back to that

152
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,120
topic because I think therein lies one of the themes of your book, right? Which is that

153
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,400
willpower is not a great long term strategy. But before I get to that, I want to kind of talk a

154
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,120
little bit about you personally, at least before you came to these realizations.

155
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,160
Are you someone I didn't mean, I know you're an athlete in your book, you write about

156
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,040
this horrible accident you had when you were playing baseball. I believe that was high school

157
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,080
or was it in college? Yep, sophomore year of high school. During that period of your life,

158
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,720
were you someone that others and your peers would have looked at you and said, Oh God, that James,

159
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,280
that guy is so disciplined. I mean, he just has what it takes to always get the job done. And he,

160
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,080
you know, never sort of indulges in the wrong things and always does the right things. Like,

161
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,920
were you were you one of those guys that was just a beacon of a quote unquote discipline or were

162
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,360
you a normal guy or were you someone who had a hard time doing what was right?

163
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,560
Well, I wasn't someone who had a hard time, but I do think it depends on the context. So,

164
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,280
you know, I let's keep it simple, like homework, sports, kind of those things.

165
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:30,360
So with school, definitely. I always liked school. I was like the nerdy kid on the sports teams I

166
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,520
was on. But, you know, in the science lab or something, I was like the jock, which is kind

167
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,320
of funny how you change based on the room that you're in. And so I always felt like I kind of

168
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,480
played that middle ground between those two. I think it helped me learn how to get along with

169
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,480
both groups and, you know, it was helpful socially and all that. But earlier in my life, I think I

170
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,920
thrived more in school than I did in sports. I was never, you know, like I barely got to play in

171
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,800
high school. You know, that's one of the punchlines of that early story in the book is I've ended up

172
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,160
playing a total of 11 innings in high school. Now, I kind of blossomed once I got to college and

173
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,240
ended up being an academic All-American by the time I graduated. But that came much later. So

174
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,480
it really sort of depended on the context. But generally speaking, I would say, yeah,

175
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,720
people probably thought that I was disciplined, but I do think it depended on where we were.

176
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,680
If it was just looking at school, then I think people would say that if you're looking somewhere

177
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,640
else, then maybe not. Was there an area that you struggled with, from a behavior standpoint?

178
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,640
To be honest, there were areas that I avoided because I thought I would struggle. So I think

179
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,040
it was I think it was more about me being fearful and avoiding anything I thought I would be bad at

180
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,840
than it was about watching him and being like, oh, look at him floundering around.

181
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,640
And I think I had to kind of overcome that wiring over the course of a decade or two. It took me a

182
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,680
long time to start to take more risks and take on things that I didn't think I would be good at,

183
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,640
rather than just trying to like stack the deck and just do what I thought I would do well.

184
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,240
I don't know how much you've paid attention to the sort of discussion debate around free will.

185
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,920
I have always sort of assumed we have free will. This is one of those things that

186
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,360
is kind of anathema to me to imagine a world under which I'm not completely

187
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,480
under control of my own will and my behavior. But my good friend, Sam Harris, who I don't know if

188
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,960
you were familiar with Sam's work, but he's written and spoken.

189
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,720
Yeah, I did an episode on his podcast as well.

190
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,040
Okay. So you're familiar with the fact that he's written extensively and spoken extensively about

191
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,160
the idea that we actually don't have free will, that this is an illusion. There are examples that

192
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,440
I can conjure up to make that case. For example, he uses a very clever thought experiment, which is,

193
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,160
if I tell you to think of a movie, the first movie that pops into your head,

194
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:04,760
you have no control over what that's going to be. Conversely, there's a part of me that thinks,

195
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:12,680
okay, but there were lots of things I have free will over. My desire to, or my ability to go and

196
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,440
do something, whether it be take an action, go and exercise or something like that. But the deeper I

197
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,360
get into this thinking, the more I start to realize, well, wait a minute, that may still be innate.

198
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,040
This ability that I have, using myself as an example, to really have an easy time exercising,

199
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,440
it requires virtually no effort to exercise. In fact, it usually requires a lot of effort to

200
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:46,360
sometimes not exercise, but requiring a lot of effort to mind what I eat. And I know people for

201
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,280
whom that's not the case, right? I know people for whom they just have an easy time eating what's

202
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:57,160
healthy, but maybe they don't like to exercise that much. So when you, I guess, before I go any

203
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,440
deeper than my question, let me just pause and ask you for your reaction to that overall line of

204
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,480
inquiry and how do you think about free will as it pertains to what we're going to talk about today?

205
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,360
Yeah. Well, first, I think I'm probably similar to you in the sense like exercise has always been

206
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,640
on the easier side for me. Nutrition has always been on the harder side, which is kind of

207
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,480
interesting there. I don't know exactly what that reveals, but just interesting to think about where

208
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,520
you have certain inclinations and maybe not others. With respect to free will, I understand

209
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,120
the argument like in once you start to walk through, it's like, okay, yeah, there's this

210
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,760
very long chain of atoms that are essentially colliding and leading us inevitably to, you know,

211
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,440
the next action or the next thought or whatever. And if we could map them all out, then perhaps

212
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,240
we could just predict everything that's about to happen. So I get that as a thought experiment.

213
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,880
I tend to, when I'm living my daily life, fall in the same space that sounds like you fall in,

214
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,280
which is, well, I'm going to continue to act as if I have free will. And ultimately, the more that

215
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,760
I think about it, I usually come down on that side where it's like, listen, the truth is nobody knows

216
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,760
the answer one way or another. We have we have good arguments, perhaps for each, but nobody knows

217
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,760
for sure. If it is all predetermined, then it kind of doesn't really matter. I'm going to do this

218
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,160
anyway. And if it isn't predetermined, I might as well choose the thing that, you know, I think

219
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,400
best serves me. So whether I'm making that actually getting to make that choice that best serves me,

220
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,800
or whether it was predetermined that I'm going to make the good choice, it kind of doesn't really

221
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,560
matter to me like I might as well choose to act that way. So I don't know, I would be very curious

222
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:46,120
to hear what Sam's thought on that is, but I don't from a practical standpoint, I don't see a reason

223
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,200
to not choose the best option that you can. In the event that you do have free will, you'll be

224
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,440
glad that you chose it. In the event that you don't have free will, you didn't get a say anyway.

225
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,440
So who cares? Yeah. And the other the other thing I add, I guess what I did that is

226
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,080
it might be that free will or the absence of free will is what determines a person's

227
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,200
maybe call it genetic propensity to change habits or form habits. There may be some people for whom

228
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,520
that is easier than others, but that's probably a spectrum. And it doesn't imply that a person

229
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:27,960
who struggles with a given behavior can't learn to master it just as a, you know, so again, using

230
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:35,800
an example, I'll never be a Michael Phelps, like ever, right? There is no there is no scenario under

231
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,680
which I was going to be as good a swimmer as Michael Phelps. So even if he hadn't started swimming

232
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,720
till he was 15 and my parents threw me in the water at two, I was never going to be that good.

233
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,040
But it doesn't mean I couldn't learn to swim. And similarly, had he never been thrown in the pool,

234
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,520
we would never have heard his name. So I guess that's how I kind of rationalize it, which is

235
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,880
there are going to be people for whom it is easier to go through the exercises that we're going to

236
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,160
talk about. And there are people for whom that's just going to be more difficult. And in the end,

237
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,720
you're sort of you can't change that part of it. That's the part, I guess, that is sort of set.

238
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,880
Yeah. And I a couple thoughts to add on to that. So I thought of this when you first brought this

239
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,400
up a few minutes ago. I don't know if you're familiar with David Epstein, his very much sports

240
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,400
team and range and so on. So David's great and a good friend of mine, a really nice guy and just

241
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,240
very thoughtful with the way he puts arguments together, which I always appreciate.

242
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,640
And I was having a conversation with him about some of this stuff. And he said one of the things

243
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,240
that surprised him when he was researching the sports gene is that characteristics that he

244
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,280
thought would be mostly genetic, like, you know, strength and speed and things like that,

245
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,360
turned out to be heavily influenced by training and choice and a lot of other stuff.

246
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:06,680
And qualities that he thought would be a choice like grit and perseverance and desire to train

247
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,600
turned out to have a much higher genetic component than he realized. I always love the example.

248
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,080
I think this is in sports gene who talks about Steffi Graff just happened to be in a tennis

249
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,240
study when she was young. She was like 14 or something. And she was part of this cohort of

250
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,400
young Germans that were being studied. And she not only tested the highest for physical abilities,

251
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,600
like strength and speed and quickness and so on, but also tested the highest for competitiveness

252
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,160
and desire to train and all these other things. And you just I just love when combinations like

253
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,240
that come together, like think about how pointless this is to compete against her. Not only is she

254
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,840
better than you, she also wants it more. And so I do think that there's a heavy genetic component

255
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:55,320
to some of the mental characteristics that would make you more likely to train some of these aspects

256
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,160
or more interested in some things than others. To your point about Phelps and you know, whether

257
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:10,040
he had ever been dropped in the pool or not, that I think is a on the surface, it seems like something

258
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,280
that would make you less motivated. It would you would say, Oh, well, why even try? I'm never going

259
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,480
to be Michael Phelps. Or if genes play such a large role, what's the point? But I actually think

260
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,720
that's the wrong lesson to take away. The primary lesson I think is that genes don't,

261
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,320
they don't tell you not to work hard, they tell you where to work hard, or they don't tell you

262
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,200
not to have a strategy, they just inform your strategy. This is another line that David told

263
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,840
me in a conversation once we said, I was saying, you know, a lot of people talk about grit and

264
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,400
perseverance and discipline. But what if that is just your natural propensity based on the thing

265
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,920
that you're working on? Like what you know, what if I just happened to look kind of gritty,

266
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,000
in my terms of, you know, weight training, or working at writing a book compared to the

267
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,640
average person, but I just look that way, because I happen to like those things. And he said, Yeah,

268
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,080
there's this whole line of thinking that like grit is fit. And so actually, the way to increase your

269
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,760
perseverance and discipline is to find areas or categories or skills where you're highly

270
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,000
interested in them, you know, it's very hard to beat the person who's having fun, because they're

271
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,680
going to want to keep working longer than the person who's suffering. So grit is fit, I think

272
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,720
is one way in which you can maybe try to stack the deck or stack the odds in your favor and get your

273
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,920
genes aligned with the things that you're working on. And then, you know, there are going to be

274
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,480
things like, you know, Michael Phelps in a pool, where you're like, Listen, this body was just

275
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,000
designed to do this thing, you know, it's very hard to find somebody who's more optimally designed

276
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,680
to move through the water than him. And not all of us are going to have the good fortune of

277
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,960
discovering whatever that thing is for us in our lives at age four or six or whatever. But I don't

278
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,360
think that that means you should stop searching. This is one of the benefits of trial and error,

279
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,480
you know, the person who is curious and willing to explore a lot of things is more likely to come

280
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,760
across an area where they are fascinated or they are interested. And it also is a really good fit

281
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:22,040
for their natural abilities or propensities or whatever. And that's kind of the primary lesson

282
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,280
that I take away from the genetic side of things is, you know, similar to what you said, anybody

283
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,120
can improve doesn't mean anybody can be Michael Phelps, but you can always improve your ability.

284
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,000
And let's try to find that thing that I'm fascinated with, that I'm interested in,

285
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,560
so where it doesn't feel like I'm suffering in the same way that other people are when they're

286
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,720
trying this thing. And you often be surprised how far you can go and how willing you are to build

287
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,480
habits and improve skills if you find some of those things that you're truly fascinated by.

288
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,200
Yeah, two comments that add to that one completely trite, but amusing, which is,

289
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,080
you know, not only does Phelps have the perfect chassis and engine for what he does, but

290
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,760
just as you described, Steffi Graf, I've seen Phelps race at meets that meant nothing, right? So,

291
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,960
you know, like total throwaway meets, he's not shaved, he's not tapered, he couldn't care less

292
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,840
to be there. And, you know, he's swimming like a 200 IM and he is, it doesn't look like he's going

293
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,880
to win at all. And yet somehow in the last 15 meters, he out touches everybody. And I've seen

294
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,360
this on enough occasions that I just think like this is a guy who hates losing. So even though

295
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,600
he's not necessarily in shape at this moment, even though this meet means nothing for him,

296
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,400
he's training through it and half the people he's competing against, this is their pinnacle.

297
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,960
He hates losing so much. So it is, I have the same take on watching the last dance when, you know,

298
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,440
it's like you see these clips of Michael Jordan, they had that there was that one summer where he

299
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,400
was recording Space Jam and they set up like a tent for him outside the movie studio and all the

300
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,960
NBA players came in like each night to play pickup games. And it was basically just like, you know,

301
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,280
he just got done filming like 12 hours a day, but he just could not handle losing a pickup game. It

302
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:15,000
would just bother him so much to not get it right to not win. And yeah, I got to think that that is

303
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,240
maybe not exclusively, but at least largely just he can't turn it off. He doesn't know any other

304
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,040
way to be, you know, that's personality or genes or whatever you want to call it. It's just that's

305
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,800
just how he's wired. And I actually love it when I see that that characteristic in any domain.

306
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:37,320
Maggie Rogers, who's a musician, she had this post she put on Instagram where it was all of her

307
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,600
notes on a particular song that they were working on and like, you know, hey, I think we need to

308
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,320
bring the symbol in, you know, a second earlier here and, you know, a bunch of other stuff. And

309
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,960
then she shared a little clip of her listening to it with her producer and so on. And you could

310
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:57,240
just tell that she cared so much about the details. It would bother her if the song was not as good as

311
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,480
it could possibly be. And, you know, that's maybe that's the musician's version of hates to lose.

312
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,280
And I love it when I see that characteristic. It just like it kind of lights me up. It makes me

313
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,240
want to be that way about whatever thing I'm working on. You just if you can find that area

314
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,280
where it would bother you for it to not be right. I got to think you're going to get much better

315
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,120
results there than most people because most people get bored or move on or, you know,

316
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,680
get tired or frustrated. And the person who just will not stop unless it's right is going to end

317
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,520
up with better results. It sounds simple to say the way to have great results is to not lower your

318
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,880
standards, but in a lot of ways, it turns out to be more true than you would expect.

319
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah. And I agree with you. I love watching this in the best of the best. And, you know,

320
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,280
Formula One is one of my favorite sports and especially, you know, historically, you know,

321
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,960
my my hero is this guy named by Art Tonsena. And to hear him, I watch that documentary. I'd never

322
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,600
heard of him. I know very little about for one. I it was awesome. After watching that,

323
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,720
I was like completely hooked. This is a fascinating sport. Yeah. Well, and you gather from the from

324
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,880
that documentary. I mean, that his I mean, he was a perfectionist, even amongst his peers.

325
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,080
He took it to a level that exceeded that. It actually cost him his life. I don't think the

326
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,840
documentary fully explains how much that that need to win killed him because the day he died,

327
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,600
he was trying to do something in a car that shouldn't have been done at a time when it

328
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,480
shouldn't have been done. But it's amazing when in a sport like that, where the stakes are so high

329
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,400
for trying to to do something at the expense of, you know, maybe a mechanical limit or a limit of

330
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,400
the car. But yet all drivers will tell you like they're they're going to go for it. If there's a

331
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,680
gap there, they're going to take they're going to go for the gap. And, you know, there was there was

332
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,560
a debate in the 90s in Formula One because that was before, you know, so Senna's death changed the

333
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:02,200
sport forever because that's really what changed the imposed safety in the sport. But the debate

334
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,680
prior to that was, look, we'll just tell the drivers to drive slower. You know, they don't have

335
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,200
to drive this fast there. You know, they can choose to drive 10 percent slower, which of course was

336
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,080
nonsense. Right. I mean, the head of the F.I.A. at the time who has just recently passed away

337
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,120
made a point which was that that's the dumbest thing you could ever say. They will all choose

338
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:30,440
to have a less safe car if it goes faster because you're talking about the 20 most competitive

339
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,560
drivers on the planet. Now, there was another point I was going to make that was so you talked

340
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:45,000
about. Oh, yeah, here is the point. For most of us, we will never know what it's like to be the top

341
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,560
thousand in the world of anything. Right. Like I could if I think about all the things that I love

342
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:56,680
driving a race car, shooting my bow and arrow, you know, exercising. I mean, I'm multiple orders

343
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:06,680
of magnitude beneath even the most lowly ranked professional of those things. And this gets into

344
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:14,520
something else, which is for me, at least the joy is not in the absolute comparison of myself to

345
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:22,200
others, but the relative comparison of where I was before. Do you think that's a universal thing?

346
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,120
Is it universal that people are mostly engaged by how much they are making progress relative to their

347
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,040
own performance? Or do you think that there are some people who are only capable of finding pleasure

348
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:43,240
when being compared to others in an absolute basis? The second half of that question, I'm not sure of.

349
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,520
I generally I think both of those things are universal. I think one, it's universal that the

350
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,040
one of the most motivating feelings to the human mind is the feeling of progress.

351
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:00,040
And I think it's fairly universal that progress feels good. You know, we are in a sense at the

352
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,320
most base level, we are goal directed organisms in the sense that, you know, we have a goal to get

353
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:13,080
food or water or to procreate or to be safe. And we want to move toward those things and resolve

354
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:20,280
the tension, the gap between that goal and our current state as much as possible. And, you know,

355
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,880
now with our complex brains and modern society, we come up with many other goals that are outside

356
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,680
of just our basic needs like food and water. We have goals like getting a promotion at work or,

357
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,040
you know, losing 10 pounds or whatever it is. But that same tension between where you are currently

358
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,800
and where you want to be, we want to have that resolved. And the more progress that you feel like

359
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,480
you're making toward one of those things, I think that generally feels good. So I feel like that's

360
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,680
pretty universal. I also do think it seems to be fairly universal that we have some bias toward

361
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:00,600
status, some bias toward prestige and rank and hierarchy. And it feels good for pretty much

362
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,400
anybody to win the game or to have the best score on the scoreboard or to climb the leaderboard.

363
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,240
And the more that you see yourself occupying a higher run relative to those around you,

364
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:19,960
whether it's with wealth or money or fame, the better that feels too. And it probably is a

365
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,000
spectrum or maybe each of those is a spectrum. And some people have the dial turned up real high

366
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,280
on the status part and maybe lower on the internal measures. And other people have it,

367
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,880
you know, the reverse. But I generally think we all have them to some degree and you probably

368
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,360
will find yourself feeling good if you happen to succeed on either of those metrics.

369
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,400
And how much of it do you think is, for lack of a better term, journey versus destination focused?

370
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,120
Because if you talk about your example of weight loss, right, that is generally a very

371
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,880
destination based metric. I want to lose 10 pounds. I'm not going to be happy until I lose 10 pounds.

372
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,520
The process of how I go about doing it, changing the way I'm eating, changing my exercise,

373
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,400
accepting the fact that you're not going to lose 10 pounds linearly, it's going to look like this.

374
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,280
You know, those are details that I'm going to will, I'm willing to tolerate, but I want to lose

375
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,720
those 10 pounds or I want to fit into this piece of clothing that I used to fit into. Contrast that

376
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:27,960
with I want to learn to speak Italian and I'm enjoying this process of learning a few new words

377
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,920
every day and learning how the structure of this grammar works relative to my native tongue. And

378
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm never going to be perfectly fluent in Italian, but I know that in some point I'm going to be

379
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,640
completely functional, but it's more that this journey of learning this new language or learning

380
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,840
how to play this instrument, that's what's giving me the pleasure. And I don't know if that distinction

381
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,520
makes sense, but sure. I think, you know, this is first, I should say this is coming from someone

382
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,920
who's been very goal oriented for most of their life. You know, like I would set goals for the

383
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,400
grades I wanted to get in school for the weight I wanted to lift in the gym for the numbers I wanted

384
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,720
my business to hit. And at some point I actually found this sheet that I made my sophomore year

385
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,360
of college for the goals that I wanted to hit by the time I graduated. It was funny looking back

386
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,880
on it like 10 or 11 years later, because, you know, about half of them I hit the other half I didn't.

387
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,400
And I was like, obviously setting the goal was not the thing that made the difference, right? Like

388
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,760
if it did, I would have hit them all. So something else is going on here. And I kind of had to like,

389
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,480
it was like a little remedial training session for myself or something realizing that, you know,

390
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:46,280
goals are not the primary thing that drives results. And in fact, if you look at the performance

391
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,360
in most domains, the winners and the losers have the same goal. Presumably every Formula One driver

392
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,720
has the goal of winning the race when they take off from the starting line. You know, if you have

393
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,440
a job opening and a hundred candidates apply for the job, presumably every candidate has the goal

394
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,640
of getting the job. So the goal is not the thing that makes the difference in the performance. And

395
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,320
if the winners and the losers have the same goal, then it cannot be the distinguishing factor. Maybe

396
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,040
it's necessary. Perhaps there's an argument necessary for success, but it's not sufficient for it.

397
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,920
And so that got me thinking more like, well, what is it then that drives it? And I, in the book,

398
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,520
the way that I described is the difference between systems and goals. And so, you know,

399
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,520
your, your goal is your desired outcome, your target, the thing you're shooting for,

400
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,720
your system is the collection of daily habits that you follow. You know, it's like all these

401
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,680
little gears in this overall machine. And if there's ever a gap between your desired outcome

402
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,120
and your daily habits, if there's ever a gap between your goal and your system,

403
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,760
your daily habits will always win, right? Almost by definition, your current habits are perfectly

404
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,520
designed for your current results. So whatever system you've been running for the last, you know,

405
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,520
six months or year or whatever, you talked about shooting a bow and arrow, presumably whatever

406
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,720
system of movements you have going on there, pre shot routine, how you draw it back, everything,

407
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,560
it kind of is inevitably carrying you toward the result of where the arrow ends up. And,

408
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,560
you know, sort of the irony of all this is we also badly want better results in life. You know,

409
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,520
we also badly want to make more money or to reduce stress or lose weight or whatever.

410
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,760
But the results are not actually the thing that needs to change. It's kind of like fix the inputs

411
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,920
and the outputs will fix themselves. And there are some areas like shooting a bow where that is the

412
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,280
connection is quite obvious. But there are other areas where for whatever reason, we don't see it

413
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,560
as clearly, but I think that the pattern is still there, which is let's adjust the habits, let's get

414
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,880
this machine running in a more fluid fashion. And you'll find that the results kind of come naturally.

415
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,920
So I think just appreciating that helped rewire my mindset a little bit. I was so focused on

416
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,960
outcomes and goals for a long time. And now realizing that actually the way this is driven

417
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,080
is with the system that helped me shift from, you know, what I would say now is like

418
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,120
goals are for people who care about winning one time, you set a goal to run a half marathon,

419
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,280
and you train for three months and you do it and you complete the race. But then maybe you

420
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,240
stop training after that. But systems are for people who care about winning again and again.

421
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,200
And if you care about sustaining that success, then you're like, you know, I'm a runner, I care

422
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,120
about the system that I'm building for how I train, how many miles I'm getting in, all kinds

423
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,800
of other stuff. And whether I have a half marathon three months in the distance or not, it doesn't

424
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,800
really matter because I like I'm going to be running my system either way. And so making that

425
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:58,440
mental shift, I think can be useful for sustaining results. So let's talk about habits now, because

426
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:06,760
I think that's the thing that, as you said, basically shapes the nature of what we're going

427
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:13,000
to do. There's a saying that many people have said, and I won't even try to paraphrase it because

428
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,200
at the moment it's escaping me, but the gist of it is like you don't rise to the level of your,

429
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,800
what is it? You don't rise to the level of your training, you fall to the level,

430
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,360
or you fall to the level of your training and what would it be?

431
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:31,080
Right. The original quote, I think it's from Arcilocus, I believe a Greek philosopher,

432
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,560
and said, you don't rise to the level of your expectations, you fall to the level of your

433
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:42,680
training. And in Atomic Habits, I tweaked that or adjusted that to say, you don't rise to the level

434
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,520
of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. And so it's actually your habits that

435
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:53,560
kind of create that baseline. So why is it called Atomic Habits? I think, I remember when I first

436
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,800
saw the title, my assumption was Atomic must be huge explosion, like big habits, which of course

437
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,800
is exactly not what it means. So, so, uh, well, it's, it's good. Actually, it's interesting which

438
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,200
meanings people pull out when they see it. Cause so I chose the phrase Atomic Habits for three

439
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,840
reasons. Um, the first meaning of the word atomic is tiny or small, like an atom. And I do think

440
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,760
habits should be small and fairly easy to do, especially in the beginning. The second meaning

441
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,560
of the word atomic is the fundamental unit in a larger system. And that's the one that people

442
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,800
often overlook, you know, like atom is built into molecules, molecules built into compounds and so

443
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,440
on. And your habits are kind of like that. Each little habit is like a, you know, a little atom

444
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,760
in the overall routine of your day. You put them all together and you end up with your lifestyle or

445
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,160
your daily routine. And then the third and final meaning is the one that you mentioned, you know,

446
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,600
the source of immense energy or power. And I think if you put all three meanings together,

447
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,040
you sort of understand the narrative arc of the book, which is make changes that are small and

448
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,120
easy to do, layer them on top of each other, like units in a larger system or atoms in a molecule.

449
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,120
And collectively you can get some really powerful or remarkable results. And so I feel like the phrase

450
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,640
atomic habits not only encapsulates that kind of small change in the system that you're looking to

451
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,520
build, but also the powerful results that can emanate from that. So you talk about three different

452
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,040
types of change, right? There's sort of the outcome change, the process change. We've touched

453
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,440
on a little bit of those, but the one we haven't really touched on is this identity change. And

454
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,200
that was something that when I read your book really resonated because it provided, I think,

455
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,560
a very decent explanation, at least for why exercise comes naturally to me, which is it's

456
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:51,960
so hardwired into my identity and why maybe certain other habits I've tried to create over time

457
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,920
don't come easily to me because I haven't fully identified with them yet. So explain a little bit

458
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,640
what, you know, first of all, what, you know, expand on that, but also how you kind of came to realize that.

459
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,800
Yeah. So two things before I unpack the idea a little more fully. First is of all the ideas

460
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,480
in the book, this is probably the least scientific. There are actually some studies,

461
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,480
which I cite in that chapter and it's not like there's no science behind it, but the majority of

462
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,840
the book, I try to be very robust in the way that I was thinking about, like, how do we build habits

463
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,600
and what actually gets in the stick? And there also are just a bazillion, you know, social

464
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,000
psychology and cognitive psychology studies that, you know, illustrate a lot of the examples that I

465
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,680
talk about. But this is more of a mindset, I would say, or a philosophy on how behavior change works.

466
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,600
Second thing is it's maybe the only unique idea that I have. Pretty much everything else that I

467
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,440
share is, you know, stuff that's been widely covered by other people or, you know, things that

468
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,160
we've known for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But I felt like this was something that,

469
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,720
you know, maybe I could contribute to the conversation. And part of the reason I started

470
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,120
thinking about it is I started asking, like, why do habits really matter? You know, why do we

471
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,440
we seem to care about them a lot as a society? It's something a lot of books get written about,

472
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,760
something we talk about a lot. There's clearly some kind of deeper importance to them. So what is it?

473
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,640
And the surface level answer is that we care about habits because they get us these external

474
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,320
things that make us more productive and more fit and so on. And habits can help you do all

475
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,920
that stuff, which is great. But I think the real reason, the deeper reason that habits matter

476
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,400
is that they are a signal internally to ourselves about who we are and what we care about. And,

477
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,440
you know, they're kind of a signal of like the story that we're telling ourselves.

478
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:56,440
So in a sense, every time that you perform a habit, you are embodying a particular identity.

479
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,800
Like when you make your bed, you embody the identity of someone who is clean and organized.

480
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,840
When you shoot a basketball for 30 minutes, you embody the identity of someone who is a

481
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,960
basketball player. And, you know, you do those things once or twice, it doesn't radically

482
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,680
transform the story you have by yourself. But if you keep showing up and shooting a

483
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,160
basketball every day for six months or two years, or, you know, at some point, you cross this sort

484
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,480
of invisible threshold where you're like, yeah, being a basketball player is like part of who I

485
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,160
am, you know, it's some aspect of my identity. And so your habits provide evidence, they provide

486
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,920
proof of the story that you're telling yourself. And that I think is a very powerful thing, a very

487
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,360
deep personal thing that habits can provide, and perhaps the real reason why they matter.

488
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,600
So to come back to your question about process versus outcome versus identity, and kind of

489
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,680
where how we change, usually when people set out to make some kind of change, they start by thinking

490
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,240
about the results or the outcome that they want. So they say, I want to lose 40 pounds in the next

491
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:05,720
six months. And then from that outcome, they back into a process or a plan. So they say,

492
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,560
All right, if I want to lose 40 pounds, then I need to follow this nutrition plan, I'm going to

493
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,600
need to work out four days a week. And maybe there are details to those plans and everything.

494
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:21,160
But that's usually kind of roughly where it stops. And then the assumption is, if I do those things,

495
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:27,080
and I lose that weight, then I'll be the kind of person that I want to be. And the argument that I

496
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,440
try to unpack in that chapter is what if we worked backwards from this? What if instead we said,

497
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:38,040
who is the type of person I wish to be? What is the identity that I'd like to have? And in fact,

498
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:44,360
we could even ask like, the person who has that identity, what kind of habits would they have?

499
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:52,200
And then we use that identity to inform the process, the habits, and we let the outcomes

500
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,800
come naturally. And there are a variety of examples of this. I one reader of mine, she

501
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:04,120
lost a bunch of weight, I think it was 110 pounds in total. And she kept, she's kept it off for over

502
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,440
a decade. And the question that she sort of carried around with her as she was starting her

503
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:14,120
weight loss journey is what would a healthy person do? And that's very much aligned or oriented with

504
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,520
that identity piece. It's like, okay, would a healthy person take a cab? Or would they walk

505
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,080
four blocks the next meeting? Would they order a salad and chicken at lunch? Or would they have a

506
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,240
hamburger and fries? And she could just kind of carry that question around with her to every

507
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,680
context she was in, and make a choice that she felt like aligned with the identity that she wanted to

508
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,880
have, rather than worrying necessarily about, you know, something specific, like the number of

509
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,760
macros she's getting, or, you know, whatever. Now, I should say, I think it can work both ways,

510
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:48,440
like I count my macros and works really well for me. But I think that's partially because it'll

511
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:54,440
aligns with the identity that I already have. And if you aren't, if you don't have that shift

512
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,560
in internal story yet, it's hard for the behavior to follow suit, you know, like imagine,

513
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,200
imagine you went up to two people. And you said, Hey, would you like a cigarette? And the first

514
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,760
person says, Oh, no, thanks, I'm trying to quit. And the second person says, Oh, no, thanks, I'm

515
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,760
not a smoker. Now, technically, they've done the same thing, they both turned down the cigarette.

516
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,360
But the second person kind of has signaled a shift in identity change, like they the first

517
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,400
person is trying to be something they're not, no, thanks, I'm trying to quit. And the second person

518
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,320
is saying, I'm not a smoker. It's just not something that I do. And I think once you get to

519
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,920
that stage, that shift in identity, you're in a much more powerful place from a behavior change

520
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,120
standpoint, because you're not even really trying to change anymore. You're just acting in alignment

521
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,760
with the type of person you see yourself to be. So we can talk about ways to do that. But that's

522
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,800
kind of the quick version on identity versus outcome. Tell me what you think the difference

523
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,560
is in identity between the woman you gave the example of and say yourself, so you're both

524
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,920
striving to the same objective, which is a healthy weight. But she accomplished it by

525
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,320
focusing on what would a healthy person do in this situation, you accomplish it again,

526
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,440
just pertaining to nutrition at the moment, presumably by saying, you know, I don't know

527
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,520
what your macro goals are. But these are, you know, these are the aspirations that I have,

528
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,360
and I'm going to stick to these. So tell me a little bit about the difference between those

529
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,840
approaches. And how can a person know which will be better for them outside of just empirically

530
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:35,640
trying them both? Well, I think in this particular case, the primary difference is I had an internal

531
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,720
story or have an internal story that I am a healthy person already. And so just doing things

532
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:47,080
that are aligned with that, like counting macros feels totally fine. Whereas for her at that early

533
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,040
stage, she did not feel that way and did not genuinely believe that about herself. This is

534
00:49:52,040 --> 00:50:01,000
also I should say, it's possible to have an epiphany and to change, you know, cold turkey or

535
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
to just flip a switch and suddenly start acting in a different way. I do think it's possible. I

536
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,720
think sometimes people have experiences like that. Ironically, I think it rarely happens from some

537
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,800
kind of bolts of lightning inside. I think one of the most common ways it happens is by reading

538
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,560
books. I think people will sometimes read a book that really changes their worldview and they start

539
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,400
to do things completely differently after that. You can imagine a bunch of nutrition examples,

540
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,760
like somebody reads a book that convinces them that, you know, carbs are the devil and the grain is

541
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,240
terrible. And all of a sudden, the next day, like they want to throw out all the bread in the house.

542
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:42,440
And, you know, like it's very, very quick switch has been flipped. So I do think it's possible.

543
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,160
However, I don't think that changing through an epiphany is a very reliable way to change. And

544
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,840
I don't know that it's a it's something you can bank on or can plan around or strategize for.

545
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,280
Might happen to you a couple of times in your life, but I don't think that it's an efficient

546
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:04,600
way to try to build a new habit. So if you can't change or hope to change through an epiphany,

547
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,560
then what are your options if you want to change your identity? And I think the the best avenue

548
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:18,280
that you have is to cast votes with your actions. So in a sense, every action you take is like a

549
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:24,440
vote for the type of person you wish to become. So no, doing one push up does not radically

550
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,560
transform your body, but it does cast a vote for the type of person who doesn't miss workouts.

551
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:36,120
And no, writing one sentence may not finish the novel, but it does cast a vote for I'm a writer.

552
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,160
And I think this is like a meaningful difference between my approach or what I recommend. And what

553
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:49,160
you often hear, like you often hear something like fake it till you make it. And I don't necessarily

554
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,160
have anything wrong with fake it till you make it. It's asking you to believe something positive

555
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,240
about yourself. But it's asking you to believe something positive without having evidence for it.

556
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,120
And we have a word for beliefs that don't have evidence, we call that delusion,

557
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,280
right? Like at some point, your brain doesn't like this mismatch between what you're saying

558
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,240
and what you're actually doing. And so to bring it back to your question about my friend who lost

559
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,920
all this weight, I think you have to genuinely believe that story about yourself in order for

560
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,040
the actions to start to feel aligned. And what do you do if you don't genuinely believe you're a

561
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,200
healthy person or don't genuinely believe that I'm the kind of person who would track my macros or

562
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,640
whatever? Well, I think you have to start with these very small habits, you have to start by

563
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,920
proving it to yourself in some little way. Maybe it's just that you did walk the three blocks to

564
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,240
the meeting and didn't take the taxi, or maybe it's just that you did order a salad for lunch

565
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:46,680
and not a burger and fries. And none of those things individually are going to change your body,

566
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:53,880
or even the story right away. But if you keep casting votes for that behavior, and keep casting

567
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,520
votes for that identity, then eventually you get to the point where it's like the basketball example,

568
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,360
you kind of have to admit that you're a basketball player, because you've been shooting hoops for

569
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:08,280
the last two years. And like, this is just part of who you are now. So I think that that's the

570
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,440
primary difference between the two of us is that I already kind of had that story and early on,

571
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,600
she didn't. Now she does. So who knows, maybe now she could just track her macros just as easily,

572
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:23,240
or even easier than I can. I don't know. Yeah. I wonder how that process changes in this person

573
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,320
after 10 years. I mean, most people understand that losing weight is actually not that hard,

574
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:35,000
but keeping weight off is exceptionally hard. So what your friend did, yes, losing 110 pounds is

575
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,920
remarkable, but the fact that she's kept it off for a decade is actually what's remarkable.

576
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:48,120
And I'm curious as to what the temporal sequence of events is where, hey, for the first year,

577
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,080
it was a daily struggle of what would the healthy person do? What would the healthy person do? What

578
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,800
would the healthy person do? And at some point that transitions into, I'm a healthy person,

579
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:02,680
this is what I do. I'm a healthy person, this is what I do. And then it becomes so autonomic that

580
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,560
you can even slip, you can slip up for a day and it feels wrong. Like it's like,

581
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,720
God, that cotton candy is horrible. Like I don't ever want to eat that again.

582
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah. Well, you said something similar to that a few minutes ago about how like it bothers you to

583
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,880
not work out sometimes, you know, and near y'all who also has written about habits has kind of a

584
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,040
little measure for that reason. Like his measure for whether it's a habit or not is does it bother

585
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,240
you when you don't do it? And I think that's a signal that it's kind of aligned with your

586
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:37,080
identity. It's like, I kind of feel like I'm not being me if I if I don't do this. And to your

587
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,800
point about it taking a long time, it can take much longer than you would think. I mean, my friend

588
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,680
told me she had to lose 60 pounds before the first person noticed before she ever heard anything from

589
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,280
somebody else. Wow. And, you know, that's, that's a lot of that's a lot of weight, a long time to be

590
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,200
working in essentially what feels like a vacuum feels like you're just doing it for yourself,

591
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,480
no external feedback from the world. So, you know, this comes back to a lot of things we've

592
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,040
already talked about, about process and falling in love with the system. And, you know, there are

593
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,840
a lot of a lot of things that go into it, but it definitely is an internal journey. And it definitely

594
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:16,040
will take longer than you would imagine. A lot of cases. One of the most common examples that I

595
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:24,440
hear of in my practice for the epiphany behavior change that sticks is the person who quit smoking

596
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,880
the day their child is born. And I've always found this interesting, right? Because the day

597
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,320
before their child is born, they clearly know how bad smoking is, right? There's nobody who's

598
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:41,000
smoking, you know, who doesn't understand the risks of it. And by the same token, who doesn't,

599
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,600
as you pointed out earlier, enjoy the benefits of it in the short run, right? Very rewarding in the

600
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:51,480
short run, very damaging in the long run. So that's, that's completely understood intellectually.

601
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,320
On day X, they have a child and they decide, I'm done with this. I'm not going to have smoke in

602
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,280
my household because I also know the benefits of secondhand smoke or the harm rather of secondhand

603
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,480
smoke. And I'm not going to expose my child to this. And yet amazingly, I mean, over and over

604
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,120
and over again, I hear these stories from patients saying, yep, you know, my, I grew up in a household

605
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,080
where my parents were incredible smokers. And the second I was born, they stopped, they stopped. And

606
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,600
that was 40 years ago and they've never had a cigarette since. What do you think is going on

607
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,320
in an example like that? Is it, is there a transference process here where because it

608
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:33,160
involves the life of another person, it's easier to make this change stick? Possibly. I mean, I'm

609
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,400
sure there are a lot of variables that go into it, but it does align with, there's like this whole

610
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:43,080
category of behaviors that I feel like if you wanted to hack a radical change in your life,

611
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,760
you want to figure out a way to get, like you said, this epiphany to stick.

612
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:56,040
Massive environment changes or lifestyle changes are a good way to do that. Perhaps the, you know,

613
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:02,120
one of the strongest ways to do that. So having a kid, getting married, changing jobs,

614
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:09,400
moving to a different city, even something small like getting a dog can lead to rapid

615
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,920
behavior change. And I think one of the things that is really crucial about it is that most of

616
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:21,640
those decisions tend to be irreversible or at least very hard to reverse. I had one that I

617
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,760
struggled with for a long time. Sometimes people ask me, you know, what habits have you struggled

618
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:32,200
with or whatever? And I, I tend to be pretty good about getting enough sleep. I almost always get

619
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:39,960
eight hours or even nine if I'm training hard and, but I would fall into this pattern where it'd

620
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,320
be like nine or 10 o'clock at night and I would kind of get a second wind and it'd be like, well,

621
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,160
maybe I'll just send a few emails or something. And of course it's never just a few. You turn

622
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,000
around and it's midnight or one and you're like, okay, am I going to sleep for eight hours? Because

623
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,080
if so, that means I'm not getting up till nine. And I know that I prefer to get up early. I know

624
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,480
that I feel better throughout the rest of the next day. So, you know, 10 p.m. James is kind of

625
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,400
ruining things for tomorrow, James, by staying up late. And I tried a bunch of different things.

626
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,440
There's a little device called an outlet timer. You can buy it for like 10 bucks on Amazon and

627
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,200
you plug it into an outlet and you can set the time for when it kills the power from that outlet.

628
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,280
And so like, if you plug your internet into it, then like the internet shuts off at 10 p.m.

629
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,680
or, you know, whatever you set it for. And so I tried different things like that, you know,

630
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,720
but then you could just pick your phone up and, you know, kind of like get around it.

631
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,440
But the thing that finally made it stick was getting a dog because the dog is going to get

632
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,760
up at seven a.m. Whether I whenever I go to sleep, it doesn't matter. And I need to go take it for

633
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,040
a walk. And you can only do that for a few days before you're like, all right, I'm not going to

634
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,760
play this game anymore. I'm going to bed at 10. And it's because it was fairly hard to reverse.

635
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,720
They got it to stick. And I think, you know, in the case of having a kid like they're going to be

636
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,360
there every day now. And so maybe you could rationalize it a bunch of times before that.

637
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,200
But like that change is not going to or that's not going to change. They're going to be around.

638
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,280
And weirdly, because, you know, presumably this person's wife was pregnant, so they obviously

639
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:16,200
saw that throughout the whole pregnancy. But that didn't get them to change. But once the child is

640
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,200
there, man, it's really immediate, you know, like you're taking a puff and you have those little

641
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:26,040
eyes looking back at you. And so the feedback loop is even tighter than before. So I would

642
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,520
imagine both of those things probably play a role. But more generally speaking, those kind of

643
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:36,360
irreversible or hard to reverse lifestyle changes also tend to be big drivers of quick behavior

644
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:45,720
change. You know, I can only think of one dramatic habit I changed that has stuck. And it is the

645
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:52,360
silliest thing. But I always bit my nails growing up. I mean, I would bite them nonstop.

646
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,760
And, you know, invariably what happens is you'd get a little infection because you bite too close.

647
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,320
And it was like my mom was always like, God, that is such a disgusting habit. Like you have like,

648
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:08,680
it's just it looked horrible. And the day I decided to change it was the day I got my first

649
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,520
interview for med school. So, you know, you apply to medical school and then all of a sudden the

650
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,000
envelopes start coming in and you've got these interviews. And just as I got that first

651
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,440
envelope and I realized, oh, I'm actually going to go and be interviewing because you don't at

652
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,800
least for me, I didn't interview to go to college. This was the first time I had to do an interview.

653
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,160
And I don't know, just something came over me. I was like, wait a second, dude, you can't be the

654
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,680
guy that's showing up to an interview with these horrible looking nails. You have to cut this out.

655
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,160
You are going to get a nail clipper and you are going to start clipping your nails like a civilized

656
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:50,200
human being. And that was, you know, I don't know, 25 years ago. And today I sometimes like when my

657
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:55,960
nails get long, I'm a guy who likes short nails, so I'm always sort of treating them. But like,

658
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:02,360
I can't imagine that I once bit them. It just seems so strange to me. That's fascinating.

659
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:08,760
But it's just it's a silly example. Well, I don't think it is actually because there's, you know,

660
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,880
we all have habits that are like that. And I think there's two things that made me think the

661
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,600
first is it connects to our conversation about identity from a few minutes ago, which is you

662
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,720
started to take pride in it. You know, you cared about how you presented. And the more that we

663
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,640
take pride in certain elements of our identity, or aspects of who we are, certain parts of our story,

664
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,960
the more strongly that behavior starts to stick. You know, like you can imagine

665
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,480
a woman who takes pride in how her hair looks, she probably has all kinds of hair care habits

666
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,680
and products and things that she does. And, you know, she probably doesn't have to convince

667
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:49,640
herself to do them the same way that we talk about convincing ourselves of a lot of other habits. Oh,

668
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,040
I wish I could write or I wish I would work out or whatever. It's just an element of her identity.

669
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:59,560
She takes pride in and so she does it like fairly consistently, or the guy who gets complimented on

670
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,040
the size of his biceps. And so he just never skips arm day in the gym because it's an aspect

671
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:09,160
of his identity that he takes pride in. And so that connection of, you know, when we talk about

672
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,640
identity change, what I'm kind of getting at is like, what parts of your story do you take pride

673
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:19,400
in? And once you start to take pride in it, man, you'll fight for it pretty hard to keep it. And

674
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,120
in many cases, you'll find yourself doing it somewhat naturally, or at least internally

675
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:29,080
motivated to continue doing it. So that was the first piece, the second piece, and this is

676
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:35,400
something that since atomic habits has come out, I think is even more important than I realized

677
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:42,040
when I was writing the book, which is the influence of the social environment on your habits. So in

678
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:48,920
your case, the med school interviews, it was actually the image in your mind, the expectation

679
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,560
about what other people might think and how you would present in that interview and so on,

680
01:02:53,560 --> 01:03:01,080
the judgment of others, essentially, that helped drive that change. And if you look at behaviors

681
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,600
that really stick, the ones that tend to stick for, you know, 10 or 20 or 30 years, a long time,

682
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:15,800
there's often a strong social component involved. So for example, we're all part of multiple tribes,

683
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,320
some of those tribes are large, like what it means to be American, or some of those tribes are small,

684
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,680
like being a member of your CrossFit gym or being a neighbor on your street. And, you know,

685
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:31,800
like if you take the neighborhood example, you might walk outside and see your neighbor mowing

686
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,880
their grass on, you know, Wednesday night or something, and think, Oh, I need to cut my lawn.

687
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,400
And you'll stick with that habit of mowing your grass for, you know, 20 or 30 years, or however

688
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,120
long you live in that house, like we wish we had that level of consistency with most of our other

689
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:52,360
habits. And why do you do it? Like partially you do it because it feels good to have a clean lawn.

690
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,400
But mostly you do it because you don't want to be judged by the other people in the neighborhood for

691
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:03,560
being the sloppy one. And so it's actually that social norm, that expectation for what it means

692
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,200
to be part of this neighborhood and how you act in this group or this tribe, that helps get the

693
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,880
habit to stick. I think the practical takeaway there, if you really want to behavior change to last

694
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,520
is to join groups where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Because if it's normal in

695
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:25,960
that group, it's going to seem much more normal and typical for you to do it. I mean, you know,

696
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,280
Peter, I'm sure you're part of multiple groups that do what most people would determine are like

697
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,200
weird habits, like I'm sure there's a group of friends who are really into driving cars.

698
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,720
And there's probably another group who's like really into bow hunting and archery.

699
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,560
And there are all kinds of habits that these little tribes do. And it might seem strange to

700
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:49,480
the normal person, but it's probably very casual or typical or easy, relatively for you to stick

701
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,640
to those habits, especially when you're part of those groups or talking with those guys,

702
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,920
because it's just part of something that, you know, it's it's part of what they do.

703
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:04,760
And I think maybe the deeper lesson here is that we don't just do habits because of the results they

704
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:12,040
get us. We also take behaviors because they are a signal to the people around us that, hey, I get it,

705
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:19,880
I fit in, I understand how to act in this group. And most people, if they have to choose between

706
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,920
having the habits they want to have, but they kind of go against the grain of the group,

707
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,440
they like don't really fit in well, they get ostracized, or having habits that they don't

708
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,800
really love, but they get to go along with the crowd, they fit in, they get praised for being

709
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:42,120
part of the group. Most people will choose belonging over loneliness, like the desire to

710
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,800
belong will overpower the desire to improve. And so you want to make sure you get those two things

711
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:53,720
aligned to join groups where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Yeah, it's interesting.

712
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:00,840
I wonder if part of the queue for me was buying a suit and it was the first suit I had. So it was

713
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:07,640
like, that was sort of a, wait a minute, you're wearing a suit, think of the trouble you're going

714
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,920
to get this thing and then this tie that you're going to wear and blah, blah, blah, all this sort

715
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,920
of stuff. But it's interesting. And then clearly it just became a part of my identity, which is

716
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:25,720
I'm a person who has nice fingernails. I present well from the fingernail standpoint, at least.

717
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:31,320
Yeah. Hasn't translated to all of my habits, but okay. So let's talk about the four laws,

718
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:37,560
because these four laws are kind of the central tenets to what we speak about and they can be

719
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:44,440
inverted as well, which I think is important as we think about creating, call it adaptive habits

720
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:52,120
versus breaking maladaptive habits. So what's the first law? Yeah. So real quick, before we get into

721
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,800
these four, I just want to explain the framework a little bit, because in particular for this

722
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,160
episode or this show, because I feel like your audience will appreciate it more than most

723
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:09,080
audiences. So I like to divide a habit into four stages. And as you said, those four stages kind

724
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,360
of have four different, what I call the four laws of behavior change that come out of it.

725
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,760
But when I was working on atomic habits and researching this framework and trying to

726
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,760
understand like why do behaviors happen and how do they happen, how do habits form?

727
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:27,080
I had a couple questions that I felt like previous frameworks did not answer that well.

728
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:34,840
So while researching the book, I was able to find 40 different models of human behavior that

729
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,320
biologists and neuroscientists and psychologists, a bunch of different industries had come up with

730
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:46,680
over the last, say about 150 years. And broadly speaking, those human models of human behavior

731
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,480
tended to fall into one of two categories. The first category are what I would call like

732
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:58,360
motivation models. So they explain things like internal drives and motivations and cravings and

733
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:04,200
kind of like what compels us to act. And then the second category were what I would call

734
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:10,040
reinforcement models. And so they described like the rewards that we get from behaviors and how

735
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,360
those things kind of reinforce our behavior and essentially what happens like after an action.

736
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:20,200
And what I wanted to do was try to come up with a model that I felt like accurately described

737
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:25,480
both the motivation that may come before and the reinforcement that may come after and how those

738
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:30,840
things influence the actions that we take. And there were a variety of what I thought were

739
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:37,080
fairly simple questions about human behavior that weren't totally answered by the previous models.

740
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:42,200
So things like what causes somebody to try have it in the first place, you know, like you haven't

741
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,080
experienced the reward at that point. So why would you take the first bite of a pancake or the first

742
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:54,040
smoke of a cigarette? Like what what would motivate you to do that? Or, you know, we say that habits

743
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:59,480
are very common, you know, start with BF Skinner, stimulus, response, reward, and then Charles

744
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:05,000
Duhiggen, power of habit kind of popularized as Q, routine, reward. But we say, OK, habits are a Q,

745
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,880
and then there's the action, there's some kind of outcome. Well, how come two people respond

746
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,880
differently to the same thing? Like why would one person see a cigarette and feel like, oh,

747
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,320
I have to smoke and another person's like, I've never smoked a day in my life. I'm not interested

748
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,480
at all. Because if it's just the Q that leads to the action, you would think they would do the same

749
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:28,600
thing. And even why would the same person respond differently to the same Q? How come when I walk in

750
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,000
my kitchen at 7 a.m., I see a loaf of bread and I think, oh, I'm going to make some toast for

751
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,120
breakfast. But then I walk in at 4 p.m. and I see that same Q and I don't think anything of it,

752
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:45,960
I just move on. So to summarize all of this, I think the one of the meaningful distinctions

753
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,520
about the four stages that I put together and why I feel like it accurately describes human behavior

754
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:57,000
and sort of the insight that I came across as I was researching, there's a neuroscientist

755
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,760
named Lisa Feldman Barrett, and she has a bunch of studies and, you know, a couple of books on this

756
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,480
topic. One book in particular that was useful for me while I was researching is called How Emotions

757
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:14,360
Are Made. And the key insight is that we often think that human behavior is reactive in the sense

758
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,360
that somebody does something and I respond or somebody says something and I feel a certain way.

759
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:26,040
But in fact, human behavior is mostly predictive. You are kind of endlessly going through your

760
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,760
experience in life predicting about what to do next. And it's actually this prediction that I

761
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,080
think was the key thing that was missing from a lot of the previous models of habits and behavior.

762
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,360
So with that as a primer, the four stages are huge.

763
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:47,480
Sorry, before we do that, James, just I think you wrote about this in the book, which was that

764
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:54,680
the dopaminergic surge comes more from the anticipation of the reward than the actual

765
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,120
behavior that gives the reward. Is that that I remember that correctly?

766
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,920
Right. So, you know, there's a bazillion studies on dopamine, of course. And also, I should say,

767
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,920
I think if you only talk about dopamine, you're kind of, you know, it's not the full story about

768
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,600
habits. Like there's, you know, there are many neurochemicals that are involved in the process

769
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,720
and dopamine is just one part of the overall picture. But it does play a very important role.

770
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:25,080
And for a long time, we thought it was about reward and satisfaction and enjoyment. But in fact,

771
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:31,160
it seems that the crucial role dopamine plays is about prediction and anticipation. And so the

772
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:36,040
first time that you take a bite of a pancake, you don't know what to expect. And so you take that

773
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:41,880
bite and then afterwards, you get a surge of dopamine, almost as if to like mark the experience

774
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,960
or to teach you, hey, that was favorable, you should do that again next time. Like if you happen

775
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,960
to see a bit of a pancake again, that was a really great outcome. And so then the next time around,

776
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:57,560
you know what to expect. And in fact, what we find is that dopamine tends to spike before you take a

777
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,800
bite, not after. And there are a bunch of studies that show this like, you know, gamblers get a

778
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:07,640
spike before they roll the dice, not after drug addicts get a spike before they take a hit of

779
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:13,160
cocaine, not after. And so dopamine, I think probably the more accurate way to describe it

780
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:18,120
in this context is it's a teaching molecule, it's a learning molecule, and it helps you,

781
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:23,640
it helps mark experiences that are favorable so that you'll remember them next time.

782
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:29,560
And then when you come across a similar situation, it spikes in anticipation. So after you see the

783
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:35,000
cue, you get this craving. And it's actually that craving or anticipation or prediction

784
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,880
that motivates you to act and drives the response. And then there's an outcome.

785
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,880
And presumably, again, using your example, there are lots of there's lots of diversity between

786
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:51,160
individuals, right? So you take 10 people who have never smoked a cigarette. Let's just to make the

787
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,960
math easy, say, well, seven of them have no desire to. So they walk away. Three of them are

788
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,040
like, I'll give it a try. They take a puff. One of them starts hacking and says, that is the most

789
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,000
disgusting thing I've ever done. I never want to do that again. And they never do. One of them says,

790
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,440
you know, I kind of like that. I'm going to do this socially. Like anytime I'm going to have a

791
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,760
drink, I'm going to have a cigarette. And one of them goes on to become a chain smoker. Now,

792
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,280
what explains that distinction? How much of that is neurochemical? Yeah, it's fascinating. And there,

793
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,680
I mean, there are, you know, examples like that for alcohol and drugs and all kinds of things.

794
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,520
And, you know, I'm not an expert on addiction. And I didn't write the book about addiction. So I

795
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:34,280
don't want to speak out of turn or step out of my lane or anything. But so I don't know that I have

796
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:38,920
a good answer to it. But from what I understand, and from what I've seen, as I was researching the

797
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:44,600
book, it does seem to have a strong, basically genetic or neurochemical component, you know,

798
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:51,800
it seems like, in a sense, drugs kind of hack the system, you know, it's like, you know, this is,

799
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,320
I think, one way to define an addiction, which is the process of learning is actually broken,

800
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:02,360
you know, addicts know that the behavior does not benefit their lives in a lot of ways, but they

801
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,280
still can't get themselves to stop doing it, even though they know it doesn't benefit them.

802
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,680
And I think part of the reason that happens, or perhaps the primary reason is the drug kind of

803
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,760
hacks the system, it like gives you this spike of dopamine, even though you shouldn't be getting

804
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,400
it, usually your brain would not be doing that, it would not be trying to teach you to repeat that,

805
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,480
but you're artificially spiking it by taking the substance. And so then that, you know,

806
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,240
the process of learning breaks. I also find it interesting that different people

807
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:38,840
will get that pleasure from different things. When I'm not in a good place, when I'm unhappy

808
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:44,760
about something, it's never my tendency to have a drink. So alcohol would only be associated with

809
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,840
something I want to do when I feel good to begin with, I would never want to have a drink when I

810
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:55,960
don't feel good. But when I don't feel good, I would happily binge on junk food, right? Like that

811
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,320
would be the thing that provides comfort. And of course, there are people who would, who when

812
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:06,600
they're unhappy, they would never want to eat even, let alone have junk food. And again, it's hard to

813
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,160
know. I find it interesting to at least contemplate how much of that is genetic, how much of that is

814
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,240
learned and what else is going on and sort of understanding that because that does sort of

815
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:20,680
factor into falling to the level of our habits because we fall to these levels when things are

816
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:25,720
not going well, typically. I think, you know, I do think there's a genetic component. Some people

817
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:31,960
are more sensitive to certain substances than others, or at least it appears to be so. However,

818
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,080
it does strike me as like very possible that a good chunk of it is learned and that now you have

819
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:43,080
a story that junk food is the way that I cope or the way that I, you know, soothe myself when I need

820
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:49,560
that. And you can imagine like, in a sense, your habits are these solutions to like recurring

821
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,680
problems that you face. So say you have somebody who comes home from work and they feel exhausted.

822
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:01,160
And one person like that's a recurring problem that they feel often. And so one person comes

823
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:05,640
home and they play video games for 30 minutes. And another person comes home and they go for a run.

824
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:12,440
And a third person smokes a cigarette. And all of them are solving the same underlying recurring

825
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,960
problem. But they're choosing different methods through which to do that. And I wonder about like,

826
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:24,360
how the grooves kind of get formed once we learn that a certain method is effective in solving that

827
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,720
problem, we tend to default to it, even if it's not the only way to solve that, even if, yeah,

828
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,800
going for a run would make me feel better, but I'm just used to smoking cigarettes now. And

829
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,080
then we start to develop a story around it, starts to become a little bit of our identity. We start

830
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:43,960
to, you know, kind of like use it as a crutch. And so I do think there's definitely a learned

831
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,440
component to that as well. All right. Well, I interrupted you before you were just about to

832
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:57,000
launch into the four laws. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So the four stages are cue, craving, response, and reward.

833
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,680
The cue is something that you notice. So for example, you see a plate of cookies on the counter,

834
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:08,360
that's a visual cue starts the habit of eating a cookie. The craving is the prediction or the

835
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:15,480
meaning that you assign to that cue often happens relatively automatically or quickly. So you see the

836
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:21,240
plate of cookies, and you think, oh, that'll be sweet, sugary, tasty, enjoyable. It's that

837
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:27,560
favorable meaning that leads to that dopamine spike that we talked about. And that motivates

838
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:32,920
you to take the third step, which is the response you walk over, you pick the cookie up, you take a

839
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:38,680
bite. And then finally, there's the reward. Oh, it is in fact, sweet, sugary, tasty, satisfying.

840
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:45,160
Now, not every behavior in life is rewarding, right? Sometimes things have a cost or a

841
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,160
consequence. Sometimes they're just kind of neutral and don't really mean a whole lot.

842
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:56,120
But if a behavior is not rewarding, then it's unlikely to become a habit because you don't

843
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:00,360
have any reason to repeat it again in the future. You need some kind of positive emotional signal

844
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:06,760
associated with the behavior for you to stick with it, at least as we've already talked about

845
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:11,560
an immediate signal. Now, is there is there some evidence to suggest if I remember back to like

846
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:17,880
my psych 101 class, which is obviously pretty elementary, that some of the most addictive

847
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:23,560
behaviors are variably reinforcing. And I sort of remember this example of why slot machines

848
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:32,280
are particularly addictive because the pattern with which they produce a win is actually random.

849
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,880
And therefore, you really don't know when it's going to come. You know, it's going to come. You

850
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,920
have to have belief that you'll see other people win and you've won in the past, but that's somehow

851
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,640
even more addictive. Whereas the cookie in theory is not variably reinforcing. It's pretty much

852
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,680
reinforcing the same way every time and presumably only subject to the tastiness of the cookie.

853
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:55,400
Yeah. So it's even more. There have been tons of studies done on variable rewards. And

854
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:02,040
the basic answer is yes, you're right. Variable rewards tend to accelerate or intensify behavior.

855
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,880
It can get even more twisted than that in the slot machines example, because what they have found is

856
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:13,800
that the sweet spot tends to be right around 50 50. And so if you you can imagine getting a reward

857
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,120
at very different schedules, like you could get it 95 percent of the time or you could get it 5

858
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:23,160
percent of the time. Well, if you only get a 5 percent of the time, then you learn pretty

859
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:26,120
quickly like, hey, this isn't a very fruitful action. Maybe I should stop doing this.

860
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,200
But if you get it around 50 50 and it works, tends to work out for you a lot, but not every time. And

861
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:36,600
it still is coming at it like a roughly a random pattern, even if, you know, over 10,000 trials,

862
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,480
it works out to be about 50 percent of the time. Man, you will just keep pressing that slot machine

863
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,360
button over and over and over again. And, you know, there are studies, there have been studies

864
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:51,560
done on mice where they would get a like a squirt of sugar water when they poke their nose in a box.

865
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:56,840
And if they did it at a variable reward schedule, they would do it. I can't remember the exact

866
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,760
number. I want to say it was like six thousand times in an hour or something, but it was it was,

867
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:06,920
you know, many, many times. And, you know, we laugh at it thinking about mice, but we're not that

868
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:11,160
different. The average slot machine player will press the button like 800 times in an hour. And

869
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:18,360
we're just basically, you know, doing the same thing. So that that variable reward, getting the

870
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,320
reward, but not knowing exactly when it's going to happen, it gets you to do it more frequently. And

871
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:28,360
you can think about examples like this in everyday life. Imagine a remote control where the battery

872
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,200
is dying and you press the power button, but it doesn't turn on right away. And you're like,

873
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,560
did that work? And you press it again a little harder than maybe pressing it a third time. Now,

874
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:40,120
if you do it, you know, eight or nine or 10 times, you're like, OK, the batteries are dead. But if on

875
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:45,560
the second try, it turns on the like the variable reward got you to do it again or got you to try

876
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:51,080
the behavior more. So, yeah, that that variable reward schedule is definitely something I can

877
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:56,920
intensify behavior. You remember Anchorman? I assume you've said, yeah, this might actually

878
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,840
mean that there is truth to the statement that 50 percent of the time it works every time.

879
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,960
Incredible reference. Yes. Fantastic. Little did we know that Will Ferrell was a

880
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,840
cognitive psychology fan. I think that was Paul Rudd's line, wasn't it?

881
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,400
When he was when he used Black Panther, the Cologne. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing.

882
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:23,000
Some of the time it works every time. I'm going to be honest with you. That smells like pure gasoline.

883
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,960
It's got bits of real panther in it. It's made by Odeon.

884
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:36,840
That movie. So, OK, so those are the four stages. And what I like to do and what I consider to be

885
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,640
the hallmark of like my work, you know, I am I'm just interpreting the research like, you know,

886
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:47,320
I'm just pretending to be an academic. I'm not actually an academic. And my I think the value

887
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:52,920
that I try to provide is to make these ideas actionable and to turn them into something that

888
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:58,840
we can operationalize or apply to daily life. And the four laws of behavior change are how I have

889
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:04,760
attempted to do that. So if we understand that a habit has those four steps, and how do we actually

890
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:10,440
change our behaviors, we can follow these four laws. And there's one for each stage. So the first

891
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:15,880
law of behavior change is to make it obvious, you want the cues of your good habits to be obvious,

892
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:22,440
available, visible, easy to see the the easier it is to see, or get your attention, the easier it is

893
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:28,680
to notice, the more likely you are to act on it. The second law is to make it attractive, the more

894
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:34,520
attractive or appealing or exciting a habit is, the more likely you are to feel motivated to do it.

895
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,160
Again, this is about anticipating it or something you you anticipate more feel more motivated.

896
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:46,520
The third law is to make it easy, the more easy, convenient, frictionless, simple a habit is,

897
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:51,960
the more likely behavior is to be performed. And then the fourth and final law is to make it

898
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:58,280
satisfying, the more satisfying or enjoyable, pleasurable a habit is, the more likely you are

899
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:04,200
to repeat it in the future. And so those four laws give you like a high level overview of how to

900
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:09,400
build a good habit. So make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying.

901
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,720
You don't need all four every single time. But the more that you have those four things working for

902
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:20,040
you, I think the more likely it is that the good behavior will stick or that you'll find a way to

903
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:27,160
start on it. If you want to break a bad habit, then you just invert those four. So rather than

904
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:32,360
making it obvious, you want to make the cue invisible, unsubscribe from emails, reduce

905
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:36,920
exposure to the queue. If you're trying to be on a diet, don't follow food bloggers on Instagram.

906
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,680
So just, you know, like reducing exposure to the thing that starts the process,

907
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:46,200
rather than making it attractive, make it unattractive, rather than making it easy,

908
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,920
make it difficult. So increase friction, put more steps between you and the behavior.

909
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,040
And rather than making it satisfying, make it unsatisfying, layer on some kind of immediate

910
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:02,520
consequence or cost to the behavior. And so those four make it invisible, make it unattractive,

911
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:09,000
make it difficult, make it unsatisfying, give you a high level framework for how to break a bad habit.

912
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,760
Now, how often is a certain behavior, the combination of breaking a habit and creating a

913
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,400
habit? Again, it seems like a lot of the ones we default into talking about are the hard ones like

914
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:25,320
nutrition. We all eat, we're all going to eat all the time. It's not something you can opt out of

915
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:31,560
or into. You just, you know, we all eat. So presumably if a person says, again, I hate coming

916
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,600
back to weight because it's such a stupid example relative to say overall health, but let's say

917
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:42,200
health, actually, I want to be a much healthier person. So I need to change the way I eat.

918
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:49,400
So those that's two things, right? You have to start eating better and stop eating poorer.

919
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:56,360
It is two things, but I view them as two sides of the same coin. In many cases, you know, we can come

920
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:01,080
up with edge cases or examples where, you know, like the behavior start to get more specific. But

921
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,240
you know, generally speaking, I think there are three ways to break a bad habit. You can eliminate

922
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:13,400
it entirely. So you can just go cold turkey, cut it out, never do it again. You could curtail the

923
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:18,120
behavior to the desired degree. So you can reduce it a little bit. You still do it sometimes, but,

924
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,640
you know, instead of drinking a beer at dinner every night, you just have it maybe once a week.

925
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:28,280
And then you could also replace it. So rather than, you know, you know, drinking a beer,

926
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:33,560
you replace it with water or whatever. Now, when I'm thinking about myself personally,

927
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:38,200
when I actually am changing behavior, I don't usually think about breaking bad habits that

928
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:44,120
often. In fact, most of the time I'm focused on building or establishing new good behaviors,

929
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:52,520
which necessarily displace the old ones. Like, for example, with eating, it is a bit of a zero

930
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,880
sum game. I mean, not entirely. I guess you could just keep eating more and more and more.

931
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,280
But generally, if you say I'm going to eat more good things, it kind of drives down the bad things.

932
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:07,960
Is that the way it normally works then? I think a lot of the time it does. And that's why I tend to

933
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:12,520
focus on that for my personal life is that it's kind of like two plants, you know, like one plant,

934
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,960
if it grows a little bit more and, you know, spreads its leaves a little further,

935
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,360
it starts to crowd out the other plant, you know, just soaks up more energy and resources in

936
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,160
sunlight. And your good habits are kind of like that. I mean, we all in some sense, it is zero

937
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,360
sum in the sense that we only have 24 hours in each day. And so, you know, if you have somebody

938
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:34,680
who says, even if they're unrelated habits, they say, hey, I want to start doing something healthy.

939
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,880
I'd like to start, you know, working out for an hour each day. And I also want to watch less TV.

940
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,440
I just feel like I watch Netflix too much. Well, you know, if you usually watch Netflix for three

941
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:50,760
hours each evening, and you decide to insert your workout from six to seven p.m. By definition,

942
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,080
you're not watching Netflix while you're doing that. And so, you know, you start to crowd out

943
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,880
the bad behavior just by focusing on building workout habit, even if you don't think about the

944
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:07,640
TV thing at all. So my sort of general approach is, look, I'm trying to spend my 24 hours in

945
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,280
the highest leverage way possible, the best way possible, the way that is, you know, moving me

946
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:17,640
toward whatever I'm optimizing for. And so let me just try to continually think about how to upgrade

947
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:23,000
those behaviors. I also like that mindset more than the breaking the bad habits one, because

948
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,800
it gives me a reason to improve even once I have good habits, you know, like I'm continually

949
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,880
looking for the higher leverage action, even if what I'm doing is already good. Okay, fine. How

950
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:38,680
can I make it great now? And so I tend to focus on that style rather than thinking about breaking

951
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:44,040
bad ones. But they definitely are related to answer your question. And I guess like the example that

952
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:49,160
we come back to is smoking. So it's hard to think of because smoking doesn't really take that much

953
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:53,880
time. So it's hard to say I'm just going to introduce a new habit that will force smoking out.

954
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:59,720
Are there other examples, though, of habits where you really do focus on how to break the bad one?

955
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:08,920
Yeah, so to take the smoking example, I think it's helpful to divide it into the specific

956
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:14,680
instances in which it happens. So, you know, we kind of lump smoking into a single habit. But the

957
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:18,840
truth is, it actually might be a collection of like a dozen habits throughout the day, it might be

958
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,480
that you have a habit of smoking when you get in your car for the morning commute. And then you

959
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:28,120
also have a habit of smoking around 1030 when you take a break with your coworker. And then you also

960
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:34,120
have a habit of smoking, you know, after dinner on your porch. And all three of those are going to

961
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,800
have their own cue craving, response and reward. And so you in a sense, you kind of have to intervene

962
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:45,080
in like 12 different places to try to come up with a solution for each one of those. So you might find

963
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:51,160
that like, for the morning commute, maybe instead of having a cigarette, you know, you come up with

964
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:55,400
something else that you can do on the morning commute while you're that fulfills that, you know,

965
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,880
that desire, maybe, maybe even just a cup of coffee is what wakes you up instead of a cigarette.

966
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:05,640
But that may not work for the 1030 session with your friend, maybe there you actually need like

967
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:10,840
an e-cigarette to start, because you want to have the socialization of feeling like you're smoking

968
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,800
with a friend. So you may need to like kind of take it in different stages and break it down

969
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,240
to a more degree where it's easier to have a line of attack.

970
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:25,560
The environment seems to be so potent. You know, again, David Foster Wallace writes about

971
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:31,080
when in his commencement speech, this is water. He talks about the ubiquity of water and also the

972
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:35,800
fact that you don't even realize it's there. And that's what makes it so profound, right? Is the

973
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,440
referring to certain thoughts. But I think the same is true of these cues, right? I mean, we,

974
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,920
for most of us, we, we're not actually that aware of what it is, you know, it can be pointed out to

975
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,040
you and you can say, Oh yeah, come to think of it. I am a fish swimming in water or yeah,

976
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:57,240
I come to think of it every time I get in the car, it's the act of getting in the car and driving to

977
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:04,440
work that signals a change in my where I'm going. And that's what forces me to light up. But, you

978
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,880
know, the example of having the cigarette at 1030 with your coworker is a very powerful one because

979
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:17,640
of the connection in the environment. And I remember in my residency when people would

980
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:22,280
come into the hospital with abscesses from IV drug use. So very, you know, in Baltimore,

981
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:28,200
which is right in my residency, there was, you know, just rampant IV drug use. And you'd be amazed

982
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:33,880
at how much that habit and that addiction could cause a person to do something that at the surface

983
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:39,240
doesn't seem that logical, you know, use dirty needles and needles would break in their abscesses.

984
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:45,720
And so you'd be down there and you'd be sort of draining a huge baseball size pus filled abscess

985
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:50,200
that's got broken needles in it. And this person is very sick. I mean, this is a person who's now

986
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:55,240
risking their life due to this and they would be back in a month with the same thing in a month,

987
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,680
in a month later, the same thing over and over again. And tragically, eventually a lot of people

988
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:03,640
would die. But I remember at some point saying to these folks, this was the best advice I could

989
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:09,480
offer, which was not very helpful, was I don't think you can go back to the same place you live.

990
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:16,040
Like, I think you need new friends. Now, that's not a very helpful thing to offer somebody who

991
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:21,080
probably doesn't have many choices. But the point was like, how could you expect this person to go

992
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:26,440
back to the same place that they were living in the same environment with all of the same people

993
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:31,000
doing the same things and say, well, you just got to resist it. It doesn't make sense, right? You,

994
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:37,960
you know, presumably someone who decides they want to stop drinking alcohol really ought not go into

995
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:43,800
a bar that much anymore. Despite unless your environment is like a form of gravity. Yeah,

996
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:49,400
you know, like it just pulls on you and you can resist it for a little bit. But, you know, maybe

997
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,840
a day or week or a month, but at some point, it just starts to drain on you and, you know, sucks

998
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:00,600
you back in. And to your point about, you know, going back to this environment that prompted the

999
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,440
behavior in the first place. I mean, this is one of the stories I share in Atomic Habits, but it was

1000
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,000
the surprise that we saw from the Vietnam War, which is so many soldiers were getting addicted

1001
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,560
to heroin and drugs when they were over there. And then they came back and we were like, what are we

1002
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,760
going to do with all these addicted soldiers? And it turns out that 90% of them or more

1003
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:23,320
ended up being fine because they didn't go back to the place where they got addicted. They went

1004
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:28,680
home to their friends and family and like they didn't have all the same signals that were

1005
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,080
prompting them to pick up the habit. And so they were able to drop it much more easily than we

1006
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:38,440
thought they would and compare that to the typical drug addict who does the reverse. They go into

1007
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:46,120
rehab and that's where they leave all of their cues and influences behind. And then we, you know,

1008
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:50,040
once they get clean and they detox, we send them back to the same place where they got addicted

1009
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:57,640
before. And that is a much, much harder uphill battle. So environment, I think it's kind of like

1010
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:02,280
the invisible hand that drives our behavior. I mean, we, as you said, it's kind of like water,

1011
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:07,720
you know, fish in water, we don't realize it. But we all have these things that we say are important

1012
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,960
to us. Oh, I would like to lose weight, or I'd like to build a business, or I want to finish a book.

1013
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:18,520
But then you look around the spaces where we live and work. And the cues of those habits are not a

1014
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:26,840
big part of the environment. And, you know, we all are busy, strapped for time, you know,

1015
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:32,920
minimal energy, we have kids to take care of, or parents to do chores for, or friends to see.

1016
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:39,560
And whenever we have limited capacity, or limited time, or we're low on energy, or exhausted,

1017
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,440
what choice do we make? We often choose the thing that is most obvious in the environment,

1018
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:50,120
we choose the thing that is the easy choice or the path of least resistance. And so, you know,

1019
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:55,720
if I'm recommending a place to start for changing behavior, it's usually either the first law or the

1020
01:33:55,720 --> 01:34:00,200
third law, it's making it obvious and making it easy. Because, you know, we can talk about making

1021
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,760
it easy, but scaling habits down, obviously makes it more likely that you're able to complete the

1022
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:11,080
task. And making it obvious, essentially creates an environment where the good choices are right in

1023
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:17,240
front of you, where the path of least resistance. And individually, I think it's easy to overlook

1024
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:22,440
the importance of this, because individually, one change to the environment does not usually

1025
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:27,800
meaningfully move the needle or change your behavior. But collectively, making a dozen,

1026
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:32,600
or two dozen, or 50 little choices to how your office is laid out, and how your living room is

1027
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,920
laid out, and how your kitchen is laid out. Yeah, now all of a sudden, you're working and thriving

1028
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:43,160
in a space that is stacking the odds in your favor. That's making it more likely that you will

1029
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:47,640
just choose the good thing because the healthy food is on the counter. And the TV is behind a

1030
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:52,360
wall unit and a cabinet where you're less likely to see it. And the remote control is inside a

1031
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:56,840
drawer and there's a book in its place. And you have a couple books that are scattered around in

1032
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,680
your desk waiting for you to pick them up and open them. You can do it with digital spaces too,

1033
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:07,400
like when I wanted to start reading more, I took audible for audiobooks and I moved it to the

1034
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:12,440
home screen on my phone and took all the other apps and moved them to the second screen. That's

1035
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:17,560
a very small thing and it doesn't guarantee the behavior, but it's another way to stack the odds

1036
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:22,520
in my favor that whenever I open up my phone, I'm reminded to listen to an audiobook for a few

1037
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:27,480
minutes rather than browse Instagram. And the more that you do those kinds of things,

1038
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:33,560
the more likely good behaviors are to arise. So one thing I want to park for later once we

1039
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:40,760
get through the laws is a very specific question around the challenges that some people face and

1040
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,800
that they don't control their environment. And again, I come back to food because I think for

1041
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:50,360
most of my patients and for myself, food is such a struggle because again, it's always around us.

1042
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,640
You have to do it. It's not a behavior you can just opt out of. And I think those of us that

1043
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:00,440
have kids, not to throw our kids under the bus, but I haven't met too many people who's eating

1044
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:05,800
habits get better once they have kids. If they're generally inclined to be healthy people, because

1045
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:13,480
at some point you sort of start losing the battle of how much non-crap you can have in the house due

1046
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,840
to time constraints and the other constraints, which is look, kids are going to eat things that

1047
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:26,120
are probably not so bad for them, but I shouldn't be eating. And, you know, wheat thins, my kids

1048
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,960
love wheat thins. I love wheat thins. I think the difference is they can get away with eating a lot

1049
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:37,640
more wheat thins than I can. So I've lost the wheat thin battle. Like we have a pantry that is

1050
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:41,800
full of wheat thins and I'm never, at least for the foreseeable future, going to get those wheat

1051
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:46,280
thins out of there. So now every time I walk in the pantry, I'm staring down the barrel of wheat

1052
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:51,160
thins and I would love to get those wheat thins in the trash. But every time I do, my wife says,

1053
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:56,200
understandably, hey, if you want to be in charge of feeding the kids every meal, knock yourself out,

1054
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:01,560
chef. But if you're not, let me handle food and our kids eat well, but they're going to eat wheat

1055
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,400
thins and a few other things that you don't want to eat. Isn't it kind of fascinating? Like, you know,

1056
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,720
I mean, you're someone that I think most people would describe as disciplined and high performing

1057
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:13,160
and, you know, talented and skilled. And you like look at yourself with that and you're like, wheat

1058
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:18,360
thins beat me every time. You know, it's like I think about myself. I was doing an interview

1059
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:22,840
with somebody else a couple of weeks ago and he was joking about how the number of cookies he can

1060
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:29,480
eat is either zero or 30 because if they're there, then he's going to eat them all. And I'm exactly

1061
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:36,440
that way. One of the best hacks that we've come up with is I love chocolate chip cookies and my wife

1062
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:41,320
will make them, but she'll like make the balls of dough and then freeze them and put them in the

1063
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:46,760
freezer. And at night after dinner, we'll take them out and just take out two and put them on the

1064
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:51,480
pan and warm up the oven and put them in. And it's actually a better experience because you get to

1065
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:56,760
eat like fresh baked warm chocolate chip cookies, but you'll only eat two because all the rest of

1066
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:01,800
them are frozen. And it's just enough friction to know that this is going to take another 15 minutes

1067
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:05,160
if I want to take two more out and heat them up. And you're like, I don't actually need another

1068
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:10,600
cookie like I just want to. But what limits you from putting five on the on the on the on the tray?

1069
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:15,800
Great question. We just haven't gotten in the habit of doing that. So hopefully this that

1070
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,200
question will wreck my psyche and now we'll be doing that every night. But it's part of that,

1071
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:24,600
the accountability though between you that like probably you say I want to at least she's going to

1072
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:32,520
say she'd be like, come on. Yeah, for sure. And I think we've seen that we've seen it's interesting

1073
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,080
the ways in which there's a whole discussion we can have about habits and marriage and like

1074
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:41,240
relationships and how that influences things because you soak up each person soaks up a little

1075
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:46,920
bit of the other partner. But we've seen it work in a very positive way for training, which is

1076
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,520
there are going to be some days where I just like don't feel like working out after, you know,

1077
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,600
full day at work. But she's like, all right, we're going to go to the gym. And, you know, then I'm

1078
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,920
like, okay, I'll change, you know, and then other days I'm like, okay, I'm ready. And she's like,

1079
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:04,200
all right, you know, and she didn't feel like it. And that's really helpful for the long term

1080
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,760
consistency. But I've talked to other couples who have said, you know, my nutrition habits

1081
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,760
actually got worse because like one day I won't feel like cooking. I'll be like, hey, can we just

1082
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,520
order out and she'll be like, okay, fine. And then the other day she won't feel like cooking like,

1083
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:21,240
hey, why don't we pick up something from and you're like, okay, fine. And so you can see how

1084
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:28,760
it goes in both directions. And I don't I don't have a good way to describe these kind of upward

1085
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:35,000
and downward spirals that we often get into where the momentum once it's moving in that

1086
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,840
direction, you just kind of like it becomes your default behavior and you just sort of keep rolling

1087
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:45,320
with it. But that there's something very powerful about that in life, that if you get on a nice

1088
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:49,640
trajectory, and you got a good spiral working for you, then that momentum just kind of carries you.

1089
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:55,800
And if you start to get in a downward spiral, you really got to find a way to just reverse course

1090
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:00,040
and gain a foothold, even if it's a really small thing, just to get the momentum moving in the

1091
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:04,520
other direction. But anyway, well, there are a lot of that. And that's actually something I feel like

1092
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:13,480
I've, I've also noticed with my patients and myself, which is it seems that the people who are able to

1093
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:23,640
be more self forgiving, when they slip up and get back on course, have an easier time than people

1094
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:29,720
who approach it through a very perfectionistic lens. And once they make a mistake, they get into

1095
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:37,000
the cycle of self judgment, and beating themselves up. And I say them like it's me too, right? We all

1096
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:44,760
do this. Sure. And all of a sudden, a blown meal turns into, well, forget if the day's over, I mean,

1097
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,000
I've screwed this day up. So I'm just gonna eat whatever I want. And then you wake up the next day,

1098
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,880
and you probably feel like crap, both physically and emotionally. And that reduces your drive to

1099
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:02,360
continue to do what you set out to do. And you sort of you just you have the spirals. And you make a

1100
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:05,880
point about that in the book, right? Which is don't, you know, if you're gonna miss a workout,

1101
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:10,600
miss a workout, but don't miss two. Yeah, yeah, never miss twice is the idea that I try to the

1102
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:15,640
little mantra I try to tell myself, you know, it's like, okay, stuck to the diet for nine days,

1103
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:22,120
binge ate a pizza on the 10th day. Well, wish I hadn't happened, but never miss twice. So let's

1104
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:28,920
make sure the next meal is a healthy one. And, you know, I think we all know this, it kind of

1105
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,800
implicitly from going through life, but it's easy to forget in the moment, which is, it's rarely the

1106
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,720
first mistake that ruins you, you know, it's like usually the spiral of repeated mistakes that

1107
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:42,680
follows. That's the real problem. It's like letting slipping up become a new habit. That's

1108
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:47,160
the real issue. And if you can cut that off at the source, if you can never miss twice,

1109
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:52,120
then you know, you get to the end of the year, and those mistakes are just like a little blip on the

1110
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:57,720
radar. But it's really about getting back on track quickly. And I think actually you see this with

1111
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:01,480
top performers in many different industries, like, you know, think about any athlete. I mean,

1112
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:06,760
this is something that like Nick Saban's teams at Alabama pride themselves on the screw up a play

1113
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:12,200
or have a bad drive, throw interception for a touchdown or something. But the focus is on the

1114
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:17,800
very next play. And I'm making sure that you don't let that mistake become another mistake.

1115
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,280
And the teams and the athletes that are really good at doing that and having a short memory and

1116
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:28,440
getting right back on track, they end up having, you know, really successful careers. And you can

1117
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:33,400
scale that down to your own life. Gretchen Rubin actually has this, I thought was a clever little

1118
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:39,240
idea, which is divide the day into four quarters. So you got like morning, afternoon, dinner and

1119
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:45,000
night or evening and night. And if you make a mistake, keep it contained to that quarter.

1120
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,440
So, you know, you don't lose the day, you just lose the quarter. And then the next one,

1121
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:53,560
you get back on track. And if you can, you know, keep your failures small like that,

1122
01:42:53,560 --> 01:43:00,040
if you can contain the damage, then I just think it's easier to get back on track quickly and to

1123
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:04,040
maintain the momentum, build consistency, all the other positive benefits that we've talked about.

1124
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,440
And to your point about judging yourself or feeling guilty or, you know, turning this into

1125
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:15,320
some kind of like self berating session. Playing the victim never makes it better. You know,

1126
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:20,440
it never it doesn't make any of it easier. You can, I think generally in life, we all have things

1127
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:25,400
that happen to us. Some of them are, you know, some of them are terrible things. And you can be the

1128
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:32,280
victim. But I don't know that it ever benefits you to play the victim to accept that role. You know,

1129
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,960
like bad things can happen to you. But that doesn't mean you have to start to identify

1130
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,440
as someone who is worthy of them or someone who is, you know, it's inevitable for that to be part

1131
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:48,120
of your story. And so the more that you can like cut the judgment out of it, cut the the guilt out

1132
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:53,560
of it, the story, the narrative piece and take that away and just accept the event for what it is

1133
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:57,480
and move on to the next instance that I think probably the better off you'll be.

1134
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:02,840
Yeah, this is probably an area where a habit that is probably desirable for many people also

1135
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,720
becomes a tool to help. And that's mindfulness meditation, which I think is one of the more

1136
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:15,320
powerful tools to help people observe the judgment without judging it, which sounds a bit, you know,

1137
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:21,240
odd to someone who hasn't practiced that. But that becomes very powerful. And it certainly made a

1138
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:29,240
difference as I've kind of released the need to be perfect, which doesn't mean again, that's just

1139
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:32,840
it's really a continuum. And there's there's a there's a spectrum of efficacy here, which is

1140
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:40,840
like on Monday, we traveled the whole day and we got back and I really wanted to work out, you know,

1141
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:46,520
I just hate ever missing a workout. But the reality is once we got home and the kids were exhausted

1142
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:52,280
and my wife was tired and it just felt like sort of a schmucky thing to do to go and work out and

1143
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:57,240
leave her with decompensating kids and a whole bunch of stuff that needed to be unpacked. And

1144
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:02,440
actually part of the judgment was letting go of that, letting go of the fact that I wasn't going

1145
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:08,600
to work out that day and that was okay. Now that's, you know, you can do that on anything, I think,

1146
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:13,560
if you can come to be flexible and say, you know what, you're stuck in the airport with your kids,

1147
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:21,640
the food sucks. It is what it is today and you're not horrible because of it. But I think this idea

1148
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:27,960
of get back on the horse as quickly as possible is is really powerful. Again, anecdotally,

1149
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,360
always bring everything back to driving a race car. It is so rare that you make a mistake

1150
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:38,360
and crash in a car because of what you did at that moment and not because of what happened

1151
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:45,080
earlier. So, you know, if you spin at corner four, the mistake usually started at corner two.

1152
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:49,960
And sometimes you don't realize it and sometimes you do realize it, but you

1153
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:55,000
arrogantly think that you don't have to make any adjustment going forward because of it. At least

1154
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:01,320
for me, that's been an incredible, incredibly humbling experience with how, you know,

1155
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:08,600
mistakes compound. Rapid course correction is probably a deep, like deeply applicable

1156
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:14,040
lesson for many areas of life. You know, I mean, the world is complex and situations evolve. Life

1157
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:20,280
is dynamic. It's not static and your preferences also evolve. What you optimize for or want is

1158
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:24,440
different today than it was 10 years ago and probably will be different five years from now

1159
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:31,800
or 10 years from now. And given that many changing dynamics, it's not possible for someone to predict

1160
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:37,960
the optimal course of action. And even if you could, it is very unlikely that it will remain

1161
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:43,240
the optimal course of action. So given that things are going to be changing, you're going to be off

1162
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:49,720
course at some point and the ability to correct for that and to correct for that quickly. I mean,

1163
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:55,720
it might be one of the all optimal life skills, you know, the ability to assess where you are in

1164
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:01,000
the moment, see what the next step is going to be, keep in mind where you ultimately want to go

1165
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:09,160
and then correct as needed is possibly the path to like living a great life. I heard recently this,

1166
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:16,040
I thought it was a great little framework, which is a BZ came from Sean Pury. He's a entrepreneur

1167
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:22,600
and basically said you need to know your ABCs. A is where you are right now. It's like the truth of

1168
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:28,920
the situation, the reality. B is your next step. And Z is where you want to go. Ultimately, it's

1169
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:34,520
where you want to end up. And I think the key, this is me talking now and not him. For me, the

1170
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:39,960
key is working backwards. It's knowing Z first, knowing what you're optimizing for. And then

1171
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:45,080
jumping back to a and being honest about the situation, what is the truth of the situation?

1172
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:49,240
What are the resources I have, the skills I have? What are my strengths? What are my weaknesses?

1173
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:55,000
What's reality say? And then knowing that I want to head towards Z and knowing honestly where I am

1174
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,680
today, what's the next step? I actually don't need to know see through why right now. I don't need to

1175
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:04,600
have the whole thing planned out perfectly, but I do need to make sure that my next step is

1176
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:10,520
directionally correct. And if it is, then you can just keep running that ABC process over and over

1177
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:15,160
again until you finally get there. Yeah. Any Duke talks about this in a slightly different way. And

1178
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:21,400
she refers to it as back casting. And I find it to be an incredibly powerful tool again, to be

1179
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:25,240
contrasted with forecasting, right? Forecasting is I'm just going to stand here and I'm going to tell

1180
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:30,760
you I got to do B and then C and then as opposed to saying, no, this is where I am. That's the

1181
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:35,320
desired outcome. Let's start working the steps backwards. This is what you've described is

1182
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:40,520
slightly different, but I think it preserves this idea of taking stock of where you are. And most

1183
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:45,800
importantly, understanding where you need to be and not trying to do what I think stochastically

1184
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:50,200
is really hard, but predict every step going forward. Yeah. The only thing I'll add to that,

1185
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:54,680
which I like Annie's framework and I think working backwards is it's a really powerful thing,

1186
01:48:54,680 --> 01:49:01,960
particularly if you can not be your own bottleneck in the process. A lot of people,

1187
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:06,680
the phrase I like is work backwards from magic. So, you know, what would the magical outcome be?

1188
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:11,000
What would the ideal outcome be? And then let me work backwards from that. And a lot of people have

1189
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,560
trouble with that brainstorming part of the process because they think, well, if it's unrealistic,

1190
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:19,480
why would I even try? And the point is like, listen, it's way too early for that. You know,

1191
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:25,160
like most people, most people become their own bottleneck long before reality prevents them from

1192
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:29,400
doing it, which is kind of this great irony. We're like, oh, you know, why would I attempt this like

1193
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,840
super impossible thing? And it's like, well, the world hasn't even told you it's impossible yet.

1194
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:40,520
You have. So I think work backwards from the magical outcome. But my key is I want to be very

1195
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:45,800
clear about where I'm going, but very flexible about how I get there. So I don't need it to

1196
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:50,520
happen if I work backwards. I don't need it to happen only through that chain of potential,

1197
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:54,840
that potential path, because if you can only have one way to get there, you're actually kind of

1198
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:00,680
brittle and you become hostage to the, you know, things working exactly in that way. But if I know

1199
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:04,360
where I want to get to the very clear vision, I'm flexible in how I get there. Well, now I can start

1200
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:09,240
to spring on opportunities as they arise and just take whatever the most fruitful path seems to be.

1201
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:14,680
But I do think that that whole process starts with working backwards. So it's a, I think,

1202
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:18,280
a more fruitful way to think about where you want to go than just trying to predict.

1203
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:24,920
Before we leave the first law, what advice do you offer for people if they aren't quite clear

1204
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:32,760
what the cues are? Again, in the spirit of trying to even displace, you know,

1205
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,400
a habit that's maladaptive and create new ones. Again, is this something that's just empirical,

1206
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:42,440
or is it, is it, are there, are there, I hate to use the word, but are there tricks for

1207
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:47,880
identifying what the cues are? Yeah, no, I think there are exercises or strategies you can use. So

1208
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:54,120
it's a good question. And I think you sort of hinted at this a few minutes ago, and I meant to

1209
01:50:54,120 --> 01:51:00,200
say it, but I forgot, which is the process of behavior change, like strategically changing

1210
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,880
your behavior, that, you know, we need to make a separation here, a distinction between the types

1211
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:10,440
of behavior change, because people change their behavior all the time. We're always responding

1212
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:14,600
to the situation we're in, or the circumstance or the conversation we're having. This is like one

1213
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:19,080
of the great myths about behavior change, which is behavior change is hard. Actually, it's one of

1214
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:23,720
the easiest things that you do, like your brain is designed to change your behavior to match the

1215
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:28,520
situation that you're in. So you're, you're making adjustments all the time. The question is, can you

1216
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:35,000
reliably change your behavior? Can you design your behavior in a fashion that you want?

1217
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,480
And if you want to design it, if you want to be in control of it more, I think it almost always

1218
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:43,160
starts with the process of self-awareness. And that's kind of what this question is getting at.

1219
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:48,120
Hey, I don't even know what the cues are. I don't even know what my habits are. So the two exercises

1220
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:53,000
I recommend the first one I call the habit scorecard, and you just go through your day,

1221
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,720
and you list out every habit that you already do, and try to get as detailed as possible. So usually

1222
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:02,760
there's a big lump in the beginning, like, I wake up, I take a shower, I step on the scale, I brush

1223
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:06,600
my teeth, I go to the bathroom, I get dressed, like there's all this stuff that you do to start

1224
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:11,240
your day. And then there's, you know, things for breakfast and starting a workday and on and on and

1225
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:17,320
on. And the more that you have that list, you're again, the goal is not to judge yourself. It's

1226
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:21,960
almost like you're at the zoo looking at animals, and you're, you're one of the animals, it's like,

1227
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:25,400
oh, how interesting that they would do that, you know, like just kind of, you're just trying to get

1228
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:30,040
a lay of the land and see how do I actually spend my time? What habits am I actually doing if I'm

1229
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:34,680
being honest about it? And then the second, so that's just to understand what habits you have.

1230
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:40,600
To figure out what the queue is, there's a just basically, you're just asking like five questions,

1231
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:45,400
who, what, when, where, why, you know, you're essentially just trying to get a lay of, you know,

1232
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:49,720
what's going on. So let's say that you're like, man, I eat a lot of candy bars, but I don't know

1233
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:55,000
why I do it. I don't know what the queue is. Well, each time that you find yourself eating a candy bar,

1234
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
just pull up a note on your phone or have an index card or a notebook or whatever somewhere

1235
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,960
to record it, write down what time is it? Where are you at right now? What's the what's the context?

1236
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:07,880
What's the environment? Who are you around? Are you near the, do you eat these by the same kind of

1237
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:12,680
people? What were you doing just before this? You know, was it a break from writing emails or,

1238
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:17,080
you know, doing something else? And the more that you start to answer those questions about the

1239
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:21,240
context, the better you'll, you'll start to understand, Hey, maybe that was the queue.

1240
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:26,360
And I bet if you do that exercise for whatever the particular habit is that you're working on,

1241
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:30,280
just do that for, you may not even need to do it for a week, but if you do it for five days or

1242
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:34,600
seven days or something, you're going to start to develop a good sense for what it is that's

1243
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:41,160
prompting the behavior. Yeah, that's, that's a great exercise. And I mean, is there any concern

1244
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:45,000
that when a person does that, that the Hawthorne effect kicks in and they basically start

1245
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:51,320
deviating from the natural behavior because of the observation? In other words, is the act of

1246
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:56,760
going through this exercise potentially, uh, making it harder for them to transparently see what's

1247
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:02,520
happening? Um, maybe I think it's, uh, I, I, sir, I'm not going to say it's not a risk. I'm sure it's,

1248
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:08,440
it's a possible risk, but, um, I think what's more likely to happen is rather than not being able to

1249
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:12,440
see what's going on, assuming you're being honest with yourself, I mean, you know, it's, it's,

1250
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:17,880
it can be hard to honestly observe your own behavior. You know, we have a lot of biases

1251
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:21,880
and stories for why we do what we do. So, but assuming you're doing that to the best degree

1252
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:25,800
possible, I think you're probably still going to get a good idea of what the Q is.

1253
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:30,520
What I think is more likely to happen if there is some influence on your behavior

1254
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:35,240
is you may find yourself changing the behavior anyway, uh, just because you're tracking it.

1255
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:39,000
And there are quite a few studies that show this, like with nutrition, for example, there are some

1256
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,640
studies about food journaling, people who just keep a food journal. They're not even trying to

1257
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:49,080
stick to a certain calorie level or a certain macro profile or anything. They just are tracking

1258
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:54,600
what they're eating tend to change their eating habits and eat less just because they're tracking

1259
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:58,920
it. Even if they don't have a specific program, they're trying to follow. So the mere act of

1260
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:04,920
observing something or measuring something often changes the behavior associated with it. And you

1261
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:08,360
may find that to be the case here. You're like, well, I keep writing now when I have candy bars.

1262
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:13,240
So I'm like, maybe I'll skip this one. Um, and I think that's probably the more likely outcome,

1263
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:18,040
but, uh, who knows there could be other biases as well. Yeah. I, uh, these devices here,

1264
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:24,360
these continuous glucose monitors, they, they are a remarkable tool for both insight. Cause it,

1265
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,880
you know, when you first put them on, you're sort of learning, Oh my God, like I didn't realize eating

1266
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:33,160
that thing would have this response in my glucose. But once you sort of saturate the insight part of

1267
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:37,960
that equation, which can be three months, six months, depending on the complexity of your,

1268
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:45,160
your life, it becomes forever a behavioral tool. You sort of, you know, you don't want to eat a

1269
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:49,160
certain thing if it's going to raise your glucose, because you've at least bought into the thesis

1270
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:54,840
that you don't want to have your glucose skyrocket the way it does when you eat M and M's. So, uh,

1271
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:59,400
it's interesting. It becomes kind of an accountability partner. And I, and I find some of the most

1272
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:05,880
interesting and sticky devices do that, right? The wearables that offer an insight that's not obvious

1273
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:13,160
that, but as objective tend to be the things that we really like coming back to. Whereas the ones

1274
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,920
that are kind of obvious, like how many steps you take that doesn't, that's not very sticky because

1275
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:22,120
we sort of have an intuitive sense for what that is. Like everybody, once they've, you know,

1276
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:25,800
spent enough time walking 10,000 steps a day, they don't really need a device to tell them that

1277
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:31,000
anymore. It becomes easier to do on their own. It's interesting. I have this kind of, this is a

1278
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:38,440
side comment, but I have this like theory about technology and innovation. Um, and that the way

1279
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:43,240
in which we, the technologies that most radically change the world or change our behavior

1280
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:47,960
are all just kind of different forms of vision. So like, you know, you have obvious examples like

1281
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:53,720
x-rays, which, you know, allow you to see the broken bone or, um, you know, uh, MRIs or whatever

1282
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:57,800
that allow you to see some tissue in a way that you couldn't see before. And so that gives you

1283
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:02,040
information that then you can act on and make a diagnosis and, you know, uh, make some kind of,

1284
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:07,320
uh, change. But the glucose monitors, like another example, it's just like, now you can see the spike,

1285
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:12,360
you know, see in a very broad sense. Um, and because you can see it, uh, you change your

1286
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:17,720
behavior. Um, and you know, even stuff like the number of email subscribers to my website, you

1287
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:23,080
know, because, uh, my email platform tracks that and I can see how many people are signing up each

1288
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:29,080
day, I make a change to the form and, you know, conversion and so on. And, um, I do think there's

1289
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:35,320
some deeper lesson there about behavior change and about what drives a human behavior, which is if

1290
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:40,680
you can visualize your progress in some way, maybe it's a chart on a screen, maybe it's, you know,

1291
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:44,600
an actual printout, uh, maybe it's something that you actually see like, you know, looking through

1292
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:50,200
lenses or something, but if you can actually visualize it, then the behavior often follows suit.

1293
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:55,080
And that's why even simple strategies like a habit tracker where you just put an X on each day

1294
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:01,960
seems very, um, rudimentary, very basic, but it can still be meaningful because it gives you a way

1295
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,400
of visualizing your progress. Yeah. This idea of what gets measured gets managed is, is, is, is a

1296
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:14,440
great tool. Um, about six months ago, I started going to the water meter of our house every Tuesday

1297
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:19,160
and recording it. And then I've got a little spreadsheet that says, okay, this is how many

1298
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:24,440
gallons we've used this week. This is what it would project to for a monthly usage, et cetera, et cetera.

1299
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:29,880
And you just can't believe how much our water usage has come down in six months. Because I mean,

1300
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:35,080
again, in Texas, water is not that expensive actually compared to California, but just

1301
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:38,600
it became something I was obsessed with, which is like, we're not going to waste any water. Like,

1302
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:42,520
I just don't want to waste any water. And it's now become a game for me. It drives my family nuts,

1303
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:49,400
but it is a game. Like we are going to have the lowest water bill ever in Austin. No one is going

1304
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:55,480
to use less water than us. And I, I mean, I'm obsessed with that spreadsheet. It's kind of like

1305
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:59,720
an adult version of I spy, you know, you like walk in, you're like, I spy the red thing and then all

1306
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:03,480
the red stuff in the room lights up. And you're like, right now you're like, I spy water and

1307
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:08,760
everywhere I go is that's what I see. And you know, you find opportunities and you find ways to

1308
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:13,560
to change it. Oh yeah. When I'm giving my kids a shower, like once I'm lathering them up the water,

1309
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,600
I got to turn the water off and they're like, daddy, why are you turning the water off? I'm like,

1310
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:20,360
because we're just putting soap on right now. You don't need the water. It's just, it drives

1311
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:26,840
everybody nuts, but what the hell? Okay. So let's talk about the second law.

1312
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:32,760
Yeah. So the second law is making it attractive. And I think there's a simple example I could

1313
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:37,800
give here, which is let's imagine that you wake up tomorrow and you're like, all right,

1314
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:42,280
I listened to this guy talk about habits all day today. So tomorrow's going to be the day I'm going

1315
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:49,880
to wake up and I'm going to go for a run. So you set your alarm for 6am and 6am rolls around,

1316
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:55,000
but your bed is warm and it's cold outside and you're like, well, I'll just press snooze and

1317
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,120
sleep in. Like maybe I'll do it tomorrow. But if you rewind the clock and come back to today

1318
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:04,680
and you text a friend and you say, Hey, you want to meet at the park at 615 and go for a run?

1319
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:11,000
Well, now 6am rolls around and your bed is still warm and still cold outside. But if you don't get

1320
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,280
up and go for a run, you're a jerk because you leave your friend at the park all alone.

1321
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,560
And so you've kind of simultaneously made it more attractive to get up and go for a run

1322
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:27,160
and less attractive to press snooze and sleep in. Now you haven't made the run itself any easier,

1323
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:31,000
like that's still going to be as difficult as it was before. So the habit, the difficulty is kind

1324
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,480
of the same, but you have changed the calculus that's going on in your mind about like whether

1325
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:40,120
you should do this or not, or how attractive it seems. So, you know, there are a bunch of examples,

1326
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:43,880
strategies like that and stuff I talked about in the book and that you could use to kind of make

1327
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:49,000
habits seem more attractive than they otherwise are. But that's sort of what it comes down to on

1328
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,040
a short term basis for making habits attractive. On a long term basis, I think it's about what

1329
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:57,800
we've already discussed about the social environment and being part of a tribe or your

1330
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:03,960
desired behavior is the normal behavior because those behaviors become very attractive even a year

1331
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:07,800
or two or five from now, if they help signal that you're part of the tribe.

1332
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:12,360
Yeah, you brought up CrossFit earlier, but I always thought that CrossFit was one of the best

1333
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:17,560
examples of this. I never did CrossFit myself, you know, there's lots of criticisms of it, etc.

1334
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:23,960
But the reality of it is it was certainly it was and is something that really creates a community

1335
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:30,680
of people who have a certain belief about who they are and what they do. And again, for all the

1336
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:35,160
people who not CrossFit, I've seen it take a lot of very inactive people and turn them into some

1337
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:41,160
pretty impressive people. Yeah, I think the social side, the community side of it is the strongest

1338
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:47,480
piece of the whole thing. You know, it's the it's the part that's hardest for any other exercise

1339
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:53,000
program to replicate, that's for sure. And it does, it gets people to stick to it. I mean, it becomes,

1340
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:58,040
you know, it sounds extreme to call it a form of a religion, but it becomes kind of like that for

1341
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:01,880
them. I mean, the box is like their church in a lot of ways, you know, they go six days a week

1342
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:07,560
instead of one day a week. And so there, yeah, there are a lot of strong community elements there.

1343
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:12,680
You also see crossers pick up a bunch of habits they didn't even expect, like they thought they

1344
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:17,240
were going to start working out. But then six months later, they all are buying the same

1345
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:21,400
brand of knee sleeves, and they have a certain type of weightlifting shoe, and they're all eating

1346
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:26,040
paleo. And it was like, we didn't even plan on doing that stuff. I just was going to go to a gym

1347
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:32,760
to work out. But all of those are behaviors that signal what it means to be part of that group.

1348
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:36,440
And again, once you start to build friends in that group and start to, you know, become

1349
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:43,800
ingrained in that society here in that tribe, you start to soak up some of those other behaviors as

1350
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:49,640
well. Yeah, it's really a great example. I guess we'll go to the third and fourth law, but I want

1351
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:54,840
to take a step back and ask you where you put nudging into this, right? So Richard Thaler's

1352
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:59,080
book Nudge, which was probably the first book I ever read on this subject matter.

1353
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:06,760
I mean, it seems so obvious, which is what makes it so interesting and insightful, right? Sometimes

1354
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:11,400
the most brilliant things in retrospect seem so entirely obvious. But it was, I think reading

1355
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:16,520
Richard's book circa, I don't know, call it maybe 2012, it's probably nearly 10 years ago,

1356
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:22,120
that this idea of the default food environment sort of came to me. And I use that term with

1357
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:27,240
our patients as, you know, the more you can control your default food environment,

1358
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:31,560
the more healthy you can be, right? So if your default food environment sucks,

1359
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:36,680
you're going to be relying on willpower a lot. And that's really, really hard. If your default

1360
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:40,520
food environment is at one extreme end of the spectrum, you kind of have a perfect default food

1361
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:44,520
environment, and you could be the healthiest person in the world, even if it's not enjoyable.

1362
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:49,960
At some point, like if you were locked in a room and all you had were the best foods to eat,

1363
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,320
you're going to end up being healthy. And you're going to be kind of like, oh,

1364
02:03:53,320 --> 02:04:01,560
I eat one more macadamia nut and have one more avocado and salad. But, you know, nudging

1365
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:07,800
obviously refers to a cue, but it also refers to this environmental change. It doesn't seem to

1366
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:13,720
really capture the idea of making it attractive or does it? I think it's more about making it obvious.

1367
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:20,280
I would lump it more in the first law, design the environment to make the good habit the obvious one

1368
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:26,040
to make the good habit the path of least resistance. Some other nudges that are, you know,

1369
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:30,680
very popular people talk about is like default choices on, you know, forms or whatever. So,

1370
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:37,560
you know, the very famous example being the 401ks. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And 401ks also. Yeah,

1371
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:45,400
you know, so default opting in every employee to a 401k and making them opt out is a nudge. And I

1372
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:49,320
think that's also another example of making it obvious. Or we could also say making it easy.

1373
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:55,000
Yeah, sort of one in the nothing's easier than letting it ride. So all of those are examples to

1374
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:02,760
your point about about default food environment. Daria Rose, who writes a nutrition blog. She's got

1375
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:08,440
a great concept. I just like it. It's kind of sticky home, home court habits and away court habits.

1376
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:12,200
And, you know, the argument is like, try to optimize your home court habits first, you know,

1377
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:17,240
like what's what's the environment where it's your kitchen, it's your apartment, like you're,

1378
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:21,960
you know, you get to set the tone. And let's just try to prime all of that. Whatever happens at a

1379
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:26,200
restaurant or when you're at a hotel traveling or whatever, let's don't worry about that as much

1380
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:30,920
right now. Let's just optimize the home court. And I like that if you can build a home court advantage

1381
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:35,560
for yourself, then you get in a good, you know, situation, you start to build some momentum,

1382
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:40,360
you handle the thing that you're probably going to be doing 70% of the time or 80% of the time.

1383
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:44,600
And then after that, you can move on to the, you know, to the away court stuff. So one of the other

1384
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:50,360
things you talk about is the idea of accountability. It's come up now several times. And I think

1385
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:55,560
everybody would agree that the moment you have somebody else in this thing with you, the better

1386
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:02,840
it gets. Is there any evidence about the type of accountability partner? So an example you gave was

1387
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:08,680
your wife, great accountability partner for you guys to work out. Would that be more or less

1388
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:16,520
effective than if you were matched with a person who you didn't know, but who had similar aspirations

1389
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:25,800
where you'd be less comfortable and perhaps more inclined to hold yourself to a higher standard.

1390
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:31,720
Again, it kind of comes back to this idea of how we're wired to be, you know, seeking the approval

1391
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:35,320
of others and all those sorts of other things. Is there, is there any research to support this idea?

1392
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:41,800
Yeah, you know, I don't know of any studies that like distinguish clearly between those two. It's

1393
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:48,280
quite possible there are plenty out there. I just may not know of them. But man, I can see it working

1394
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:53,800
well on both sides. And I also see complexities on both sides. So a lot of the time when people

1395
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:58,760
talk about accountability partners, they join a Facebook group or they join a course or program

1396
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:03,960
or something and they get matched up the way that you described. But I can actually see that form of

1397
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:08,760
accountability kind of falling apart fairly quickly for a simple reason, which is it's a

1398
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:15,080
stranger and you don't really bear much cost for them, you know, thinking you did a bad job or you

1399
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:21,320
may not really value or care that much about their opinion. Compare that to the example I gave, you

1400
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:26,120
know, earlier, which is you walk outside and your neighbor sees that your lawn is very sloppy and

1401
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:31,000
you haven't mowed the grass in three weeks. That actually you may care pretty deeply about because

1402
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:34,200
you don't want to be judged by the other people in the neighborhood and you don't want to have

1403
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:39,000
friction with your neighbor and so on. And so there's much more of a cost there. And that form

1404
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,920
of accountability is a lot stronger because there's, you know, some reason why you really want to fall

1405
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:50,840
through on it. Now, you could say that that same thing is true for, you know, for example, a marriage

1406
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:54,760
or relationship is that, you know, I don't want to let my partner down. I don't want them to think

1407
02:07:54,760 --> 02:08:01,400
poorly of me and so on. But you have to remember in that particular case, you're so close that

1408
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:06,600
there are actually a lot of additional complexities there. Like you want to be fairly forgiving of

1409
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:10,840
your partner because you're living with them all the time. Or even if it's not someone you're

1410
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:15,800
married to, say it's, you know, your brother or your parents or whoever, like there's just a lot

1411
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:23,160
going on in those relationships. And so is the other person really going to become like an enemy

1412
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:29,080
just over you skipping your workout routine on Tuesday, because like you guys got to get dinner

1413
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:33,480
together on Wednesday night and you have to babysit their kids over the weekend. And like,

1414
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:38,920
there's a lot of other stuff that's involved there. And so in those cases, I think the

1415
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:44,840
relationships are so tight or so complex that that person may not actually want to be a strict

1416
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:49,960
accountability partner because of the other costs that they may need to bear. So you're kind of in

1417
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:55,640
this weird situation where you don't want there to be other things on the line that would influence

1418
02:08:55,640 --> 02:09:02,360
their ability to be to hold you accountable. But you do actually want to care about their opinion,

1419
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:07,640
and to bear some kind of cost if you don't follow through. Perhaps this is the reason why having

1420
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:13,160
like a coach is a good example, because that's somebody that presumably you want to do a good

1421
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:18,280
job because you're going to see them repeatedly. But even if it's not as dicey as the neighbor

1422
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:23,800
situation where like you do bear some social cost for it, you probably bear a financial cost

1423
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:27,080
because you may be paying your nutrition coats, you know, five hundred dollars or a thousand

1424
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:32,840
dollars or whatever. And the more that there's some kind of painful cost associated with it,

1425
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:38,040
probably the more that you're going to be willing to fall through on that accountability.

1426
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:44,280
And speaking of a coach, just more broadly, how does a coach or how do the best coaches,

1427
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:48,840
if you have insight into this, sort of thread the needle of

1428
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:54,840
creating accountability, but also creating encouragement when you fall short?

1429
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,200
Boy, that's a big question. And, you know, I'm not a coach. I've had I've been fortunate to have some

1430
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:06,680
good ones. And I've also had a bunch of, you know, mediocre ones, too. And thinking about the

1431
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:11,640
difference between them, there's just, you know, we could have a whole conversation about coaching

1432
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:16,440
and about the art of that, because there is a really fine balance there. And I think

1433
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:22,440
there also is a big difference in the I'm going to use athlete, but of course, you can have a coach

1434
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:27,480
for many things. But there's a big difference also in the intensity that the athlete might have. I

1435
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:32,680
mean, you know, you can imagine I so I was into Olympic weightlifting for a time and it was kind

1436
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:37,240
of the main way I was training. And I had the fortune of training with a really great team.

1437
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:42,360
I was very average, but, you know, Holly Mangold was on that team and she competed at the Olympic

1438
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:49,080
Games in London in 2012. And watching, just watching the interactions between the coaches

1439
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:54,920
and her and what was required for her to make it to the Olympics was interesting to see, you know,

1440
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:59,880
like there's there, there is every element of a tight relationship there. I mean, there's tough

1441
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:04,520
love and there's like, you know, actual love. And there are some days where you have to be really

1442
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:10,120
harsh and some days you have to be really soft. And there's all the dynamics of the athletes

1443
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:14,920
internal mindset. Like, you know, there are days when you go out and you feel like you're a world

1444
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:19,320
killer and like nobody can touch you. And then there are other days where you just feel completely

1445
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:25,160
broken and you're like, can I keep this training up for another six months? And so the the more

1446
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:29,880
intense the objective is that you're trying to achieve, I think the more detailed and balanced

1447
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:35,000
and nuanced all of that becomes, you know, and then you have like just your standard

1448
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,560
CrossFit coach who's coaching a 35 year old dad of two who just wants to get in better shape.

1449
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:45,320
And that I think may be, you know, a totally different relationship. So I don't know that I

1450
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:48,760
have a good answer there, but I do think it's a really important thing and that there are

1451
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:56,280
great coaches are incredibly valuable and they're rare by definition. That's why they're great.

1452
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:59,880
And it's probably much more complicated than a lot of us realize.

1453
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:05,080
So you said rule number one and rule number three were probably the most important rule.

1454
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:11,960
Number three is now make it easy. Yeah. So if I could only recommend like one thing, if I had,

1455
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:16,120
if you forced me to say, hey, where's the one place I would start, I would say start with this.

1456
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:20,520
You hate being asked that question, by the way, if you would just, uh, yeah, just because I mean,

1457
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:23,800
you know, like, you know how it is, you know, like if somebody said, what was the one thing

1458
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,760
I would do to get healthy? You'd be like, okay, come on. This is like a very big picture. You

1459
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:32,360
know, there's, there's a lot of stuff here. Um, and, uh, same, same story here. Like, you know,

1460
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:36,920
I do think this is a good place to start though. And so if I had to pick, I would say, follow the

1461
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:41,480
two minute rule, which says, take whatever habit you're trying to build and scale it down to

1462
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:47,800
somebody that takes two minutes or less to do. So read 30 books a year becomes read one page or

1463
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:53,960
do yoga four days a week becomes take out my yoga mat. And sometimes people hate that because

1464
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,360
they're like, okay, buddy, you know, like, I know I'm not actually just trying to take my yoga mat

1465
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:02,760
out. I know I'm actually trying to do the workout. So if this is some kind of mental trick and I know

1466
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:07,800
it's a trick, then like, why would I fall for it? Basically. And I get where people are coming from,

1467
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:13,640
but I have this reader, his name's Mitch and I mentioned him in atomic habits and, uh,

1468
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:17,720
he lost a ton of weight. Another guy, I think he lost definitely over 80 pounds. I think it was

1469
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:24,760
probably over a hundred and, um, kept it off for a long time. He, uh, he had this interesting rule

1470
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:29,960
for himself though, where when he went to the gym for the first six weeks, they started working out.

1471
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:35,160
He wasn't allowed to stay for longer than five minutes. So he'd get in the car, drive to the

1472
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:40,680
gym, get out, do half an exercise, get back in the car, drive home. And it sounds ridiculous.

1473
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:44,040
You know, it sounds silly. You're like, obviously this is not going to get the guy the results that

1474
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:50,600
he wants, but if you take a step back, what you realize is that he was mastering the art of showing

1475
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:55,320
up, you know, he was becoming the type of person that went to the gym four days a week, even if

1476
02:13:55,320 --> 02:14:02,120
it was only for five minutes. And I think this is like a deep truth about habits, something that

1477
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:07,720
we often overlook, which is a habit must be established before it can be improved. You know,

1478
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:11,960
it has to become the standard in your life before you can optimize and scale it up into something

1479
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:17,640
more. If you want, you can come up with a better theory. Like you could come up with a perfect plan,

1480
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:22,760
but unless you're acting on it, it doesn't do you any good. It's just a really good idea. And so,

1481
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:28,360
you know, for whatever reason, we get like really all or nothing about our habits. We tend to have

1482
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:32,600
this, this tendency to be like, well, if I can't do, you know, the full marathon training program,

1483
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:37,320
then why go for a run at all? Or if I can't, you know, follow through on the perfect, like lean

1484
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:43,720
startup business framework, then like, why bother starting a company? But I think, you know, the two

1485
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:48,280
minute rule kind of helps you get over that tendency of perfectionism and just start to master the art

1486
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:53,720
showing up, find a small way to establish the habit, make a part of your new normal. And then

1487
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:58,680
you can gain a little foothold and start to scale up and expand from there. It reminds me of that.

1488
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:02,520
There's that great quote from Ed Latimore, where he says the heaviest weight at the gym is the front

1489
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:07,960
door. And, you know, that's true for a lot of things in life. I mean, the hardest part is getting

1490
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:12,680
started. So let's master that and make it part of your lifestyle. And then once you're the kind of

1491
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:17,080
person who's showing up consistently, we have all kinds of options for how we can improve and optimize.

1492
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:23,640
And so on. I think meditation is another great place where that the two minute rule really helps.

1493
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:28,280
I think it can be really daunting the first time you decide for the first time, let's say you buy

1494
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:33,400
the idea that, hey, you know what, there's probably real value in this. I'd be better served

1495
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:37,800
to go on a silent retreat for seven days or meditate 40 minutes every day. It's like that's a

1496
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:45,000
real big step for someone who's never done it. How about two minutes every single day you meditate

1497
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,120
and, you know, maybe in a few weeks, it's three minutes a day. But yeah, you have to sort of lay

1498
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:55,880
down that track to say, A, I'm a person who meditates and B, this is the actual muscle memory

1499
02:15:55,960 --> 02:16:02,040
of what it looks like to sit down. It's also surprising how few people actually have two

1500
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:06,440
minutes in their day where they stop and do nothing except breathe. I mean, that that alone

1501
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:12,440
would deliver more value than you might expect. And there are a whole host of other behaviors that

1502
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:17,480
go along with this. You know, like you think meditating for two minutes sounds very small,

1503
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:22,280
but if you start to back out of it, you realize, oh, there's, you know, you got to pick a space.

1504
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:26,600
Where is it going to happen? What time of day is it going to occur? Is this something that you're

1505
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:31,240
going to do before work or after work? Do you do it on your lunch break? Are you going to like,

1506
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:35,160
try to do it with somebody to so you have a little bit of social accountability? Or is this just like

1507
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:38,920
a private thing that you're going to do in the corner? Do you need a pillow to sit on or you

1508
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:43,960
find a sit on the floor? Like what's your flexibility like? Are you going to get interrupted by your

1509
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:47,800
kids? If you do this at 7am, it might be nice to get it done in the morning. But is that when you're

1510
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:52,760
getting them ready for school and getting them dressed, there's like just a lot of little

1511
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:58,600
questions like that that people don't think about. And so finding a very small version of the habit

1512
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:03,400
allows you to get all of that other stuff kind of handled, figure out the logistics of it,

1513
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:07,480
and just to do it for a minute or two. And then once you get all that stuff handled,

1514
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:11,960
and you don't have to decide anymore, you have a little bit more mental capacity and energy

1515
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:16,040
to actually focus into, okay, let me scale this up a bit and do it maybe in the way that I was

1516
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:21,400
hoping I would. So how do you make them satisfying? Because that's the fourth ball.

1517
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:27,960
Yeah, so this is the final piece. And it's really about just making a habit that's pleasurable

1518
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:32,040
enough that you want to return to it, giving you some, you know, some reason, some emotional signal

1519
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,600
that hey, this is worth it. And there are a bunch of different ways you can do this, you know, some

1520
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,160
of them are short term, some of them are long term, like the short term stuff is mostly about

1521
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:46,600
reinforcement. So, you know, the classic examples are things like, Oh, you can reward yourself with

1522
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:51,240
a bubble bath or with ice cream or, you know, buying, you know, something that you wanted or

1523
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:57,000
whatever. I think the key with those short term reinforcements is you want to make sure that the

1524
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,600
reinforcement also aligns with the long term identity that you're trying to build. Right.

1525
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:07,320
Ice cream wouldn't be a great reward for learning, you know, getting in better shape.

1526
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:11,160
Yeah, right. Like you go to the gym and you do a workout and then you eat a bowl of ice cream.

1527
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:15,800
It's like, okay, you're casting boats for two different identities. Or let's say that you're

1528
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:18,920
trying to get your finances in order. And so you're like, Okay, I want to budget,

1529
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:23,960
you know, consistently and save money for retirement. Well, if you reward yourself with

1530
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:27,880
that by, you know, like buying a leather jacket, and it's kind of like, okay, on the one hand,

1531
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:32,280
you're trying to be a saver. On the other hand, you're being a spender. So I like to pick things

1532
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:37,640
that we feel like are aligned. So like in the in the fitness example, you could say, well,

1533
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:41,720
if I don't miss any workouts this week, then I'm going to reward myself with a bubble bath and kind

1534
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:46,360
of like an hour alone of peace and quiet on the weekend. And that's like a vote for taking care

1535
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:53,080
of your body. And so you know, that seems pretty aligned. Or if I if I save consistently for

1536
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:57,160
retirement this month, and I make a contribution each week, then at the end of the month, I'm going

1537
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:02,680
to reward myself with a hike in the woods. And that's like another example of, you know,

1538
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:08,120
a lifestyle of freedom and of controlling your time and you know, like having having financial

1539
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:13,080
control of you know, how you're spending your time. So anything that's that you feel like is

1540
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:17,400
aligned or reinforces that story you're trying to build, I think that can make a great immediate

1541
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:25,080
reinforcement. In the long run, the way to feel rewarded, the kind of ideal form of making it

1542
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:31,800
satisfying is when the behavior starts to feel like it reinforces your desired identity. So if

1543
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:36,920
if you're the kind of person who feels like, yeah, I'm the type of person who doesn't miss workouts,

1544
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:42,200
then in the middle of doing a set of squats, you can feel satisfied because you're being the kind

1545
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:46,360
of person you want to be. And so this comes back to kind of the point you made a little bit ago

1546
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:50,520
about I just don't want to miss a workout, like I kind of feel off, I feel like I'm not being

1547
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:56,040
myself if I miss. And so just getting the reps in that alone is it's satisfying in the moment.

1548
02:19:56,040 --> 02:20:00,680
And that's sort of the the ultimate version of making it satisfying, because you don't even

1549
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:04,280
need to wait for the reward. It's just it's happening as you're in the middle of performing

1550
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:11,560
the behavior. So make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying,

1551
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:15,960
those kind of those four laws and you know, the various ways to intervene and do that increase

1552
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:21,000
the odds that you're going to fall through on a good habit. Now, let's take a step back from all

1553
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:27,240
this when when someone picks up your book, presumably, there's a selection bias that exists,

1554
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:33,720
which is this is a person who either through luck or, you know, or through some recommendation or

1555
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:40,280
friend or whatever, has made a decision that they at least want to examine the habits in their lives

1556
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:48,760
and or potentially change them. What do we know or what can we extract from this about a scenario

1557
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:55,800
that's different, which is, you know, I'll use my example, like you have a patient who you're trying

1558
02:20:55,800 --> 02:21:02,680
to help and that, you know, helping that patient requires some intervention. They're going to have

1559
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:07,800
to make a change. Now, that change can be at one level really simple. I think the simplest change

1560
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:13,960
medicine has to offer is take a pill and there's a time and a place for pills. I kind of I think

1561
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:18,600
it's a bit silly when people assume that everything modern medicine has to offer is bad. Pills are bad.

1562
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:23,160
You know, obviously, that's not the case. So, you know, taking your medicine for your blood pressure,

1563
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:26,920
your cholesterol, these things, if it's warranted, that's a really important thing to do. And we

1564
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:31,080
also know, by the way, that even something as quote unquote simple as taking your medicine is

1565
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:34,760
actually really hard for a lot of people. Most people are I think studies demonstrate, you know,

1566
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:39,480
sort of in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 percent compliant with something as simple as take a pill.

1567
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:45,880
But it only gets harder from there. Right. So getting someone who's not sleeping well to sleep

1568
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:51,400
well, that's a real big set of behavior changes. Getting someone who's not eating well to eat well,

1569
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:55,080
getting someone who's not exercising to exercise, getting someone who's not taking care of their

1570
02:21:55,080 --> 02:22:00,040
mental health to take care of their mental health. All of these things require enormous change.

1571
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:08,440
And if a person says on the surface, yes, I want to be better, like I accept that I want

1572
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:15,880
this outcome of being healthier, but they haven't specifically had the need or desire to change the

1573
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:23,880
way they eat or exercise or sleep or whatever. It adds a layer of challenge or friction to this

1574
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:31,080
process. What advice would you offer to me in a situation like that for trying to implement

1575
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:39,080
your insights into us into that scenario to a person who hasn't fully selected into wanting

1576
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:45,240
to change habits? Yeah, it's a great question. The point about people self-selecting by picking up

1577
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:51,000
the book is interesting because, you know, sometimes it's like you sort of only helping

1578
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,560
the people who already, you know, want to be helped in that sense. It's kind of like

1579
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:05,320
it's interesting to think that most of the time the people who most need to read the book are not

1580
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:08,440
the people who pick it up to read it. You know, it's like the people who read about habits are

1581
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:11,960
usually the ones who have like fairly decent habits and are pretty interested in it and like

1582
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:16,120
want to optimize it more. The people who need it the most, like they never read a book on habits

1583
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:19,880
and they don't want to read it and, you know, they're not interested. So anyway, there's a whole

1584
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:27,400
something interesting about that. But I think, you know, the points you bring up are very true

1585
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:32,760
and challenging and, you know, changing your own behavior is hard enough. Changing other people's

1586
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:37,560
behavior is like a whole nother level of difficulty, a whole nother order of magnitude of difficulty.

1587
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:45,800
I'll offer maybe three ideas that could apply. So the first one, and we've already talked about

1588
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:51,080
this in various ways, but I do think you have to make it really small, you know. And so you said,

1589
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:54,600
you know, like taking a pill is the smallest version, but it doesn't always have to be that

1590
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:59,240
it could be, you know, if you're trying to get them to exercise, it could literally be doing one

1591
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:03,880
push up or, you know, walking around the block one time or something. And this is that version of

1592
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:07,960
like, can I just go to the gym for five minutes sort of thing? Let's just scale it down, make it

1593
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:13,880
super simple. Along with that, it is very hard for it to be simple if people are being pulled in

1594
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:19,000
multiple directions. And so I think, you know, if you're giving people a plan that has five things

1595
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:24,040
on there for them to do, can we eliminate four of those for now? Can that be state phase two? And

1596
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:29,560
can we just do one right now? Let's take one thing and scale it down and stay focused and just try to

1597
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:34,600
get a little bit of momentum going on that. And then once we've established that and started to

1598
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:39,480
gain a foothold there and get a little bit more consistency with that one thing, we can take that

1599
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:45,960
momentum and transfer it into the next one. So yeah, ideally, probably a lot of patients will be

1600
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:50,280
doing these five things or these 15 things, but it doesn't mean you need to do all of them right

1601
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:54,840
now. Let's pick one and stay focused. So that's the first thing is try to keep it as simple as

1602
02:24:54,840 --> 02:25:02,280
possible. Pretty obvious answer, but I still think a useful one. The second thing, again, fairly

1603
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:06,280
obvious, and we've talked about it a bit, but still, I think useful is the environment design

1604
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:12,200
piece, you know, even the laziest person, even the person who has zero interest naturally in

1605
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:17,160
these topics is a product of the environment that they're in. And as you mentioned earlier,

1606
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:21,560
you know, if you were in some imagine this like lab experiment where you're locked in a room that

1607
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:26,360
only has healthy food options, even the laziest person is going to eat healthy there, they have

1608
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:31,960
no other choice. And, you know, that doesn't mean that they need to change everything in their home

1609
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:37,320
so that that it's that kind of like control lab experiment feel. But look, there's a lot of low

1610
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:42,440
hanging fruit that can be done here, that you don't actually need someone. And this, I think,

1611
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:46,840
is one of the reasons why I like environment changes. You don't actually need someone to be

1612
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:52,520
motivated every day to do this, you really just need them to be motivated for like one afternoon,

1613
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:57,080
so that they change the environment a bit. And that can actually serve them in some cases,

1614
02:25:57,080 --> 02:26:01,880
a concern for months, but in most cases, even food related cases, it could serve them for the

1615
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:06,920
next three days or five days or seven days, just by getting junk food out of the house that serves

1616
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:12,120
them for the next, you know, couple days. And so you only need little pockets of motivation.

1617
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:17,560
And if you can direct that pocket of motivation toward a high leverage action, like redesigning

1618
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:22,600
the environment, then it can continue to serve even a lazy person for a good chunk of time.

1619
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:29,080
So that's probably the second thing. So make it small, optimize the environment. And then the

1620
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:33,720
third thing, and this is maybe more of like a coaching thing as someone who deals with patients

1621
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:42,200
or, you know, has clients or whatever. The general strategy is easy to say, but very hard to follow,

1622
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:48,120
which is praise the good, ignore the bad. And it goes against the grain of what we want to do,

1623
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:52,520
because they're like, you're telling me, I just want to ignore the mistakes that they're making.

1624
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:57,640
And, you know, certainly there's a place for rectifying mistakes. And I don't mean that every

1625
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:03,720
problem should just go unresolved. But especially early on, the thing that you really want to build

1626
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:09,640
is momentum. And you want to reinforce the good behaviors. And as we talked about a good plant

1627
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:14,840
crowding out another, a way to encourage that is by praising the good and ignoring the bad.

1628
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:19,400
There was a hilarious op-ed that was written, I think it was in the New York Times,

1629
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:24,840
this wife who her husband would never throw his dirty clothes in the laundry hamper. And it was

1630
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:29,880
driving her nuts. And, you know, occasionally he would do it, but it was like pulling teeth all the

1631
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:33,960
time to get him to do this consistently. And she tried everything. She, you know, she tried nagging

1632
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:37,080
him, she tried annoying, you know, whatever, just all kinds of different, put the laundry hamper in

1633
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:41,160
a different place. Don't even have it in the closet, just have it out on the floor in the bedroom,

1634
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:44,440
and he still wouldn't do it. Sometimes you throw the clothes next to the hamper. She's like,

1635
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:49,960
you're already throwing it over there. Just put it in. And eventually what she settled on doing

1636
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:54,360
was that every time that he happened to put it in the hamper, she would make a huge deal about it.

1637
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:58,600
She'd run over, give him a kiss, give him a hug, say thank you, be like, oh, you're making my life

1638
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:04,440
so much easier. Thank you so much. And over the course of about a year, she effectively trained

1639
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:09,800
him to always put the clothes in the hamper because every time that happened, something good

1640
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:15,480
happened, he got praised, it felt good. And, you know, it's almost like training a dog in a sense,

1641
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:22,040
which is all kinds of organisms, dogs and humans love feeling praised, we like feeling good,

1642
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:27,080
we like being rewarded. And so if you praise the good actions and ignore the bad actions,

1643
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:32,120
it's again, almost like a form of gravity, people naturally gravitate toward the things that they

1644
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:38,600
get rewarded for the things they get praised for. And you'd be surprised how often people don't do

1645
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:44,440
something like this, or in fact, do the opposite. Like, you can imagine, you know, the quiet kid in

1646
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:49,080
the household who comes down for dinner with the rest of the family, and it's like, Oh, look who

1647
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:53,480
showed up, or, you know, they decide to share something about their day. And it's like, Oh,

1648
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:59,240
you know, finally, some, you know, a fact about your life. And you can imagine a parent or somebody

1649
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:03,240
saying something sarcastic like that. And all of a sudden, you're punishing the very behavior that

1650
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:10,680
you wanted to see. And so praise the good, ignore the bad, I think it applies in a lot of situations

1651
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:15,640
and can be more powerful than you realize. The tricky part is it requires a lot of patience,

1652
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:22,360
you got to do it for six months or a year or three years. And it's hard, it's hard to stick with that

1653
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:29,480
in the long run. Last example of this is a weightlifting one. I was at the gym on a Friday night

1654
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:35,800
one time. And I was there with a friend, we were doing a quick workout. And it's probably like 20,

1655
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:41,640
25 minutes, we got done, we're putting our shoes on. And this guy who's just kind of a jerk,

1656
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:49,240
went over, was talking to her, was like, quick workout for a Friday night. And, you know,

1657
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:55,480
like, she just kind of moved on. But that's like exactly the opposite of the type of feedback you

1658
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:59,560
want to be getting, especially if you're someone who's like new coming into the gym or feeling

1659
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:03,000
kind of uncomfortable there, you know, what people should be saying is, oh, it's great that

1660
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:09,160
you got in here, even though you know, it's the weekend. And a little cutting comment like that

1661
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:14,840
is all that people need to not show up again the next day. And so the more that you can be

1662
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:21,320
lavish with praise is, you know, maybe stating it even too strongly, but it doesn't really cost you

1663
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:26,600
very much to be kind. And, you know, you may not even remember it, but it's the kind of thing that

1664
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:31,400
might be enough to get that person to show up again the next time. And so in the long run,

1665
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:36,120
praising the good and ignoring the bad can count for a lot. So James, you're working on another book,

1666
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:42,520
right? I am. Yeah. And working is the correct term. So I'm currently kind of slogging and

1667
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:48,360
battling against the manuscript. I seem to find whatever way requires the most suffering to write

1668
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:55,800
books. Atomic habits. The first draft was like 720 pages. And then I cut it down to 250 eventually,

1669
02:30:55,800 --> 02:31:01,480
which for the finished version, this manuscript is like 600 and something right now. So I'm in the

1670
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:10,920
in the trimming phase. What's this book about? It's a book about strategy and choices and

1671
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:16,200
decision making and how we direct our attention. I'm still kind of finding it and discovering it

1672
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:21,720
in a lot of ways, but no one question that you could have after finishing atomic habits is,

1673
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:27,000
okay, that's great. I know how to build better habits, but which habits should I be focusing on?

1674
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:31,800
What's the high leverage action? How do I figure out where to direct my energy and attention?

1675
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:34,280
And so those are a lot of the questions that I'm exploring now.

1676
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:39,480
Well, I can't wait to have you back to discuss that after I read it twice, which I will do. I'm sure.

1677
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:44,280
Thanks very much, James. This has been really great to sit down with you. And

1678
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:49,560
again, this is almost like reading the book a third time. And I've picked up a lot of things

1679
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:53,720
that I hope readers or listeners have also. And I look forward to implementing it both

1680
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:57,960
personally and professionally. That's great. Thanks, Peter. Appreciate the opportunity.
