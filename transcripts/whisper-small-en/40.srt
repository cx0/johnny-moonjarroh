00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,200
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,560
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,800
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,080
for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,200
back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,920
notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,000
of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,440
getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,040
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,720
consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr.

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,360
Tom Catena. Now I want to preface this by saying something that, you know, on the one hand is a

47
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,160
little bit embarrassing to admit, but I think it also speaks to sort of the significance of Tom.

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,960
I've been very privileged over my life to have met many quote unquote important people, people

49
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,360
who are very rich or people who are very famous or people who have accomplished great things

50
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,360
athletically or otherwise. For whatever reason, I've never been nervous going into the first

51
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,400
meeting with somebody who is quote unquote special. Not sure why, maybe just deep down and

52
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,520
kind of get that we're all kind of the same and just because one person's smarter or runs faster

53
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,120
or, you know, made more money, you know, in the end it doesn't really matter that much and we're

54
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,400
all the same. But I got to say I've known about Tom for about three years. We've exchanged emails

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,960
in the past, but this interview was the first time I met Tom in person. And I only know how to say

56
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,640
this just bluntly. It's the first time in my life I've ever been nervous to meet a human being,

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,840
which of course is ironic when you meet Tom and this will come across in this episode because he

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,560
is quite simply the most humble human being you could ever meet. But I suppose I see in Tom what

59
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,680
I consider to be the greatest of any qualities or characteristics of any human being. And so it

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,840
humbled me and intimidated me to meet him. Since about the year 2000, Tom has been a missionary

61
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:40,600
physician in Africa, initially working in Kenya. And then in about 2008, he moved to a region of

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,280
South Sudan called the Nuba Hills or Nuba Mountains, where he continues to take care of

63
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,640
about three quarters of a million people. He's the only physician in the area and there's a

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:58,600
single hospital there that he runs with a, it's hard to describe how few resources he has to run

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,440
it. And I don't want to get into that because the episode will cover that in detail, but

66
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,400
I can only say that it is nothing short of a miracle what he and his very limited staff are

67
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,360
able to do. His accolades are so numerous that I don't even think it's worth getting into them.

68
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,800
I will say he is the recipient of the Aurora prize for awakening humanity. This is a prize

69
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,120
that awards $1 million to the charities of Tom's Choice. And needless to say, that is about as high

70
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,200
an honor as anybody could receive for the type of work that he does. He's been described by one

71
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Muslim man as Jesus Christ, which I think also speaks to the impact that he has had on the

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,320
community that he serves. Now in this episode, we talk about a lot of things and obviously talking

73
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,720
about kind of the unimaginable suffering that he sees and how he himself copes with death and how

74
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,080
he himself copes with being in a situation that I don't think any of us can understand. And certainly

75
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,200
no physician can understand because none of us really practice medicine alone. And yet in many

76
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,440
ways, that's what Tom is doing. We talk about a crisis of purpose. So it's easy, I think, to look

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,040
at what Tom does and feel sorry for him or feel sorry for the people he serves. But I must admit,

78
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,360
I came away from this interview actually feeling more sorry for us. And Tom so eloquently without

79
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,040
judgment explains some of the differences between people with all the privilege in the world, like

80
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,840
most of us listening to this and the people that he serves and talk about the sense of community

81
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,280
that exists in Nuba. And what you start to realize is that the way that we die in this country and

82
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,200
the way that we live in this country is so different from the way that people live and die in that part

83
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,480
of the world. And it's not just on the obvious things. It's not surprising that people there

84
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,760
don't die from complications of type 2 diabetes, but they die from infectious diseases and trauma.

85
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,160
But there's a more subtle point here, which is we in many ways are prisoners of our own world,

86
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,040
our own minds, our own possessions, these things. And to see the way Tom describes the freedom from

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,280
that, it gives me hope that if someone like me can realign the way I think about these things that

88
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,640
in many ways enslave me, perhaps I could even capture a fraction of the satisfaction, the

89
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,200
happiness, the purpose that someone like Tom has. Tom's work is so important to me. And I want to

90
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,720
be sure that anybody listening to this can get access to all of the notes we're going to put

91
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,760
together on this. And so normally our show notes are only available to subscribers, but for this

92
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,400
episode, they're available to everyone. I don't want anyone to not be able to see this under any

93
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,560
circumstance. So I really do recommend that everybody take a moment and look at some of the

94
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,960
videos that we link to. If you don't make time for that, but you are still sort of interested,

95
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:53,160
I can't recommend enough that you watch the documentary, The Heart of Nuba, which is based

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,720
on the work that Tom does there. I think you'll come away from this episode understanding why

97
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,760
I could feel so nervous meeting Tom for the first time. And so without further delay,

98
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:11,160
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Tom Katana. Hey Tom, thank you so much for making the time to

99
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,480
come over here today. Sure Peter, my pleasure. Yeah, there are a few people that would be giving

100
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,080
up more that they deem important work than you. So I know your time is tight. How often do you

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,680
come to the US? Well, this is my first time out in more than three years. So last time I was in

102
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,600
the US was November 2015. I was here for about five days. I was in my hometown of Amsterdam, New York.

103
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,080
And it wasn't much of a trip. I was, you asked about malaria. I was sick as a dog of malaria.

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,840
So I was like in bed with malaria the whole time. The last day I felt a bit better,

105
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,560
just in time to go back to Africa. So it's been, it's been a long time since I've been back.

106
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,960
You grew up in upstate New York. Yep. Your pedigree is like the star, right? You went to

107
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,080
Brown, you played football, you went to Duke medical school. Right. At what point did you

108
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,520
realize you wanted to do something a little different vis-a-vis working, you know, outside

109
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,480
of the US, for example? This desire to do this kind of work really was planted in, when I was in

110
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,160
college, when I was at Brown. And I always want to do some kind of mission work. And that term has

111
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,080
several connotations, but I, you know, wanted to be a missionary, whatever that meant. I wasn't quite

112
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,280
sure what meant at the time, but I just had this idea. I wanted to work in other cultures in the

113
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,000
society, do mission work. But I was, as you, a mechanical engineering major, and that didn't

114
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,840
really fit with doing mission work. This was in the 1980s. And most of the jobs then were

115
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,840
in the defense industry. They were, you know, they were good jobs, but I didn't really want to

116
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,160
do that kind of work. So I graduated college and kind of floating around for while I was offered a

117
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,560
job by GE, working with their kind of nuclear submarine program, it would have been a really

118
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,840
good job, but I just wasn't interested in that kind of work. And then one day it was kind of odd,

119
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,240
I thought it was coming back from my great aunt's funeral. I was with my brother Felix, and I did

120
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,400
just kind of popped in my head, I should go into medicine, because that could, if I do that, then

121
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,240
I could do mission work. And, you know, I'd like the sciences, I could stay in the sciences, do

122
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,280
mission work, help people, just kind of that general idea. And ended up going to medical school,

123
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,400
and kind of kept that desire to mission work. And that kind of evolved into wanting to work in

124
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,600
Africa, work with people that don't have a lot of options for healthcare, you know, 15 years later,

125
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,800
ended up in Sudan. So you started out in Kenya, is that right? Right. So, you know, when I finished

126
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,360
medical school, then I did five years in the US Navy, I had a Navy scholarship for medical school,

127
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,640
so I had to pay that time back. Then went to my residency, I did family practice in Tarahou,

128
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,440
Indiana. Now it was time to kind of be free and do what I want. So I thought, well, let me just go

129
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,800
and let me do this thing that's been kind of an itch for so many years. So I teamed up with

130
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,360
Catholic Medical Mission Board, and I said, okay, we have an opening in Kenya at this mission

131
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,440
hospital. Maybe go there. I said, okay, I'll go for one year. I'll see how it goes. If I like it,

132
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,840
maybe I'll stay longer. Otherwise, maybe I'll just come back and start a practice. And went down to

133
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,680
the Kenyan, fell in love with the place and decided to stay. What was the first thing that you

134
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,920
remember when you got there, as far as how different this was from the way you had trained?

135
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,360
Because you did your residency in the United States, right? Right, did my residency in the US,

136
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,840
and I did family practice. And the program I went to was kind of geared towards rural health. So I

137
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,840
thought, okay, if I want to do admission medicine, I got to be doing more than just kind of outpatient

138
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,200
office stuff. I need to do something with a little more meat to it. So a little bit of obstetrics,

139
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,320
we did a bit of surgery, mostly just C-sections. So when I first got there, I think what struck me

140
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,120
was just the volume of patients. I mean, I was a resident. And in clinic days, we'd see

141
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,480
like five or six patients and get all every little detail down on each one. And now,

142
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm in this rural hospital in Kenya. And I mean, you're seeing 50, 60 patients, you know,

143
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,440
huge numbers, the clinic, the wards are full, you go do ward around. I was in charge of the adult

144
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,680
ward. And there were, you know, at the time, I thought it was a huge, I mean, like 30, 40 patients

145
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,680
there. And I was responsible for all them. It's just this sheer volume of patients you had to go

146
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,600
through every day in the variety of diseases. So not only the tropical stuff, which I didn't know

147
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,680
much about, I mean, here's malaria, TB, lyshmaniasis, all this kind of stuff I had no idea about, I had

148
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,520
to learn about when I was there, you know, learned to thank God some, a couple more senior doctors

149
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,000
there like I learned from, but just a volume of patients and the variety of diseases you had to

150
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
face. So what year did you get to Kenya? I arrived in Kenya, January 17, 2000. That's so interesting.

151
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,840
I arrived at NIH when I was in medical school on January 17, 2000. No way. Yeah.

152
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,960
Yeah. That was, which was NIH, being at NIH while I was in medical school was one of the

153
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,640
sort of more formative parts of my experience. So how long before you went to Sudan and what

154
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,000
led to that transition? I'm trying to think of my geography, right? Kenya is south of Sudan,

155
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,800
correct? Sort of south east of Sudan? South, right. South and a bit east, exactly. Okay.

156
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,000
And much more stable, right? I mean, Kenya is a relatively safe place to be. Right. Sudan is not,

157
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,880
right? It's divided into these provinces and my, the one that got all the attention was Darfur,

158
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,240
which is the furthest west. Correct. Exactly. And that basically was a war zone. Right. I mean,

159
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,040
a killing field, right? So Bashar was basically killing his own people there, wasn't he? Right.

160
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,560
So to go from Kenya to Sudan, what were you thinking? I think maybe the modus operandi

161
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,240
in my life was always looking for, what's the opposite of greener pastors? I'm looking for

162
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,560
browner pastors. When I was there in Kenya, this was, as I said, I got there in January 2000.

163
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,560
The civil war in Sudan was really raging at that time. And I was in Kenya learning a ton of stuff,

164
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,040
really enjoyed the work. And I kept hearing about Sudan, the civil war in Sudan and how it's so

165
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,720
terrible. And the conditions there were terrible. And the, you know, there's such a lack of any

166
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,520
kind of health services. I thought, man, I'd really like to get involved in that, in that struggle,

167
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,520
just to go and work with the help the people there, just because it was so health facilities

168
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,880
were so limited. I thought that's kind of the place I want to go to. So I had this general

169
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,520
thought. This is 2000, one thousand two. Now, this woman in June of 2002, I left my first

170
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,560
posting, which was in a rural place called Motoma was there for two and a half years.

171
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,720
I went up to Northern Kenya, a place called Turkana. I was at the Kakama mission hospital,

172
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,960
which is up in the Turkana desert near the refugee camp, a woman named Deidre Burns. So Deedee was,

173
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,120
I think, her first time up in Turkana. And I was talking to her. She's an American,

174
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,560
she was doing a kind of short term mission there. She's a surgeon and a family practice

175
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,800
doctor. She did both, was doing primary surgery. And she said, look, there's a bishop I know,

176
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,400
who's Bishop Makram Gossis, who was building a hospital in Sudan. I think he might be interested

177
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,760
in going there. And that, say, whoa, that's exactly what I've been thinking about doing,

178
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,080
you know, for the past couple of years, some back in 2002. So she said, look, he's got an office in

179
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,920
Nairobi. He's living there in exile. Maybe you can make contact with his office because I was due to

180
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,920
go to Nairobi and start working there. Anyway, to make a long story short, I ended up working in

181
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,320
Nairobi, linked up with his office. And we started kind of making plans for the hospital and how it

182
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,800
runs, staff who would need all that kind of stuff. And then took six years, but six years later.

183
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,080
Who funded the hospital?

184
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,320
It was all funded through the Catholic Diocese. So it was the Catholic Diocese of El Abaid. Bishop

185
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,720
Gossis was the Bishop of the El Abaid Diocese. And he and his office were able to get funding

186
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,680
through the church mechanism to fund the hospital.

187
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,520
So now it's 0809 and that's when you go.

188
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,440
Right. So I went to Nuba Mountains, arrived there March 10th, 2008. Was there, landed there in

189
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Nuba Mountains.

190
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,480
Tell the listener a little bit about where Nuba is. I mean, I know it's in the southern part of

191
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,320
Sudan. It's to the east of Darfur, but it's pretty rugged country, isn't it?

192
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,880
Right. So the Nuba Mountains is probably one of the most remote places in the world.

193
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,520
It's a region which for many years in Sudan was kind of kept off limits before when Sudan was a

194
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,560
kind of a colony, was under the, called the Anglo-Egyptian condominium, partly kind of administered

195
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,480
by UK and by Britain and by Egypt. They decided to kind of keep the Nuba separate. They said,

196
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,280
these people have a unique culture and unique people. They didn't really allow a lot of open

197
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,480
tourism or people to go in there. It was kind of a closed area. So they really kind of have maintained

198
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,440
this separateness and this isolation over centuries. It's difficult to reach. It's semi-arid.

199
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,440
It's got this thing of rainy season. It's got a dry season, but more hills. They aren't real high

200
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,600
mountains, but sort of 3,000 foot hills, that kind of range.

201
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,520
My history is not great, but I sort of remember that basically Sudan was granted sort of,

202
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,960
I forget the term, but when you're given your independence, for lack of a better word,

203
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,240
that would have been in the 50s, right?

204
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,120
Right, 56.

205
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,600
Okay. And then what was the religious sort of map of Sudan and did that figure into how it was

206
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,920
divided and was that partly why Nuba was, was it religiously diverse? Was it mostly Muslim,

207
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,720
mostly Christian?

208
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,880
Yeah. Sudan is a very interesting place. It was one country up until 2011 when they divided

209
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,160
the North and South. Now, the religious makeup is in the North. So North of Nuba mountains,

210
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,080
it's primarily Muslim, almost all Muslim in the North. The South is primarily Christian.

211
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,720
Nuba is right in the middle. And interestingly enough, Nuba is a mix. It's about, let's say,

212
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,200
half Christian, half Muslim. And everybody's anatomist, but half are Christian, half are Muslim.

213
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,480
And the Nuba are unique. I think a unique tribe in the world where you have families which are

214
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,640
mixed. You have Nuba, you have Nuba Muslims and Nuba Christians, and there's no conflict

215
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,040
amongst them. For instance, my wife is a Nuba. Her father, both her parents, when they were born,

216
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,360
they were just followed the traditional religions. The Christianity in Islam had not been introduced

217
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,240
yet into the area. Now, as they got older, her father became Muslim, mother became Christian,

218
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,480
they married. Her father's a polygamist, so two wives, both wives are Christian. Their oldest son

219
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,200
is a Muslim. The rest of the children are Christian. And nobody's really bothered by this.

220
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,280
That's in Nuba. Now, the country itself, this difference between Muslim and Christian was

221
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,520
really a big issue in the previous civil war. We had the Southern African people that were

222
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,000
mostly Christian against the Northern Arab people that were all Muslim fighting each other. And there

223
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,320
was very much a religious context to that previous civil war. And also in Nuba mountains, the Nuba

224
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,800
people joined the Southerners. They're all African in Nuba. They joined the Southerners fighting the

225
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:24,440
Northern Arab Muslim people in the North. And in the 1990s, there was a jihad against the Nuba

226
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,720
people. So there was a real genocide in the 1990s against the Nuba. Who issued this jihad?

227
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,600
The ideologue behind this is a guy who just died last year. His name is Hassan Al-Tarabi.

228
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,880
And Tarabi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, very bright guy, went to Sorbonne in Paris,

229
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,600
and was kind of intellectual, but really kind of an evil genius, if I can use that word.

230
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,120
He was a real ideologue in the Muslim Brotherhood. And he managed to

231
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,160
convince some of the imams in the North to sign off a fatwa to allow jihad against the Nuba.

232
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,040
And many imams rejected it. They said, well, you can't do that.

233
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,000
Even though he'd be killing Muslims within Nuba.

234
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,560
Right, exactly. His response to this was, okay, you can have a jihad because the Christians are

235
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,200
fair game in the jihad. And then the Muslims are apostates from the religion because they

236
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,760
associate with Christians. Some of them eat pork. Some of them drink local beer. They're not real

237
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,640
Muslims. Like this thing with the Nuba are very much communal. And to have Muslims and Christians

238
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,320
together at functions, it was an atma to him. The fact we could have Christians and Muslims in the

239
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,880
same family was a huge scandal to him. He just couldn't tolerate that kind of stuff. So he said,

240
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,280
no, these guys are also fair game because they're not real Muslims.

241
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,120
So what year was that fatwa issued?

242
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,000
That was in the, I think in the early 90s, have been 93.

243
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,480
So Bashir was already in power, right? His coup was like late 80s, right?

244
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:52,120
He took power in 89. And this guy, Tarabi helped him in this coup. He was kind of the brains behind

245
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,080
the coup. And Tarabi, I mean, he was, you know, he was kind of a power hungry guy. He said, okay,

246
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,080
his figure, he figured if he helped Bashir get into power, but she was a military guy.

247
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,000
And he thought, okay, if I help Bashir get into power, I'm much more intelligent than Bashir.

248
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll just kind of find a way to get rid of him and I'll take over. And Bashir said, look,

249
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,120
I'm the one in power. You're not, you're not taking over. So he kind of always kept Tarabi at

250
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
a distance. And they're always these, he would always, he was always throwing Tarabi in prison

251
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,920
afterwards because Tarabi started speaking out against him. So we put him in a quote unquote

252
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,480
prison, maybe, you know, it would be some luxury apartment in Khartoum, but they kind of were at

253
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,320
odds with each other. But Tarabi was the ideologue behind a lot of this moment. He's the one that

254
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,320
invited Osama bin Laden to Sudan in the early 90s. So bin Laden lived in, when bin Laden was exiled

255
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,880
from Saudi Arabia, which is in the early 2000s. Right. Well, that was before then he invited,

256
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,000
what's his name? He invited bin Laden to Khartoum. So he lived in Sudan for a while and a lot of,

257
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,520
you know, Kaida had a lot of training camps in the desert in the north of Sudan.

258
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,000
I had totally forgotten that fact. That's the chapter of Volkaita that I'd sort of forgotten.

259
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,440
So you basically have a bunch of incredibly evil people who are deciding to kill their

260
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,080
own citizens effectively. Right. You got there in, oh, wait, you said, or 09? Oh, wait. So he arrived

261
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,240
March, 2008. So historically that was the interim peace period. So since they got independence in

262
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,600
1956, Sudan has been at civil war, various parts of it have been a civil war for almost the entire

263
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,840
history. That's it has 60, that's how many years 62, 63 years, most of the history they've been at

264
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,240
civil war. So this was one of the brief periods actually wasn't even priest them because their

265
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,720
forest started in 2003. Their for a rebel started fighting against the government in 2003. So this

266
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,960
wasn't the whole country was not a piece of the time, but the big war between the south and north,

267
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,400
the peace agreement was signed 2005. So when we arrived in 2008, the peace agreement was still in

268
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,760
effect, and there was no active fighting. And then we were kind of waiting for this referendum to take

269
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,880
place referendum, the way the peace agreement was signed up was southerners. So South Sudan would

270
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,320
have the choice for self determination. And that will be done by referendum. So the people actually

271
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,600
have a vote, straight up vote, the majority vote to succeed, they succeed, the majority vote to stay

272
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,720
and stay as one country they stay. Now 2011, they have the vote and like 99.99% vote to succeed from

273
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,320
the north. So South Sudan separates in the peace agreement. I'm sorry, is Nuba considered south or

274
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,760
north in this cessation? Right, this is part of the problem because in the peace agreement, Nuba

275
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,160
was separate. Okay. And what they said was, okay, South Sudan will have a referendum. The Nuba

276
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,520
mountains was not included as part of South Sudan. Nuba and Blue Nile were separate regions. And they

277
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,960
said in these two regions, they're called the two areas, they will have what's called a popular

278
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,960
consultation, which was a very vague system where there'd be committee set up, they would go and

279
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,240
they would talk to people in the villages and kind of get their opinions on things and see what they

280
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,760
wanted to do. If they wanted to separate stay, it was very vague. And I think it was purposely vague,

281
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,520
because the government knew it was kind of a bargaining chip for the north to allow South

282
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,800
Sudan to have this referendum. They said, okay, because they knew in the end, they will keep the

283
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,400
Nuba mountains because this thing was too vague, you know, and they would be able to manipulate it

284
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,320
enough, they will keep the Nuba on their side. So South Sudan separates. There are elections in

285
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,760
Nuba mountains in 2011, in May, the candidate for Bashir's party, of course, wins the governorship

286
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:19,080
in the parliament. This is a side note. Before that election, the guy's name is Ahmed, Ahmed Haroun,

287
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,960
who was running against the guy named Abdulaziz. Anyway, Ahmed Haroun was the candidate for Bashir's

288
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,240
party, National Congress Party. And before the election, Bashir said, Ahmed Haroun is our candidate,

289
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,120
and he will win this election, whether by the ballot or by the bullet. So going into it, it

290
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,120
doesn't look like it's gonna be a free and fair election. Right. And Bashir at this point, does he

291
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,200
already have basically a warrant out for his arrest? Right. So he's got the warrant for his arrest.

292
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:49,240
That was, I think, 2009, I think. Ahmed Haroun also is indicted by the ICC for crimes. He was one

293
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,520
of the architects of the genocide. Genocide, yeah. So Ahmed Haroun, who's our governor,

294
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,000
as under, is indicted by the ICC. Bashir is indicted by the ICC. It also was the defense

295
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,080
minister, was indicted by the ICC. So Ahmed heard wins. They go and say, okay, now our party is there

296
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,200
in South Kordofan state in the mountains. There are still SPLA soldiers, like Southern soldiers,

297
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,600
living in this region. The Northern Army came and said, you know, did a forced disarmament

298
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,840
of these SPLA soldiers. And that's when violence broke out. So June 2011, June 6, 2011, civil war

299
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,440
breaks out in Nuba mountains against the government. Now, I've heard you speak about this in the past.

300
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,960
It was overnight that most of the staff in your hospital left. So prior to that, leading up to

301
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,600
the referendum and the breakout of war, you've got this three year period where you're in the

302
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,480
hospital, you're working there. As far as Nuba can be tranquil, this is the greatest tranquility

303
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,320
you've seen. The staff is what? It's you, it's what else? Right. So at this time, we started

304
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,120
the hospital in March 2008. We went there with about eight expatriates, including myself. So I

305
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:03,080
was the only doctor. We had a few nurses, an esthetist, a lab person. We had those eight expatriates.

306
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,360
They're mostly from, they're all from Kenya or Uganda. Those eight expatriates, myself, we had

307
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,880
15 local staff, Nuba. And the Nuba, I think the most educated person had finished primary school.

308
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,160
They were not nurses. They were just kind of local people that could read and write a bit of English

309
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,640
and they could speak English. So they had to be taught everything. We first started, they couldn't

310
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,200
weigh a patient. They couldn't take a temperature, let alone give an injection or start an IB. Anyway,

311
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,800
with time we got these guys trained up a bit. So they had some pretty good skills. A lot,

312
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,680
most of that was done by these expatriate nurses. Now we still kept expatriates, but over time we

313
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,800
added more and more on the job trained people. We kept adding more primary school graduates or

314
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,440
eventually we got a few secondary school people. Started training them on the job. We didn't have

315
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,920
any trained Nuba nurses by the time the war started in 2011. So now war starts June 6th,

316
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,360
2011. By June 16th is 10 days into the fighting. Things are getting pretty hairy. There's a lot of

317
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,120
fighting within Nuba, Arab bombardments all the time and the diocese. And this is all from the

318
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,760
north? The north and the north, right. Fighting within Nuba mountains. The resistance is posed

319
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,880
by whom? Is it former southern who have not seceded or are trying to basically, are the north

320
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,120
and the south now fighting for Nuba? Right. So what happens is the south Sudan is totally separate.

321
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,400
So within Nuba mountains, you've got a lot of soldiers that were southern soldiers,

322
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,320
SPLA soldiers, a lot of whom were Nuba. Most of them were Nuba, but you also had other southern

323
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,720
tribes in the mountains kind of leftover from the previous conflict and they were there in the

324
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,320
barracks. So that all those kind of trapped SPLA soldiers are fighting the Sudan army. Now they

325
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,000
call themselves instead of SPLA, they're called SPLA north. So from that point forward, these guys

326
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,640
are called SPLA north. They have kind of a new identity as a separate military force from the SPLA,

327
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,320
which is in south Sudan. So fighting is going on, Arab bombardments. June 16th, the diocese says,

328
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,920
look, we're having, we're sending a plane in and this plan is going to come in to evacuate anybody

329
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,160
who wants to get out of there. Okay. And the plane was going to go to Uganda or to Sudan?

330
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,520
The plane was flying into Nuba mountains to pick up whoever wanted to get out and they would get

331
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,800
out and leave. Now this was a bit dicey because at this time there were a few flights coming into

332
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,360
Nuba mountains, mostly getting people out, but they have to change the airstrip. There are a few

333
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,760
airstrips around, but they would give the location of the airstrip at the last moment and they would

334
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,240
have like a code name for it because if there were a lot of spies around and if the north found out,

335
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,760
they would come with their bombers and come and bomb the airstrip. They would try to bomb the

336
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,560
plane on the ground, they'd bomb the people that were trying to get in the plane to escape.

337
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,720
So all the stuff was top secret. A plane comes in and they say, look, we come in, we land,

338
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,360
we're taking off in 10 minutes. You better be at the airstrip waiting, get your butts on the

339
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,640
airplane. We have to be out by 10 minutes or else these guys will come and bomb. And they do this

340
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,560
at night, I'm assuming. No, they did it early, early in the morning because you can't, there's

341
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,040
no lights or anything for the planes to land. So it's all just by sight. So they would come

342
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,480
early in the morning, land and they would get out. So all of our expats that were there with us,

343
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,200
they had all the knowledge. I mean, our anesthetist, our lab person, pharmacist, the nurses that were

344
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,280
awarded in charges, the ones that were doing most of the work and doing the leadership,

345
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,160
they all decided to leave. Now, did you all sit down together and have this sort of heart to heart,

346
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,280
which is each of you had to make a very difficult decision, which is you feel committed to this work

347
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,200
you're doing, but now your life is at exponentially greater danger. Right. So yeah, we met with

348
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,440
everybody. We had a group talk and we met individually and say, look, this plane is coming

349
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,920
in. This is the last plane that the diocese can send in. This is it. Once this plane comes and once

350
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,080
it leaves, you might never get out of here. Because you have no idea what's going to happen the next

351
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,360
day. You don't know if the Syrian army is going to overrun us and this is the last chance. How

352
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:58,200
did you think about that? I mean, was there a moment when you thought maybe I should leave and

353
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:05,000
go back to Kenya or go to Uganda or go somewhere else? I mean, what was that thought process like?

354
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,240
Right. So, you know, I was encouraged to leave by some different people. I said, look, why don't

355
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,040
you come out? You stay in Kenya for a while. Then when things blow over, then you can go back when

356
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,280
it's safer. I thought, and I thought, geez, you know, first time you have no idea, this is just

357
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,800
total chaos. You have no idea what's going to happen. What I did know is that we were getting

358
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,160
people wounded or all the structures that were ever coming in all the time, you know? So I knew

359
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,840
if I leave, it's not like they can go somewhere else. There were no other hospital surgical

360
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,520
capability. Okay. There wasn't a single one. There was another small hospital nearby run by

361
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,280
a German group that could do some inpatient stuff and outpatient and some minor stuff.

362
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,640
But really if somebody needed a C-section or something more serious, they would just die.

363
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,200
Okay. And that says nothing of the casualties that are going to start coming in as a result of this

364
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,600
attack. Right. So all these people that came in that were wounded would just die a miserable

365
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,120
death. And I knew that. So for me, it was a very easy decision. I thought, you know, there's no way

366
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,440
I can in good conscience leave this place and go out. It was a very, very stark reality. And to be

367
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,720
honest with you, it was not a difficult decision. I think the sisters that were there, the two

368
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,040
kamboni sisters that stayed, the priests that stayed, we all were of the same mind. We all

369
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,200
thought the same thing. Let's just stick it out. We're here as missionaries. Let's do what we're

370
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,560
supposed to do and take care of the people the best we can and come what may. We have faith in

371
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,680
God. We'll see what happens. And it wasn't, you know, we didn't feel like it was some big thing.

372
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,640
It was just like, well, no, we can't go. You know, we got stuff to do here. And, you know,

373
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,640
the other expats said, look, I've got a family. I've got this, I've got that. And we said, look,

374
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,200
we're not going to hold anything against anybody. This has to be very individual decision. If you

375
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,200
guys want to go, we'll find a way to keep going. Don't worry about it. So we wanted to give them

376
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,160
full latitude to lead in peace and not feel they were abandoning people there. So I think

377
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,280
everybody's pretty much at peace with the decision. The expats left. And I mean, sure enough,

378
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:02,440
they left June 16th, the morning of June 16th. They left around six in the morning. They had to

379
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,720
get out there early because they had to get the, you know, get this plan and just get out of the

380
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,720
place. And we had to keep everything secret. So all of our staff didn't know these guys were leaving.

381
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,640
We had to keep it a secret from everybody. And they have been left. And then the staff came to

382
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,280
work at 7 30. And so you, you had an anesthesiologist that was one of the people that left.

383
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,760
Right. So talk to me about 10 o'clock on that morning, the first time or whenever the first

384
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,200
surgical case comes in, who's running anesthesia? That was the biggest problem. So these guys leave

385
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,480
around six, eight o'clock casualties start rolling in people that were, there's a bombing from one of

386
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,200
the Sudan air force planes called an Antonov that has barrel bombs. They bombed in a location near us,

387
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,960
maybe an hour, a couple hours away. We hear these in the film, the heart of Nuba, right? Which we'll

388
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,520
talk about in a few minutes, but right. So like two hours later, all these mangled bodies start

389
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,760
coming. Yeah. Describe what this, I mean, so I did my training in Baltimore. In many ways, trauma

390
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,320
was a feature of the training program because if you're training in surgery, you know, one of my

391
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,480
mentors said, you know, to be able to train at a place like Hopkins is a great honor because

392
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,360
you really get to understand surgical anatomy in trauma. And it's penetrating trauma in the United

393
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:17,480
States is mostly gunshot wound and stab wounds. But I have no idea what you were seeing. So what

394
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,320
explain to me what things you actually saw, what types of injuries are you seeing? Right. So this

395
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:30,120
was very stark because when Antonov bombs, there are huge shards of metal. I mean, weighing, you

396
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,040
know, 10 pounds, I've got a bunch of the scraps. I have them as a souvenir, Megan Nuba. So imagine

397
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:42,120
a scrap of metal weighs 10 pounds, red hot, just going through your body. So it slices off legs,

398
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,760
slices of arms, cuts through people with just massive tissue loss and massive trauma. So I'm

399
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:55,080
here one young lady. She was 16. Her name was Ursheline, which means Jerusalem in the Arabic and

400
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,680
her arm was just totally mangled. I mean, just shattered. She came in, her cousin came in, his

401
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,720
hand was his whole hand was blown off by the Antonov shrapnel. So these guys both in amputations,

402
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,640
the girl, we did a disarticulation on the shoulders. So we had a couple of our on the job

403
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,320
trained nurses there. And they had done something they've been taught how to do spinal anesthetic

404
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,200
by the anesthetist. See the smiles they couldn't do GA for the listener GA general anesthetic,

405
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,800
meaning they couldn't intubate and put the patient fully to sleep. And I, I had never

406
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,560
intubated a patient before. I remember when I was in the military, we intubated and intubate goats

407
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,600
for as part of our atls training. I think if I remember, I never done it either. It's like,

408
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,440
what the heck? So I'm so afraid. Like, what do I do with these people? You know, so I remember

409
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,440
reading the book, we have a book there, kind of basic anesthesia book, so I bring you through the

410
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,680
protocols. Okay, first, give some ketamine, you knock them out with that, they go to sleep,

411
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,600
give it a little bit of pain, you give succinylcholine to paralyze them, intubate,

412
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,960
and you give pankaronium, you have a healthy anesthesia, put the two bands, the side intubate,

413
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,680
like, okay, okay, let's let's do it. So we took some of these guys back. And you know, I would go

414
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,560
and give the drug, I had a nurse there, kind of on child, it's okay, give the ketamine, you would

415
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,560
push it in, push the succinylcholine, I would intubate. And I guess I should explain for the

416
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,600
purposes of listening to this, because we use these terms so commonly. So intubation is a very

417
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,360
important step where if you screw this up, you're going to kill a person, literally, you will kill

418
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,760
them, but you have to put a breathing tube into the endotracheal space. So this is now to allow a

419
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,640
machine to breathe for someone while they're under anesthesia. And we do these things in medical

420
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,000
school, we did them in residency, a lot of our critical care training required that. But I have

421
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,120
to tell you, and I was not trained as an anesthesiologist, I never intubated somebody without

422
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,280
being incredibly nervous, because it's so easy to put that tube accidentally into the esophagus,

423
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,960
and you think you're doing it right. And all of a sudden, you know, you get the tube in, you hook

424
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,400
it up to the ventilator, you think everything's going well. And by the time you realize you're

425
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,520
providing oxygen to their stomach instead of their lungs, it can be too late. And then of course,

426
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,040
the panic that ensues is often what kills the patient, right? Because you're getting nervous,

427
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,720
and then you can't do it, you're starting to shake. You know, the problems might, as I said before,

428
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,760
my training was family practice, I did an internal medicine internship, you know,

429
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,320
in the family practice, I never intubated somebody, I never did anesthesia rotation in medical school,

430
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,600
that was not part of our training at all. So I was very green with this. Anyway, by the grace of God,

431
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,000
managed to get the patient intubated, connected to help, we have a really primitive structure called

432
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,280
an OMV, Oxford miniature ventilator, it's got a set of bellows, it's like turn of the century kind

433
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,960
of stuff, turn of the 20th century. So, you know, intubating, so we have to get to manual ventilation

434
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,720
for the patient. Throughout the whole surgery? Yeah, throughout the whole surgery, as long as

435
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,640
they're paralyzed, you got to you've got to ventilate manually. Usually with the hella thing,

436
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,520
after you manually ventilate for about 20 minutes, they can breathe on their own. And it's a bit of

437
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,440
an art to try to keep them under enough, where they can breathe on their own, but they're not

438
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,240
in pain. So it's a big art to this kind of work, but it's all manual. I just have to go off on a

439
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,160
tangent for a moment, which perhaps only the people listening to this who have medical training will

440
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,960
appreciate what you're saying. I'm guessing you don't have blood gases? No. Okay, so you can't

441
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:19,000
measure a patient's PAO2 or PACO2. And yet your anesthetist has to figure out how to ventilate,

442
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,720
which again, means how much oxygen the person needs, and how much CO2 you take off. And if

443
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,880
you screw either of those two up, you will kill someone. Right. And if you told me to walk into

444
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,360
Mass General or NYU or pick your favorite hospital and said, Peter, we're going to do

445
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,560
everything for you. We're going to intubate the patient. We're going to do this. All you have to

446
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,240
do is be the guy that manually ventilates them. I wouldn't be able to do that. Like I would

447
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,200
overdo it or underdo it. There's no way you'd hit that sweet spot. Yeah. You'd cause an alkalosis

448
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,520
acid. And then to be able to not have the laboratory tools to know when you're off the rails.

449
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,600
Right. Yeah. In those days, we didn't have a pulse ox. Now we have a pulse oximeter, which can measure

450
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,840
the percent of oxygen in the blood. The oxygen saturation. Oh my God. That time we had no pulse ox.

451
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,800
Some of this stuff, maybe ignorance is bliss because you can't measure it. So you just hope

452
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,920
and pray that things are going okay. But we managed to get the guy intubated. I mean, you couldn't do

453
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,120
veterinary medicine like this in the United States. Right. Yeah. You know, it was pretty hairy. We

454
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,200
managed to get through and this went out. We eventually got an anesthetist to come. This was

455
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,560
after about a month or two. Well, and in that month or two, what types of casualties did you see?

456
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,520
Oh, I mean everything, abdominal trauma, lots of leg trauma. We did a number of general anesthetics

457
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,240
during that time. We had a baby that came in with intersusception. This was the worst case. It was a

458
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,880
nine month old baby who came in who had an intersusception, which is kind of an intestinal

459
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,560
obstruction. Yeah. Explain what that looks like, the telescoping part. Right. So intersusception

460
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,000
is when the intestine telescopes on itself and basically causes a blockage of the intestine. And

461
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
then the longer you delay, that intestine can die and the person will die, the baby will die from

462
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,360
from infection. And we made the diagnosis and I'm just like, Oh God, you know, we're supposed to do

463
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,360
with this kid. So anyway, we take the baby to the outbreak and we said, we got to try something.

464
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,400
So I mean, intubating an adult is hard. A baby is really, really hard. We managed to get the

465
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,600
kid intubated. So I didn't debate the baby. He started on the ventilated pelothane, went out,

466
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,480
scrubbed for the case, came back. We opened the baby up, did a bowel resection, put it back together,

467
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,320
closed the baby up and he did great. He's a, how old is the baby now? He's like baby, he's eight

468
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,720
years old now, eight, nine years old. So he's cruising. But that's kind of one of the many

469
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,040
miracles we've seen. And when these bits of shrapnel are going through people, I mean,

470
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:44,280
you're seeing liver lacerations, you're seeing bowel injuries, hema pneumothoracies, head trauma.

471
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,400
I mean, give me a sense of the mortality. There are some cases that obviously just can't be saved.

472
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,520
Right. Well, you know, I'll tell you Peter, I think what happens sometimes people say,

473
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,600
why do you have so many extremity traumas? Because they're the ones that make it in.

474
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,640
The ones that survive. So, you know, the ones that get a really terrible trap with the chest,

475
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,840
they bleed out in the field because we're, you know, we're six hours. Sometimes these

476
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,360
patients come a day. We've had people with penetrating abdominal trauma with multiple

477
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,280
holes in their intestines come three, four days afterwards and survive. So imagine that.

478
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,720
You're leaking feces into the abdomen for three or four days. So imagine how strong these people

479
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,920
are. And they come in, it's just a mess and you open them up and some of them pull through.

480
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,560
You know, anemic dehydrated, they haven't eaten in several days and these guys can survive.

481
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,520
So some of the people are just tough as nails, but we get a lot of penetrating. I mean,

482
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,440
kidneys get torn to shreds, liver lacks, massive kidney trauma, liver trauma. I remember one guy

483
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:49,480
had, we counted, he had 23 holes in his intestines that we had to, you know, resect here, resect

484
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,760
there, stitch this one. It just took forever. How did you learn surgery? Right. So, you know,

485
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,280
I trained in family practice and when I went to Kenya, we were doing a lot of, you know, tons of

486
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,040
tropical medicine, a lot of obstetrical care, did a lot of C-sections. But I realized a lot of the

487
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,080
disease burden in Africa was surgically related. A lot of it. I mean, a lot of it courses tropical

488
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,880
medicine, like, okay, do all those things. And I said, well, a good, like half of what we were

489
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,960
seeing was surgically related, either just wound care, miscarriages, laparotomies, imputations,

490
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,920
kind of the run in the middle kind of surgical stuff. There's a lot of it. So I thought I really

491
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,920
need to learn how to do this stuff if I'm going to stay here longterm. So luckily, where I've been,

492
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,320
both rural Kenya and Nairobi, I met up with people that were willing to teach me things.

493
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,080
So really, it was like doing another residency. I mean, I would, there was Nairobi, I had a whole

494
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,080
day in the operating room, and we would do tons of cases. And there was an American missionary doctor

495
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,920
there named Mike Johnson. So I'm like, would you sit there and teach me stuff? You know, I would do

496
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,320
just like you did in residency, I would do the case, he would assist me and just kind of walk me

497
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,520
through it. There was a Kenyan surgeon there, Dr. Rucho was a fantastic, he was like a magician.

498
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,920
He was not so hands on. But if he was always, he was there in the operating room, he would say,

499
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,040
go ahead and start the case. After he had a little bit of experience, he'd start the case,

500
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,440
he had a problem, call me. So I'd start open up, look around a bit, say, okay, I'm stuck when we

501
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,040
come in, look around, say, I'll do this, do that, I do this and that, and things will go ahead.

502
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,480
Before you know it, you're doing thyroid and laparotomies and reciting bowel and stitching

503
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,120
liver and taking kidneys out and doing amputations. And I mean, you know, it is just kind of once you

504
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,920
learn a few, you have a few skills, you can add the next case, the next one, the next one, then

505
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,880
I mean, it took I was there for seven and a half years in Kenya. It was like doing another residency.

506
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,880
I mean, at some point, though, you have to be making mistakes that are harming patients,

507
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,120
because even in our, and I say that not being critical, right? But just saying like, that's

508
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:45,720
the nature of medicine. I mean, I think of every time I hurt somebody, even, you know, I remember

509
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,760
once causing a hemoneumothorax in a patient when I put a central line in them, it was my 500th

510
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,440
central line. So at this point, you'd think I could do it blindfolded. And yet to cause that

511
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,840
complication, which in my case, I'm lucky enough to have an x-ray to see that I've caused this

512
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,120
complication. You don't even I mean, you're missing so many of the basic tools that could act

513
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,800
as sort of a safety net. So what was that process like? I think what I wanted to make sure of when

514
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,160
I was in Kenya, I think those whole seven and a half years I was in Kenya, I always had either

515
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,040
somebody assisting me in the case, or somebody in the room or in the next room over. So I think I

516
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,680
was pretty well covered during that time. And by the time I was finished seven and a half years,

517
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,720
I felt pretty confident I go out on my own and do surgery. I think it's this concept, you know,

518
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,120
better than I do about 10,000 hours, you know, and I think in residency, you have like a thousand

519
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,280
cases, suppose like a thousand cases at least, but that's like a minimum. Yeah, maybe 1200 or

520
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,280
something. Yeah. So I did, you know, but time I finished my time in Kenya, I done. But for you,

521
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,160
it's harder because you're doing a breadth of cases that like, even if you took something as

522
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,000
broad as general surgery, I mean, you're still doing basically orthopedic surgery as well.

523
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:02,600
And obstetrics, right? A lot of urology. There's a mix. And I think maybe the trade off is the

524
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,280
surgery in Africa is much broader, but less depth. Like we don't have any laparoscopic stuff. Of

525
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,880
course, we have any of the da Vinci, yeah, and all that and all this high tech stuff.

526
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:20,120
You trade off kind of depth of surgery for breadth. I felt after doing around 2000 C-sections and

527
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,920
over a thousand other major cases, I felt, okay, I think I can do whatever we're doing in aerobic,

528
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,120
I can do that, I think safely in Sudan. I mean, obviously, you know, we have complications and

529
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:36,680
other problems and there are a lot of limitations in terms of going into the case. So you tend to do

530
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,880
more laparotomies because you don't have a diagnosis. You don't have a CT scanner, right?

531
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,080
No CT scanner. You don't exactly what's going on to get a tissue diagnosis might take you six months.

532
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,320
So you say, go, Hey, let's do a laparotomy and see what that thing is. That's, that's your CT scan in

533
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,360
the end. But that's about the best you can do. So I think what I always, what I try to do when I

534
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,720
approach a case is, you know, the premium known known cherry first do no harm. So if you think

535
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,560
you'll make the patient worse by doing this, like, okay, I'm not an expert doing this case. And

536
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,080
sometimes I say, I'm not going to do it, you know, I won't, I won't do it. If I think I really cannot

537
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,800
improve this patient's health, I think, okay, this is too much of a risk. Sometimes I look, I just,

538
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm not really comfortable doing this, but usually I'll say, okay, I think it's better. If we

539
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,480
try to do this operation, I think we can, the patient can improve and we'll go ahead and it

540
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,520
works. I mean, it only works out pretty well. I was talking with my wife and my daughter a couple

541
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,040
days ago and about how we were going to be speaking today. And they had so many questions,

542
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,720
you know, we all watched the heart of new, but together. And one of the questions my wife had

543
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,800
was how do you deal with exactly that type of situation you described, which is what we would

544
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,440
consider quote unquote, end of life here in the United States or palliative care. What do you do

545
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,440
in a situation where somebody comes in and your judgment says this person is not an operative

546
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,240
candidate, but also by not operating, they need to be palliative. I mean, they're not going to,

547
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,520
they're not, it's not like, you know, they're going to walk home. How do you deal with that? And more

548
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,720
importantly, I guess, then medically, how you deal with that, it's emotionally and how is that

549
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,280
communicated to the community because you're still a foreigner, right? Right. Right. I'm still a

550
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,440
foreigner and we'll always be one. So I would say when we first started 10 years ago, people did not

551
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,400
trust us and it was incredibly nerve wracking, something we just got here. People kind of have

552
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,320
this because they've been, these people have been traumatized and oppressed for so many years.

553
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,200
They're not going to trust some foreigners showing up saying he's there to help them. So you got to

554
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,920
prove yourself something. Well, you know, it comes with these operations. What if we have bad outcomes?

555
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,200
You know, what happens? So it was really nerve wracking for all of us and, you know, thank God,

556
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:46,760
things went pretty well. We went ahead. So the issue with palliative care, you know, we try to

557
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,320
just talk to the family, talk to the patient, say, look, I think we can't do much for you. And

558
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,520
as if you go home, we'll take care of the pain and other things we can do. One good thing there

559
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,040
is the people, their expectations are extremely are low. And I'm not saying that negative, I'm

560
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,080
saying a positive way. They don't expect, they don't really expect miracles. They want to be

561
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,560
treated as a human. They want that human touch. They want to talk to us and talk to you and say,

562
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:18,040
okay, what can we do? If you tell them, look, we can't do much. They're not saying, they're not like,

563
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,440
they're not very demanding saying, no, you got to get it. Send me to Nairobi for a second opinion.

564
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,760
They're very accepting. I think that's just because of their lives are very hard. They're not used to

565
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,320
good outcomes. So I think first off, they're very accepting. So when you tell them, look,

566
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,960
I think there's not much we can do. We often will talk to the relatives culturally, usually

567
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,040
relatives will say, well, just, you know, they don't, they don't like telling the patient,

568
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,120
which is very different from here in the US. So we just talk with relatives and they're usually

569
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,800
very accepting. They say, okay, we, you know, we see a dumb jacan, we'll do, we'll take them home,

570
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,480
we become comfortable there. They have some of their local traditional things they might try with

571
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:00,600
the person at home, but there's usually very accepting of negative outcomes or bad news. When

572
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,760
you're kind of at the edge of survival all the time, when you get this kind of bad news, it's not so

573
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,040
shocking to you. It's like, well, you know, that's what happens. People die, you know, and

574
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,360
people have bad outcomes, bad things happen to you. So it's not so unusual for them. You know,

575
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,360
in the US, we're kind of anesthetized that everything has to be perfect. And we're not

576
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,440
supposed to die, we're supposed to, you know, have this kind of outlook on life. It's, it's a very

577
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,840
different way of doing things. So they're fairly easy in that respect. They understand this stuff,

578
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,280
you know, most people have some level of faith, whether Christian or Muslim, they can accept this

579
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:34,440
stuff in a theological sense also, it's not so difficult. When you showed up, how primitive

580
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,520
was the extent to which people were receiving, I don't know how to describe the type of care,

581
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,480
but there must have been local traditions and shaman and stuff like that, right? Right. And

582
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:52,200
at some point you're showing up and you're coming from a place of science as sort of simple as you

583
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,360
describe your work in medicine. It is still grounded in the fundamental principles of Western

584
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:02,040
medicine. And you use antibiotics, for example, you wash your hands before you operate. What was

585
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,720
the landscape like as far as the other types of medicine being practiced? And are they still being

586
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,160
practiced now? Yeah, they're still being practiced. So their scope of medicine, you have kind of the

587
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,840
local level in the home. And what they'll do is almost any febrile illness. So some kids got a

588
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,920
fever, someone's got a fever, they burn the person so that everybody there, my wife included, they

589
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,480
have burn marks. They look like cigarette burns. They're not cigarettes, but they take a round

590
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,440
thing that's put in the fire and they burn on the back of the wrist, back of the neck and the elbows.

591
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,600
There are certain points where they burn the person to try to release the whatever it is,

592
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,560
the spirit of evil humors that are causing the problem. When they see that kind of smoke and they

593
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,680
see the fat underneath the skin burning, they feel relief. Okay, the thing is gone now I'm better.

594
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,600
So they burn, they cut. A lot of people have cut marks in their arms or in the abdomens where they

595
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,000
think that'll also release things. They cut down to cause some blood loss. That'll release some of

596
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,960
the problem. And that's usually done in the home, usually by the father or the mother or the

597
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,360
grandparents will do that kind of thing. That's kind of the local treatment. That is still

598
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,240
practiced less so than when we came, I would say. I mean, everybody, all of our staff have burn marks

599
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,880
when they were kids. Now, we still see patients come with the burn marks. Someone comes with a

600
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,800
simple malaria. They've been at home four days and they've been roasting the kid. It's like,

601
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:27,880
why, you know, just gives a chance. Anyway, so burning, cutting, that's one level. They do have

602
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,880
some herbal remedies that don't seem that prevalent. They were there, I think traditionally,

603
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,760
some people still use those. And I don't know, you know, some they still swear by it. If you use

604
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,080
the neem tree or this Kayla, this plant that they use for malaria, they still swear that thing works

605
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,840
for the, for that. A lot of kind of local fruits and vegetables they use for, for GI problems or

606
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:53,400
other things. And those seem to work okay. And the third level is the, what's called the Kudur.

607
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,320
Kudur is like a shaman and the Kudur is like the priest for the, for the village.

608
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,440
The traditional legendary is ancestor, kind of ancestor worship. It's, it's communion with the,

609
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,920
with the ancestors. So if you're sick, if you have a problem, whether it's physical, psychological,

610
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,800
whatever, you go to the Kudur, you have a little ceremony with the family, all get together.

611
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,680
Kudur will talk with your ancestors and then kind of give a report back saying, well,

612
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,000
your kid is sick because you, your goats wandered on this guy's land and ate his crops.

613
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,480
So you need to make up with this guy and you go and give him something. And then you pay the Kudur

614
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,120
something. And then this thing is kind of lifted, child should get better. Those three things were

615
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,440
kind of traditional treatment. The Kudur is still very, very prevalent in this society. And they

616
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,240
still often go to the Kudur and they still will often delay in treatment when they go to the Kudur.

617
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,640
So how many people does your hospital serve?

618
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,480
Ketchman area is roughly a million. Anywhere from 70,000 to a million people is in our Ketchman area.

619
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,840
And the physical region is around the size of Austria, somewhere in that, in that range.

620
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,320
The people there, I, for example, how many of the people that you serve would understand

621
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,480
what you meant if you were going to New York? Like how big is their world?

622
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,880
Well, it's interesting you asked that. I mean, even the ones that have finished secondary school

623
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,440
wouldn't have an idea. Like if they ended up here or I mean, it would blow their mind.

624
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,600
Maybe I'll give an example. My mother-in-law is probably in her 70s. So we went to talk to,

625
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,320
my wife was talking about writing a book. Actually she started writing her book

626
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,960
and we went to my mother-in-law and we said, let's go and interview her mother as part of your book.

627
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,120
You know, I can write on it about her life. My wife didn't actually know a lot of facts about

628
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,960
her mother. They don't have that, you know, mothers and daughters there are not like buddy,

629
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,360
buddy, you know, the girls are, you know, once they, once they get weaned from the breast,

630
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,720
they start working, carrying water and firewood and everything else and cooking for the family.

631
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,800
So we went to talk to her mom and my wife asked her mother, her mother only speaks the tribal

632
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,000
language. She doesn't speak Arabic or English or anything else. So we talked to, she's talking

633
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,160
on the tribal language saying, do you know where Tom is from? And she said, she thought from it.

634
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,280
She says he's from Kenya. And she said, that's the furthest place she can imagine.

635
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,240
Right. Because she's heard of Kenya. So in her mind, anybody who's not from Nuba Mountains

636
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:19,080
must be from Kenya. It doesn't matter who you are, you know? So that's the outside world. And we say,

637
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,920
well, no, he's from America. You ever heard of America? No, she never heard of it. Had no concept

638
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,560
of America. Have you ever, you know what an ocean is? No concept of an ocean, no concept of a lake,

639
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,960
no concept of Africa. She didn't know she was in Africa. So what she knew was her local area,

640
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,360
just a few of the villages there. She'd been to Khartoum once. She's, my wife's mother has

641
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,120
leprosy. We've treated her for leprosy and have amputated, I think all of her fingers at one point

642
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,320
or another. She's really quite disabled. She got in the Khartoum some years previously to get

643
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,520
treatment there and ended up not getting treated. But besides that brief trip to Khartoum, she'd

644
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,720
never been out of that local area. A lot of my wife's siblings have never been out of this

645
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:04,360
15 square mile radius. You can't imagine the worldview. Presumably your wife also hadn't

646
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,760
experienced things outside of that until she met you. And what was the first time she left

647
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,320
or traveled with you? The first time? Especially that you don't travel much. Right. So the first

648
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,440
time we traveled was after we married was just this past June. We went to Armenia. So that was

649
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,720
really her first time out of rural Africa. She went to nursing school, but that was in South Sudan

650
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,400
in a while, which is, I mean for South Sudanese, they call it a city, but it's a village. It's a

651
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,080
big village. So imagine we went from either a refugee camp down to Juba, which is the capital.

652
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,640
I mean, Juba's more or less a city, but it's really not very nice. Then we fly from Juba to Dubai.

653
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,720
And we were in the Dubai airport. Which I was just there a month ago, even for someone who's,

654
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,360
from the United States, the Dubai airport is an overwhelming. Yeah. It's terrifyingly huge. It's

655
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,560
a city. It's a major city. So we get there and her eyes are the size of saucers.

656
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:05,960
Has she seen that much electricity in one place? No, I mean, not even close. Not even close. Has

657
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,440
she seen fresh water to that extent? No, I mean, I try to get, if she'd ever seen a tap. No, we had

658
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,480
taps in the hospital. We have a pump that pumps water up and we have some taps in the hospital.

659
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,800
But flush toilets, she never seen before about all this stuff. Elevators. So that was one of

660
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,600
the things we get in there. We're at the airport. We get in this pressure button, this door opens,

661
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,520
we get this thing and press the button, then the thing goes up and we get off. She's like,

662
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:38,680
what was that? So no concept in the elevator. We got in the escalator and she's falling over the

663
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,000
place. We go to get off the escalator. She's like, how's this thing moving? I think when she was in

664
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,080
there, she's going, wow, I think they had one set of stairs. There might've been a second floor,

665
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,720
but just the concept of walking up stairs is something strange, little moving staircase.

666
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,840
So all these things were very new to her. Now we get to Armenia and I mean, just being in a city,

667
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,680
I mean, the air van is a capital of Armenia, not like New York, but very different experience for

668
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,600
her. Now she came to the US for the first time just this past October. And I mean, she was in

669
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,800
Times Square. I mean, saw the ocean for the first time. She went to my brother lives in near Boston

670
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,720
on North Shore, Boston. So that was the first place she went. So first place she went to,

671
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:22,280
went to Boston and our hospital was getting an award by a group called Medicines for Humanity,

672
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,120
which supports us. And they were giving us an award for the work that our outreach team is doing.

673
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,520
So nobody can make it. I couldn't go. My other staff couldn't go. So my wife went to accept the

674
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:37,000
award on behalf of the staff. So she lands in Boston and the first thing she does is goes to

675
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,360
the Harvard club to get this award. It was very opulent place. It was my brother's place. He's

676
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,600
up in Rockport, Massachusetts. This is the ocean for the first time. She's a train for the first

677
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:54,840
time. Goes to malls to Walmart. She loved the dollar store. And my family just went crazy with

678
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:59,720
her. They had so much fun being with her, seeing all these things for the first time through her

679
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:05,800
eyes. And I mean, she has a very calm infectious joy to her and they really kind of tapped into

680
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,600
that. And it was really- And the flip side of that is we can sit here and have this discussion. And

681
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,960
of course, most of us would be thinking how amazing at all the things that they don't have.

682
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,040
But I'll share with you a story that I suspect will resonate and you will understand it.

683
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,920
This past Christmas, my daughter's school, each grade picks something they're going to do. And

684
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:37,000
that grade decided that they were going to buy Christmas presents for all of the kids at the

685
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,480
Sudanese Community Center in San Diego. And so they're basically all refugees. And this was very

686
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,120
interesting because we had already watched the Heart of Nuba, which was her first time even.

687
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:53,000
She didn't know what Sudan was and she certainly didn't understand why there would be refugees

688
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,400
leaving this place. So on the day that we take all the presents there and the kids have done

689
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,480
an amazing job, right? They've bought like four or five presents for each and every kid there. And

690
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,080
we spend the whole day there. So we go, it's my whole family. So it's me and my wife, three kids.

691
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:14,840
And our youngest is like a year and a half old. So there's another little kid there, a Sudanese girl,

692
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,000
who's also about the same age. So the two of them are playing together. But you feel like you've got

693
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,200
to sort of keep an eye on them because they can fall off the stairs or hurt themselves.

694
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,440
So there's a woman that's holding the Sudanese girl and she's sort of keeping an eye on our son

695
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,960
as well. And so that gives us time to go and do these other things and see the other kids and do

696
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:38,200
all the other stuff. And about four or five hours later when we're leaving, my wife goes over to the

697
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:44,360
woman who's has been holding this little Sudanese girl the whole time and says, what's your daughter's

698
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:51,160
name? And she says, oh, I don't know. This is not my daughter. I don't even know whose kid this is

699
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:57,960
basically. And we couldn't stop talking about that, right? Which was talk about a different sense of

700
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:04,760
community, right? There was nothing odd to this woman who was probably 20 to just say, hey, there's

701
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,680
like this little 18 month old running around. I'm going to take care of her. And by the way,

702
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:15,320
she's taking care of our kid too. And so for as many things as they lack, they have something we

703
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:21,080
don't have. Right. That type of centipede or something, you always hear about the negative side

704
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,640
of places like Sudan. People think of Sudan, what are the images, war, poverty, disease, starving kids.

705
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:33,080
The positive side is not shown. And some things that always stick in my mind. One is we'll have

706
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:38,600
patients that will come to us that it's a seven or eight day walk to reach us. And on the way,

707
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,600
like they'll start their journey and start walking. Now, at nighttime comes in the society there,

708
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:50,040
you can stop in somebody's hut and knock, you know, just kind of knock on the whatever or just show up

709
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,000
and say, look, I'm going, you know, I've got a long journey. Would you mind if I kind of spend the

710
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,680
night with you? I don't know. And we're safe. So that family will take this person in total stranger,

711
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,400
giving place to sleep, give them food, get some water for them to wash, take care of them that

712
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,960
night. The next day, I'll continue on his journey. Next day, stop at another total strangers place.

713
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,640
That stranger will take this person in, give him some food, hang out. This next day, same thing

714
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,360
until they reach the hospital. And this is the normal way of doing things there. The concept

715
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:25,000
of community and what stuff belongs to you. What is a stranger totally different than our outlook

716
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,000
here. So when you're there like, well, geez, who's really, really has it all and who's doing the right

717
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,760
thing, which society is on the right track, you know, it's really, it's really mind blowing. Well,

718
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:43,320
especially for you, because I guess it's one thing to know nothing that but you've seen both worlds.

719
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,800
And I've read enough about you to know, I've seen enough interviews to know, I mean,

720
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,600
correct me if I'm wrong, but you've described being more at home there than anywhere else.

721
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:59,640
Which I have to admit, you know, Tom, when I watch the videos of that, the first thought that comes

722
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,640
to my mind is not, I wish I was there. I realized that probably just speaks to me being sort of a

723
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:11,000
vapid, shallow person. But if I'm going to be brutally honest, right? I don't look at that and

724
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,840
think I want to be there. I think I would never want to give up my family. I would never want to

725
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:24,840
give up my comfort, my safety, my whatever. You couldn't fake it. I mean, so it's obviously so

726
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:30,120
genuine for you and any, you know, the other people like John, who are serving as missionaries there.

727
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,960
I know that on some level, you'll say the answer is faith, but there must be more to it than

728
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,760
simply your faith. Well, you know, some of it, Peter, I think is just, I think everybody is

729
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:44,760
kind of geared a bit differently. So, you know, we grew up in a big family and, you know, my

730
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,760
brothers could never, could never be there. But at the same time, I could not do what they're doing.

731
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,280
So I think, I think all of us are really, we're kind of wired a bit differently, even people in

732
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:57,720
the same family. So I think I'm very comfortable there, but I couldn't maybe fit working in New York,

733
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:03,880
you know? But I think the good thing is I don't attach your value to all this. Everybody has

734
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,560
something to contribute. I really, I really believe that. It's not just kind of blowing smoke.

735
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,480
My thing is being there to my mountains, you know, it's a part of the puzzle. Somebody else might be

736
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,360
in New York, but you're doing a podcast. You're helping us in Nuba tremendously by helping get

737
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,800
the message out, you know? If you're in Sudan doing the same work I'm doing, we don't have this,

738
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:32,040
you know? So I think everybody has something to offer. And if we try to get in this thinking,

739
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,880
like, gosh, I'm not doing what he's doing. I should be doing what he's doing. I think we

740
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:41,560
missed a point. We miss out on our shared abilities. You've got unbelievable talents

741
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:47,320
and a brain twice the size of mind, and you're using it in an area that you are comfortable with

742
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:53,240
that is probably maximizing your abilities. I think it's good to be aware of what's going on

743
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,600
in the world and everybody should think about their brothers and sisters elsewhere and contribute

744
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,080
and do something to help other people. At the same time, don't spend too much time

745
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,600
stressing that you're not doing enough, you're not doing anything. Do something,

746
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,840
but it shouldn't be something which is agonizingly painful. You know, I think just the way I'm

747
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:15,960
geared, that kind of life is a pretty comfortable fit for me, you know? So I don't see it. Yeah,

748
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:21,160
it's a sacrifice. It is. And I miss the family like crazy. And I'm missing a lot and not being

749
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,840
with my, man, I've spent more than three years since I've come here. I'm missing my parents,

750
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:31,240
my nieces and nephews, my brothers, my sister. I do. I miss all that stuff. But I'm pretty

751
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:38,520
comfortable in that weird remote setting in the mountains. So I learned about you through

752
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,000
my really dear friend Rick Gerson, his brother Mark Gerson, and ultimately

753
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,120
met John. And I think they learned about you through a piece that Nick Christophe wrote in

754
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:54,200
the New York Times in 2015. How did Nick come to find you? Because that story, we're going to link

755
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:59,080
to that story. The story is amazing, right? It leads off with about a 10 minute video that

756
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:06,600
I watched over and over and over again. And I came home and I made my family watch it.

757
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:14,600
And I sent it to my family back home. And there's a part in it that just says everything about it.

758
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,880
I mean, first of all, I think Christophe did an amazing job framing the story. And he was there,

759
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,960
which is in and of itself, I want to actually understand how someone actually gets there.

760
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:29,240
Because that strikes me as quite a challenge logistically. But he ends the article with a

761
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:36,120
story of a Muslim man who proclaims that you are Jesus Christ. And I always, it's the title of the

762
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:41,400
article, if I'm not mistaken, he's Jesus Christ, which coming from a Muslim man also speaks to the

763
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,160
religious harmony that you've described. And for people like me who aren't especially religious,

764
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:52,200
it makes you think, well, I guess that's what religion should be about, right? It shouldn't

765
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:59,000
be about most of what we think of religion as religion has has its taboos here. But I think the

766
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,880
point Christophe makes and makes it beautifully is, if you want to be critical of all of the religious

767
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:10,600
hypocrisy, by all means do so. But you can't then fail to acknowledge the times when in the name of

768
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,440
religion, people are doing these incredible things in the name of all religions, by the way, it's not

769
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,040
just your religion. I mean, as you know, it's people of all faiths that are doing these things.

770
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,880
But in many ways, I think that story brought amazing attention to your work that it breaks my

771
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,040
heart to think are there other toms out there whose stories are not being told? So how did

772
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,040
Christophe find you or how did you guys find each other?

773
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,400
He has an interest in Sudan, I think he's had it for a number of years. And I think for him,

774
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,480
he saw this, what Bashir was doing as such an egregious affront to humanity, that he felt

775
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,240
obligated to go and see firsthand what was happening. So he made a couple of trips into

776
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,240
the mountains, you can fly into Juba, then he got a flight up to the refugee camp in Eda,

777
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,640
and then managed to come into the mountains. You don't come in with official permission of the

778
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,680
Sudan government. So you're sneaking into the country. Right, because he's sneaking in, you get

779
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:02,200
a permit from the rebel government, and they allow you to come in. And I think he just has an interest

780
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,320
in that part of the world and really wanted to do something that shed light on the situation there

781
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,440
against Bashir. And he'd been into Nuba, I think, one previous time, and heard about the hospital

782
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,240
on the common see us there and see what kind of work we're doing to see for himself. And was there

783
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:23,000
for a few days. He's a really intrepid traveler and incredible journalist. I mean, he's unbelievable.

784
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:28,440
And what I respect about him the most is he can disagree with you, like, you know, whether

785
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,360
whatever, religiously, politically, not agree with your beliefs, but he can realize what you're doing

786
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,600
has benefit. You can look at it objectively and say, okay, you know, I don't believe in this

787
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,000
religion, but I see what these guys are doing and highlight that, you know, not many people are

788
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,480
willing to do that. I thought it was very elegant how he framed that in that piece in the New York

789
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,600
Times. And that video, though, it's only about 10 minutes. That was really my first introduction to

790
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,480
you, God, about three and a half years ago now. Right. So the world's a better place. Certainly

791
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,920
the Nuba mountains are a better place because of Nicholas's work. Right. And he tends to highlight

792
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,400
people that are kind of not well known. And there are others that are out there. And it's actually

793
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:13,480
part of what we're trying to now with Aurora. Aurora's focus is on highlighting what they say

794
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,240
is unsung heroes, but people that are kind of operating in the weeds that nobody knows about.

795
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,440
So shine a bit of spotlight on them, not so much for publicity, but to help them both in their,

796
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,000
in their work and to raise by raising their profile, you raise the issues that they're involved with.

797
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,680
So tell people a little bit about what the Aurora prize is and what it means for you to now be,

798
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:38,760
you're the 2018 recipient. Is that right? 2017. 2017 recipient. So what is the Aurora prize? I

799
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,680
know it's based on, I know a few things about it, so I'll fill in the little bits that I know.

800
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:48,120
It's a prize that has a finite life, correct? It was began in 2015 or 16 and it will run until about

801
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:53,880
2022, 23. And that duration, if I recall, is meant to commemorate the length of the Armenian genocide

802
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,160
in 1911-ish, 1915? Well, it's a hundred years onward. The genocide went on for about eight

803
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:05,720
years, 1915 and 1923. So this is a hundred years, henceforth, those eight years, those eight years

804
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:12,360
of the Aurora prize will be given out. Yes. And it's a, it's a substantial prize. You were selected

805
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:18,840
and my understanding is, first of all, it takes an act of Congress to get you out of Nuba to be doing

806
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:24,920
this other work, but it speaks to, I think, your understanding of how valuable this will be to the

807
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:30,200
broader mission that you're serving. Right. What I saw was I'm very comfortable being in Nuba and

808
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:36,600
doing the everyday medical work. And I definitely want to go back to that environment longer term

809
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,360
and get involved more with teaching the local people. And when these guys, once these guys come

810
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,840
back from medical school that we have out there, really working with them to get their skills up.

811
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:52,040
But I thought maybe using Aurora as a vehicle, it was time to come out to kind of see what was out

812
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:58,920
there with Aurora to try to expand the model that we have in Nuba mountains. So find a way to bridge

813
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:07,080
the gap between say big donors or people that have resources and small organizations, small people on

814
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,760
the ground that are kind of doing a lot of the grassroots work and doing it very efficiently.

815
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,240
Because I think there are a lot of other people that are doing the work nobody knows about.

816
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,760
And there should be a way to try to connect them to resources. So through Aurora, that's one of my

817
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,400
main goals. I wanted to come out and try to expand what we're doing. I felt that was we're in

818
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:30,280
Nuba doing our thing, but maybe a little bit pigeonholed. How do we expand that and get outside of

819
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:35,240
Nuba, get into South Sudan, to Central, from public to Chad, Tunisia, other places which are

820
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:40,760
really neglected parts of the world, hopefully into some conflict zones. That was my main thinking

821
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,240
coming out. And my time now I've got three months out of the mountains. I'm traveling all over the

822
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:50,840
place speaking on behalf of Aurora, kind of doing some basic of some promotion for them,

823
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:55,480
but also meeting a lot of people trying to formulate which direction we need to go in

824
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:59,960
Aurora. So I'll be physically out for these three months. It'll be three months later in the year

825
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,120
from September through November. Besides those two or three month periods, I'll be back into

826
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:08,840
the mountains, do my usual work at the hospital. What does more money solve in this problem? I

827
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,360
remember recently Mark sent us an update about sort of where the dollars were going. And it was

828
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:19,640
sort of hard to believe that so much could be done with so little. And I don't think the stats

829
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,120
are, I think they're so overwhelming that it's almost hard to put it in context, but it's worth

830
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:31,720
trying. For about a million dollars as an annual budget, what have you been able to do in the past

831
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:37,560
year? A million dollars is pretty generous. That's probably more than we'd need for the basic work.

832
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:45,480
But let's say if it's a million dollars, we can see about 130,000 outpatients. 130,000 outpatients

833
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:53,800
do close to 2000 operations, see maybe five, 6,000 inpatients. I mean, vaccinate tens of thousands

834
01:10:53,800 --> 01:11:00,520
of children. I'm not sure what numbers of maternity and antinatal clinic patients, but a lot,

835
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,080
several thousand eternity patients for that. A lot of that million dollars, I mean, most of that,

836
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,360
gosh, I think it's the number that comes that I use is about 750,000, but somewhere between

837
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:15,960
750,000 and a million, if I'm being conservative, if someone gave us a million bucks, we could easily

838
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,840
run the hospital for a year and probably expand quite a bit of what we're already doing. That'd

839
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:25,640
be a very generous amount of money for us for one year. Which is very interesting. Anyone

840
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,880
listening to this who has some understanding of the economics of the US healthcare system

841
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:36,280
would find everything you just said to be sort of comical because of just the costs here are

842
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:43,720
so artificial and so inflated and so ridiculous. Now, when you think about where those dollars go,

843
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:50,520
I mean, how do you get these supplies? I mean, where do these things come from? I remember once

844
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,760
asking, I knew somebody who was, I think, on the board of Doctors Without Borders and I said,

845
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,080
hey, how come you guys aren't in Sudan? Because I remember once reading, you guys couldn't even

846
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,920
get certain vaccines and antibiotics. You just physically couldn't get the supplies.

847
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,760
So you're really doing the work that nobody else can do here.

848
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,640
Yeah, it's tricky. I mean, our number one problem, when people say, what's your biggest

849
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,240
problem there? I always say logistics. It's the hardest thing because-

850
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,520
You don't have infrastructure.

851
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:21,400
Infrastructure is not there. And if we want anything, you want chemotherapy drugs, you want

852
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,720
antibiotics, you want the role of gauze, you've got to buy that in Nairobi. Nairobi is two

853
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:31,320
countries away. It's South Sudan and Kenya. So it's got to come from Nairobi. Like this past

854
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:37,080
shipment of drugs came from Nairobi by truck up to actually through Uganda, up to the border with

855
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,280
South Sudan, where they just harassed the heck out of the drivers and all kinds of people.

856
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,560
You have to bribe the guards?

857
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,560
You've got to bribe the guards and they give you a hard time and they don't want you going through

858
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,800
and they say, no, they're always changing the rules. You know, there's a duty, you've got to

859
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,360
have all this paperwork. I mean, just reams of paperwork to get this stuff through. So we've got

860
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:01,800
some people that are in Juba that don't actually work for us, but work for the church that help us

861
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:07,800
through all this process to get this truck through. Now, from there, there are, I don't know, 30 or 40

862
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,840
checkpoints from the border of Uganda and South Sudan up to the refugee camp in Iida. And it takes

863
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,600
a few weeks. It takes about three weeks to get up there just because of the checkpoints and the

864
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,200
delays and everything else. It can take three weeks to get up to this refugee camp in Iida.

865
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,640
Then from there, it's offloaded. We've got to go and pick it up. We've got to find a way to get it

866
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:31,720
from Iida up to our place. Wait, not you personally? No, not me personally, but we've got to get some

867
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,600
trucks or something to go down there and pick it up or find someone that can carry it for us.

868
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:43,400
And that's about six hours. It's not really a road. It's a dirt track. I mean, there aren't

869
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:48,520
roads there. These terrible dirt tracks you get from Iida to where we are. That's about six hours

870
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:54,600
on the best day just during the dry season. So rainy season, which runs from about June through

871
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:01,400
October, you can't go with the trucks. You can't really even go with a, like a Land Cruiser. Usually

872
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,240
we don't move at all. If you really had to get in or out at that time, you've got to go with a quad

873
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,160
bike. That can usually get you in or out, but sometimes even then if it's a flash, it was a

874
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,360
heavy rainfall and you have a flash flooding, these dry river beds, if that fills up with water, you've

875
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:20,920
got to wait. Maybe it's the way today, a few hours. So in the hospital on any given day, how

876
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:28,280
much do you have in terms of IV fluids, gauze, antibiotics, soap? Right. I mean, things that we

877
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:33,800
just, we can't even imagine not taking for granted in an American hospital. Right. I mean, if we have,

878
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,560
if this truck makes it through, because we make our order and we make a fairly generous order,

879
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,320
just because we know it's so difficult to get stuff out there. If that stuff makes it all through,

880
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,280
we're in pretty good shape. For how long? For a year. So we try to make it one full year on that

881
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,320
supply that gets sent in. And the problem comes because sometimes you order stuff in the Roby and

882
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,720
it's not in stock and you know, you just can't, you can't order one off things. There's no, there's

883
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,520
no system to get stuff up to us. That's really hard. If you can't load everything on that truck

884
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:06,600
for this one go, we're a bit stuck. You've got to really be creative trying to get these other small

885
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,560
things up. Is there like a chief logistics officer that is in charge of the ordering and

886
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:16,200
the procurement and the management of this product? Because that sounds like a, I mean, that's a,

887
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,160
that's a bottleneck, right? Yeah. It's a terrible job. So John Fielder through F commission healthcare

888
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,000
has a woman who's in his, he's gotten off the small office in Nairobi. They got a few staff.

889
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,560
So she did all of our procurement. So we sent her the list of things we needed. I mean, it's,

890
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:35,400
it's, it's a lot of items, a lot. So she has to go out and source all this stuff and get it in Nairobi

891
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:39,400
from a few different vendors, get the trucks or less stuff, get it through.

892
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,200
We've got a couple of people in Juba that help us with logistics that are not employees of ours,

893
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,960
but they're just kind of, they're helping us out. Just kind of random people and they can help

894
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:53,000
shepherd that stuff through. But it's, it's, it's really, really difficult. It's a lot of work for

895
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:01,080
those people. What does the pattern of mortality look like in Nuba? My guess is infant mortality

896
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:08,680
must still be quite high. Right. How much of that is due to challenges with prenatal care versus

897
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:14,840
the actual deliveries and postnatal care? I think a lot of the neonatal deaths are just from

898
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:21,160
difficult deliveries. You know, their baby gets asphyxiated, baby's born and dies. Is it still

899
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:28,520
born or die soon after birth? And there are very few deliveries done. I mean, 99% of women there

900
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:34,120
still live at home. To deliver in a clinic with maybe a traditional birth attendant is rare,

901
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,080
let alone in a hospital. So I think a lot of it is just due to, you know, most of those people

902
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,880
probably would end up in a C-section with a C-section if they were at a hospital in the U.S.

903
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,480
or even in Kenya, if they had access to care or they would have the C-section. We are, you know,

904
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,840
we have one place to do C-sections. There are actually two now that do C-sections. How many,

905
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:54,200
how many babies do you deliver in a typical year? I think there are maybe three or 400 in our hospital,

906
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,760
somewhere around there. Like we came with the exact number. So it's, you know, it's really, it's not,

907
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:06,040
it's a very small number compared to the number of deliveries. So the vast majority of women still

908
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:12,200
deliver at home. But you're doing presumably more of the high risk ones. I mean, if a child is

909
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:17,720
breached, is there, can you deliver a breached baby at home? That's, I mean, the risk would be

910
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,480
enormous, right? Right. Some make it out, but a lot of those babies are going to die because they

911
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:26,760
just get, they get stuck, they get asphyxiated and maybe dies. So I mean, when we do our antenatal

912
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,160
clinic, you know, these women will come and the midwife there fills the card out for them. It's

913
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,800
okay. They've had 10 deliveries and four living children. You know, this one died at birth, this

914
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,240
one died at birth, this one died from diarrhea, this one died from fever, you know, this kind of

915
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:43,400
thing. So it's a lot of- And what about the mothers? What is the maternal mortality like?

916
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:48,200
I don't know. That's something I really wish I could have a grip on because you hear occasionally,

917
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,120
you know, it's not that often we hear about it, but once we hear, oh yeah, this woman died from,

918
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,480
she bled to death, you know, after he'd been birthed to the baby at some remote village.

919
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:00,440
There's not really, it's so remote and people are so spread out. There's not really a system to

920
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:05,800
collect that kind of information. So I don't really know. It's got to be, it's got to happen because,

921
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,560
you know, we have a lot of women that we ended up doing C-sections on that would have died

922
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:15,960
without that. You know, how many times a baby is stuck? The mother's already septic and, you know,

923
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,200
we have to do a C-section or something. And this says nothing if preeclampsia and all of the other

924
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,280
things that would just show up even under the most normal, you know, circumstance. Right. And

925
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,840
getting women with eclampsia is not uncommon. So if we get a clampsia at home, especially young,

926
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,920
you know, Muslim are our prime whips that are very young, they're not going to survive when

927
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,520
they start convulsing. And to get to us is a chore. I mean, it's really hard to reach us.

928
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,440
What are the patterns of diseases like there? I mean, when we're watching, and again, I keep

929
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,880
mentioning this because it's just such an important film, The Heart of Nuba. You see these things that

930
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:54,280
you're doing, Tom, that just, I mean, they blow my mind. And maybe because I know enough about

931
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,840
medicine that I can watch what you're doing and appreciate, you know, the partial nephrectomies

932
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,720
you're doing on kids with, you know, tumors in their kidneys. And like, how did you even learn

933
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:09,000
to do that operation? Even within the realm of surgery, that's not a trivial operation to do on

934
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:15,160
a child that size. Yeah, I've done some nephrectomies before, total nephrectomies on for tumors or for

935
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:19,640
trauma or for whatever. So meaning remove the whole kidney. So I wasn't so worried about that,

936
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,240
but I was worried about was the other kidney. It's harder to take part of the kidney out because

937
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:27,080
you have to be able to preserve the blood flow to the part that remains. Right. And you know,

938
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,440
they can can bleed it. So if it was just say the tumor was partially involved in the kidney and

939
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,600
say you're doing the operation and you can't stop the bleeding, your backup is just to take the whole

940
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,520
thing out. But you couldn't do that in this case. Because this child had one kidney that had to

941
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,320
fully come out and then there was a partial note. So you basically, this kid would die if you

942
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,360
couldn't save half of the remaining kidney. Right. Exactly. So it was lower, the tumor wasn't lower

943
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:53,080
pole of the kidneys. So I had to take out half the kidney. So there was a visiting, actually a

944
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,760
visiting as a friend of mine who was visiting, he's a family practice doctor, Corey Chapman was there.

945
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,680
And we talked about this case and going back and forth and he said, let's look on YouTube.

946
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,880
If there's something, because I read, I'm reading about it and everything I was reading was talking

947
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:09,320
about all these fancy things. You know, there's some kind of a slush, like an ice slush that you

948
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:14,440
have to bathe the kidney in to get the metabolism way down. So you can do the operation, just

949
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:19,800
different things we didn't have. So we looked on YouTube and I'm just, when I think about it now,

950
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,480
I wonder how we did it because normally we can't watch YouTube there because we have internet,

951
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,720
we have a satellite dish, internet, but the speed is very, very slow. So normally we can't watch any

952
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,120
videos because it's just too, it's just too slow. But for some reason we were able to see this video

953
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,080
and it was this group of Polish surgeons that were doing the partial infrectum aid

954
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,880
and with a fairly low tech approach. So we watched that and said, okay, I think, I think I can do it

955
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,680
following what these guys are advising. We kind of followed their system, managed to put these

956
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,640
sort of buttresses like on the lower pole, the kidney to kind of staunch the bleeding and it

957
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,520
worked. And the kind of the child did very well. That was held by YouTube. I mean, I think that

958
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,920
really helped us out in that case. Like the Khan Academy of surgery. That's right.

959
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,800
How long do you just spend rounding? I mean, how many inpatient beds do you have in this hospital?

960
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,840
Yeah, it's 435 beds. And what's your typical capacity? I mean, your typical utilization,

961
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:14,600
how many patients are in there? I mean, it's, it's about a hundred percent occupancy. It's,

962
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,040
it's a bit less now than it was saying the peak of the fighting. When the peak of the fighting,

963
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:23,000
it was crazy. It'd be five, 500 people there, 550. So there were, you know, several children's

964
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,440
were several to a bed. We have wounded all over the place. I mean, not even in beds, just

965
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:34,920
wherever we could, we could fit them. It looks like when you see movies in war zones and you

966
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:43,000
see the tents that are serving as, you know, hospitals, and you just see amputation, nose

967
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,840
completely missing, you know, sort of the most gruesome things. That's what it looks like you're

968
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:54,840
in. I mean, you are literally in a war zone. I'm thinking back to residency. If we had to round on

969
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,960
20 patients in the morning, we were moaning and groaning like it was going to be the end of the,

970
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:05,640
oh my God, I'm not going to have time for breakfast today before the OR I've got to round on 24

971
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:11,400
patients. Yeah. So you're rounding on 300 patients. I mean, how, I don't even know how you do that.

972
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,280
Now probably 300. Those days was more. I mean, I remember one time we had this measles epidemic

973
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:21,560
and just on children's ward, we had 225 patients. So a hundred normal cases,

974
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,400
malaria's bowel structures. You don't have vaccines. I'm guessing. Is that the reason

975
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,000
they don't get the measles? We, with the first three years of the fighting, we didn't have them.

976
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,240
So the usual provider stopped providing them. The usual big organization that provides them

977
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:38,680
stop providing the vaccines. Why? Just logistically couldn't get them in. Logistically. And they,

978
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,720
we were in rebel held territory and a lot of these people, these big organizations don't

979
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,600
want to violate the sovereignty of the, of the host government by providing something as simple

980
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,240
as vaccines. This is just how it is, which really shocked me. The sovereignty of a government that

981
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:58,280
kills its own people. It needs to be respected. It's the theater of the absurd. It's crazy.

982
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:03,080
So, yeah, I mean, Ron's were just, they would take hours and we started at seven 30 in the

983
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,400
morning and two o'clock I'd be finishing up and just try to get through all those people.

984
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,160
But then you're, aren't you being interrupted every hour by some trauma that comes in?

985
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,760
Right. There's stuff coming in. There's stuff, there's other emergencies. I mean,

986
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,120
the other stuff was still coming. I mean, somebody comes into a woman who comes in,

987
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,720
was having a miscarriage, bleeding, we have to break into a C-section on somebody who can't

988
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:26,680
deliver. So all this stuff was still going on. It was, it was pretty crazy. I mean, it was,

989
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:32,200
you really had to just go as fast as you could. It was a lot of just putting out fires and we

990
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,320
weren't, we weren't able to spend a lot of time with these patients. Obviously it was really

991
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,120
got to go pretty rapid fire through all those cases. It was exhausting. Psychologically,

992
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,680
it was, it was rough. One of the other questions my daughter wanted me to ask you is,

993
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:51,000
what's the most afraid you've ever been there? You know, she was sort of taken aback and we told her

994
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,680
before the movie, I said, look, Olivia, this is, this isn't a Disney movie. You're going to see

995
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,400
people getting killed. You're going to see bombs dropping on innocent people. And it's not a movie.

996
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:07,080
It's real. Right. So are there times when you are just afraid for your own safety?

997
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:12,120
Yeah. You know, I think every time they bombed the hospital twice and they bombed our local region,

998
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,800
kind of within a half kilometer several times. So the first time the area was bombed,

999
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,400
we were at church and the church was just outdoors. It's not really church. It's kind of outdoors

1000
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,400
thing. And we were finishing up and the, the catechist was up there talking to people and we

1001
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,320
heard the airplane overhead. We were used to it because every day the airplane came overhead,

1002
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,600
but we'd never been immediate vicinity. They never had never been bombed. So we just got

1003
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,680
the airplanes over heads going to bomb somewhere. And is that because you had this belief that said

1004
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:43,320
even these people as wicked as they are, wouldn't actually bomb a hospital. Or is there some sort

1005
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,600
of view of we'll respect at least one sanctity of life. So that was, that was the bit in the back

1006
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,600
of our minds. And we had him in bombing. And this was, this was a couple years into it. All right. We

1007
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,280
had him in bomb directly. There weren't commercial flights. So anytime we heard an airplane, it was

1008
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:01,160
going to bomb somewhere. And then we hear the, we hear the airplane. Then invariably a few hours

1009
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:05,000
later, one day would show up a bomb somewhere and people are wounded in the wind. They show up.

1010
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,560
This day it was a bit different. We heard the airplane overhead and the mass was over. We're

1011
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:16,200
kind of standing there. All of a sudden somebody says, everybody get down. So we, we just dive on

1012
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,560
the ground. They were just lying flat. And I heard the airplane drone overhead, you know, this

1013
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:24,360
Antonov sound. Then I heard the pitch change. It sort of high pitched, like a whirring sound,

1014
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:29,880
almost like a jet engine noise. And then boom, this incredibly loud explosion. It felt like it

1015
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:33,960
was two feet away. I mean, it was like half a kilometer away. It wasn't right. But it was so

1016
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:39,960
loud. And it circled again. Then I realized that what that whirring sound was, was the sound of

1017
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,800
the bomb falling through the air. So then I now, so now I know what that sounds like. Then it's

1018
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:51,800
happened six bombs, six times. You kept hearing this thing comes around again, bombs. And you're

1019
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:58,520
lying there terrified thinking you just, you feel like you want to burrow yourself into the ground

1020
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,640
and disappear. You know, we just lying flat exposed thinking what, you know, what happens?

1021
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:08,680
And the thinking is not even so much being killed, but what if, what if my, you know, what if my leg

1022
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:13,240
is blown off or my arm gets blown off, you have no control over this. You're totally at the, at the

1023
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:18,280
mercy of these people. And you feel like you're, you feel like you're just in like a hunted animal.

1024
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:22,440
That's the, that's what I felt like. I felt like I'm, I'm a hunted animal. And at that time, since

1025
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,120
we hadn't been bombed, we didn't have the, the foxholes dug around. So immediately after that,

1026
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,800
we went and we dug foxholes all over the hospital grounds. And that's what you see in the film.

1027
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,080
There's actually one point when you're being interviewed and the bombs start coming in,

1028
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,280
you guys have to jump into these foxholes. Right. Right. And then another time we were

1029
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,240
bombed, I was in the hospital and just down on the, on the floor of the hospital, you know,

1030
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,480
you're thinking, well, you know, you're just, you're just thinking this, this might be it.

1031
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,400
This thing might, cause you can't tell where it's going to fall. You hear that whirring sound

1032
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,080
and we hear that whirring sound. You don't know if that's going to fall on top of you.

1033
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,200
It's going to fall right next to you and, and, and just then shatter your body.

1034
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,800
You have no idea. So it's really, it's, it's really terrifying. I mean, there's no other

1035
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,680
way to describe it. And I mean, you know, when you see this stuff that's happened in Syria,

1036
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:16,360
people living in these cities, I mean, you can, you can imagine what that is like and the kids

1037
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,440
that were in that situation. That's something you'll never, never outgrow that fear and that

1038
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,360
feeling of, of being bombed. You really, you feel like you're a hunted animal. I think it's the

1039
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:30,040
closest thing I can, not that I've ever been hunted or I'm an animal, but you just feel like,

1040
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:35,800
I remember thinking to myself, we were down, this is after, this is a few bombings later,

1041
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:43,480
we're down in the foxhole and there was a Sukhoi 24 jet going overhead. Sukhoi 24 is a supersonic

1042
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:48,520
jet bomber, you know, bombing villages, you know, huts. And thinking, what are these people doing?

1043
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,240
I remember thinking to these guys, I say, how can they bomb us? Don't they know there are people

1044
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:57,720
down here? That's what I felt. You know, like it was some exercise where they made a mistake.

1045
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,160
And of course they knew exactly there are people down there. That's why they're bombing, you know?

1046
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:08,360
But I, I really hope someday I will meet these pilots. Not that I don't even feel any animosity

1047
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,600
towards them. The feeling is never as strange. You don't feel anger. You don't feel animosity

1048
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,200
towards these people. Just kind of wonderment. Like what are they doing? Like why are they doing

1049
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:21,800
this? So I would love to meet these guys someday and say, what, what were you thinking? You know,

1050
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,160
what, what did they tell you before you did your mission? You know, I was a flight surgeon in the

1051
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:30,680
Navy. So I know you have a briefing before the pilots fly out. They discussed the mission today.

1052
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,640
We're going to fly here. We're going to bomb this target. This is our objective. What were you told

1053
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,880
in the briefing room? They say, okay, today guys are going to bomb a hospital. There are a bunch of

1054
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:45,640
civilians there. I mean, presumably if you're, if you're trying to put your psychology hat on,

1055
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:51,720
you have to believe that they are being told that the people that they are bombing are somehow

1056
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:56,680
a threat to them or their sovereignty or supporting rebels. I mean, you, you'd have to

1057
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:02,040
concoct a story that's so orthogonal to the truth. Right. Maybe that might be it because I mean,

1058
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:09,000
after one of the times the hospital was bombed, one of our staff heard a radio broadcast from

1059
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:14,040
Ella Bade, which is a city in the north. And the way they portrayed it on this radio was they

1060
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:19,480
admitted they bombed a hospital. They said we bombed an American church hospital in Cowra,

1061
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:24,600
which is the kind of capital of the rebel held territory, hospital taking care of the rebel

1062
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:30,600
soldiers. That's how it's portrayed. So you're an American hospital and America of course is a great

1063
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:37,400
enemy. It's a Christian hospital. Therefore they're no good and it's taking care of rebels. So you're,

1064
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:42,600
you're justified in this, in this act. And my guess would be that's what these guys were fed.

1065
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,040
Who knows that the pilots were true believers. I know work with a lot of pilots in the U S military

1066
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,400
and they would, they would not go along with the mission that they said, you're going to the

1067
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,840
Obama hospital with civilians. They wouldn't do it. We say, look, man, we're not doing this.

1068
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,920
I know these guys, they were not, these guys, they had, they loved the fly and they loved the

1069
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:04,360
country, but they were not interested in killing civilians. And, uh, I still hope someday I can

1070
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,240
meet these guys and just have a talk with them. And, uh, just to know what they were thinking and

1071
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:13,480
what, what went on in their brains, like whether they know this, how did they feel about it? I'm

1072
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:21,160
just interested in what they would, what they would say. How do you cope with what I could only imagine

1073
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:26,520
is stress and anxiety aren't the right words, but just sort of the gravity of it. Like, you know,

1074
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,920
when you describe a day in your life, you know, getting up at five 30 in the morning, making rounds

1075
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:38,440
at seven operating. If you said, Peter, you got to go do this for a month. I mean, first of all,

1076
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:42,840
I could provide no assistance to you. That's the unfortunate reality of it. Despite my medical

1077
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,480
training, all I would, I mean, I could, you know, put IVs in patients and that's about, I mean, I,

1078
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:52,600
I don't think I could provide any benefit, but let's assume I could even magically provide

1079
01:30:52,600 --> 01:31:00,040
benefit. I can't imagine how physically, but more so emotionally exhausted I would be

1080
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:06,280
at the end of 30 days. Right. Even thinking back to my training where, you know, you'd have

1081
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,240
every other night call, but on one of the nights in between, you didn't get to go home. And so you've

1082
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:17,400
been in the hospital for three and a half days and it's been one trauma after another. Like even that

1083
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:21,560
feeling is just as physically tired as you are. There's something different going on, which is

1084
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:30,120
just an emotional depletion. Right. So to imagine that you're now eight, no more, you're coming up

1085
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:36,600
to 11 years into this and this is just in Sudan. Right. I don't understand how you can do that.

1086
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:41,960
I think it hit the nail on the head. I think probably the emotional trauma and upset is

1087
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,600
probably worse than the physical degradation your body takes by just always being on call and just,

1088
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,760
even when you're not called at night, it's hard to sleep. You know, there's a lot of

1089
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,000
kind of fear and worry about things, but there's always that less so now because they're not

1090
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,480
bombing, but there's always that sense of worry about there being physical danger. But even when

1091
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:03,960
you're out of that, when the physical, the risk of physical danger is not there, it's just the

1092
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:09,400
psychological thought of always being responsible for the, for the patients and not having a

1093
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:14,040
psychological rest. Like I can't refer these people somewhere. There are other colleagues

1094
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:19,720
we can talk to or get an advice on or have somebody else see these patients. It is very

1095
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:26,040
draining. And I don't know. I just, you know, a couple of things is one, of course, is I do draw

1096
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:31,960
on my faith all the time. And I think that does help me keep centered a lot. You know, I go to

1097
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:37,240
church every day and that's, I think helps put things in a bit of perspective. That's just how

1098
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:42,920
it is. And besides that, I think you see the people there, they see the strength and resilience

1099
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:48,120
of the Nuba people. You say, well, okay, if they can put up with this environment and keep functioning,

1100
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:53,720
keep going ahead, let me just try to keep taking care of them as best I can. So I definitely get a

1101
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:58,680
lot of strength from the people there and their attitudes. They've been in this for their whole

1102
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,760
lives and they're, they're not giving up, they're pushing ahead with things. So let me see if I can

1103
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:08,600
also just keep going. It's not easy by any stretch, both physically and mentally and emotionally. It's,

1104
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,240
it's, it's very, very draining. But I don't know, it's weird. I mean, you get up in the morning and

1105
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:18,840
you, you know, had this huge number of patients to get through and you kind of say, man, I'm sure

1106
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:23,480
if I can, so I'm tired already. Like I feel like I kind of see the first few and then you, before

1107
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,840
you know it, you're finished with the children's ward. Take a deep breath. Okay. I got through all

1108
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:31,640
the children. Now we go to the female ward, you get through there, you pick up pace a bit, you get to

1109
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:36,360
the male ward, you go through them, see the maternity patients. Now it's one o'clock. Okay,

1110
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:40,200
I finished the rounds. We go to clinic, go to clinic and there's a big line of people.

1111
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:47,240
How many patients would you see in clinic typically? Uh, maybe 40, 50. Again, I don't even

1112
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:51,240
know what that means. I mean, I think most U.S. physicians would have a hard time seeing that many

1113
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:57,640
patients in a week in clinic. Do you have any blood tests you can do? Can you do CBCs or UAs even? I

1114
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:03,960
mean, what's the extent to your diagnostic toolkit? So until recently you had nothing. I mean, now you

1115
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,640
have an ultrasound. Right. We've had the ultrasound from the, from the beginning. Okay. So we've had

1116
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,800
that the whole time. That's been hugely helpful. You don't have an x-ray machine. X-ray we do now.

1117
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,880
Okay. So we just got that about a year ago. So you can do a chest x-ray at least if you want some

1118
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,200
assistance with, does this person have pneumonia or a pneumothorax or something like that? Right.

1119
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:25,640
So prior to a year ago, we didn't have the x-ray. Now we do. It's, it's been a help. Lab has been

1120
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:31,640
difficult. We can do a urine, we can do a stool, we can do a hemoglobin. Sometimes we can do a CBC,

1121
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,160
but the machine always seems to be broken. You know, we'll get in the machine, work it for a while,

1122
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:41,800
then it just stops working. You can't do a CBC. Chemistry tests, we can sometimes do a creatinine,

1123
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:46,120
but then the machine breaks and you know, you can't do a creatinine. Sometimes you can do

1124
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,680
ALT, ST, machine breaks, can't do anything. But would those things matter? In other words,

1125
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:56,760
if, if, if someone's listening to this and says, well, gosh, if it's $50,000 to buy a new lab,

1126
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,400
piece of laboratory equipment, can we have one of those, you know, brought in with next year's

1127
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:07,240
supplies. Would that change, would that make life easier for the care you guys provide?

1128
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:12,440
It would help. And you know, like there's a, just saw this chemistry analyzer, it's called a piccolo,

1129
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,520
which is supposed to be kind of built for these remote locations. It's pretty doctorproof. I mean,

1130
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:20,680
you kind of have this thing, it's pretty hard to slip in a disc, you put a drop of blood on it,

1131
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:24,600
and it gives you results. So our guys in lab can do that. Not our lives, our guys in lab can do the

1132
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,160
other tests, but the machines are just very, it's less about the human. It's more about the, you need

1133
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:35,160
a robust machine. A very robust machine. So this is kind of a thing. And that's about 14 grand. If we

1134
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:39,800
have one of those and some of the discs, which have the reagents kind of embedded in them.

1135
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:45,160
So if you had a year's supply of, of test strips or reagent discs, and then the machine,

1136
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:51,640
you could do a CBC and a chem seven or a metabolic panel of some sort. Right. That would, yeah,

1137
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:56,040
that would definitely help. We're pretty limited. We can do a peripheral blood film. So taking blood,

1138
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:00,280
guys can do the film. We can look at that. So you're a pathologist now too. Yeah. And a very

1139
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:05,400
hematologist. I'm terrible at it, but I can pick up like a chronic leukemia, chronic myologist,

1140
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,960
chronic mycocetic or an acute leukemia. Those are, if it's pretty obvious, we can pick those up. But

1141
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:14,040
a lot of blood films, I'm baffled. And when you have a child that has leukemia, I assume you send

1142
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:20,360
them to Kenya. It's impossible. Why? It's too far. It's too expensive. It's too difficult. Like this,

1143
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:26,440
the administrative stuff to get them there and the chance in Kenya of them being, I mean, maybe at a

1144
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:30,600
higher end hospital, they could get decent care, but they're just, we just can't do it. So what do

1145
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:35,800
you, can you treat with chemotherapy, a child? Not with leukemia. If a child has leukemia, we often

1146
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:41,960
will give steroids to try to, you know, sell them a bit of care for leukemias for chronic leukemias.

1147
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:46,280
These are again, are usually adults. If it's a chronic liposylic leukemia, we'll treat them with

1148
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:49,960
cyclophosphamide. We don't have tablets. We'll give periodic injections and that can kind of

1149
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:56,840
wail them a bit. CML, chronic myosinable leukemia. We don't have treatment for, I would like to have

1150
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:01,240
at least, at least some hydroxyurea, which is kind of an older drug for it. You know this drug,

1151
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:05,640
GleeVac. Yeah. It's just about to say GleeVac would cure most cases of CML. I mean, it's a very

1152
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,400
expensive drug in the United States, of course. That's the problem. So with GleeVac, I was so

1153
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:14,920
excited like a month or two ago. I'm reading that GleeVac is now in generic. Oh my God, maybe we can

1154
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,680
buy GleeVac because we get a few a year. We don't get a huge number of CML patients. We get a few.

1155
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,720
I'm thinking, man, we wouldn't need a huge amount. You know, so

1156
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:27,560
to look it up and it's okay, GleeVac is going on generic. So the price went from 8,000 a month

1157
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:33,880
to 7,000 a month. Yeah. This is another one of these ridiculous systems, you know, problems,

1158
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:39,480
which is a lot of times when drugs go from being branded to generic, there's virtually no change in

1159
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,640
price. Right. We just can't do that. You know, there are a lot of things that are just beyond

1160
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,600
our scope of being able to pay for it. That's something that to me is,

1161
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,960
it's really difficult to consider. I mean, if, you know, we can be as critical as we want of the US

1162
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:58,040
healthcare system for all of its buffoonery, but in large part, it's because we can be buffoons.

1163
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:02,600
Right. Right. It's because we have infinite resources, though we don't, right? But in the

1164
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:08,840
short term, we have infinite resources. And so we never have to ask the question of what are we

1165
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:15,720
optimizing for and how do we triage expenses? On the other hand, you're faced with that decision

1166
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:21,880
every single day. Right. So you would look at a patient with CML and say, we're not going to

1167
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:27,800
spend $80,000 a year to save this person's life because as much as we believe every life is equal,

1168
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:33,720
we sort of know that $80,000 can save a hundred lives in another way. And are you the one that

1169
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:39,400
has to make that decision by yourself? Yeah, it's agonizing. It's absolutely agonizing. That's,

1170
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:43,720
that's, I mean, that's just one example of money. I've got a woman that comes all the time with CML

1171
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:49,640
and she's got a huge spleen that hurts. She's anemic and she got a bunch of kids. I got to

1172
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:54,760
talk to her in clinic and try to figure something out with her. And she walks, I don't know how long,

1173
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:00,520
how far she walks to reach us. I mean, it's absolutely agonizing. I cannot send her anywhere.

1174
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:07,160
There's just this totally impossible. You just can't do it. So if we had, we wouldn't need

1175
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:11,960
mountains of GleeVac. I mean, a small amount would be enough to at least get her through a year.

1176
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,880
There are a few people that have CML. It's a few. It's not a huge number. If someone's listening to

1177
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,880
this and they say, I'm going to tell you a story in a moment called the starfish story, but I want

1178
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:24,280
to save one starfish. That's, that's, I'll tell you the story. Logistically, would it even be

1179
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:28,600
possible for someone to provide one year's worth of GleeVac to a patient in your hospital? Is that

1180
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:33,080
something that they could do through the American, the African mission? How would someone even

1181
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:38,760
logistically go about providing specific or project-based funding to your mission?

1182
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:44,600
If they could get the drug, certainly had access to the physical drug here in the US. Maybe if

1183
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:50,520
they sent it to say the Catholic Medical Mission Board, which is my sponsoring lay sending agency,

1184
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:55,320
and they also help us a lot with logistics and with the overall managing the hospital,

1185
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:58,840
they might be able to find a way to get it down to us, at least get it to Juba and then we could

1186
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,880
figure out a way to get it up to us. If they could get the physical drug, there was a program when I

1187
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:08,840
was on Armenia the time before last, we met some guys and there's supposedly some GleeVac program

1188
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,120
that you can register. Like the patient can register and they can get drugs at either low

1189
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,800
cost or no cost. So we went through all this thing, counted the person, she said, okay, all you have to

1190
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:22,680
do is take, fill out these forms, have the patient go to a cartoon, get the drugs. That's absolutely

1191
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:27,160
impossible. We can't get the cartoon. That's on the other side of the enemy lines and you just

1192
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:33,880
can't reach there. Which gets back to your point of providing the money is half the battle, but the

1193
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:38,680
logistics of actually getting it in there. And I mean, just spit balling, you can't have these

1194
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:43,640
things air dropped or air lifted in because the enemy fighters will obliterate anything that's

1195
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:48,360
trying to, it's not like you can fly the Cessna in there to get this stuff in there. There's been no

1196
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:54,600
non bombing aircraft in our airspace for, it's been since November, 2011. So, so even foundations

1197
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,840
like the Gates foundations, which do a ton of great stuff in Africa, I mean, Sudan is basically off

1198
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:04,520
limits. You know, so they were able to provide money for a bunch of GleeVac. One of the problems

1199
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,560
and one of the problems I've, I've decided to go with Aurora is a lot of these funds are kind of

1200
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:15,400
unassailable. If you're like, I'm an individual or even a small organization that's trying to apply

1201
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:20,600
to one of these big organizations to just get through that application process to get funds

1202
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:25,800
and then to account for it and do monitoring evaluation and follow up. It's a very daunting

1203
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:33,160
task. You need, you need people who are trained in this area of writing proposals and monitoring

1204
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:37,960
evaluation, all this sort of stuff to really follow through with all this. It's very difficult

1205
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:42,680
to access some of these big funds and big organizations. You know, a lot of these bigger

1206
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:48,520
groups are set up to do that kind of work and their administrative size has grown exponentially

1207
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,840
because in order to get these, this funding, you need a big administrative staff to apply for the

1208
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:55,960
funds and follow up and accountability and accounting and all that kind of stuff. Right.

1209
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:00,840
And you, I mean, you've got tons of extra time, I'm sure to do that, right? I just can't, I just

1210
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:05,960
can't do it. I just can't do it unless it can be made fairly simple. Or someone's okay, if I got

1211
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,960
the drug, I'll send it to Catholic Medical Mission Board and then Catholic Medical Mission Board will

1212
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,360
send it down and we get the drug, you know, at least as far as Juba and we can try to figure

1213
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:19,320
out a way to get it up. But it's just, it's really, there's a problem with access and just getting

1214
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:25,000
through the administrative things you have to do to get some of this stuff. There's, so there,

1215
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,760
there are several kind of different levels of, of difficulty. So going back to the sort of state of

1216
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:36,920
diseases you see, if a person makes it out of their sort of the young life, right? If a person's

1217
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:43,320
sort of your age or my age, what are they going to die from? Middle-aged people, we have a lot of

1218
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:50,600
cirrhosis liver cancers and that's, there's a huge, hepatitis B. Yeah, huge. Like we do, we screen all

1219
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:56,200
of our pregnant women for hep B. Do you guys have a hep B vaccination program? We do, we do. The

1220
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,120
reason we started screening the, the pregnant women is just to get an idea about the basic rate. And

1221
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:05,400
it's about close to 20%. Hepatitis B positive, just in general populations are people who are

1222
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:10,360
not sick. They're pregnant with children. So what we're doing is we encourage the mother when the

1223
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:16,440
baby's born, we give the baby hepatitis B vaccine immediately after birth. And we hope with that,

1224
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,880
that we'll stop preventing this baby from getting hepatitis B as it get older and prevent all the

1225
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:25,240
complications from that. We haven't really scaled up to the point where we have so many

1226
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,280
heavy positive people. And can you only vaccinate the women who are coming in for deliveries or are

1227
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:35,400
you able to get the vaccine into the community for the women who are still delivering at home?

1228
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:40,280
No, we haven't, we haven't reached that point yet. So you're only scratching the surface then

1229
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:44,760
because the majority of these birds are outside of your hospital. Right. Exactly. I mean, eventually

1230
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:48,760
we like to have kind of midwives these places and have the testing capability to test all these

1231
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:54,600
people for hepatitis B. Or if people delivered in these clinics, you say, look, we can't do the test

1232
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:58,280
thing, but we just give the vaccine. We'll assume the kid has hepatitis B, give the vaccine because

1233
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:02,440
they have to get hepatitis B anyway as part of the pentavalent series. So after that first shot,

1234
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:07,080
we continue with pentavalent, which is DPT, diptheroid apoptosis tetanus, hepatitis B,

1235
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:12,680
and amylolus influenza B. I've heard that kids actually can get diphtheria in Africa. Yeah.

1236
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:17,720
Has there been a case of diphtheria in the United States since the forties? No, I think that I think

1237
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:22,040
I don't even know what diphtheria is. I mean, like, I'm, it sounds stupid to say that, but I remember

1238
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,560
learning about it in medical school and I know we all get the vaccine for it. What, what is the

1239
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:30,440
disease? What is, how does it manifest? We've only had, from what I remember, one case, and I think

1240
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:35,320
she had the diphtheria, it was in an adult, but it's a grinding bacteria, nithyrii, and it's a

1241
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:40,840
bacterial infection. It affects the throat and they get like a, it looks almost like a thick scab

1242
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:47,400
that forms in the throat. They kind of die from airway problems. You know, just think it's thick

1243
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,600
and they can't, they swallow, they can't really breathe well and they can die from airway problems.

1244
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:56,200
It's a horrible, really a terrible disease. And you mentioned your mother-in-law has leprosy. Right.

1245
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:01,560
Again, I've never seen that in my life. It's a bacteria as well. It's, is it in the tuberculosis

1246
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:08,200
family or something? Exactly. It's mycobacterium lepri. It's a mycobacterium and it's transmitted

1247
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:14,040
by respiratory droplets. Oh, it's not by touch. I thought leprosy was sort of contagious through

1248
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:18,520
touch. Yeah, that's, that's, that's, Is that a wives tale? Yeah, it's really transmitted by respiratory

1249
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:23,800
droplets and it should be prolonged close contact. So somewhat similar to TB. It's not a real,

1250
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:29,400
it's a very slow growing organism, but prolonged close contact respiratory droplets, you can affect

1251
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:35,000
it. It affects the nerves in the skin and with that nerve infection, people lose sensation. They,

1252
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,160
they get cuts or wounds and they don't take care of things. They burn themselves. They don't pay

1253
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:43,640
attention to it gets infected, bone gets infected and you have to amputate the digit. Are these

1254
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:49,480
people prior to your arrival that were kind of outcast and they would be not touched or anything

1255
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:55,000
like that? Yeah, there was definitely discrimination against them. They didn't have like separate

1256
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,040
places where they would make them outcast, but people would kind of avoid them. Like my mother-in-law

1257
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:05,320
still, I think a lot of it was the people themselves would kind of withdraw due to shame

1258
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:10,200
and due to the fear of giving it to somebody else. Like my mother-in-law kind of withdrew. She stays

1259
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:14,200
by herself. She doesn't eat with the other family. They keep telling her, look, come and eat with us

1260
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:18,280
is okay, but she will not come and eat with other people. She always insists to kind of eat by

1261
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:24,120
herself. She does it herself. She's kind of self-isolation from society. She's pulled herself out.

1262
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:27,880
So she'll talk to you in chat and interact with you, but then with eating and with more social

1263
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:32,760
interactions, she'll kind of pull back and eat by herself. And how prevalent is tuberculosis?

1264
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:38,680
Very, very prevalent. And for our place, our HIV rate is quite low. Which is what? It's less than,

1265
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:43,000
much less than 1%. Oh, wow. Maybe point something, maybe 0.1%.

1266
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:49,480
And is that an artifact of where you are geographically? Or is that as part of the

1267
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:53,880
benefit of some of the aid relief that made its way in the early part of 2000s?

1268
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:59,640
Yeah, I think the main reason is our isolation. Is there drug use there? Prostitution, I mean,

1269
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:03,640
which I assume would be the two most dominant modes of transmission? No, prostitution is not

1270
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:08,920
really part of that society. And IV drug use is unheard of. It's all through, like with most of

1271
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:14,600
Africa, is through heterosexual transmission. And I think just the starting to get a little bit of

1272
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:20,760
a toehold in Nuba, but still our rate is very low. I'm worried that if peace comes and the place

1273
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:24,920
opens up and you've got more movement of people in and out, the rate is going to skyrocket. That's

1274
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:29,800
what happened in South Sudan. The NITIS is there because we have a lot of STDs. Ghanri is very

1275
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:37,000
common syphilis. Do you see tertiary syphilis in really advanced cases? I don't think so,

1276
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,520
but maybe some of the stuff we're seeing is just undiagnosed tertiary syphilis. I don't know.

1277
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,920
I don't think we see it. What I see as syphilis is we do a VDRL test and we have a lot of VDRL

1278
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:50,600
positives, which are not a very accurate test. We have a lot of false positives. We have a lot of

1279
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:56,200
VDRL, or RPR positive people. We do that screening. We're just screening now with the

1280
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:01,320
pregnant mothers for VDRL and we have a lot of positivity. We don't see the shankers or the

1281
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:05,560
secondary syphilis. That's really, really rare, but the VDRL positives are very common.

1282
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,400
We talked about liver cancer. Do you see heart disease?

1283
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:15,880
No, heart failure. In the older population, we'll see a fair bit of heart failure. Somebody may be

1284
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:20,520
in their 60s, 70s, that's in heart failure. It's like bacterial or I remember there was some

1285
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,720
bacteria like shagas, something or other that would weaken the heart muscle. Is it that type of a

1286
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:30,200
heart failure? Yeah, no, we don't have shagas disease in our area. It's just old age. Do you

1287
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:34,840
think it's atherosclerotic in origin? I don't think so. I've never seen anybody that could say,

1288
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:40,440
I think this person had an MI, just not a single one in 10 and a half years. Some is hypertension,

1289
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:45,960
just kind of untreated hypertension. We'll let people come in with blood pressure of 250 over 180.

1290
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:52,520
Really? Yeah. How prevalent is obesity over weight type 2 diabetes?

1291
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:59,320
Obesity about 0.0001%, almost non-existent. An occasional person is a bit over weight, but

1292
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:04,120
really, really rare. How often do you see type 2 diabetes?

1293
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:08,920
We'll see it. Not so prevalent, but it's definitely there. Somebody's see older people

1294
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:13,480
come in and just new diagnosis of diabetes. Maybe someone has 40s or 50s.

1295
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:17,320
Do you ever see fatty liver? Like when you're operating on a patient, do you ever

1296
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:24,600
see that the liver is fatty? No, I can't remember a single case when I've seen fatty liver.

1297
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:32,280
You do so much cancer surgery, especially in children, but they're cancers. We don't see that

1298
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:39,080
much here. What types of cancers do the people in Nuba get versus basically not get? In the United

1299
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:44,920
States, of course, you'd have lung, breast, colon, prostate, or the lion's share of cancers,

1300
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:51,160
followed by pancreas. Those are the big five. How prevalent are those cancers in Nuba?

1301
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:56,520
Not so. If we go to kids first, or burka-sling-phoma is fairly common.

1302
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:00,440
That's an EBV related, if I recall. Epstein-Barr virus is?

1303
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:05,800
Epstein-Barr virus. You really just see that in Laryaholo endemic regions. We're in that,

1304
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:11,400
it's called a burka zone. That's a great cancer because it's curable with just cyclophosphamide.

1305
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:16,280
Six courses, cyclophosphamide, and you cure a cancer is great, very satisfying,

1306
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:21,640
but it's rare to have a cancer you can cure, obviously. For adults, liver cancer is probably

1307
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:26,120
most common. That's all I think all- That's a paticellular carcinoma?

1308
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:31,080
Paticellular carcinoma, and probably all related to hepatitis B positivity. They drink a fair bit.

1309
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:36,600
There's a local beer they make sorghum, but the alcohol content is not very high. It's fully weak.

1310
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:41,880
It's a hep B related cancer with liver. We have a fair bit of cancer with the cervix.

1311
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:45,320
For females, probably cancer with cervix is the most common.

1312
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:49,400
Can you screen for HPV? You're the local gynecologist as well.

1313
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:55,160
Can you do a pap smear? No. Pap smear would be a little bit impractical because we have to do

1314
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:59,480
a swab and get that sent off and do it high level, get it off to a pathologist.

1315
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:04,840
Again, if someone were listening to this and said, oh my God, if I could have an impact on

1316
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:10,600
eradicating cervical cancer for these women, is that even feasible to have the equipment there

1317
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:17,080
after you do the swab assessed for HPV? No. For cancer cervix, two approaches.

1318
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:25,400
One would be this Gardasil, the HPV vaccine, were made available either at very low cost or just

1319
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:30,280
giving us part of, I think it's actually just heard today as part of the WHO package. So they

1320
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:35,160
can be integrated into the system where HPV is given to young girls, even young boys.

1321
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:41,240
But then we're back to the logistics problem. Even if the WHO or any of the foundations came

1322
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:47,320
along and said, we want to provide HPV vaccination en masse to Africa, you're still somewhat excluded.

1323
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,520
We give other vaccines. If they can be lumped into your annual supplies.

1324
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:57,320
Just do it to get stuff out there. But if you do it in one big push, get it out there. It's got

1325
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,120
to be all cold chain. It's really hard, but it's doable. Get this stuff out there, one big push.

1326
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:07,000
That will make a huge difference. We'll start with that. The treat cancer, the cervix treat

1327
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,880
earlier versions, they call it a see and treat technique. I've not done it, but it's not.

1328
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,600
There's probably a YouTube video on it.

1329
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,040
There probably is, I think. I think there is actually. You paint the cervix with something.

1330
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:21,800
I can't remember. It's iodine or some substance and you look for irregularities in the cervix

1331
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:27,880
and then you freeze it. You have the little liquid nitrogen cylinder with some probes,

1332
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:32,920
put that in the cervix and you freeze it, make a nice ball of the cervix. Then you kill those

1333
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:36,360
pre-cancerous cells and hopefully those people will not go on to develop invasive cancer,

1334
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:41,800
the cervix. You would need some personnel for that because that would be pretty labor intensive.

1335
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:45,080
That's more of a preventive medicine thing. We come in, examine them because you're not

1336
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:49,080
treating people with the cancers. You want to get the pre-cancerous lesions. You get the screen and

1337
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,520
do a lot of these screening things. We paint the cervix with some substance.

1338
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:59,480
Look and see. You don't even need a colposcope. It's something even more simple than that.

1339
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,600
I know they're doing it in Uganda and they have this equipment.

1340
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:07,640
So that might be covered in between thing before Gardasil becomes available. At least we do a

1341
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:12,920
screening of young women. Check the cervix, see what it looks like when you paint this stuff,

1342
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,120
and then treat with liquid nitrogen. We don't have the equipment. I think that stuff is there

1343
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:21,800
nor the knowledge to do it. What about breast cancer? How prevalent is that?

1344
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:26,840
It's definitely there. The problem with breast cancer is by the time we diagnose it,

1345
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:29,640
we only diagnose so we can feel a lump. No one's getting a mammogram.

1346
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:34,280
Right. No mammograms or we don't do other stuff to diagnose it, memorize what we have.

1347
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:38,680
So women present with a palpable mass that they're feeling and they show up.

1348
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:43,240
Right. So usually they come with a palpable mass and they already have a nose and things that look.

1349
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:47,880
So in that situation, you still do modified radical mastectomies?

1350
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:51,800
We do. We usually do a modified radical mastectomy and then follow with Adriamycin,

1351
01:53:51,800 --> 01:54:12,020
S

1352
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:16,580
I really don't think it's doing much. So it's really frustrating.

1353
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:21,380
Would getting a mammogram machine add value? I mean, of course, there's all the futility and

1354
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:25,300
the controversy around mammography per se, but I'm just sort of thinking of like,

1355
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:31,700
what are some finite resources that could be added to, I mean, you're serving a million people

1356
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:38,260
basically that live in a world we can't even imagine as far as even the simplest acts of

1357
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:43,140
prevention. Right. The problem with that to do the screening, the scale up to that level.

1358
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:45,860
Yeah. You need a whole new staff to get people through.

1359
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:50,100
Right. And the same thing with cancer, server screening, it's maybe possible. So it's not just

1360
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:54,340
a matter of supplying the machine. You need the radio. You need someone who's dedicated to reading

1361
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:59,860
mammograms all day long. Or I mean, I guess the other option is, I mean, AI should actually make

1362
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:04,660
mammography. This is probably one of the most important applications of machine learning is

1363
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:10,020
actually reading x-rays. And you wouldn't even need a radiologist at some point. There will be a

1364
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:15,620
day when you could run a million women through a mammogram in a year and there's a machine that's

1365
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:18,980
reading it and basically giving you the answer. And then now you still need the logistics of a

1366
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:24,020
person taking the patients through the machine and operating the machine. But anyway, we got to think

1367
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:29,460
big, Tom. We got to think of these other ideas. I think these are areas where technology and

1368
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:33,940
medicine and developing, there's not always a good marriage, but there are some areas where

1369
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:39,540
you have technological leaps. Like for instance, our x-ray machine, part of it, the reason we

1370
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:43,940
waited eight years to get one, first of all, they were as expensive as heck. How much did it,

1371
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:48,260
does it, I don't even know how much an x-ray machine would cost. This one costs 33,000.

1372
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:53,380
Which of course in the United States, that's the cost of like getting your gallbladder removed.

1373
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:57,700
Right. I mean, literally that's about the cost of a cold cystectomy. Yeah. So it was, I mean,

1374
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:02,420
for us was a big expense, but we do a lot, quite a few x-rays now are operating. The guy's actually

1375
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:06,340
taken the, or x-ray texts are the operating room guys, but the guys in the operating room,

1376
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:10,020
my lab, my assistant's in the operating room are the ones we taught how to take x-rays and they

1377
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:16,100
did a pretty good job. We waited that long because we wanted a model that we could use. It was very

1378
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:20,500
small, lightweight, simple, or you didn't have to use the chemicals and developers and all that sort

1379
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:26,500
of stuff. And we just waited. Now we have a model where. Is it digital? It's digital. So it's a tiny

1380
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:32,340
little device mounted on this little thing. And I can actually select the size of a small,

1381
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:39,060
like a tiny box that has the x-ray tube in it. And it's a laptop and the screen is a operates

1382
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:44,260
by Bluetooth between x-ray machine and the computer. Take the x-ray that shows up on the

1383
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:50,180
computer screen and it's all there. And you can take that x-ray and adjust it. You can darken it,

1384
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:54,180
lighten it. You can focus in a certain areas. I mean, it takes a beautiful x-ray and you can

1385
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:57,860
play around with this. You really get a nice picture. And there's very little variable cost

1386
01:56:57,860 --> 01:57:02,820
at this point. It's all a fixed cost that you've covered. And now the more you use it, the better.

1387
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:08,500
You're getting more read. Absolutely. And the power is also the other thing was the power

1388
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:13,780
needed because we're 100% on solar. We've got a backup generator. It's 12 and a half kilowatts.

1389
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:19,060
How long does 12 and a half kilowatts last the hospital if the panels were to go out?

1390
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:22,500
We could run things on it. The problem with the rate limiting factor there is the fuel.

1391
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:28,740
Right now, I think we're left with maybe. Oh, so if you have enough fuel for the generator,

1392
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:33,300
you could run indefinitely off it if you needed to. Yeah. But I mean, we'd have to give probably

1393
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:38,260
big breaks of time. It's a fairly good size thing. And the hospital is the only thing that

1394
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:44,260
has electricity. You don't have electricity in your home. No, there's no grid. So it's just the

1395
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:51,300
hospital has power. We run on the solar, I mean, pretty much 24 seven. We really don't need the,

1396
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:54,580
as long as the batteries are there and everything's functioning, we don't need the generator at all.

1397
01:57:54,580 --> 01:58:00,260
And we try to find the time when these batteries are going to order a new set and new panels,

1398
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:04,340
wherever you need to re-up that. So we're, I think, three years into this set of batteries.

1399
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:06,500
What about colon cancer? Do you see that?

1400
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:11,620
Pretty rare. We've had what maybe two or three cases in 10 years. I mean, it's really, really rare.

1401
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:16,500
The folks who are the most elderly within the community live to what age? I mean,

1402
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:21,220
what is considered old? Nobody there knows the rage. They don't have any

1403
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:25,540
birth records. Even my wife doesn't know her age. She's somewhere in her thirties probably.

1404
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:29,140
So they don't really know their exact age, but I would guess they're probably,

1405
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:33,220
an older person, they were probably in the seventies, his or her seventies. I don't think

1406
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:37,700
they, they live much beyond that. And do you see cognitive impairment in that population?

1407
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:43,220
Really rare. You rarely, as somebody who say, I think this person has Alzheimer's. Really,

1408
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:47,540
really rare to see that. I mean, I think they should die of something else before they reach

1409
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:49,860
that stage. You just don't see it.

1410
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:54,500
The point you just made that reminds me, there's a new movie, which you may have seen,

1411
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:59,060
I think it's called A Good Lie. It stars Reese Witherspoon. It's a beautiful story.

1412
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:04,100
After we saw The Heart of Nubo, we watched that because I wanted my daughter to sort of

1413
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:10,100
understand the history of the Sudanese refugees. And that's one of the points from the movie that

1414
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:15,780
I remember being very sort of moved by. They were all assigned the same birthday because

1415
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:20,100
nobody knew their birthday. Like even something like that that we would take for granted. Do they

1416
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,460
celebrate birthdays?

1417
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:26,180
No, nobody does. I mean, you know, my wife, we kind of invented a birthday or she invented one

1418
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:31,620
of November 21st. So when that day comes around, we'll usually do something. She's always surprised

1419
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:37,780
like, what, what are you doing? Oh, okay. So she doesn't give me a hard time for not buying

1420
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:44,820
flowers if we could buy flowers. So it's pretty easy to be married to a Nubo lady. She doesn't,

1421
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:46,340
the expectations are very low.

1422
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:52,420
How has your life changed since you've been married? I mean, do you have a greater sense

1423
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:55,380
of obligation to not die, to put it bluntly?

1424
01:59:55,380 --> 02:00:00,900
Yeah, I would say, yeah, definitely. So I'm like, you know, you can't be so heavily with things

1425
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:04,980
because I've got a wife and I wanted to kind of look after her and make sure she's okay.

1426
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:10,180
There's been a little bit of a change in perspective with that. And I think if and when we get

1427
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:13,060
children, I think that'll change another degree up for sure.

1428
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:15,620
Do you think you could do what you do if you had children?

1429
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:21,060
I think we could stay there. And if things aren't really hairy, we'd have to see how to proceed.

1430
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:27,460
But just in terms of, I mean, your wife is a nurse, so you have the luxury of working together. So

1431
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:30,900
as focused as you are on your work, she is there with you.

1432
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:31,540
Right.

1433
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:37,140
When you have children, they will not work with you for quite some time. I just wonder, would it be

1434
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:43,460
challenging to sort of now be torn between two obligations that for many years will not

1435
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:44,500
overlap at all?

1436
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:49,140
It'll be difficult. You know, I think one thing, and one thing I remind my wife of is that,

1437
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:54,260
you know, I finish work late and I'm always, you know, often preoccupied with things and things

1438
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:59,300
with the hospital and all that sort of stuff. But at least I'm there every evening. The weekends,

1439
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:04,820
we have a little bit of time on a Sunday, but together. And even though the work is very much

1440
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:09,460
all encompassing, there's no commute and there are no distractions. You know, we don't have,

1441
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:13,780
there's no TV, there's no radio, we don't have other things that kind of occupy our minds. So

1442
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:20,740
when we're together at home, we really can be present to each other. And I would hope that if

1443
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:25,060
we have children, I'll be able to use that to really spend time with the kids and not be always

1444
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:29,220
in work, you know, if life continues like that anew, but there's not any travel involved. I'm

1445
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:30,900
just there. You know, I'm a stone's thrower.

1446
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:35,220
You know, it's funny when you say it that way, it's actually, you may actually spend more time

1447
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:42,740
with your kids than many of us do here because of our distractions and our travel and our this

1448
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:48,020
and our that. Yeah. Life here is much more hectic. I mean, it seems almost ironic to say that.

1449
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:53,700
You feel out of place here, even though you grew up here. I mean, when you walk down Park Avenue

1450
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:57,700
or Madison Avenue, are you sort of like, what in the hell is this place?

1451
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:02,740
I do. I do feel a bit out of place. In a sense, I do enjoy it. Like I've never even when I was

1452
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:06,340
like, grew up in upstate New York, I never spent time in New York City. So this is really kind of

1453
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:10,900
it's exciting. I like it, but I don't think I could I could stay long term. I mean, a lot of

1454
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:15,700
people I'm sure say about New York, but I do feel much more at home and then mountains where it's

1455
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:22,020
very quiet and kind of sedate and your time is your own when you're off. What possessions do you

1456
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:27,460
value? I mean, I know you have some textbooks and things, but I mean, your home is very modest.

1457
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:32,020
Obviously, by the standards of someone living in the United States, it would not really you

1458
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:36,900
wouldn't even really call it a home in the same way. Right. But you don't give the impression that

1459
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:43,220
you're wanting. No, I really don't. I think that was my character since I was a kid. I'm very much

1460
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,980
I think I'm very much a minimalist since I was born. All these clothes you see me wearing that

1461
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:54,260
from the well the socks, the trousers, both these shirts I bought when I came out of Newville last

1462
02:02:54,260 --> 02:03:01,460
month. So I have scrubs. I had scrubs. I won pair of trousers. I had a suit, a few t shirts,

1463
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:05,780
and that was it. And they're like, Hey, look, you got to go and meet people. You can't be wearing

1464
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:10,500
scrubs around. So I had to buy all this crap when I came out. It was painful for me to buy clothes.

1465
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:14,660
Like I don't I just don't like it. When I go back, I said, Look, when I go back to mountains,

1466
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:18,500
all this is winter coats and this stuff. I'm not taking this stuff back with me. I'll keep it in

1467
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:22,980
Armenia. Let someone there use it. I don't know. I don't want it. My suit. I do have one suit.

1468
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:29,300
That I wore to the ceremony in Armenia, the world prize ceremony. But I bought that suit in 1985.

1469
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:33,300
So I haven't. I haven't bought one since then.

1470
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:35,300
Probably when you were interviewing for medical school or something.

1471
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:39,140
Well, I was interviewing for jobs like for engineering jobs. That's the reason I bought it.

1472
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:42,660
So it was when I had someone who was for interviewing for medical school. And then

1473
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:47,700
I've used it when I come out for this sort of prize ceremony, I'll take it out and

1474
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:51,140
see what the blue shirt and the tie. But a ball of crap in 1985.

1475
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:55,780
And I know that you it's absolutely against your nature to sort of be critical of

1476
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:03,220
anyone. But do you spend any time thinking about the way the world works here and how most of us

1477
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:09,940
are somewhat attached to our possessions? Yeah. And the more possessions we have,

1478
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:14,100
the more complicated our lives get. I mean, you certainly hear people talk about minimalism.

1479
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:17,860
Few people can apply it to the extent that you can, of course. But

1480
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:25,780
I mean, what have you learned about this and how could you speak to somebody like me who,

1481
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:30,020
you know, loves his possessions as much as the next person and can't imagine

1482
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:35,060
giving up these comforts? I mean, help me understand, because you don't look like you're

1483
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:42,260
miserable. No. And you look even happier in these videos in Nuba. I'm sure that this is about the

1484
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:46,900
hardest thing you've had to do all year. Yeah, it is. You've slept around New York and talk to idiots

1485
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:52,900
like me. No, I'll tell you, Peter, I really do believe that the more detached you become,

1486
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:57,140
not like in this Buddhist kind of nirvana sense, but the more detached you are from things,

1487
02:04:57,860 --> 02:05:03,300
the easier life is. It just simplifies your life. I mean, for me, I look at a lot of possessions

1488
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:07,780
and things and attachments as just adding more complications. You know, life becomes so

1489
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:12,660
complicated. It's much harder here in the US. I see my sister and how she's interacting with the

1490
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:18,900
kids. There's a reason why advertisers are good at what they do. What they want to do is convince

1491
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:23,060
you to buy something you really don't need, and they're very good at it. Why does Madison Avenue

1492
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:27,380
exist? Why is there a huge bill in Madison Avenue? These guys are very good with what they do.

1493
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:31,940
They're convincing. They've managed to convince all of us to get things we really don't need

1494
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:36,020
and convince us that we'll be only happy and fulfilled and satisfied if we have those things.

1495
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:43,060
So you get all this tsunami pushing against you. For me, I think just because I'm in a place where

1496
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:47,860
you can't have anything that kind of realize, well, geez, I don't have any of this stuff and I kind

1497
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:52,500
of like it. It just makes things much easier for me. I've always been a bit of a minimalist even

1498
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:58,500
when I was younger, but I've come to kind of feel that that's really, I do feel better with less.

1499
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:05,460
And I think everybody is looking for some kind of meaning in life, you know, this book, this man's

1500
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:09,940
search for meaning, this Victor Frank, that was something that was one of my, is one of my favorite

1501
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:16,020
books. And it's like the of logotherapy. But we all really do need a sense of meaning in our lives.

1502
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:20,900
That's extremely important for our psychiatric makeup. Whatever that is, it's different for

1503
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:26,100
each person, whether it's kids, whether it's your pets, whether it's your job, but to try to get

1504
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:30,900
something in your life that's meaningful. And if you're looking for it, this is me philosophizing,

1505
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:35,060
certainly I think if you're looking for in material possessions, I don't think you'll find it there.

1506
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:40,660
So if I can make a bit of an aside, something I talked about earlier with a talk with the

1507
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:46,020
Catholic Medical Mission Board volunteers, my favorite Bible passage, I can't remember the book

1508
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:51,780
and the verses, but the basic story is there's a guy, the guy's a very wealthy young man. And he

1509
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:55,860
goes to Jesus, they says, they try to justify himself and says, look, what do I have to do

1510
02:06:56,740 --> 02:07:01,140
to get eternal life? And Jesus says, well, follow the prophets, you've got all this stuff there,

1511
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:06,100
follow the Ten Commandments, follow the laws of the prophets, and you'll be okay. And the guy says,

1512
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:12,100
well, I do all those things. What do I need to do to really become perfect? And Christ said,

1513
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:18,740
sell everything you have, pick up your cross and follow me. And it says something very, which I

1514
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:23,220
think is very beautiful, it says the man went away very sad because he had many possessions.

1515
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:29,620
He couldn't do it. I think he wanted to justify himself, see, I'm good, I'm doing all the things

1516
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:34,260
I need to do, I should be okay. And Christ kind of turned that on his head and said, okay,

1517
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:40,580
if you want to be perfect, sell everything you have and come and follow me. And I think what he's

1518
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:47,060
saying is, look, if you really want to be perfect, really want to be happy, get rid of, I mean,

1519
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:53,540
it's a bit of pie in the sky stuff in a way, and not practical for people. But in some way, get

1520
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:56,900
rid of your baggage and come and follow. Yeah, because it could be metaphorically get rid of

1521
02:07:56,900 --> 02:08:00,420
your stuff. Right. I don't think it's necessarily literal, right? It doesn't mean throw your couches

1522
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:05,380
out. But it can be, it means don't be wed to these things the way that I think we are. Exactly. And

1523
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:09,620
the theological meaning is exactly that. It's not that you can't have things, but what's your

1524
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:14,420
attachment to those things? You know, is this thing where you put your values, you know, is your value

1525
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:20,340
in the car you drive and the, what kind of beer you drink or whatever, or is your value more in

1526
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:25,220
people and what you're doing and how you're helping people. There is a bit of values in that. And I

1527
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:28,340
think I'm sure some people can do it very well. They're very wealthy. They have a lot of stuff,

1528
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:32,420
but they're, they do have a sense of detachment from that. I just think it's more difficult.

1529
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:37,620
You know, it talks about this passage about it's more difficult for rich men to enter the kingdom

1530
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:40,660
of heaven than it is for a camel to go through the eye of the needle. That's kind of something

1531
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:44,020
you say, well, I have the needle, it's supposedly where the camels were and to keep them out of the

1532
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:47,300
city. They had a thing that looked like an eye of an eagle and the camel couldn't go through there.

1533
02:08:48,260 --> 02:08:52,820
It's not saying being rich is bad. Rich people are bad people. That's totally, that's nothing

1534
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:57,060
that's missing the point. It's just very difficult because it's very difficult to be detached from

1535
02:08:57,060 --> 02:09:01,140
things when you have a lot of possessions. You know, I'm trying to say that without coming across

1536
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:06,980
as being judgmental. I don't mean that, but certainly for me, I feel much better having less.

1537
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:11,460
I really, really think that. Well, it's funny at the outset you talked about this idea that

1538
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:15,460
even in college you were sort of struck by this idea of you wanted to be a missionary and you even

1539
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:20,340
said something to the effect of whatever that meant. And it's sort of funny. Like if you say

1540
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:27,780
to me, Peter, picture a missionary, I don't actually picture you. I picture someone going

1541
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:31,700
into a remote part of the world and hitting people with Bibles. Right? Like that's sort

1542
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:38,500
of the image we have of a missionary, but in the reality of it, I think what you're doing is far

1543
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:46,100
more aligned with in as much as one believes in sort of religious values, I guess I think what

1544
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:52,260
people like you do that is regardless of one's religious views, they can't help but respect it is

1545
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:55,620
you're not preaching it to anybody. You're not hitting anybody over the head of the Bible. You're

1546
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:59,860
just sort of saying, look, I'm here to serve you. And your example is what's actually doing the

1547
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:06,020
talking as opposed to your words. Whereas I think most of us, myself included, are far too quick to

1548
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:12,180
use our words to speak as opposed to our actions. Well, you're tapping into my favorite quote,

1549
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:16,020
which has been attributed to Saint Francis. I don't know if he, Saint Francis is like many

1550
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:22,100
people. He's my favorite Saint, a friend of Assisi who lived in the 12 early 1200s. He said, preach

1551
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:30,340
always and sometimes use words. And I think that's, that's exactly what I think we try to do a mission,

1552
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:36,900
show the love of Christ by who you are and what you're doing, and don't, don't get too wrapped

1553
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:41,620
around the axle about how it's going to play out. Remember, if you're there as a missionary, you know,

1554
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:47,060
God is the one that changes hearts. Not me. I'm not smart enough to do that. I don't have the,

1555
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:50,500
I'm not a guy that's going to have just the right thing to say and to, you know, school somebody on

1556
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:57,620
something. I can't do that, you know, but I can do my best to show the love of Christ to these people.

1557
02:10:57,620 --> 02:11:02,500
And that's what I feel comfortable with. You know, if you ask me why I'm a Christian, I can,

1558
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:08,980
I can talk to you about it. And my words might be a bit jumbled and goofy, but preach always and

1559
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:14,660
sometimes use words. Are there any cases of suicide in Nuba? We had one guy who's the husband

1560
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:22,260
of one of our staff and yeah, he shot himself and that really shocked everybody. He, he seemed to

1561
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:27,540
have some kind of psychiatric problem. He was kind of acting a bit strange a few days. They didn't

1562
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:31,460
tell us, but he, he'd been in one of the, in one of the refugee camps, was acting a bit odd there,

1563
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:36,260
came back to Nuba and was acting a bit odd at home. And then, then he was acting a bit odd. He

1564
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:41,700
went and he shot himself as the only case I know of. It's, it's extremely rare, extremely rare.

1565
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:50,500
I mean, to me, there are so many amazing contrasts between Nuba and America, right? I mean,

1566
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:54,500
they're so obvious, they're not worth stating. It's these subtle ones that to me are interesting,

1567
02:11:54,500 --> 02:12:00,180
right? There must be a different sense of fulfillment, contentment, happiness, sense of

1568
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:04,740
purpose there versus here. I mean, as you know, I'm sure you're not paying close attention to

1569
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:10,420
statistics in the United States, but suicide is among the top 10 causes of death in every,

1570
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:16,260
I may be incorrect on this, but I'm not far off in every age demographic except for zero to 10.

1571
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:21,460
So once you get above, you know, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, suicide is always in the top 10 as a cause

1572
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:27,060
of a disease. And that doesn't include, that's what we call fast suicide. Right. When you kill

1573
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:31,860
yourself immediately with a clear, but then you have all the slow suicide. So the alcohol related,

1574
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:39,220
basically people that kill themselves with alcohol and drugs. Yeah. So when you include all of those,

1575
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:44,660
I've heard analysis that would suggest that self-harm would be sort of top five causes of death

1576
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:51,140
across the board. What does that say to you, given that you live in a world that has one,

1577
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:57,140
one thousandth of the privilege and for all intents and purposes, like shouldn't everybody

1578
02:12:57,140 --> 02:13:03,140
be killing themselves in Nuba to avoid being ripped apart by shrapnel? Yeah. It's very

1579
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:08,500
interesting. And you know, my initial thought that comes to me is that people are, when you're really

1580
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:16,100
gripped in this struggle to survive, so your life is based on, you know, every day is you're just

1581
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:21,700
trying to survive. When you have that sort of primal instinct of survival, you don't, your mind

1582
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:25,940
doesn't drift off to other things. You don't think about so much about your life is hard, your life is

1583
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:32,820
this, your life is miserable. So I think you become less inward looking. Suicide is so inward

1584
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:37,380
looking, so focused on your own misery that you can't come out of it. I mean, it's such a miserable

1585
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:42,340
thing. I mean, it breaks my heart when I hear about these things. It really does because I think,

1586
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:48,660
man, to get to that point when you just, life is so miserable for you and you are so miserable,

1587
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:53,940
you kill yourself, for me is heartbreaking. Does that break your heart more than the tragedy

1588
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:58,900
that you see every day? I mean, not to compare miseries, but like what you see breaks my heart.

1589
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:04,580
Maybe I'm numb. I mean, and it's not to say that I'm not heartbroken by anybody who hurts themselves,

1590
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:10,420
but what you see is so staggering. Do you see this as an even greater source of tragedy?

1591
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:15,860
For me, I would equate that with. The five-year-old girl who's got the shrapnel ripping her arm off.

1592
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:23,220
I would. I would see, I would feel the same sense of pain and heartbreak with that. Suicide is a

1593
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:26,900
similar effect where, you know, if a child dies from this kind of thing, the effect you have on

1594
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:33,700
the whole family is devastating the grief. Suicide, the grief you leave behind. I think that's really

1595
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:37,780
tough and that really, really breaks my heart. Not only for the person who was so miserable that they

1596
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:43,140
decided to take their own life, but for the people behind it. Oh gosh. And that's terrible. Man,

1597
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:48,420
I would just never wish that on anybody. And yet it's almost impossible in the United States to not

1598
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:53,700
have your life touched by suicide. I think it would be very rare that someone listening to this

1599
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:59,860
in America wouldn't know somebody first or secondhand who hasn't taken their life either clearly and

1600
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:04,820
deliberately or sort of slowly and maybe less deliberately. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's wrapped

1601
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:09,620
up in that struggle for survival. There is a will, you know, a natural will to survive. And when

1602
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:14,100
you're in this kind of daily grip, even when there's, when there's not fighting just to survive

1603
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:20,820
there, the amount of work it takes to get up in the morning to make food, to cultivate crops,

1604
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:24,980
to keep the animals out of your garden. I mean, it's a tremendous struggle. There's a book,

1605
02:15:24,980 --> 02:15:28,580
I think the book is called Tribes. Sebastian Younger, have you heard of it? Yes, I've heard of it.

1606
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:31,540
I would love to read it. I can give you a copy actually. I have a copy here, so I'll give it to

1607
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:38,100
you as one more possession to have. Right. But he writes about how post 9-11 suicide rates went

1608
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:42,740
down in New York. And he talks much more eloquently about this than I ever could, but

1609
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:48,820
I guess it speaks to what you're saying, which is when there's a real struggle, when there's

1610
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:53,860
something and something that can bring people together in a common goal or something that

1611
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:58,420
unites people, it can presumably distract from some of that pain that can otherwise hurt us.

1612
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:04,020
Right. It's interesting because I fairly recently was hearing about this PTSD and,

1613
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:09,780
and I mean, how many veterans have killed themselves. That's another heartbreaking

1614
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:13,860
thing. Somebody's fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan, they survival that they come back home,

1615
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:18,580
they get despondent, they kill themselves. What kept them alive during the fighting was a sense

1616
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:23,300
of camaraderie togetherness fighting for, you know, for common goal. I mean, no matter what you

1617
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:27,220
think about warfare and the horrible things that happen in warfare, at least they have some kind

1618
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:31,540
of a common bond. They come back home to the US and people are indifferent to them. Nobody pays

1619
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:37,620
attention to them. They've lost their, the common bond with their, with their comrades and friends.

1620
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:42,340
And what ensues is despondency. And before I know it, we had this huge rate of suicide

1621
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:46,980
amongst veterans that come back. Not so much from the trauma they had during the fighting.

1622
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:51,300
You know, it wasn't like flashbacks to horrible things that happened there, but the sense of

1623
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:55,540
loss of any bonds, that human contact with other people, that sense of purpose has gone.

1624
02:16:56,340 --> 02:17:00,100
So I found that quite interesting that, that thought that's what led to this.

1625
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:04,500
It just makes you wonder if there was, if there is a way to, you know, we have these dating apps

1626
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:07,140
here in the United States, right? You probably don't have a lot of them in the news, but.

1627
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:11,780
Well, dating, dating is totally illegal there. The word dating doesn't even exist.

1628
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:12,180
And then.

1629
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:13,860
How did you meet your wife?

1630
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:18,580
Well, we have what she calls secret love. That's not like in a scandalous sense for anybody, but

1631
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:23,620
you know, there you can't openly date somebody. You know, if somebody, like I could never be

1632
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:27,780
alone with her somewhere, like just chatting out in the public, people would tell her brothers,

1633
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:31,220
hey, this guy is talking to your sister. What are you gonna do about it? They come and they beat me

1634
02:17:31,220 --> 02:17:35,460
up. They'll beat her up. And then this big scandal and they say, Oh, co, you know, you,

1635
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:37,860
guys gonna get married or what's going on here? You can't, you can't be doing this.

1636
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:42,340
So you have to do it. We did it very quietly. You know, it's got that it's, it's difficult.

1637
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:44,500
We got to know each other kind of on the side and.

1638
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:49,300
Our marriage is normally arranged. Is that why this dating process is unnecessary?

1639
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:52,900
Yeah. Traditionally they were arranged now. They're not so much arranged, but the families will

1640
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:56,100
meet together. Somebody, you know, someone might show interest to somebody else. Then they have

1641
02:17:56,100 --> 02:18:00,820
to approach the family, but there's not really a dating. They can't go through a public dating thing.

1642
02:18:01,220 --> 02:18:05,620
If you, if you're interested in marrying a girl, you've got to go and approach the family right

1643
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:09,140
away and say, look, I want to marry this woman. Then they have to start negotiations with Dowery

1644
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:13,620
and all that kind of other sort of stuff. You can't be seen together in the public sphere.

1645
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:18,020
It's just not, just totally not allowed. So not so much arranged as there's some attraction between

1646
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:22,580
the two, but they have to really make them move fairly early. So they don't, you know,

1647
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:26,020
where the problems, you don't really get to know the other person very well. It's really difficult.

1648
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:29,380
You know, they're good and they're bad points because you, you're not really allowed to go

1649
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:32,660
through that, that, that process of dating if they know somebody and all that sort of thing

1650
02:18:32,660 --> 02:18:39,540
and then the family. Okay. So there's definitely no Nuba version of Tinder. So, so I think where I

1651
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:43,700
was going with that was in the same way that we have these dating apps, it's all, which are

1652
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:49,060
basically trying to pair people, right? Similar interests at a meta level. It's, it would be

1653
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:55,300
interesting if, if there would be a way to pair a void that exists here in this country and, and

1654
02:18:55,380 --> 02:19:01,540
for much of the civilized world, right? The avoid of purpose with a part of the world where purpose

1655
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:05,460
is not lacking, but resources are lacking. And in many ways, I think that's what philanthropy

1656
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:10,260
sort of tries to do. But of course the question is, it's more than just that, right? I mean,

1657
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:16,020
I don't think it's just giving. I think there's more to it, right? I mean, I, I, and I was sort

1658
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:20,180
of thinking about this knowing we were going to speak today that, because my daughter asked me

1659
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:25,860
another question. She said, you know, she said, well, can you ask Dr. Tom, like, what could a

1660
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:32,260
10 year old girl in San Diego do to help a 10 year old girl in Nuba? And I thought, and I thought,

1661
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:38,500
and I thought, and I was like, I don't know. Cause it's not like you going there is going to,

1662
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:43,940
you know, be a practical solution and, or even provide value. I mean, even me, even if I decided,

1663
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:47,780
Tom, please, I'm going to come for a year and work at your side, I would slow you down. I mean,

1664
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:52,420
I would be a waste of, like you'd spend a year just teaching me how to get out of my own way.

1665
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:59,460
So how can people help? I mean, giving is of course, the most obvious you've, you've outlined

1666
02:19:59,460 --> 02:20:06,420
so many clear, tangible examples of where even modest resources by the standards of our

1667
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:12,180
healthcare system would have profound step function changes there. Is there something else people can

1668
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:18,980
do to help? Yeah. First of all, never underestimate the value of a donation to someone you trust or a

1669
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:23,540
group you trust or an organization you trust the amount, the impact that has is tremendous. We can't

1670
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:30,580
do anything in our work without financial resources. Beyond that, I think one is just becoming aware of

1671
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:37,620
the situations somehow in this environment, trying to understand how these people, how they live,

1672
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:42,980
what their lives are like, that these really are individuals that have their own thoughts and

1673
02:20:42,980 --> 02:20:47,380
aspirations and everything else, trying to get them into their skulls a bit and understand what

1674
02:20:47,380 --> 02:20:52,740
their life is like and who they are. If you have kind of a knack for advocacy or work through

1675
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:57,700
governments and this kind of thing, be aware of the political situations there, advocate on behalf

1676
02:20:57,700 --> 02:21:03,460
of some of these people that are oppressed or having difficult lives, whether it's working in

1677
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:10,180
issues of poverty or poor health, poor education, I think people have a voice to offer and people

1678
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:16,260
do have an influence over governments. So government policies, government funding

1679
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:22,900
is a reflection of their constituents. And I just came to realize this full well in this trip,

1680
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:27,380
because some of these people say, well, the government funding, a lot of these administrative

1681
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:32,340
requirements, these beneficiary organizations have become more stringent and more difficult

1682
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:36,260
because governments require these things because they're accountable to their constituents.

1683
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:39,460
Their constituents are saying, are you sending so much money to Africa? They're wasting it or it's

1684
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:45,620
a waste of money. So to give the money out, the constituents are holding the politicians' feet

1685
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:50,180
to the fire. If the constituents were a little more open and said, look, let's help out. Let's

1686
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:54,500
be aware of what's going on and try to help some of these people get out of their misery so they

1687
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:59,380
can eventually help themselves through education, greater health, all these sort of things that

1688
02:21:59,380 --> 02:22:05,220
would free the politicians up a bit to allow more resources to go out into more aid and other

1689
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:09,300
things, more benefit to give them. I mean, the goal in all this stuff is eventually let these

1690
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:13,620
people who are beneficiaries now stay in their own two feet, maybe in the next generation, next

1691
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:19,140
go around. This cycle of aid, I mean, everybody knows the cycle of aid and dependency is a bad

1692
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:24,020
thing. Great, but how do you get out of that? So what are some creative ways we can do that? But

1693
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:29,220
you can't do anything without some help at this point, but geared towards getting these people

1694
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:34,340
to stay in their own two feet. Talk to me about food. I heard a funny story once that, is there a

1695
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:44,260
word for food in Nuba? It's like it- Gumo. So Nuba has, I don't know, like 99 different languages

1696
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:49,540
amongst the Nuba people. Does everybody speak Arabic? Pretty much. Most will speak Arabic.

1697
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:55,540
You speak Arabic. Yeah, I speak Arabic. Yeah, shwaya, shwaya, shwaya. My wife's language is

1698
02:22:55,620 --> 02:23:01,860
tira, and this came from her. The local word for food is numo. And I would say, what did you have

1699
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:06,980
for supper last night? And she said, I ate food. I said, what kind of food? She said, you know, food,

1700
02:23:06,980 --> 02:23:10,580
what are you talking about? I ate food. I said, what kind? I said, well, I had an asita, you know.

1701
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:15,700
Asita is the kind of the, it's like a cake made out of sorghum, kind of ground sorghum boiled.

1702
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:19,380
I mean, it's just totally tasteless. She loves it. She said, I have to have my asita.

1703
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:27,060
So for them, the word food and the asita is synonymous. There's so little variety. So little

1704
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:32,660
variety of foods. So what do you eat? First of all, what did you weigh? Because you were a nose guard

1705
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:39,860
in college. I've seen pictures of you. You were huge. What did you weigh in college? In college,

1706
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:48,100
I was 230, and this was 1985. By the way, 230. Yeah, what did you weigh when you arrived in Kenya

1707
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:54,980
in 2000? Probably around 190, I would guess. And what did you weigh by the time you got to

1708
02:23:54,980 --> 02:24:02,420
Nuba in 08? Then maybe 170. And I got down, I was down about 150 up until recently. Now when I've

1709
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:06,260
come out for the past month, I think I've gained about 20 pounds. I was down about 150. You've

1710
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:11,540
gained 20 pounds in the United States in a month. Yeah. So you were down to 150 pounds a month ago.

1711
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:16,580
Yeah. Talk to me about what you eat. Well, that's the thing. I eat, but my wife makes the food

1712
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:22,500
there. So is this food. What did you eat before you got married? Then I was living in the hospital

1713
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:27,540
compound. So we'd have a lot of, they would send them food in from Kenya normally, like once a year

1714
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:33,460
they would send food in. So usually rice, kidney beans, some kind of lentils. So we'd have that

1715
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:36,580
every day. Once in a while I'd have chicken, but usually it was just kind of rice and beans kind

1716
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:42,820
of stuff. So now when I got married and moved off the compound, my wife makes a cecita and she has

1717
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:48,500
some sauce on top of it. So the main sauce is this okra. Okra grows pretty well. They take okra,

1718
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:52,740
they dry it and they pulverize it in the powder. They mix that in with water and some other stuff.

1719
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:59,780
And it makes like a really slimy sauce that you pour over the sorghum paste and it tastes about

1720
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:06,420
as good as it sounds. I mean, it's really pretty bland. Where's the protein? You know, I think the

1721
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:11,300
sorghum actually has a high protein level. I think it's a grain. And I'm saying that because

1722
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:17,620
the people are pretty muscular. Like that's what they eat. They eat that and they'll have maybe

1723
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:22,340
some sorghum porridge in the morning. And that's pretty much it for the day. And I mean a few

1724
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:26,580
peanuts, they have peanuts too, but not huge numbers of peanuts. What about fruits or other

1725
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:33,060
vegetables? For fruits, they're seasonal. So you can get mangoes for maybe two or three months out

1726
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:37,060
of the year. You know, a mango season is there. There are tons of mangoes. Then when they're gone,

1727
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:41,060
they're gone. You don't see a mango for several more months. Then there's two seasons for mangoes.

1728
02:25:41,060 --> 02:25:45,620
Usually, but it varies quite a bit year to year. So mangoes are there periodically.

1729
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:53,060
Lemons you get for fruits. That's about it. Oranges are not there. You know, pineapples.

1730
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:57,780
Are there tomatoes? Tomatoes are there for a couple months, sort of towards the end of the

1731
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:03,380
rainy season. You can get tomatoes and you get some greens. They grow a few kinds of greens there

1732
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:07,860
and they'll put that on top of that. Like even the tomatoes will kind of cook up a bit and then make

1733
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:13,940
the okra slime to it and put that over the aceta. That's not bad actually. We'll have that

1734
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:18,500
quite a bit. Or the other thing we'll have during the rainy season is milk also. Milk is only there

1735
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:24,660
for a couple months. The cows will only give birth during the rainy season and therefore they're only

1736
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:28,500
lactating during the rainy season. So to get milk sort of towards the end of the rainy season, those

1737
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:35,540
last couple months. And since there's no refrigeration, most times we'll have it sour, sour milk. So

1738
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:40,820
get milk out, let it sit for a while and become sour. That'll also decontaminate it a bit. There's

1739
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:46,340
a lot of brucellosis there. And it takes the sour milk, which is kind of curdled. And you know,

1740
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:50,340
I think people have had sour milk before and you pour that over the aceta, over the sorghum paste.

1741
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:56,100
That just doesn't sound tasty. It's not very good. It's really, it's kind of eating like,

1742
02:26:56,100 --> 02:27:00,100
oh man, you know, the problem is you eat it. You're kind of hungry a bit, but there's no way

1743
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:04,420
of going back for seconds. Like, it's not great. That was enough. It's kind of going to bed, you

1744
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:10,500
know, or go back to work. It's like, okay, I guess I'm finished. My wife really, she does a great job

1745
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:16,660
cooking with limited resources we have, but it's pretty stark. Is there a food that you particularly

1746
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:20,500
looked forward to having when you knew you were coming to the United States? Yeah. Like pizza.

1747
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:25,380
You're Italian, right? Yeah. So pizza, eggplant Parmesan is my favorite food in the world. So my

1748
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:30,580
sister made that when I was down there. Hamburgers, I just crave cheeseburgers, like just a good

1749
02:27:30,580 --> 02:27:35,860
sandwich, you know, some chicken sandwich or something. Is this really nice with a good bread,

1750
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:40,260
you know, this kind of stuff. You've been sick when you're there. I mean, how many times have

1751
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:44,740
you had malaria? Well, I've been there 10 and a half years. So I've gotten malaria every year,

1752
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:50,500
except for 2018. How bad is malaria? It sounds awful. It's pretty bad. I mean, you sometimes

1753
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:53,940
you're wishing somebody comes in and just shoots you and puts you out of your misery. You're pretty

1754
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:59,380
sick with it. It's worse than influenza, right? Yeah. And influenza, anybody who's actually had

1755
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:05,300
the flu will attest. That's 10 days of really bad living. Yeah. Malaria is pretty miserable. I mean,

1756
02:28:06,020 --> 02:28:11,940
real bad headache, nausea, vomiting, you can't sleep, just high fevers, body aches, terrible

1757
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:16,420
body aches. And sometimes you get a bit lucky. You take medicine, you're over it in a few days, but

1758
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:21,700
you know, a lot of times it'll drag on for a month. But you don't take prophylaxis throughout the year,

1759
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:25,460
just or during the rainy season, which I'm assuming is when it's endemic. Right. I don't,

1760
02:28:25,540 --> 02:28:30,180
I don't take prophylaxis just because of the cost. And yeah, I just don't want to take the drug. I just

1761
02:28:30,180 --> 02:28:34,420
want to say, okay, let me just not take it and take it once you get it. Right. Once I get it,

1762
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:38,100
sometimes it'll drag on a bit longer. I mean, sometimes you get it just for a month. You take

1763
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:42,340
the medicine, you feel a bit better for a couple of days. Then next evening you start feeling the

1764
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:47,060
chills and shaking and the headache comes again and just like, Oh gosh, still with me. It can

1765
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:52,020
really drag on for a long time. So every year you've got it every year. That was an acoma a few years

1766
02:28:52,020 --> 02:28:58,740
ago. Just, uh, God, it was a strange night or it started feeling sick the night before it was on

1767
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:04,260
a Tuesday night and started taking, I took some oral drugs, I think a co-arctum, which is, um,

1768
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:09,460
artemisinin derivative. Took that at night. I went to bed, just kind of had a kind of fitful sleep.

1769
02:29:09,460 --> 02:29:14,660
And then I woke up the next morning and all these staff were in my room. I have an IV in my arm and

1770
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:19,620
I'm an IV quinine. Like what, what's going on here? The doctor needed treatment. That's right.

1771
02:29:19,620 --> 02:29:24,340
But I was really out of it. It was like 11 o'clock when I woke up and I was really,

1772
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:27,060
you know, they tried to get me up in the morning, some of the staff, because I was in the operating

1773
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:32,740
room day on Wednesday. And, uh, our guy, that's our assistant there. I didn't show up, you know,

1774
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:37,140
for the, I was on there by seven 30 and I didn't show up. So he came up to the room. He tried to

1775
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:42,100
wake me up and I couldn't get up. Like I didn't respond to him. So he thought I was dead. He was

1776
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:47,940
like, Hey, like, anyway, I didn't die. So I just, uh, that was out of it for quite a while,

1777
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:51,380
but then I recovered pretty quickly. I can't even imagine. I just, I can't,

1778
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:56,340
when you think back, Tom, about all of the people you've taken care of in the last

1779
02:29:56,980 --> 02:30:04,100
10 or 11 years, so just even just limiting it to the time in Nuba, is there any one particular

1780
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:10,260
patient that just stays with you that haunts you one case, one story, one child, one adult? I mean,

1781
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:16,100
I have those stories. I've got one or two, three, probably three stories that have stayed with me

1782
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:20,980
from my training, right? That if I even think about these patients, I'll tear up. I mean, just,

1783
02:30:20,980 --> 02:30:25,620
you know, they're, unfortunately they're all bad outcomes as the ones that, but they're also,

1784
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:29,780
they're not like the only bad outcomes I've seen, but there's just some, there was some emotional

1785
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:34,500
connection that happened. And then it's maybe it's sometimes you're projecting what's happening

1786
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:38,500
there onto your own life or something. But do you have those cases? Yeah, probably like you,

1787
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:41,700
the ones you really remember are the ones that have bad outcomes or ones that didn't go well.

1788
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:49,780
Gosh, we had one kid, I remember he came in on a Sunday morning and he had been, the Antonov

1789
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:54,900
bombed in the shrapnel wet in his face and just tore his face to shreds. And he went to some clinic

1790
02:30:54,900 --> 02:31:00,180
somewhere and they put a few stitches in it, like chromic stitches. And he came a couple days after

1791
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:05,300
that and his face was just mangled. So we took the stitches out and it was all just pus and dirt

1792
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:08,500
coming out. I mean, just didn't, but cleaned the wound out. So we took all these stitches out,

1793
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:14,100
cleaned the wound out well, put them on antibiotics. A couple of days later, we go on, he's got high

1794
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:18,740
fever and he can't swallow. I'm like, no crap. He's got, he's got tetanus. So a kid gets tetanus.

1795
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:23,460
I remember the day before then, I remember the Antonov came overhead, the Antonov is the airplane

1796
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:28,260
that bombs. And we saw the kid, he was like a, maybe 10 years old. He was standing against the

1797
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:31,620
wall, just shivering when he heard the airplane just shaking. He was so traumatized. He was so

1798
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:36,420
traumatized. He was shaking like this. Then like the next day, he gets a real high fever. He can't

1799
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:40,900
swallow. He put him in isolation, put NG2 down to feed him. And he just died from tetanus,

1800
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:45,940
like overnight. He died from tetanus. And I remember this kid's face and how, and I said,

1801
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:51,060
what the heck? He was a 10 year old kid with this thing. We had another kid, this is in

1802
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:55,220
child youth, this was a few years ago. He was, he was bombed, he and his aunt, and it was an

1803
02:31:55,220 --> 02:32:00,420
incendiary bomb from Antonov. And I don't know what they had, napalm or whatever, but it bombed him.

1804
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:05,780
And just, he had, I don't know, he had third degree burns on probably 60, 70% of his body.

1805
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:07,860
Is that even survivable?

1806
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:11,780
No, he lived like two months with this and both he and his aunt were the same. And I mean,

1807
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:17,860
we tried everything with these kids, the amount of work the nurses did every day just to try to

1808
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:23,300
address him and the agony he went through before he died. I remember his aunt would have these

1809
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:29,380
scabs and I remember they were, her eye was burned with this thing. And I remember there

1810
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:35,460
were maggots coming out of her eye, you know? And I think, what the heck are we doing? This is crazy.

1811
02:32:36,260 --> 02:32:42,500
What, who are these? These are civilians, burn to death, you know? There were other, six other kids

1812
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:47,220
that were in an area that was being shelled. So they sit in and would shell their village

1813
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:51,860
like all night and then they were bombed during the day. So they were, at nighttime,

1814
02:32:51,860 --> 02:32:57,060
they would sleep in the foxholes for protection. So right next to them was a straw,

1815
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:01,380
rakuba, kind of a straw structure. So the artillery shell fired and hit the rakuba,

1816
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:08,180
thing burst, rakuba was just like a, kind of lean to with made of grass and wood. It set this thing

1817
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:13,460
on fire and it fell into the foxhole. And there were, I think, nine people in the foxhole all

1818
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:20,260
sleeping. Three were burned to death immediately. Six of them came to the hospital with very degrees

1819
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:25,780
of burns. And a couple were just like 80% full thickness burns. I mean, just, they lived for

1820
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:31,620
quite a while before they died. Two of them, one girl started improving. They developed tetanus and

1821
02:33:31,620 --> 02:33:36,820
died from the tetanus. So these are the ones that really kind of stick out. Maybe one of the soldiers

1822
02:33:36,820 --> 02:33:42,020
I remember best is a guy that he was guy that I told you before he had 23 or four holes in his

1823
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:47,380
intestines. We opened them up and we just, I mean, it's hours we operate in this guy. Post-op,

1824
02:33:47,380 --> 02:33:51,940
he was doing great. I mean, it was cruising and started feeding him. He sat in bed. The next time

1825
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:56,660
I called down to see him, he's changed condition, as they say. And I went down and he's already dead.

1826
02:33:56,660 --> 02:34:02,260
He was a Darfur. He was fighting with the Nuba rebels. And I just remember thinking, you know,

1827
02:34:02,260 --> 02:34:07,940
what would this like for his, like this guy's got a family, you know, he's fighting in this place.

1828
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:12,580
His family's somewhere in Darfur. What's happening? Do they have any idea what's happening here?

1829
02:34:13,460 --> 02:34:18,260
So many terrible things, you know, there was one young kid, he was about 16 and he,

1830
02:34:19,220 --> 02:34:25,300
the Sudan army was approaching in our area. So the rebels went out there to kind of repulse them.

1831
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:29,940
And then people just kind of jumped on the vehicles to go out and fight, you know. So this kid just

1832
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:33,380
jumped on the vehicle. He didn't have a gun. They were weaponing everything. He was just a civilian.

1833
02:34:33,380 --> 02:34:39,220
He goes out there. He gets shot in the head with, you know, a machine gun or something. He comes in

1834
02:34:39,220 --> 02:34:44,980
with, you know, part of his skull missing and his brain tissue kind of pulsating out. I mean, he

1835
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:49,380
survived for two or three weeks like that. We have steroids and different things. In about

1836
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:53,380
X try to count things down and ended up just kind of going south and dying. So these are all,

1837
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:58,100
all people I'll never forget. And there are many, many, many beyond that.

1838
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:02,980
If people want to get involved in any way, shape or form, where would you recommend they,

1839
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:07,620
they look to as a resource? I think like an African mission, healthcare foundation,

1840
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:11,220
there was something on their website about the hospital. That's one source to go to.

1841
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:13,460
And their website is?

1842
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:22,420
It's amhf.us, www.amhf.us. So that's a pretty good source to start. There's a group called

1843
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:29,380
Take Heart Foundation, which was set up to kind of to harness the whatever support to be through

1844
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:32,420
the Heart of Nuba movie, which was made by my friend Ken Carlson.

1845
02:35:32,420 --> 02:35:38,100
Which I recommend everybody watch it. I think it's a, I'm sure it was done on a shoestring budget,

1846
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:42,580
but it's so well done. You know, it just sort of speaks for itself. So anything raised through

1847
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:46,340
them goes to African mission healthcare, which comes to us without anything taken out.

1848
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:51,540
Catholic Medical Mission Board is another good source. That's my, they're my sponsoring

1849
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:54,500
organization. They're here in New York. They've been here for I think over a hundred years.

1850
02:35:55,460 --> 02:36:00,500
And there are cmmb.org I think is their website. These are probably the main sources for our work

1851
02:36:00,500 --> 02:36:05,620
in Nuba. You know, I'll close with a story, Tom, that I think in many ways kind of defines you.

1852
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:11,700
I remember when I decided I wanted to go to medical school, I was applying for this

1853
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:15,620
scholarship and in the end I didn't get the scholarship. But I remember during the interview,

1854
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:19,220
this guy asked me a question. He said, you know, what do you want to be at the time when I went to

1855
02:36:19,220 --> 02:36:24,340
medical school, I wanted to be a pediatric oncologist. And I know what the guy was doing

1856
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:30,100
in retrospect. I mean, I think he was just trying to push me. And he basically said like, why would

1857
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:36,180
you want to do that? You can't possibly make a difference, you know, without dedicating your

1858
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:40,420
life to research, you're not going to have a difference saving one kid's life at a time,

1859
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:45,460
et cetera, et cetera. And, you know, I remember thinking of a story after, which in many ways

1860
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:50,420
exemplifies you to an extent that probably no one else, which is, you know, in medicine,

1861
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:55,620
you can do two things, right? You can, you can do something very scalable through research.

1862
02:36:55,620 --> 02:37:01,540
You know, you can devote yourself to working on, you know, treatments for cancer or developing

1863
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:07,140
a new drug to treat this disease or that disease. Or you can be on the front lines trying to save

1864
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:12,500
one life at a time. So the story is there's these two guys walking down the beach and it's after a

1865
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:17,540
really high tide and the beach is covered in starfish. And the starfish are going to die pretty soon

1866
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:21,140
if they don't get back in the water, which means they're pretty much all going to die. The two guys

1867
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:25,940
are walking and every few steps, one of the guys bends down as he picks up a starfish and he throws

1868
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:30,980
it back in the water. Five steps later, he does it again and again and again. After like the 10th

1869
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:34,740
one, the one guy says to him, he goes, what are you doing? And he says, well, you know, if these

1870
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:39,860
starfish don't get back in the water, you know, they're going to die. And he goes, have you looked

1871
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:45,300
and seen how many of them there are? You can't possibly make a difference. And he throws another

1872
02:37:45,300 --> 02:37:50,180
one in the water and he says, well, it made a difference to that one. Right. And I think for

1873
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:56,740
doctors that don't have the privilege of being able to affect the larger through research or

1874
02:37:56,740 --> 02:38:00,740
policy changes, whatever, for people on the front lines, I don't think there's a human being on this

1875
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:07,700
planet who throws more starfish back in the water than you. In the end, medicine is individual. It's

1876
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:14,660
the beauty of our profession and it's a huge privilege to have the opportunity to affect

1877
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:19,780
one person. And in the end, you close the door and it's you and the patient, whether you're in

1878
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:24,340
Nuba mountains, whether you're here in New York, and that's an incredible privilege. And I think

1879
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:31,540
if we keep that focus just one person at a time, I think people can kind of relax a bit. You can

1880
02:38:31,540 --> 02:38:34,980
see that what you're doing for that one person. You know, I think people look at Africa and say,

1881
02:38:34,980 --> 02:38:40,180
you know, what you're doing is a drop in the ocean. I really like that story because when you're there,

1882
02:38:40,180 --> 02:38:43,380
you don't see a drop in the ocean. You see a person. You see a life one at a time. You see a

1883
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:50,820
life and you see somebody that can laugh and can cry and can play and can, you know, has aspirations

1884
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:56,180
and is a living, breathing human being. Think, man, we helped this one person. That's a huge thing,

1885
02:38:56,180 --> 02:39:01,060
you know? And I think that helps to stave off some of the burnout and the cynicism.

1886
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:07,300
The fact that you are, this is a very individual thing. So one person is really a big deal. It's

1887
02:39:07,380 --> 02:39:14,180
everything to that one person, that one person's family. And I think we really have to keep that

1888
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:19,780
in mind, especially with this growing realm of cynicism and sort of negativity that we see now.

1889
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:25,700
Tom, I have been wanting to meet you for three years. I didn't know that I'd ever get a chance

1890
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:32,900
to. So it's sort of beyond a privilege. And I know that for you, being outside of Nuba is

1891
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:37,460
the toughest thing imaginable, which is of course the irony sitting here in the

plush New York City. And yet all you're doing is pining to go back to a place where your own life

1893
02:39:43,460 --> 02:39:48,180
is in danger. But, you know, I remember thinking, God, I really just, I'd love to be able to

1894
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:52,980
interview Tom. And I remember thinking there's no way he could justify making the time to do this

1895
02:39:52,980 --> 02:39:58,980
when his time in the US is so short. So when I asked Rick and Mark and John, and they said that

1896
02:39:58,980 --> 02:40:03,540
Tom would be happy to sit down, I just, I couldn't believe it. And I might make the case

1897
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:07,460
that of all the interviews I've ever done or will do, this is the one I feel most privileged to.

1898
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:11,540
So thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thanks, Peter. This has been a real privilege for me to

1899
02:40:11,540 --> 02:40:16,660
