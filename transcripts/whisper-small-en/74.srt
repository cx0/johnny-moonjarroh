00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,360
is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this. So all of this

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,560
raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this?

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,920
As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,040
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now, the

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,440
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,600
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,640
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,300
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,920
have proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,900
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,480
you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,800
for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,740
to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members will receive

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:55,440
full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we plan to build upon. These

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,900
are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of our shows.

35
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:07,140
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

36
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,620
episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,940
these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,680
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,820
I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with

40
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,540
companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and

41
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,300
have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope

42
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,260
is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,060
content exclusive for members. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,100
learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

45
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,020
by signing up for a monthly subscription. I guess this week is Jason Fried. Jason is the

46
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,160
co-founder of Basecamp. A privately held company based out of Chicago committed to building the

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,200
best web-based products and tools with the least number of unnecessary features. This is a hallmark

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,040
of Jason's personality. He's also the co-author of several books, Getting Real, Rework, Remote,

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,980
and It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work. Now, some of you may recall back from when I started

50
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,940
the podcast that one of the reasons I wanted to do this in the first place was I kind of found

51
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,340
myself having conversations with friends that after the fact, I thought, man, I wish that had been

52
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,660
recorded so others could hear it. And this conversation with Jason is exactly one of those.

53
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,820
It's in fact, it's an extension of a conversation that we've had several times over meals. We talk

54
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,380
a lot about Jason's story. We get into some turns and had some side conversations that I thought

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,620
were really interesting. We talk about his background and how he grew up and how that

56
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,120
sort of shaped what eventually led him to working on Basecamp. And we even had a little side tangent

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,980
on a whole bunch of other companies that everybody sort of thinks of as great examples of companies

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,960
like Uber and WeWork and things like that. And one of the things about Jason that's pretty unique

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,260
in this space is he's just incredibly blunt and not in an obnoxious way at all. He's not being blunt

60
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,220
for effect. He's just very open about how he feels and he doesn't sort of mask his feelings

61
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,460
about some of these companies and the way they do things and how he feels about that. We talk about

62
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,500
Basecamp's focus on hiring and they have a really unique culture around that and the importance of

63
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,780
writing and things like that. At the end of the podcast, we get really deep into all aspects of

64
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,620
work-life balance, which in some ways is something that I really wanted to talk about with Jason. I

65
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,340
would say about a week after we recorded this podcast, both Jason and I sat back and sort of

66
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,540
thought that we could have even gone deeper into that very particular topic, specifically work-life

67
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,860
balance, which is something that I just think every person struggles with on some level. So we

68
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,300
actually hummed and hawed about going back, sitting down again and going even deeper on this topic.

69
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,300
But after kicking the idea around, what we decided to do was something a little cooler,

70
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:17,900
which was set up a special AMA that Jason would do, much in the same way I've done with Matthew

71
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Walker, where after this episode, whatever questions you have about anything we talk about,

72
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,820
but I think work-life balance is probably the most important thing we talk about here. We're

73
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,220
going to take a bunch of questions from our members and we'll do a specific AMA with Jason

74
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,140
that focuses on that. So if you have any questions that we didn't get to or areas that you want to

75
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,580
go deeper on, it's a great opportunity to use the AMA to help us put together a follow-up

76
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,500
discussion with Jason. So with all that said, please enjoy my conversation with Jason Fried,

77
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,620
the first of at least two. Well, Jason, it's great to see you as always. Thanks for having me here.

78
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,420
Yeah. New York to Chicago, it's not as much of a shock as some places to New York, right? Like

79
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Chicago is? Chicago is a small New York, very small, like probably I feel like it's an eighth,

80
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,980
well actually a 16th of New York, but I get it. I know how to like roll in New York, you know? But I

81
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,420
feel like if I came from Kansas City, I wouldn't really know what New York was. It'd be a big shock

82
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,260
to me. Yeah, yeah, New York, it's a beautiful place, but I do love it. I'll offend all the New

83
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,980
Yorkers when I say this. I love it. I just couldn't live here. Yeah, that's how I feel. I feel like I

84
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,220
missed it. I wanted to live here in my twenties and I miss that never happened. And now I want to

85
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:42,100
kind of live here, but only for four days at a time. That'd be, I think kind of perfect actually.

86
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,660
Because every time I'm here, I love it. But then like, if I'm here for three or four days,

87
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,860
at the end of four days, I'm tired. I'm just really tired and burned out. Yeah. I mean,

88
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,140
as I was saying to you earlier, one of the things I like about New York, which is really maybe even

89
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:00,820
less about New York and more about just being in a short, concise zone of work is like, I always

90
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,900
lose a little weight when I'm here. I eat really well for the most part. Sometimes I go off the

91
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,940
rails, but like I don't have like kid food around. I can just be more, this really is not a statement

92
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,980
of New York. Now that I, now that it's coming out my mouth, I realize this is just a statement of

93
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,580
people who being on your own, who are working on their own sometimes. Yeah. I was going to say,

94
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,700
I can meditate when I want. I can do this when I want. I can say, oh wait, I wish I had that.

95
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,780
It sounds like I'm saying I don't like my being with my family, which couldn't be the

96
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,980
furthest thing from the truth. No, but like a little bit of separation is healthy for all

97
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,740
things. It's good to get away from work, although you're kind of working when you're here, but just

98
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,980
to have a change of scenery, I think is really healthy for people for all sorts of reasons.

99
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,140
This is definitely something I want to talk about with you today because someone might be

100
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,860
listening to this and saying, what's the CEO and founder of Basecamp on a podcast where we talk

101
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,500
about longevity? Because even though you and I both have a lot of shared interests outside,

102
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,740
including watches, I definitely don't think anybody wants to hear us talk about watches.

103
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,020
So we're probably not going to talk about watches much, if at all, but work-life balance is actually

104
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,980
something that I think people can immediately and sort of intuitively appreciate. A is something

105
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:12,820
most of us don't do well. I think if I were going to scorecard Peter Attia on health, by far my

106
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,660
closest to an F is on work-life balance. And frankly, it's something that seems to know no

107
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,540
limit, meaning it doesn't matter how educated you are. It doesn't matter how much money you make.

108
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,540
It doesn't matter how prestigious your job is. I think everybody on some level is struggling

109
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,460
with this, or at least most people are. And it's such a high priority for you. It's something

110
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,140
you've written about and you're just kind of one of the few people for whom this idea of

111
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,460
culture in a workplace means something. Everybody says that. Everybody says that. It almost doesn't

112
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,300
mean much. So part of me wants to go right there, but I also think part of me thinks the listener

113
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,140
who's not familiar with you needs to know a bit of the background. So would you humor me to,

114
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,980
if we back up a little bit and explain how you got to be where you are?

115
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,460
Yeah, sure. I feel like my career started when I was 14, maybe 13. That's when I was allowed to

116
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,580
work. I got a workers permit. My dad took me to the city hall in the city town I grew up in.

117
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,220
Which was?

118
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,620
Deerfield, Illinois, which is about 25 miles north of Chicago. And I went to work at a grocery store

119
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,180
and then I eventually went to work at a shoe store and did some other things. But around that time,

120
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,900
I started getting into computers a little bit. My neighbor had a Mac plus or Mac SE, one of the

121
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,340
original like early all in ones. And he showed me the flight simulator and it blew my mind. I'm like,

122
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,180
what the hell is this thing? It's like the graphics are crisp. This is amazing.

123
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,540
This was black and white simulator, right?

124
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,340
Black and white simulator. This is Microsoft simulator, I think, or something like that.

125
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,980
Yeah, I kind of remember this.

126
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,380
Early days. And it just completely blew my mind. Because before that, I'd only seen like an Apple

127
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:58,420
II, which was a traditional computer, green kind of screen. And the Mac was so crisp. So I convinced

128
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,140
my parents to get me one eventually. And from there, I started to learn how to make software,

129
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,940
but only because I wanted something. I didn't care about software. I didn't really care about

130
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,060
computers, but I wanted a tool to organize my music collection because I had a bunch of CDs and tapes.

131
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,620
So this is, are we in the late 80s?

132
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,820
Let's see. Yeah, late 80s. Because the Mac came out in 85.

133
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,740
So this is still pre CD. You're in your music. The reason I'm asking my question is to know

134
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,220
what kind of music collection we're talking about. Were these cassettes?

135
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,900
Mostly cassettes. I had some CDs though.

136
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
Oh, so you were a super early adopter of the CD.

137
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,220
Pink Floyd, The Wall, my first CD.

138
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,140
Mine was the Zeppelin box set.

139
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,260
Good choice as well. I remember buying it.

140
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,860
80 bucks.

141
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,500
Was that right?

142
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
80 bucks for a five disc CD.

143
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,900
I remember, yeah, CDs were like 16 bucks each or 18 bucks each at the time.

144
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,300
I had this collection of music and I was loaning it out to friends and I would never get back.

145
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,100
You know, I forgot who I gave it to and it's gone. I spent all this time making mixtapes and,

146
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,460
you know, whatever, gone. And so I'm like, there's gotta be a way to track this. And of course,

147
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,860
I could do it on paper or whatever, but I had this computer thing. So eventually I got this

148
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,700
thing called FileMaker Pro. I don't know if you're familiar with this software, right?

149
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,180
It's not programming. It was like plugging stuff together. So I plugged a bunch of stuff together

150
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,940
and it always had an interest in interface design for some reason, design.

151
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,900
And so I learned how to like make an interface. I built this thing, which I eventually called

152
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,820
Audio File, which was a way to keep track of the music collection that you had and all the tracks

153
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,580
that were on the CDs of the tapes and who you loaned it out to and when, and it would send you

154
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,580
a reminder to get it back and the whole thing. And I put it up on AOL because this was before

155
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,540
the internet, basically. Internet really hadn't happened yet. Kind of 95, 96 is when the internet

156
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:47,220
sort of happened. I put up on AOL and in that file. When you say put it up, meaning like that's

157
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,140
where you stored it or that's where you were then allowing people to access it? The latter. So AOL

158
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,900
had this like these file library sections. I don't even know what they were called. See, I don't

159
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,700
recall. This is a bit of a blur to me. This is a little bit early days in like file sharing where

160
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,220
you could, there's like these special interest areas and you could upload files that were called

161
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,660
binaries basically at the time and you could upload these files to AOL and share software with

162
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,420
others. So there's something called shareware. This is kind of where you would put things like

163
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,140
this. There's also bulletin boards, which is like you dial into with a modem and that kind of stuff.

164
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,820
But AOL was the biggest one at the time. So I uploaded some stuff to AOL and in that was a

165
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,260
text file saying, hey, if you like this, send me 20 bucks. Like here's my address. It's like my

166
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:38,100
parents house. Just like send this to me. And that summer I got 20 bucks in the mail from some

167
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,500
guy in Germany. I remember getting the envelope. It was like the red and blue checked air mail

168
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,740
envelope. Yeah. Am I, who do I, I don't know what it'd be in Germany, you know, and like inside this

169
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,980
envelope was this, was this printout of this paper I had in $20. And I realized for the first time

170
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,820
that I could make something that I wanted that other people might want to, and they'd be willing

171
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,700
to pay for it. So that's kind of, I think even though today I'm doing the same thing, now I have

172
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,900
a business name and a 54 employees and the whole thing. It was just me back then in, in, you know,

173
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,820
the late eighties, early nineties doing this. And I feel like it's the same exact business. I'm in

174
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,620
the same business, which is making something that I need, that I want, recognizing that there's a lot

175
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,940
of people in the world and there's probably some people out there like me who want it to, and

176
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,700
package it up, make it nice, take care of it and put a price on it and sell it. And that's what I've

177
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,300
been doing for 30 years now, basically. So in your business sort of career was the contraband sale

178
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,540
because there's some really funny stories that, you know, you've told me and you've told Tim and

179
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,100
where you, I mean, you definitely have an entrepreneurial spirit. I think so. Let's put it

180
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,380
that way. So where was that occurring? I'm trying to remember like the age out. This is junior high

181
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:52,980
school. So I don't know, what is that? 13? Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. I was into knives

182
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,460
and throwing stars and switch blades and butterfly knives and tear gas and like all this like

183
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,260
military stuff that you kind of get into as a boy. At least I did. No, no, I'm the same way. In fact,

184
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,340
this is the weirdest story. Sorry to interrupt, but it's so ridiculous that someone's mentioning

185
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,540
a butterfly knife, which I've almost forgotten what they are until you say that at an eighth grade

186
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:20,340
party, I had my butterfly knife because I was so cool. And this girl, she was the girlfriend of one

187
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,300
of my friends and she was just like the coolest girl in the class. Like she was like a cool girl,

188
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:34,660
and her name was Dottie, short for Dorothy. And somehow like I let her talk me into carving her

189
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,980
initial D into my shoulder with the knife, which she did. And I actually still have this scar on

190
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,500
my arm. I still have the D on my right shoulder from that eighth grade party with the butterfly

191
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,860
knife. And I didn't see Dottie ended up leaving school and stuff and we lost track of each other,

192
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,060
but I kind of came back into contact with her in 2016. And it was the first thing I showed her.

193
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,100
I was like, do you remember this? That is crazy. So someone encouraged you to do that and you did it?

194
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,580
That's wild. Yeah. Were you just kind of in this like misty, I'm going to impress this girl thing,

195
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,620
or was there? The funny thing is like I was sort of my quote unquote, you know, air quote

196
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,260
girlfriend at the time was like another girl anyway, who I was really into. So no, I don't even

197
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,180
think I was trying to impress Dottie per se as much as maybe just everybody there. Like,

198
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:31,540
look at, I'm tough enough that I can stand here while a girl grinds a knife into my arm while I

199
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:39,060
bleed and I won't flinch. Wow. Your next level. I mean, I think it's speaks to just how it's

200
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:45,300
amazing our species survive sometimes when you think of how stupid someone like me could be.

201
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,140
Especially when we all get to be 13, you know, just stupid. And you're no stranger to stupidity.

202
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,140
No offense. No stranger to it. We're in the stupid 13 year old club. So somehow I stumbled

203
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,460
on this catalog called the Sportsman's Guide, which was like one of these mail order army supply

204
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,940
camping kind of things. I think maybe my dad was on some listing like that showed up or something

205
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:14,580
right that. And I just loved it. How could you not as a camel gear and like tactical flashlights and

206
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,180
all this kind of stuff. And I had a job. So I had money because my parents didn't give me any,

207
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,500
but I had a good job. Good job selling shoes when I was in tennis rackets. And but it was

208
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,260
actually a pretty good pink job because I had a commission and I was a good salesperson. So I could

209
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,540
sell enough. And I was making like, I remember 250 bucks in a week and I bought a bunch of this stuff.

210
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,260
That's a ton of money. There's a lot. Holy cow. There was a certain tennis racket called the

211
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:46,740
Yamaha secret 10. And if you sold that racket, you got $10 commission. Now I didn't play tennis.

212
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,340
I'm ashamed of this now. I didn't play tennis, but I told customers I did. And I said, I've never

213
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,460
played better than with this Yamaha secret 10 such a horrible lie. Like I feel terrible about it.

214
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,260
But anyway, I amassed a small, very, very small, small fortune, but enough for me to place an order

215
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,780
for some stuff that I wanted, but I didn't have a credit card because you can't, you don't have one

216
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:16,500
under 13. So things came COD cash on delivery. Yeah. Remember that. I totally forgot about COD.

217
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,940
Yeah. I don't know if they still do that or not, but the UPS guy would come to our house

218
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,500
and I would give him cash. So I'd stay home from school that day. I'd fake that I was sick. I'd say

219
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,660
I'm from school and the UPS person would come and I would, I would give him, give him cash

220
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,500
and I'd get this box of stuff. And then I would basically make a catalog and sell it to my friends.

221
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,060
I'd like, I get the stuff and it, I actually physically made a catalog by cutting and pasting

222
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,780
things and doubling the price and sold it to my friends. And it wasn't even for the money. I didn't

223
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,620
care. It was just like fun. It's fun to get something and sell it for twice or whatever.

224
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,780
So I did that for a while until I got in trouble. Why did you get in trouble? I got in trouble doing

225
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,860
some other things that were not directly related, but are all related to like being a hooligan.

226
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,700
Basically some friends, a particular friend of mine, he, I don't know who convinced to, to do

227
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:10,420
this. So I'm not going to blame him or take the blame. One of us decided to fake assist, just again,

228
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,460
terrible fake poison. One of our friends by putting like a tic tac in his milk at lunch. And then he

229
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,940
drank it. We told him we poisoned him. Stupid, stupid, right? So we didn't of course, but he

230
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,820
passed out in math that day later on. The power of the placebo. There you go.

231
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,340
And so then like they had to pump his stomach because it's like, I got in trouble for that.

232
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,620
And then that was just tied into all this other stuff. And then like some friend got caught by

233
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,900
his parents with knives. Where'd you get those? Well, I got them from J. It's like the whole thing

234
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,460
came crashing down. So your empire comes crashing down. Empire crashing down. But it was interesting

235
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,300
because my parents told me, they said, Hey, look, if you don't clean up, we're going to send you to

236
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,940
boarding school. And I cleaned up like that moment. I wasn't bad. I was just having fun.

237
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,780
I was pushing as far as I could until I couldn't anymore. And then I couldn't. And that was it.

238
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,860
Now, did your parents not put limits on you before? Not really. And now I'm asking this

239
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,940
question through the lens of being a parent who's like, I think anybody listening to this,

240
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,700
who's a parent, including you. The challenge, I think there are many challenges being a parent,

241
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,300
but one of them is by definition, there is enough of an age gap between you and your kid

242
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,620
that this notion of setting limits is arbitrary enough because you don't have a great frame of

243
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,100
reference. As an example, an obvious example, what is the limit around electronics? Well,

244
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,940
it wasn't an issue for me when I was growing up. We had this one total sack of shit cathode ray

245
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,540
tube in our house that you wouldn't want to watch anyway. Like there were no limits around TV

246
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,180
because all you wanted to do was go outside and play sports. So like that whole concept of needing

247
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,180
to limit television or things that didn't yet exist, like phones and iPads, I don't have a

248
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,660
reference. I can't look back and say, well, this limit was placed on me and it was good,

249
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:04,260
or this limit was too stringent. Presumably for our kids, their kids will be in a situation

250
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,900
where the limits will look different. So I really, I enjoy this topic because I feel like there are

251
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,660
some limits that must be preserved across generations, limits around respect, limits

252
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,060
around authority or things like that. So have you reflected back on the limits that were set on you

253
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,300
and how you thought about those with your two children, for example? I have, and I'm terrified

254
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,980
of it to be honest, because I know what I got away with. And I feel like where I lived was a lot

255
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,060
safer to do some of these things perhaps. But I remember my parents were very, and still are,

256
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,700
but now they don't control me anymore, right? But they were very forgiving. They were very supportive

257
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,380
of me. They were there all the time, whenever I needed something, whenever I wanted something.

258
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,660
You were an only child, right? Only child. So that was probably part of it.

259
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,220
My mom actually tried to have a few kids before me, but had, I think, three or four miscarriages,

260
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,540
maybe three before. That puts a little extra pressure on you as this sort of chosen one.

261
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,260
Yeah, it was sort of me. I mean, I didn't know that. I didn't really care, but like looking back,

262
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:10,180
I can see that now. And it makes me ashamed of some of the things that I did as a child.

263
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,740
For example, I ran track and my parents were every single track meet. I was on play basketball,

264
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,220
freshman year, and I sucked. I got into one game, but my parents were at every game,

265
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,580
even though I was on the bench the whole time. So they were always there for me,

266
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,420
always were supportive, always gave me plenty of latitude and lots of room to do what I wanted to

267
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,940
do. And I really appreciate that. And I think that that was valuable, but I got away with a lot

268
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,580
of things that I probably shouldn't have. I certainly pushed them a bit too far, and I pushed

269
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:44,660
myself a bit too far. And there was quite a bit of tension near the end of my hooligan time. And

270
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,500
then I remember they just kind of told me this eventually, like you've got to stop this, or we're

271
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,220
going to send you away. And you're what, like 15, 16, I don't think I was driving it. So it's probably

272
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,260
15. I got in with like some of the wrong kids. My parents knew it. They called it from the beginning.

273
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,980
They go, you shouldn't be hanging out with these people. But I did. Because you know, that's what

274
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,620
you do. It's cool, right? And the pressures that's sort of what I'm aware of now, like,

275
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,460
I mean, my son's only five and my daughter's 11 months. So like, I've got some time here. But

276
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,700
you can only do so much as a parent, I mean, kids are going to sort of do what they're going to do,

277
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,580
I think. Anyway, they gave me a lot of room. I did a lot of things I learned a lot. But they also

278
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,340
taught me from an early age to be very independent, like getting a job right when I could and working

279
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,860
and that sort of thing. So I think the independence part of it was really important. I think it really

280
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,580
did shape me that I could figure things out on my own and get where I needed to go without a lot of

281
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,380
support, let's say there was support in terms of were there for you. But I figured a lot of things

282
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,460
out myself. I was never really good at school either. I was okay. But I wasn't great. I think

283
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,780
it just kind of bored me. Thinking back to your point about kids now, I'm just aware of these

284
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,300
things. Now, it helped me think about what it was like to be that age again. So when these things

285
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,580
come up with my kids, I'll hopefully be able to empathize a bit more than maybe if I was more

286
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:05,220
perfect. So you managed to dodge this boarding school bullet, right? Yeah, I did. And then you

287
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,020
go to college and what do you study? I studied finance, went to University of Arizona. I picked

288
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,420
finance because I didn't know what else to pick. I loved business. I was kind of doing business

289
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,100
before, right? My dad was working for himself. My grandfather started a grocery store chain way back

290
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,380
when. I think it's something I've always wanted to do. And I felt like I was good at it. I like the

291
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,460
stock market and like on the stock market, I guess that's a finance degree. I don't know,

292
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,620
right? So I did that. And truthfully, I went to Arizona to chase the weather and to chase a girl

293
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,900
at the time in high school who was also going there and some friends I had were going there.

294
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,060
So I didn't really care. I didn't think that much about college. And I remember a couple of years

295
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,060
in, I just wanted to be done because I was actually doing business. That was then by that

296
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,460
time I was starting to do website design. After that, I was offered a job in San Diego and I moved

297
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,540
to San Diego for about six months. I lived in the gas lamp way back in the nineties.

298
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,580
When it was even dirtier.

299
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,260
It was just beginning to turn. They just built a Horton Plaza. If that's right,

300
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,780
they just built that and things are starting to change on there. But anyway, I started doing

301
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,260
website design and I actually felt like school was interfering with my education. Like I felt like

302
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,540
I was learning so much more from doing business and finding clients and delivering work and getting

303
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,180
paid or not getting paid and understanding what it's like to work with people in the world.

304
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,900
That school began to feel faker and faker to me because everything was very abstract.

305
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,020
Everything was not real. The work we were doing, the projects we were doing, they were all

306
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,940
manufactured in a way where it just didn't feel like this is really like I can learn the real

307
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,540
thing. Why would I spend my time doing this? But eventually I finished.

308
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,220
But let's pause there for a moment because I'm really curious as to what the real assessment is

309
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,220
of this phenomenon that everybody loves to talk about, which is how many of the great entrepreneurs

310
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,380
that we think of didn't finish college. Everybody loves to tell the story about Zuckerberg and jobs

311
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,260
and gates. I'm curious now that you've been in the workforce for a long time, but not only that,

312
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:07,460
but you're so highly attuned to the notion of recruiting talent. Are there a subset of people

313
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,780
whose talent is such that going to university or college is truly a waste of time? They're going

314
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,020
to go on and be really successful without it versus there's another subset of people who

315
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:25,780
have the potential to be equally successful, but they need that time to be on the rails versus it

316
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,620
doesn't matter. Could Jeff Bezos have just said, forget MIT, I'm literally going to create this

317
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,260
thing. If the timing were right and he could have started Amazon, if he were 10 years younger,

318
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,140
could he have skipped college and investment banking and just started Amazon and would we

319
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,260
be adding him to the list of the Zuckerbergs, the gates, the jobs? It's hard to say. I think that

320
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,380
there's some mythology around some of that. I mean, some people like Steve Jobs went to school

321
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,940
like at a liberal arts college and sort of got into all sorts of interesting things like taking

322
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,020
calligraphy classes and stuff. That influenced his sort of flavor for design. Exactly. So the fact

323
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,740
that he didn't finish school to me doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you finish school or not in

324
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,660
our field. I mean, perhaps in medicine, it certainly matters, right? But like in our world,

325
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,900
it doesn't matter so much because I think it's about what experiences do you want? What experiences

326
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,820
do you find interesting? And being motivated by the things that you're doing. So some people are

327
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,420
motivated by learning in school. Some people are motivated by learning outside of school. I don't

328
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:29,540
think that there's a specific breed or type of person that couldn't finish school and needs to

329
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,100
leave the world, a school, the educational world and get out in the real world. There's some moments

330
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:40,260
in history where timing really matters. I mean, timing always matters. But for example, Zuckerberg,

331
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,140
Facebook only exists because he went to Harvard. It only exists because he wanted to build this

332
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,580
thing to get to know other people at school or like the fact that he finished school.

333
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,860
Yeah, exactly. And you could even say the same experience.

334
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,460
If he had not gone to college, like everyone likes to focus on he didn't graduate, like that's cool.

335
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,260
Whatever. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But what's interesting is that to me,

336
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,540
although I have a big problem with Facebook, but Facebook exists today because he did go to college.

337
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,740
I think that's actually the more interesting thing to focus on rather than like, did you finish

338
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,460
or not? Did you actually finish and get this piece of paper? Yeah. So if we want to play with all

339
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,460
these myths like Steve Jobs, calligraphy classes, well, that influenced design, that influenced

340
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,460
typography on the Mac and that made a huge that changed the world in a lot of ways. So

341
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,300
school was important to jobs and school was important to Zuckerberg. I don't know Gates'

342
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,660
history and whatnot. He and Paul Allen met in high school, didn't they? They might have been

343
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,700
old friends. Yeah. But again, like here's the other thing that I think is interesting. We all like to

344
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,340
call out the exceptions and think there's a lesson there. Right. And we don't really know

345
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,580
what the graveyard looks like. Right. The contra positive. And it's the same thing with venture

346
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,220
capital. I'm sure we might get into this, but I can jump into it for a second, which is that

347
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,220
people like to look at or like hard work. Let's say hard work is actually a better example.

348
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,300
Bezos and whatever they work their ass off. So like, well, there's a lot of people who work their

349
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,460
ass off who get nowhere and they work really, really, really, really hard and they make minimum

350
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,540
wage if they're lucky and they work their whole life and it's very, very difficult. So this idea

351
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,780
of hard work getting you somewhere, I don't buy it. Wow. I wanted to go down the path of contrarian

352
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,380
case and views. We're going there. We're there. I don't think that hard work,

353
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,860
the argument is that like no one else is working as hard as Zuckerberg, therefore Zuckerberg worked

354
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,420
hard and he, come on, please. There's only 24 hours in a day to begin with. I don't even know

355
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:30,420
what working hard means. Like in my opinion, if you get to sit behind a desk all day in an

356
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,980
air conditioned room, there's no such thing as hard work. Hard work is picking strawberries in

357
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,580
the field. Hard work is roofing in 120 degree heat. That's hard work. Intellectual work can

358
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,380
be challenging work, no question about it. And it can be difficult work. But as far as like the hard

359
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,980
part of it, the word hard, like to me, that's physically hard sweating, not getting paid,

360
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,340
not being respected. That's hard. It's hard to go to work every day when that's your reality.

361
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,860
Anyway, I have a slightly different take on that I suppose than most, but going in circles a little

362
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,420
bit. But basically, there's a lot of myths around these exceptions. And we tend to focus on the

363
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,220
exceptions as like those are the exceptions and the exceptional people. A lot of this has to do

364
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,260
with luck and timing and also skill and talent and observation and opportunity and all these

365
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:19,300
things. But I think we put a lot of weight into things that probably have very little to do with

366
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,660
it. In fact, so we can find patterns like these people dropped out of school, therefore I should

367
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,580
drop out of school. And there's a lot of people who feel that way. They want to follow their idols.

368
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,300
What I would say is, well, what did they get from that experience? Maybe that's something

369
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,060
you should look for versus the drop out, the drop out just a moment in time, you decide not to go

370
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,580
anymore. That doesn't really mean anything. I think that is actually a great point. And you're

371
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:45,620
right about the patterns. I mean, I think we are pattern forming machines and it probably served us

372
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:51,380
incredibly well. In fact, I wrote a blog post on this a long time ago. It's rare that I would even

373
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,260
remember a blog post I wrote truthfully. This is like one of my favorites. I don't know why. I just

374
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,900
really, I've probably even gone back and read it once or twice. So I don't remember the details,

375
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,260
but the gist of it was we're not wired to think scientifically. So all of this critical thought

376
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:13,780
stuff, reason, trying to distinguish between correlation and causation, these are incredibly

377
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:21,780
modern phenomenon. In fact, you could argue that they represent less than five basis points of our

378
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:28,500
genetic existence. Meaning like less than one 20th of 1% of our genetic existence has been

379
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,140
in exposure to the idea of thinking logically, going through formal logic and reason. The

380
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:41,780
scientific method has not even been around for 400 years. And if that sounds like a lot,

381
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:47,060
obviously just reflect on how long our genes have been around. But what has been around for a long

382
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,300
time is pattern recognition. In fact, you would argue that it hasn't just been around for a long

383
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:59,620
time. We have sharpened that tool so well because as I think the example I remember using in this

384
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,060
blog post was like, if you were walking around in a tribe of 30 people and you see somebody over

385
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,700
there getting the desirable mate, then you want to emulate what they're doing. You see somebody over

386
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:15,940
there getting sick. Well, presumably whatever he ate or drank, you shouldn't be doing. And again,

387
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,580
will you ever be able to tease out the correlation versus the causation? Not a chance, but if you were

388
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:27,140
a good correlation identifying machine, that was a very beneficial trait to be able to carry on.

389
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,660
And I just think that on this topic, which is again, it's off topic, but it's such an interesting

390
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,180
notion that we observe in ourselves. Most of us default back into that without even realizing it.

391
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,220
Even when we think we're smart and smarty pants, in the end, we're still kind of a bunch of knuckle

392
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:50,340
dragging pattern recognizing brain stems. For sure. And also we look for the patterns that

393
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,020
correlate with our own stories. Then you get into all of the biases, of course. So you have

394
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,940
the confirmations that come with these things. Right. And that's sort of where it gets to be

395
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,700
dangerous, but you kind of have to. I mean, you can't go through the world looking at everything

396
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,140
fresh all the time. You just wouldn't get anywhere. I mean, that's what's so I think fascinating about

397
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:12,100
looking at kids. I assume from what I can tell from observing kids, like they don't have those

398
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,300
patterns yet, especially when they're young and they see a leaf for the first time, they see a plant

399
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,820
for the first time, they see a caterpillar for the first time, and they're fascinated by it. You and

400
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,220
I walk right past those things because we know what they are and the pattern is clear. That's a

401
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,020
leaf. That's the thing. So you end up missing all these interesting details, probably because you

402
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,380
jump over things. It's like not all leaves are the same, but we, so that's a leaf. Big deal.

403
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,660
But a kid's like, what's this leaf? What's that leaf? What's this leaf? And you're like,

404
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,340
come on, we got to go, like get your shoes on. But they're fascinated by these little things.

405
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,220
So I think that we have to, of course, function with patterns or through patterns.

406
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,660
But I think oftentimes they end up reinforcing our own wishes. We're excited about the person

407
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,260
who dropped out of school, therefore, like we find the patterns, we find the things that line up,

408
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,580
and then we can tell our own story that matches with our own internal story. But I try to look

409
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,100
for things that are a little bit outside of that because it's a little obvious. Some of these things

410
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,380
are really obvious in terms of if you don't dig a little bit deeper, you end up believing the myths.

411
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,340
And I think there's a lot of that going on, especially in the entrepreneurial world right now,

412
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,620
where people are, they look to companies like these big companies and they go, well, that's the way we

413
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,460
want to build our company. And that's the way we want to be. What they do, they took $100 million,

414
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,020
we should take $100 million. And they, their founder is whatever. And so we should be that way.

415
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,740
And the thing is that I think people follow the wrong pattern. So they're looking at big,

416
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,020
huge companies. So they're starting a new business. Let's say there's three people in the business or

417
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,020
themselves, just themselves. And they're looking to like, well, how does Apple do it? Well, Apple is

418
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,620
at a totally different scale from where you are. You should not be following their patterns. Those

419
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,620
are the wrong patterns to follow. They don't make any sense for you. Just like you wouldn't expect

420
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,260
Apple to follow your patterns. Like you're just one person, but we end up following the wrong

421
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,540
patterns and doing the wrong things because we want to get what they have, but we don't realize

422
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,300
that they started out where we started out too. We just kind of feel like they just jumped to be

423
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,340
Apple. And so like, let's just do what they do and we're going to get to where they're going to get.

424
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,620
And I just don't think that's usually true. What do you think is sort of among the top

425
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:12,260
mistakes slash myths that people starting businesses make, not even making the looking

426
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:19,380
at Apple model, but looking at other successful startups, looking at like Dropbox or companies

427
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,060
where you can say, well, look, I can still remember when they were in their infancy,

428
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,220
but look what they're doing now. What are some of the common mistakes you see people talking about?

429
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:36,740
I think that most of this stuff is actually luck and timing. And there's clearly talent and skill

430
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,540
involved too, but sometimes things just happen at the right time. Meaning most of the successes

431
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:47,940
that we look to as these beacons of brilliance, we're under appreciating how much luck is involved.

432
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,540
I think so. Partially, because if you just think about it this way, like what if they all started

433
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,980
again right now? Like could Dropbox be what Dropbox is 10 years from now? Like it is 10 years in,

434
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,980
probably not. And you'd say, well, why not? They could do the exact same thing. Well, because it's

435
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,580
a different time and there's different competitive pressures and there's just different timing and

436
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,980
there's different economic things going on. If you can't replicate these successes, then there's

437
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,140
probably a lot of luck and timing involved in these things. And it's not that people don't

438
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,140
pay attention to that. I just don't think they give it enough value. I remember early in my career,

439
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,140
I thought there was no such thing as luck. I thought I was hot shit and I knew it all.

440
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,260
Where in your life cycle is this? This is in college, post college?

441
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,820
No, post college after starting our business. Probably I gave a talk. We'll have to look this

442
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:34,900
up. I gave a talk at startup school, which was a Y Combinators thing. I don't remember what year

443
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,900
this was. Maybe it was 2007. I'm just guessing. I remember someone asked about luck and I remember

444
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:47,140
answering, I don't believe in luck. I remember that answer distinctly. And I am so ashamed of

445
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,940
saying that, but that was me at the time. And I remember just being like, no, no, I did this,

446
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,140
I did that. We did it this way. It's all intentional. And as it happened for a reason,

447
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,780
the whole thing. And now I realize that that's probably not true at all. In fact,

448
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,860
if I had to start the business again right now, pretty good chance I wouldn't be able to do it

449
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,900
at all. So I think luck and timing has a lot to do with it. And there's multi-dimensional

450
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,540
luck and timing. There's like how like your time, there's the market's time, there's competitors

451
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,860
time, there's the appetite for the public's time. Like there's a whole bunch of timing things in

452
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,700
here. I just don't think people pay enough attention to that. That's number one, or maybe

453
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,260
number two and three. The other thing that I think people who start businesses don't realize

454
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:30,020
is that it only gets harder. Business only gets harder. It doesn't get easier.

455
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,140
So Basecamp is harder today than it was 20 years ago.

456
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,580
Absolutely. Because we have more people, we have more customers. With those come

457
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,780
all sorts of things. Customers, you have expectations. There's more competitors,

458
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,900
employees, there's just more people. People are difficult. There's just the notion of doing the

459
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,820
same thing for a long period of time and becoming blind to new things. And you're so used to the

460
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,620
way you've done things.

461
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,420
I mean, is it safe to say it's harder or it's just different? Like I'm trying to think of an example,

462
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,980
like I don't know, every example I can think of, I can immediately think of a counter example.

463
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,340
But let me give you something kind of more specific than perhaps to frame it.

464
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,100
I'll hear a lot of entrepreneurs saying like, I'm going to work my ass off now.

465
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,820
So I don't have to later. The assumption is, is that if I put in all this time now,

466
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,860
it's going to be easier later. So therefore I don't need to work those kind of hours or

467
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,820
all hire people to do that stuff. Never works out that way.

468
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,820
Why is that the case?

469
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,500
Well, I don't know.

470
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:35,220
How much of it is the drive to work so hard now under the guise of not having to work hard later,

471
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,940
when you get to later, you have failed to address that which it is that's driving you to work so

472
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,740
hard in the first place. And so, you know, work expands to fill available time. You just come up

473
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,420
with more stuff to do, some of which may not even be necessary.

474
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,300
Most of it, I would say is probably not necessary. I think that one of the reasons why it happens

475
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:59,540
this way is that we're just our creatures of habit. So whatever you practice, you get better at.

476
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,020
And sometimes you don't even realize you're practicing, but if you're working 80 hour days,

477
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,540
you're going to get really good at work or 90, 80 hour weeks, you're going to get really,

478
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,140
really good at working 80 hour weeks. That's just what you're going to do 12 hour days like that.

479
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,020
And then at some point, you're like, that's the only way to do this, right? Because that's what

480
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,260
I've done. That's how I've gotten to where I've gotten. And it's because of the hours I put in.

481
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,940
And therefore, like if I pull back, like this is all going to fall apart. So we just,

482
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,380
that's what we begin to do. And that's how we begin to work. The other thing is,

483
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,420
I think people underestimate how difficult it is to have employees. I love our employees,

484
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,180
but like, it's difficult to have employees. Like when you're starting by yourself, it's just you,

485
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,180
you'd make all the calls, you bring someone else on, maybe it's great, bring the fourth or fifth

486
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,620
person on at some point, there's personality conflicts, things get a little bit more difficult.

487
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,900
And then you have to manage people and you have to hire managers, and then you're a little bit out

488
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,820
of the loop. And before you know it, you own the business, but you're the last to know everything.

489
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,900
That's important about the business. You don't know what people are upset, you don't know what's

490
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,060
going on. You're so far removed from it. And this is what happens. And I think business just gets

491
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,500
harder. It does also just become different. So there's just the difference that's true.

492
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,340
But I think it becomes harder. And I don't think people realize that. And so I just see people

493
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,780
going into things, not recognizing that and just assuming that they can be self destructive in the

494
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,060
short term, because in the long term, it'll be worth it. And I just haven't really seen a lot of

495
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,740
that play out. I see a lot of people actually ultimately destructing themselves and destroying

496
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,380
themselves. And then maybe selling their business or getting out and then trying to come back and

497
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,860
never being able to do it again. So the other thing I would say, I don't know what number I'm on here,

498
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,140
if there's even numbers, but I would say like, if lightning strikes, like, keep that lightning in

499
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,380
the bottle, like, it's a lot of people who are serial entrepreneurs. I'm not one of those people,

500
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,500
I don't believe in that necessarily. I think if you are lucky enough to have a hit, write it out

501
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,860
until it's over versus stop and try and do it again. Chances are very slim that you can really

502
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,420
do it again, if you actually truly have a hit. So I'm not ashamed to say I don't think I could do

503
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,100
this again. I'm totally comfortable with that. A lot of entrepreneurs feel like they need to

504
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,460
prove something to someone or themselves that they can do it over and over and over. That's just not

505
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,820
me. So I think putting that idea out there is a good alternative because a lot of people think that

506
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,540
starting a business selling it five years in doing other ones selling it five years in is like the

507
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,100
way to make a career. I think the way to make a career is to stay in business, not to get out of

508
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,260
business. Now again, is it possible that there's just a different itch that's being scratched? I

509
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:25,940
mean, I want to come back to sort of this because, you know, your motivation is, you know, it's clearly

510
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,020
not driven by some exit. I mean, Basecamp's a private company, right? There are probably how

511
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,260
many times a year you asked when you're going to take this company public. Probably not that much

512
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:40,020
anymore. Because we've made the answer very clear. Yeah. I get an email or two every week from a VC

513
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,500
firm or private equity firm or whatever wanting to invest. And the answer is always no. I just

514
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:51,380
don't want that pressure on me. Like the other thing I think that becomes clear or has become

515
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,620
clear for me, and by the way, everything I'm saying is my point of view. None of these are facts.

516
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,260
Like this is just what I'm saying is that people end up making things really hard on themselves.

517
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,940
I don't think business is that difficult if you don't make it hard on yourself. But people make it,

518
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,780
they grow too fast, they raise money from the outside, they put unnecessary expectations on

519
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,460
themselves. They are forced into a growth track where they have to grow and they have to produce

520
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,780
returns. They have to then hire people because they have money in the bank from the investor,

521
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,780
because that's where you spend money on people basically in marketing. And then you get ahead of

522
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,420
yourself and you're over your skis and now you're screwed, you're in trouble. So now you have to keep

523
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,260
fueling the growth and raising more money. And it's like, I've talked to a bunch of people who've

524
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:40,100
done this and they all pine for the good old days when they were a group of eight people just doing

525
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,980
it right. I mean, it sort of got out of control for them. So I see that happening a lot too. And

526
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,260
I think this is like self destructive behavior, even though people don't necessarily see it that

527
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,620
way. They see it as like business building, but a lot of businesses are destructed and destroyed

528
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:59,460
by unreasonable expectations of growth and having too much money in the bank. Something I'll talk

529
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,140
about before is that making money is a skill, just like playing guitar is a skill, just like

530
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,260
anything is a skill. And if you want to get good at it, you have to practice it. In our industry,

531
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,020
in the software industry, a lot of companies will lose money for years and years and years. And

532
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,940
they think they actually say like, we can just pull the lever and become profitable whenever we want.

533
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,060
That would be like saying you can walk on stage and just play guitar really well whenever you want.

534
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,020
You can't, you have to practice. You have to practice making money, which means that

535
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,660
if you keep borrowing money and keep having other people fund your operations and you don't have to

536
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,700
get in the black, then when are you going to get good at this skill? And to me, like an entrepreneur

537
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,980
needs to be able to make money. They need to be able to make their own fuel, need to be able to

538
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,260
make their own food and their own water. That's what profit is. And profit is the only thing that

539
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,980
keeps you in business ultimately. And if you have to rely on other people to provide that fuel for

540
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,140
you, I think you're at a real disadvantage and I think you're putting undue pressure on yourself.

541
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,220
So let's use an example that's very top of mind because it's just, it's somewhat recent,

542
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,660
which is Uber, right? Yeah, terrible business. Uber is not profitable, but the story is it could

543
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,660
be profitable at any moment. It just has to choose profitability over growth, right?

544
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:10,100
Well, it's a great example because it's a textbook terrible business. Everyone thinks it's a great

545
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,060
success. It's horrible. They lost what, 1.8 billion last year on 11 billion in revenue or whatever it

546
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,900
is, or maybe last quarter. I don't even know if it's quarter a year, what numbers, they're just

547
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,980
huge losses. Right. The fact that you can't remember that, it probably says enough. Massive

548
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,780
losses. And their CEO says, just a few days ago, he's like, we're just getting started on this

549
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,580
amazing journey. It's like, you've actually been in business for a long time. Yeah, about 10 years,

550
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,540
right? 10 years. You've raised over a billion dollars in capital. You're a public company now.

551
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,660
Like when is this journey, when is this going to work? Because right now, I think right now for

552
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,940
every buck they make or they pull in, they're losing 20 or 30 cents or wherever it is. It's like

553
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,140
terrible. Like the economics are terrible and they don't seem like they're going to change unless they

554
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:56,660
actually change the pricing model, which might make it less attractive to riders. On top of that,

555
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,420
Uber is a dumpster fire in terms of ethics. They've done a lot of bad things, let's say,

556
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,340
with tracking journalists and the way they went after competitors and a whole bunch of stuff.

557
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,540
That's pushed by growth. They have to show numbers. These businesses like Uber and even like

558
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,780
Lyft and like WeWork and like a number of these businesses that are, quote, successful, they're

559
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,100
not at all. They're actually terrible businesses. The dry cleaner on the corner is a better business.

560
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,780
They're going to be around longer than WeWork. I don't follow this stuff at all. This is all

561
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,020
sort of, again, I'm one of those guys that would just naively say, well,

562
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,540
they're everywhere so they're doing well, right? Yeah, or just that, oh, they sent the concept of

563
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,620
WeWork makes sense. But truthfully, I've never put my business hat on and actually scratched

564
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:44,500
the back of the envelope and looked at what they're paying per square foot and how they arbitrage it

565
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,060
and then what their middle costs are. I haven't done that analysis. All you have to do is look

566
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,980
at their filing and they say, there's a good chance we will never be profitable. They know

567
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,540
that themselves. How is that possible? That's what almost all of these IPOs that file these

568
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,540
days in the tech world say, there's a good chance we will never become profitable.

569
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,380
That's what it says in their S1s. Is WeWork's S1 on the street? Yes, it is. Now it is.

570
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,420
I didn't even know that. These businesses are terrible.

571
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,540
But then let's use the counter example of Amazon. Sure.

572
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:19,300
So Amazon went public long before they turned to profit, continued to lose

573
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:27,540
incredible amounts of money while growing in equity value like crazy. Do you argue that AWS

574
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,260
basically saved Amazon or do you argue that at some point Amazon just turned the ship and said,

575
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,740
look, we're going to focus more on profitability than on pure growth?

576
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,100
Let me even step back further and go, I don't care because it's one example.

577
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,620
And this is the thing that ends up happening. I will address that.

578
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,460
Amazon might be an exception is what you're...

579
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,460
I think pretty much most of these companies are exceptions. Because if you think about,

580
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,580
most of the ones we all talk about are exceptions. I will address the Amazon point in a second though,

581
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,820
but people always will go, well, what about Amazon? Well, you're not Amazon. And if it was

582
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:06,500
so easy, everyone company would be doing this. They're not. Amazon is a very different kind of

583
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,620
company. They've basically said, we don't want to pay anything in taxes. So we're going to roll

584
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,180
all of our profits back into the business. AWS is a huge part of their business.

585
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,380
Maybe for people listening to this who were getting a little deep in the weeds,

586
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,780
can you tell people what AWS is and how that is such an important piece of Amazon?

587
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:28,820
Yeah. So AWS is Amazon Web Services, which is basically an outsourced cloud. You can basically

588
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,860
use Amazon services and hardware to run your own business in their cloud. They built it for

589
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,380
themselves and they basically made it available for everybody else. So instead of having to

590
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,140
buy a data center or a co-host physical machine somewhere, you can just buy a slice of theirs,

591
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,020
if that hopefully makes sense. Yeah. And I remember just to put this in perspective,

592
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,900
I remember in 2014, one of my best friends, maybe it was 2013, but it was 13 or 14. One of my best

593
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,380
friends who was running a hedge fund, we were having dinner one night and whenever I'm having

594
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,980
dinner with people, I'm much more interested in their world than mine. So I try to monopolize the

595
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,740
conversation around them. So I don't have to answer a bunch of questions. And this was one of

596
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,660
those nights where I was like, tell me about the most interesting long position you have right now.

597
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:12,180
And he's like, Amazon. And I'm thinking it's going to be some company I've never heard of.

598
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,460
And he's going to tell me about some offshore oil company in Brazil that's got this thing and

599
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,540
bowl on. It's like, no, it's Amazon. And I'm like, why? And that was the very first time I ever heard

600
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:28,900
of AWS. And he basically showed me the entire share price of Amazon is captured by AWS.

601
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:38,100
You're getting a retail business for free in 2013 and you have a appropriately valued AWS.

602
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,820
And of course, me naively, I was thinking, but their price to earning ratio is so blah, blah, blah.

603
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,500
200 or 500 or whatever.

604
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,620
He's like, no, no, no, you're thinking about this the wrong way. So what you're saying is,

605
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,700
look, that's a bit of an exception. I don't know enough about Microsoft, but given that they're a

606
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,540
software business and we've been talking about software, I assume Microsoft was pretty profitable

607
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,940
at the outset. They've been profitable for years as has Apple, two great companies,

608
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:07,220
wonderful companies. I guess my point is this, their stories actually don't matter because

609
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,660
that's not like in my world that doesn't matter because I'm more interested in small businesses

610
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,780
and like real businesses that have to show profit. Like you can't be Amazon.

611
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,380
The dry cleaner in the corner cannot be Amazon. The pizza shop in the corner cannot be Amazon.

612
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,260
They're not going to like, if you said, hey, pizza shop, let's say this, let's say a pizza shop owner

613
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,060
comes up to you and goes, I've got an idea. I'm going to lose money in every slice of pizza I sell,

614
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,980
but I'm going to sell a lot of them. What do you think of my business? You go, that's stupid.

615
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,180
What are you talking about? You're going to be out of business and everyone in the world would know

616
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,500
that. So like those are the economic laws that most people are under Amazon and some of these

617
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,340
other companies are exceptions. Now Apple, hugely profitable. Microsoft is profitable.

618
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,300
Those to me are better models than like, but what about Amazon? I have a lot of respect for

619
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,540
what Amazon's done. I also lately have a lot less respect for what Amazon's doing. I think that

620
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,420
they might be a net negative given a number of different things. I think the pressure they put

621
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:07,300
on the system, the fact they don't pay federal income tax. And I know they say, well, we're

622
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:13,060
doing what's within the law. Like, okay, fine. But I think there should be a little bit more

623
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,300
corporate responsibility in the world. And I think like companies that generate billions in revenues

624
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,700
have an obligation to pay taxes. But aside from that, I also think that given their largess,

625
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,020
I feel like they could treat workers a little better and they can do a number of things. I

626
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,340
also think they put undue pressure on smaller businesses and they sort of dominate the market.

627
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:37,940
For example, like our book, 98% of the sales come through Amazon. And that's just kind of wrong.

628
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,980
I don't think that's good. Even though it's convenient to buy, they made the user experience

629
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:48,820
incredible. So I can't fault them for running that kind of business, but it still feels like

630
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,820
in the world, things are a little bit better when there's more options, not fewer options.

631
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,580
And I think that Amazon has reduced the number of options people typically have these days.

632
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:02,660
But that's an aside. My general point is that we all like to look at these outliers and go,

633
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,540
but what about? And I go, well, that's not your world. You don't get to be them, unfortunately.

634
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,380
You don't get to be them. You have to actually generate more money than you spend. You have to

635
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:16,660
pay your employees. The public is not going to endlessly give you money forever. You're just not

636
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,260
that. So we can look at these examples, but I just don't think they're relevant to most companies,

637
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,380
truly. What's the natural history then of these businesses of the WeWorks and the Ubers of the

638
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,020
world? Like you, I mean, you sort of, I think basically said, look, at some point the public

639
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,300
will either demand profitability, in which point prices have to go up, in which case profitability

640
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,980
might not be as much as you think, because at some point you're going to drive people back to

641
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,980
taxis or whatever the alternative was. I'm still sort of reeling in this idea that these companies

642
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,620
are that bad from a pure business standpoint. They are. You should look at the numbers. They're

643
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:54,900
terrible. Truly. And this is like not an opinion. I know you don't read fiction and that's something

644
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,500
you and I have in common. We've just basically decided there's too much other stuff I need to

645
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:05,460
read fiction. I've read one work of fiction since 1999. So I'm at 20 years, one work of fiction.

646
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,500
But this is another one of those things that I used to be very interested in. When I worked at

647
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,620
McKinsey, like there is nothing I enjoyed more than reading the entire Wall Street Journal cover

648
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,340
to cover every morning. I don't even read the news anymore. I've just decided I'm not reading

649
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,500
the news like ever. I'm the same way. I don't read the news either. But I've looked into these

650
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,340
numbers because I'm curious. No, it's relevant. They're terrible. They're terrible numbers. And

651
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,980
the thing is, is like these companies, there's a sense that they deserve to exist no matter what.

652
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:36,020
No, they can go out of business. Like Uber could go out of business and why shouldn't they?

653
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,580
It's a crappy business. It's a terrible business right now. Maybe it'll turn around at some point.

654
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:45,140
They've had 10 years. Maybe it'll turn on some point. But there's this assumption that these

655
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,980
things are now part of our world. Therefore, they must be there forever. I just don't think that

656
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,740
that's true. There will be other people who come along who maybe make a profitable model out of

657
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,580
this. But and there's been a number of things around ride sharing lately that have come out.

658
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,260
Traffic is worse because of ride sharing. Pollution is worse because of ride sharing

659
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,900
because there's a lot of cars idling with nobody in them. So will autonomous vehicles

660
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,820
change this for Uber? I think they might. Although I think that's much further off

661
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:14,980
than we all think. I think it's very, very far actually. But I do think that that's probably

662
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,500
what they're holding out for. They want to dump all their drivers because they don't want to deal

663
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,340
with them. And they've kind of said this publicly, which is amazing to say that about people who work

664
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,340
for you right now. Like we're basically trying to eliminate you and they want to go through

665
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:31,940
autonomous. But I think that's also selling the dream to investors. Right to buy a longer.

666
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:36,100
Longer position and just go in and make the investment. But I think that's very, very,

667
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,620
very far out. So they're of course running trials and doing all the stuff and they get new stories

668
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,220
for it. But I think we're very, very far off from that. You can just see like the best in the

669
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:49,140
business at this Tesla. We don't have one now, but we had one. And they're autopilot. Like it's

670
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,620
actually a crime to call it autopilot. I think they shouldn't have called it that. That's part

671
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,860
of the problem. The expectations are wrong. It's not autopilot. It's like assisted driving. And

672
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,620
it's really quite good at that. But to leave your hands off the wheel and trust the thing,

673
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,460
which is what autopilot would basically suggest, you're going to kill yourself. So

674
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,100
if they're the best in the game and that's where they're currently at, maybe there's some massive

675
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:14,260
technological advances around the corner that we don't see over the hill, whatever. But as it is

676
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:20,020
today, we're nowhere near autonomous vehicles. Like really driving on the streets with human

677
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,420
beings and pedestrians and bicyclists and all that stuff. I just don't think it's anywhere close.

678
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,540
Yeah, that's sort of been my uninformed, I guess bias would be the only way to describe it,

679
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:36,580
which is I think the problem is way harder than it's being sold because it's way more asymmetric.

680
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,500
Yes. And I think it's easier if you, for example, I don't have to think it's it, it would be easier

681
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,900
if you had like dedicated roads only for autonomous vehicles where they would all behave the same way

682
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,820
and follow the same rules. Well, not only that, and if each car could be autonomous overnight,

683
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:56,180
in other words, if you could immediately allow every vehicle to communicate with every other

684
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,300
vehicle and you could eliminate all of the humans simultaneously, I think that's actually easier to

685
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:08,340
imagine than a gradual transition where you infuse in autonomous vehicles. And there's a point when

686
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:15,460
like 7% of them are autonomous and 93% are driven by knuckleheads. Well, the 93% of us who are

687
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:22,900
knuckleheads driving cars, I just don't know if AI is good enough to fully understand the depths of

688
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:28,500
our stupidity. I totally agree. So it's the phasing in which seems like that's the part that

689
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,740
I'm decades and decades away. I agree. If there was dedicated lanes where all the cars talk to each

690
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,500
other and they all follow the same rules and they all have the same language, different story, but

691
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,460
that's not the story. Like we can't build more roads right now. Like there's where you're going

692
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,220
to build roads in Manhattan. Of course that going to happen. So they're going to have to phase in.

693
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:50,500
And that I think is really far away. But anyway, we work Lyft, Uber, look at the economics,

694
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,580
terrible businesses. Uber and Lyft, I mean the public markets are saying these are actually

695
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,100
quite bad. They're down quite a bit off their highs with the IPO. So like people are starting

696
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,740
to wake up to this and they're saying, eh, I don't think there's anything here.

697
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,100
The funny thing is like I love talking about this stuff so much and I realize there's probably

698
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,540
somebody at this point in the podcast saying, what in the world does this have to do with

699
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:12,420
anything that I want to hear these guys talk about? So let's go back to post college,

700
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,780
you're doing some software stuff, right? Website design.

701
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,740
Website design. You ever get any interesting feedback on website design?

702
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,260
I did. So I remember when I was first getting going with this, I thought I was good. There's

703
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,340
this award thing back then, I think it was called high five awards or something like that.

704
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,740
And back then this is before you had like WordPress where people could basically take

705
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,220
a template and to it, you're doing this from scratch.

706
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:39,940
From scratch. This is like writing basic HTML, website code, basic stuff.

707
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,620
This is mid to late 90s?

708
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,220
So this was about, 95, 96 is when I started doing this stuff. Because that's kind of when

709
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,420
the web became visual before that it was like mostly text based.

710
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:54,660
Right. So Mosaic was a big step forward. And I remember the summer of 94 when I was using

711
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,660
Mosaic on a Sun workstation and it was like, I didn't know what I was looking at.

712
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,580
Yes. Total game change.

713
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,820
That was the moment that everything changed in the world.

714
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,500
Netscape IPO'd in August of 95 if I recall, right?

715
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,300
I remember when that was.

716
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,620
Okay. 94, 95 was a...

717
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,340
That's when it changed.

718
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,140
Was a step function.

719
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,740
Yeah, exactly. And that's when it changed and that's when it became commercially viable for

720
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,300
companies to have websites or even begin to think about the web.

721
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,980
There I was in college, bored, a junior, I think in 90, I graduated in 96.

722
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:28,260
I love design and I knew a little bit about computers. And back then it was really easy

723
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,340
to learn how to do this stuff because no one knew what they were doing.

724
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,460
And so like it was just dead simple. Today, it's really hard.

725
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,940
Another example, like today, could I pick up what I know today?

726
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,500
Probably not. It's really hard. I mean, yeah, I could, but like,

727
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,540
everything's got more complicated. Back then was simple.

728
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,140
Anyway, I figured out how to make some websites.

729
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,780
I went around to some sites, actually financial sites and emailed at the bottom and said like

730
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,980
webmaster at whatever, because that's what everyone had back then.

731
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,660
So I'd email these people and say, hey, I like your site, but I think I could make it look better.

732
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,940
Like, will you give me a shot? A couple of them replied yes.

733
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,980
And so I did some simple work. First job I ever had was like 600 bucks doing some guy's website.

734
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,420
Actually got him Tim, forget his last name, but it was called Profit Data Services.

735
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,780
He's actually based out of San Diego.

736
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,060
Tim Knight was his name. He's still around actually doing this stuff.

737
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,700
But anyway, he gave me a shot and I did some work for him.

738
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,020
I did some work for another guy named Keith Cruikshank in San Diego and started doing more

739
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:24,420
work for him. And then he offered me a job when I graduated from college in 96.

740
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,500
So I went out to San Diego and sort of worked with him.

741
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,060
It was just me and him for about four months, five months.

742
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,380
And I realized I'm just not built to work for other people.

743
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:35,300
I just knew it at that moment. I kind of had a suspicion before.

744
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,980
I've had jobs before, but they were like, you know, part time jobs and that's fine.

745
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,340
But as far as like a full career job, I couldn't work for somebody else.

746
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,740
I had a hard time doing something I didn't believe in or didn't agree with.

747
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,940
I just couldn't do it.

748
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,740
What do you mean by that? Like, was there, I mean,

749
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,740
these guys weren't asking you to do anything unethical.

750
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,540
No, no, no, nothing like that.

751
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,380
So what did you not believe in?

752
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,700
I realized that my motivation went to zero.

753
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,860
Because it wasn't your idea?

754
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:04,740
No, it wasn't that. It was more like, for example, an aesthetic decision or like,

755
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:10,180
if I had to do something that I just didn't agree with aesthetically or like structurally or in

756
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,940
terms of like copywriting a sentence that I didn't like, I just, it's not that I couldn't do it.

757
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,900
It's just my motivation went to zero. I just didn't want to do it.

758
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,020
So it wasn't about you having a boss. It was about you having a client.

759
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:26,260
If I'm your client and I say, Jason, you know, you probably noticed the Attia medical website sucks.

760
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:33,620
Can you help me redo it? Is the issue that I would say, well, I really, I much prefer to have

761
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:38,180
serif fonts here, but sans serif fonts here. And if you thought that was wrong,

762
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:43,300
you just couldn't do it. Or is it that I'm talking to a guy between us who's telling you

763
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,420
what I'm telling him?

764
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,100
It's not the client side. I'm okay with working with clients. It was more the boss situation.

765
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,700
And it wasn't this fellow named Keith, who was a great guy. It wasn't that.

766
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:57,380
It was just purely a function of motivation. I realized that I don't want to spend my day

767
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,900
on something I feel like I begrudgingly have to do if I don't have the intrinsic motivation to

768
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,380
get it done. Like I just, if I just like, for example, with writing, like I love writing.

769
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,140
If I had to write a sentence in a certain way just to appease somebody because they were paying me,

770
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,820
like it was, it was my job, I would write the sentence, but I'd be miserable by the end of

771
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:22,020
the day. I'm like, I don't, why am I doing this? Like, why am I spending my day doing things I

772
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,260
don't want to do and I don't agree with that? Like you could do that once or twice or five

773
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,700
times, of course. But like when that became something that was clear to me that we had like a,

774
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:36,180
we had like aesthetic differences with my boss. We had like just fundamental principle

775
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:41,940
outlook differences around the work itself. Yeah, I could do the work, but I didn't want to do the

776
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,460
work. And if I didn't want to do the work, why was I doing it? Why was I wasting his time? Why was I

777
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:50,180
wasting other people's time? Why was I wasting my time? I realized that I have to be motivated by

778
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:56,820
the work itself. That's what drives me. It's not the money. It's not success. It's like, I get the

779
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:00,420
pleasure. It's like Feynman, like the pleasure is in the final thing out, right? It's not the

780
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,900
award. It's that. And so for me, that's what it was. And if I have to do something I just didn't

781
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:09,140
enjoy, I just motivation was gone. And if you don't have that, you're screwed because then there's no

782
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,340
carrot that can pull you along. I mean, they can pull you along in the short term, but long term

783
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:16,580
camp. So which I want to come back to this theme by the way, at base camp, but let's keep going with

784
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:21,220
this story. So I quit live in San Diego for a few more months, moved back home to Chicago, and then

785
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,180
started doing freelance website design on my own, which in the mid nineties looks like what, how are

786
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,580
you finding clients? Same way I did before, which was that I would just reach out to people who had

787
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:34,580
websites because everyone's website at that time. How are you finding the people who don't have

788
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,660
websites? Aren't they the people that need you even more? No. So I've never focused on that. I

789
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:46,020
always focused on redesigning because I felt like I could show an improvement if there's context.

790
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,740
Certainly there's always context from zero to nothing, but I felt like I had the ability to

791
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:55,460
take something that someone had and elevated basically in a way where they'd be like, I want

792
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:01,700
that version of the thing that I have. So I always have focused on redesigns. So I would go to

793
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,580
websites that I use and I'd find out how to get in touch with the owner and say, Hey, sometimes I

794
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:11,060
would send them like a free mock-up that I would make or something and say, here's what I would do

795
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,140
with your thing. And eventually you get a few clients and you get a few clients and sometimes

796
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,660
you don't have any. So you make up a fake client and design something yourself and show someone

797
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:22,580
something. This is what I would do to this bank if I could, which is something we eventually did

798
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:28,980
at our company where we did this whole thing called the better project where I was so frustrated

799
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,860
with how FedEx's website worked that I just redesigned it for myself. I mean, I couldn't

800
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,540
use it because it wasn't FedEx's website, but I made a mock-up of it. This is how you'd want it

801
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:41,940
to be. It's how I'd want it to be. And we got a lot of publicity over doing like a better FedEx,

802
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:48,260
better bank, better car interface, better PayPal. We didn't get hired by these companies, but we,

803
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,940
it was a way for us to show what we could do if we had the chance. And so sometimes you have to

804
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:56,260
create your own clients. That's what I kind of did too. And sort of got that word out there and

805
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,300
then word sort of spread and it was just me. So I've, oh, my costs were zero. My rent, I was paying

806
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:07,140
$900 a month to live. I lived and worked in the same place, of course. My costs were zero, basically,

807
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:11,860
not zero, but $900. So I could cover that. This is one of my things. I never get ahead of myself.

808
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:17,220
I never spend more than I make. I never put myself in a bad position. I'm a believer in risk,

809
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,220
but never putting yourself at risk, which is a different. So how differentiate those for me?

810
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,780
Risk is like taking a shot that if it doesn't work, no big deal. And we do that all the time

811
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:32,980
at base camp. But what I will not do is bet the company on something. I mean, maybe I would figure

812
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,780
out that I've done that looking back if something didn't work, but I would not knowingly go into

813
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:42,580
something, go, this has to work. We're going all in on this or else, like it's over. And this is

814
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:48,340
another great example of history is littered with these hero stories of betting the company on,

815
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,900
what was Apple bet on? Apple was bet on the Mac. The re-release of the Mac in 97 was the entire,

816
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,620
I mean, that company was hemorrhaging cash when jobs came back.

817
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,740
Disaster. And they bet big. They had to bet.

818
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,660
Now, in retrospect, yeah, was that? Is there really a survivor move?

819
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,820
Well, yes. But even, I mean, but remember Annie Duke, I don't know if you ever heard the podcast

820
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,500
I did with her. I mean, Annie, I think does this great job of differentiating outcome from process

821
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:20,420
and stuff like that. But in retrospect, do we still think like if there were a thousand universes

822
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:27,540
with a thousand apples all in the same position and the company was bet, do like 800 of them work

823
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:32,500
out well? Or did we see one of just 75 of a thousand that worked out well?

824
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,460
Well, I think there could have been, of course, a bunch of different outcomes. Microsoft could

825
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,660
have bought them. Someone else could have bought them. But looking around this table right now,

826
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,740
I have an iPhone, you have an iPhone, you have an iPad. These things would not have existed in

827
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:48,980
the world had Apple not made that initial bet with the the Bondi Blue iMac. So all those things

828
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,340
led to these things, whether or not that's good or bad. You're just saying it's not in your person.

829
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,340
Like that's your type of leadership is not designed to be in that moment. Maybe the way

830
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:01,140
Jobs was the right guy for that role. Yes. Although I will also admit that I haven't been in a position

831
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:06,260
where I had to do that. And that's sort of partially intentionally and also perhaps by luck. But

832
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:13,700
Jobs came back. He had nothing to lose. Apple was dying. You could almost say like, what else were

833
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:18,660
you going to do? Why come back and do the same thing? Make another Newton. Make another Newton,

834
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,740
which didn't really pan out, although some of those ideas were very prescient. Yeah,

835
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:28,020
yeah, totally. Yeah, totally not his. Yeah, right. But anyway, like, looking back on it, of course,

836
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:31,700
it was the right move. But there's a bunch of littered, you know, history littered with

837
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:38,020
companies that try it. But for me, I just don't see the point. Like, I'm all about the odds. What

838
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:43,540
are the odds? Like with any decision I make, I don't really think probabilistically necessarily,

839
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,260
but I do think about it in a broad sense. Like, what if this goes wrong? Like David's my co-founder

840
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:51,460
and my business partner, we always talk about this. Like, what if this doesn't work? What's

841
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,020
the worst that's going to happen? And it's like, well, like we're making a new product right now.

842
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:59,780
Okay, we have base camp, we're going to do another product. What if this we spend a year building this

843
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,620
other product? What if it doesn't work out? Then we spend a year building it, we're not going to go

844
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,980
out of business because of it, we still have a very healthy business with base camp still growing,

845
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:13,220
we're fine. The worst that can happen is we spend a year. If we spent 10 years, that'd be a problem.

846
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:18,100
If we spent seven years, that'd be a problem. But we can afford to spend a year on this. I'm not

847
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:23,220
going to do something I cannot afford to do. I just don't see the point in it. Like I'm more for

848
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:28,660
self preservation, I don't need to like hit the grand slam. Like, I want to keep doing this. Like,

849
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,780
I found my dream job, which is running my own business. Why would I want to put that at risk?

850
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,780
Now, you could say, if you don't take more risks, someone's going to beat you. And I would say,

851
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,220
you're probably right. And at some point, we will lose and our company will go out of business and

852
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:45,380
the company will die. And that's what happens to every single company in the world, essentially,

853
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,740
except like there's some Japanese companies that run like 40 generations or whatever.

854
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:53,300
Companies die, and that's okay, too. This stuff doesn't have to last forever. But if we look back,

855
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:59,540
David and I have talked about this, too. Like, let's say in six years, it just peters out.

856
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:07,620
Well, that would suck. But also like, that's a 26 year run. That's not so bad. So I always tend

857
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:11,380
to look at it that way. But I also want to stay in business. So I don't want to take the risk that

858
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:15,380
could put us out of business. I want to just take risks, but not put ourselves at risk. So that's

859
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,580
kind of I don't know if that defines it well enough. But that's how I think about these things.

860
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:22,900
So before Basecamp now going back to the mid 90s, your one stop shop, your one man,

861
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:29,140
$900 apartment guy. And then how's that going? I mean, the story I'm pushing you to is this

862
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:33,940
funny submission to a contest. Yeah. So yeah, so around that time, I thought I was good. I mean,

863
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,100
I was I was good enough for clients. They were paying me and I was staying afloat. And this is

864
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:42,260
great. There was this award site and I was sort of excited about it because a lot of I wanted an

865
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:46,740
award. Like I wanted to be recognized, which is like a very human fundamental thing. Now,

866
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:50,820
since then, I've realized awards are nothing I'm interested in. But at the time I was young and

867
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:57,780
like excited to be on the scene, right? Get someone else's approval. So I submitted this website design

868
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:03,060
to this award site. I got an email back saying like, basically, you suck. You should not do this.

869
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,140
This should not be the line of work you're in. I think maybe some people would be destroyed by

870
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,700
that. But I've always felt that to be motivation like, okay, let me show you what I can do. Or

871
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:19,140
like, I didn't care. Did you see a grain of truth in the feedback? Did you think? No, I didn't

872
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,820
believe it. I thought I was good. I thought I was good at what I did. I am good at what I do. And I

873
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:26,980
thought so. But like, what I realized was that like, everyone's opinion is purely subjective,

874
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:30,100
especially when it comes to this kind of stuff. Like, this is just a guy, I don't even know this

875
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,980
guy. Why should I let this guy piss me off? But he did. Like now I look back at that and go, why

876
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:40,980
would I ever let someone else take my mind over like that and make me upset at his opinion? Who

877
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:46,660
cares about his opinion? But he was sort of seen as a rainmaker kind of type at the time.

878
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,220
So I didn't get that word. But it just motivated me. Like, I've always been motivated by that. Like,

879
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,780
someone thinks I'm not good at something or can't do something. Like, that fires me off. It doesn't

880
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:00,260
piss me off. I mean, it pisses me off, but it doesn't make me upset. So it's sort of a productive

881
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,900
channeling of, at least a quasi productive channeling. Except you could say it's revengeful,

882
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:10,900
which is not productive in that regard. But like, I wouldn't do it to shove it in his face. That's

883
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:15,540
not why I would ever do it. I would do it because like, I think I am good. It just motivated me to

884
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,700
keep working at that. So I got better and better and better. How do you hone a craft like that,

885
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:24,980
where you're on the, it's the wild west still. Yeah, practice. You just keep doing it. And then

886
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:32,420
you find your aesthetic, you find your eye, you find what you're good at, what you're not good at,

887
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:37,300
and you kind of double down. So for me, what I was good at was I actually wasn't very good at making,

888
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:44,180
I'm not a trained designer. So I couldn't make sophisticated three dimensional designy things.

889
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:50,180
Right? What I was really good at was laying out copy or writing copy, laying out text, laying out

890
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:54,740
simple graphics. So things were orderly and structured in a way where people who hit the

891
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,260
site will go, I understand what this company is selling. Because a lot of companies have a really

892
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,180
hard time explaining themselves and helping people get to the thing that they're trying to sell. They

893
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,140
just can't explain their own thing. They're too close to it. So I got really good at that.

894
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:11,140
Because that was what was within my ability. That was it. I didn't have the desire to flex

895
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,420
outside of that. I'm like, let me just get good at what I'm good at. Like, why do I need to get

896
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:18,660
good at everything? Like, let me get good at that. So I kept doing that, got really quite good at it,

897
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:23,460
eventually hired another person because I got a really big gig. Somehow I won this gig for

898
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:27,220
Getty Images, which is a big, huge company. Yeah, they make the stock photos and stuff like that.

899
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:31,540
Yeah. They're launching this new service called Getty One, which was the first aggregate,

900
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:36,260
they had a bunch of different stock photo libraries. And you had to search all the

901
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:40,740
separate stock photo libraries to find a picture of the Empire State Building or something. So

902
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:44,580
Getty One was going to be a new site where they aggregated all their results into one place.

903
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:48,980
It was just me at the time. I won the gig to design that site actually from scratch,

904
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,580
because they didn't have that site. But they had an identity and they had some other stuff.

905
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:56,020
But I beat out a bunch of big companies and someone really took a bet on me, made a bet on me.

906
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,580
So I ended up hiring my first employee, then a guy named Matt Linderman, who lives here in New

907
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:05,300
York now. And he was with me for like 12 years after that we worked together for a long time.

908
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,060
And that was my first employee. From that we grew very slowly.

909
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,740
And how did that become Basecamp? Is that the vehicle that became Basecamp?

910
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:18,340
No. Well, eventually, so that was the company was called 37 Signals at the time. And we started

911
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,820
getting busier and busier and doing more and more projects. And then we needed a better way to

912
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,140
manage the work that we were doing, because we were managing our projects using email at the time,

913
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:32,180
and phone calls and in person meetings and paper and like, stuff was slipping through the cracks.

914
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:35,220
And we couldn't figure out where things were. I didn't know where to find something. Someone else

915
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,980
put something in the wrong place. Like, you can't work that way. You can kind of work that way for

916
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:46,100
a minute. And then an hour later, it's a total mess. So we built Basecamp. Like when I built my audio

917
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:51,220
product, we built Basecamp for ourselves for our own specific needs. Didn't even realize it was

918
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,100
going to be a product. But then we used it with our clients. And they said, Hey, what is this

919
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,300
thing you're using? We have projects too. Can we use this thing to manage? We're like, No,

920
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,460
it's just this thing. And then eventually enough, people ask you like, ah, there's a product here.

921
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:05,460
We tightened it up, cleaned it up, put a price on it, put out in the market called the Basecamp

922
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,260
in February 5 2004, which happened to be the same day Facebook launched. Interestingly enough,

923
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:14,820
about a year and a half later, it was making more money for us than website design. So we stopped

924
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,140
doing website design and transitioned to do software entirely. I'm skipping over a few things

925
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,700
like when I met David, my business partner and stuff, but he was a student at Copenhagen Business

926
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,180
School. He's from Denmark. I hired him to do some projects before that. And then we ended up

927
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:31,940
building Basecamp together. So he did the back end of Basecamp. And I did the front end design,

928
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:36,820
along with another person we had at the company. That's what happened. But it wasn't a plan. I

929
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:41,780
don't plan. I don't have goals. Yeah, this is the next thing I want to ask you about is you're very

930
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:48,820
famously said you don't set goals. I'm not a goal driven person. How does that work? How doesn't it

931
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:54,180
work? I mean, it works. Well, you're talking to a guy like so by contrast, like everything in my

932
01:12:54,180 --> 01:13:01,700
life seems to be about a goal or something. And so when I was in high school, every day I would

933
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:07,540
wake up and write a new my goals because sometimes they would change a little bit. So I would like to,

934
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:14,100
I would have a goal. I don't know how this really started, but I had goals in what I perceived as

935
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:20,660
all areas of physical fitness. So I wanted to run five, five minute miles. So five miles and 25

936
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:25,700
minutes was a goal. And I wanted to, I had goals in strength. So I wanted to be able to bench press,

937
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:30,580
squat and deadlift certain amounts. I don't exactly remember what they were, but they were

938
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:34,500
very, very high, much higher than anything I could dream of doing today. You know, I had certain

939
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,620
anaerobic goals, certain goals with respect to flexibility and muscular endurance. Like, I mean,

940
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:44,180
I really had this long list of goals and I would literally write them out every day. And many days

941
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:49,700
I was just rewriting what was there the day before. I mean, no change, right? But over the course of

942
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:53,460
years, there was tweaking, you know, I was realizing, Oh, you know what? That's a, that's a

943
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,460
bit of a sandbag goal. You're, you're actually going to hit that goal within six months. Let's

944
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:01,700
stretch it out a little bit. And then there were times when, you know, for example, like I never

945
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,860
could do the five, five minute miles. I don't know what it was like I could do. So I really,

946
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:11,300
I changed that to five, six minute miles, which I could do again, not just to move the goal line,

947
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,500
but because I also realized like I was just not going to get to five, five. So you could have that

948
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:19,380
goal on there forever. But at the time I certainly didn't know how to train for that. I'm not sure I

949
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:25,300
ever could have, but the way I was training, which was in retrospect running far too long and far too

950
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,940
slow was going to plateau me there. So that was kind of a goal modification. Basically that has

951
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,700
sort of stayed with me forever. That habit, I don't think I'm as literal today. I don't actually

952
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:39,220
write them down on post-it notes anymore, but you know, then in college I wanted to be able to

953
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:44,660
spend, you know, this summer I would want to go through the entire book of integrals and know how

954
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:49,380
to derive every single interval and all these sort of things. So, so no, for me, it's like

955
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:53,780
everything in life comes down to these, these goals. And I still do have a to-do list,

956
01:14:53,780 --> 01:15:00,820
which is kind of a mini goal list of, I have a daily, weekly, and then non-time constraint,

957
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:06,820
personal and non-time constraint professional to-do list. So yeah, this is a totally foreign concept.

958
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:12,820
People should do what motivates them. What I realized was that goals don't motivate me because

959
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:18,740
goals turn into one of maybe three things. Like one is just disappointment. You don't hit it

960
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,780
and then you're disappointed. Like I'm not sure I want to do something that ends in disappointment.

961
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:28,340
Like why should I even set myself up for ending up in disappointment? Two, you end up just like

962
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:32,100
hitting it and then setting a new one. So like, so you're on a treadmill. You're on the treadmill

963
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:37,780
of like forever setting these fake numbers. I mean, you just, you guess like five minute mile,

964
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,780
like that's just a round number. It's easy to say, but like, what does it mean? Why is that better

965
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:45,940
than a five 12 mile? Yeah, what does it mean? The other one is that you end up, I think just kind

966
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:51,540
of chasing things without really thinking about it. My feeling is that I had some experiences where

967
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:56,420
I didn't realize this until later, but for a while I did want to run like certain times.

968
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,340
You know, you go out for a run and let's say you want to run a six minute mile, like

969
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,180
recreationally, you go out for a run, you want to set a six minute mile, you wear your watch,

970
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:08,500
you time it and you end up getting like a 606 or something or 608 or whatever.

971
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,460
You didn't hit your goal. You're disappointed. Now you could say, well, I'm not. Cause next time

972
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:17,220
I'll get it. But like at some point you're like, fuck, I didn't get this, this number.

973
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,260
That's like the wrong way to frame it. The better question is like, did I enjoy the run?

974
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:26,980
Did I get some fresh air? Did I move my body? Did I feel challenged to some degree? Like

975
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:31,460
if I did all of those things, what does the number have to do with anything? The number is

976
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,780
nothing. It doesn't mean a single thing, a six versus a 606. It's different if you're like an

977
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:39,780
athlete, like training for something you need to beat someone else's time. Okay. That's a different

978
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:46,260
story, but I'm not that. So why should I focus on trying to hit a fake number? Why not try to hit

979
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,100
things? Like did I have a good time at it? Did I get outside and run for 45 minutes and get my

980
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,620
heart going? Did I enjoy myself? Did I get a break? Did I get to think about some things?

981
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:57,460
Like those are the things that are more interesting to me. So there's that side of it. The other side

982
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:03,380
of it is I just want to do the best work I can anyway. So because I want to run a five minute

983
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:07,460
or six minute or seven minute, like I'm just going to run the best I can anyway. I don't need

984
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:12,820
the number to tell me what that is. This is maybe tying back to the whole thing. One of the reasons

985
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:20,020
why I quit that job is if I'm not motivated by the work itself, it doesn't matter. I have

986
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:24,100
to enjoy the work. And for me, the pleasure is the thing itself. Just doing the best I can

987
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,540
on a given day and just like seeing where it comes out, like cares. That's not necessarily

988
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,860
incongruent with having a goal, right? So let's use your health as an example, because that's

989
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:40,900
something we obviously talk about, right? Which is again, putting semantics aside, if we're going to

990
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:45,380
take the word goal off the table, you have objectives, correct? I mean, I want to go in

991
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:49,940
a certain direction. Well, also I think, wouldn't it be even more than that? I mean, don't you

992
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:57,620
have a model for or in your mind's eye, a sense of what the 85 year old Jason should be able to do?

993
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:02,660
What does success look like when you're 85? This is kind of this back casting idea from Annie Duke,

994
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:07,220
right? Don't think about how many miles you have to run tomorrow or how much weight you need to lift

995
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:12,420
next month or next week, but think about what the wind state looks like at 85. Not that that's the

996
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,780
end of your life, but let's just use that as a point in time. And you have to have an objective

997
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,700
of that to sort of at least get in the direction of getting there, don't you? I think about it in

998
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:27,860
terms of at base camp, we don't have company goals, but we have a vision. We have a direction we're

999
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,380
going. We have things we want to do because we think they're the right thing to do and the right

1000
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:37,140
way to do them. So for me, like living, trying to live to be 85 and be able to gobble, squat 30

1001
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,700
pounds, wherever these things are, to me, that's more of the vision side of things. I want to get

1002
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:46,180
there because it'd be nice to be alive that long and to be healthy that long. Why would I want to

1003
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:51,780
not be that way? I just don't see it as a goal. I don't see it as like a distinct thing that I

1004
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:57,540
either... Here's maybe what I think. If you don't hit a goal, most people are disappointed.

1005
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:04,420
Like when I'm 85, if I can't do that, I don't want to be disappointed when I'm 85 years old.

1006
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:10,020
I want to like, I tried or I did whatever, but like I don't want to have this point where I have

1007
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:16,100
to go, did I make it or did I not? Am I disappointed or am I happy? That's the thing. Maybe it's so

1008
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,940
subtle, but I think it's an important distinction. Like when I would just go out for a run, I don't

1009
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:26,580
have to measure up against something and decide whether or not I worked hard enough, ran fast

1010
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:31,460
enough, whatever. I can just go, did I enjoy it? That was a good for me. Did I like it? So you could

1011
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:36,020
say like the goal is like health. Yeah, there's that, but it's very broad. It's not a number.

1012
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,380
Maybe it's the number goals I don't like. Maybe it's like the milestone goals I don't like,

1013
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:43,860
but like directionally, I do have definitely, I want to go in specific directions.

1014
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,500
It might just be also, again, I think the process part of it. If you want to be able to goblet squat

1015
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:53,540
30 pounds correctly when you're 85, you'll have to do a lot of work between now and then

1016
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:58,420
to maintain it because you can do that today quite easily, but gravity is going to really work

1017
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:03,540
against you over the next 40 years. And if when you get there, you can goblet squat 25 pounds

1018
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:08,020
instead of 30, I don't think anybody would say that that's a failure. And more importantly, I

1019
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:13,540
guess it's that objective, which for me, we use this example because it's one of the things on my

1020
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:19,060
centenarian Olympic list of 20 different events to be able to do, but what's it in service of,

1021
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:22,580
I guess is the question. Maybe that's where we are probably saying the same thing in a different way.

1022
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:27,860
I mean, to me, it's not about a goblet squat. It's that 30 pounds represents the weight of a toddler

1023
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:33,060
and a goblet squat, which is to say a squat position where you have to be in scapular

1024
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:36,900
protraction and be able to pick something up in front of you. That's what it's like to pick a

1025
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,140
toddler up. And I want to be able to pick up a toddler when I'm 85. I would agree with that,

1026
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:45,780
but to me, that's like a direction versus a- I see. So let's bring it back to the company,

1027
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:50,020
because this is still a very unusual concept within the company, which is really a big part

1028
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:54,660
of what I wanted to talk about today. There's no shortage of stories, horror stories really,

1029
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:59,780
of companies that have just gone so far ethically off the rails because of creating perverse

1030
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:06,500
incentives. So this great story on the podcast with Catherine Eban about the generic drug companies

1031
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:12,260
Rambaxes. Only goal is profitability. Like literally nothing else matters. And unfortunately,

1032
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:20,820
that goal superimposed in a cultural environment that produces sort of different sets of ethics

1033
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:26,660
that are deemed almost acceptable leads to devastating consequences where, I mean, they'd

1034
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:30,980
sell you cyanide if it was profitable. If they could make enough money on it, they'd spike your

1035
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:37,060
medication with that. So you have to motivate people. Should we even start that that's not

1036
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:41,460
necessarily an assumption? Like you have 54 employees, do they need motivation? And if so,

1037
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:46,900
do you feel you need to provide some of it? Everybody's very different. I think we have

1038
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:51,060
to set a vision, a direction of where we're going. That's people want to be on board with that.

1039
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:55,380
If the train's going this direction, you want to be on that line or not. Like there's that,

1040
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,300
but I think a lot of it is more day-to-day in the actual work itself and that people have the

1041
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:04,580
autonomy and the control over their own work and their own work environment and their own schedule

1042
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:10,500
and their own time. That to me is the more important side of it versus dragging someone

1043
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,460
along with a carrot, which is like this bonus or that thing or whatever. Or at some point,

1044
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:19,540
this company's worth 17 billion and you've got this much stock equity and options and you can

1045
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:24,500
convert this. Like, yeah, some people are going to be motivated by that, but I don't think that's

1046
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,900
healthier in long-term motivation. So for me, it's more about the day-to-day autonomy of the work

1047
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:34,180
the time they have to themselves every day and the environment that we can create for people.

1048
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:37,780
I think that's the thing that's often most overlooked is that people always talk about,

1049
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,260
we want to hire the best in the world. We want to hire, you know, it's like,

1050
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,860
you can hire the best in the world, but the environment is crap. Like you're not going to

1051
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:47,940
get the best work out of those people and they're going to leave at some point. I'm more interested

1052
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:53,860
in creating a great environment than I am motivating people around specific business goals.

1053
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,180
It's just, I don't think a lot of people care about specific business goals. That's not,

1054
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:02,340
they're a writer, they're a designer, they're a programmer. They care about the work that

1055
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:06,820
they're doing and how it all relates of course, but like whether or not we hit some number,

1056
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,500
I don't think most people care unless your compensation is tied to it, but I think that's

1057
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,340
a whole other problem. I don't think that's a good thing to do either. Let's talk about hiring.

1058
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:19,620
Let's start with hiring. You have some hiring practices that are not always in the norm. How

1059
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:25,140
do you guys hire? We spend like weeks writing job ads, first of all. A lot of companies like, oh,

1060
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,820
HR department just throw something up there with a bunch of bullet points. You need five to 12,

1061
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:34,180
you just experience this and whatever. We actually try to write in a way that truly conveys what it's

1062
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:39,140
like to work in this position and what your day-to-day would actually feel like. We put a lot of time

1063
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:43,780
into it because we feel like if we want to get the best people we can, we're going to track the best

1064
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:48,820
people with that kind of job description. We're very clear about that. We also put salaries in the

1065
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:53,540
job descriptions and job ranges because there's no reason not to. Why is that typically not the norm?

1066
01:23:54,260 --> 01:24:01,380
I think the big reason is because companies feel like it's their job to negotiate the best rate

1067
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:06,500
they can from a person. They're trying to get the most out of somebody. I don't feel like that's

1068
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,060
something I'm interested in in terms of like, I don't want to... If I could have paid this person

1069
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:15,540
$160,000, they would have taken $140,000 or something like that, but I got them for $130,000.

1070
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:21,380
Or I got them lower than they would have gone or whatever. Or we're willing to pay $180,000,

1071
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:27,140
but they accept a $165,000. A lot of companies see that as a victory. To me, if there's any place

1072
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:31,860
to spend money, it's on people. I'm not interested in having leverage over anybody or forcing anyone

1073
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:37,220
to be an ace negotiator to get what they deserve. We publish our salaries because that's the actual

1074
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:42,740
number we're going to pay. It's not like, come to us and let's negotiate. It's like, this is

1075
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,620
actually what we pay. A lot of companies just won't do that because they want to try to take

1076
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:50,180
advantage of people or they don't know what they're going to pay. There's a variety of reasons for it.

1077
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,220
Some people think there's some ethical issues around publishing salaries because then other

1078
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:58,020
people would know what people make. I can appreciate that, but we've just decided that

1079
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:02,820
we want to remove negotiation completely from the picture. Do you ever get down the path where

1080
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:09,060
you post this thing, this is a job that's going to pay $97,500. You get a bunch of people,

1081
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:14,660
you put them through, you finally get your dream candidate. They're awesome. Then they say, look,

1082
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:19,300
I know you guys posted this at $97,500, but I'm not working for that. I'm not working for less

1083
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:24,260
than $115. How many times do you find yourself in that situation? We don't. That's a nonstarter

1084
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:28,260
because it's published. That's the number and that's what we're going to pay. This is something

1085
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:34,900
we did a few years ago. We decided this is a very unusual angle that we take here, but we pay

1086
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:42,020
everybody in the company top 10% of the industry rates based on San Francisco rates. We don't have

1087
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:45,300
anyone who lives in San Francisco, but in our industry, San Francisco has the highest salaries.

1088
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:49,780
We use these benchmarking tools to figure out what the industry pays. We're just saying we're going

1089
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,220
to pay people basically the best. There's of course always companies that are higher. If you're in the

1090
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:57,860
top 10%, there's some that are in the top 5%. We're going to pay people the best we possibly can.

1091
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:02,100
We're going to eliminate negotiation from the equation. It's unfair to employees.

1092
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,780
You're sort of like Carmax.

1093
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:08,740
Yes, we're like Carmax. Here's the thing. Why should you have to not only be great at your job,

1094
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:13,140
but also be an ace negotiator? Most people are not good negotiators. They don't like negotiating

1095
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:17,940
for cars, for houses, or for anything. Why should your livelihood depend on how good of a

1096
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:24,100
negotiator you are? That's not fair to somebody. They should get paid, in our opinion, the best we

1097
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:29,140
can possibly afford, which is basically top of the market. We've basically said that that's the

1098
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:34,020
deal. We have different tiers based on the different roles, but everybody with the same

1099
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:38,260
set of skills and experience get paid the same amount of money and that number is published.

1100
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:42,180
It's not necessarily clear how much each person individually makes, but it's basically you could

1101
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:45,140
figure it out if you wanted to. That's part of the hiring process, too, which is like it's no

1102
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:49,540
bullshit. This is the number. This is what it's going to be, and there's no negotiation from the

1103
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:54,340
start. If you feel like you want the 120 or you're an extraordinary person and you want double,

1104
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:58,660
because some people have said that, like, I'm worth more than this, that's cool. Go find another job.

1105
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:02,340
There's a lot of jobs out there. If you want to work at Basecamp, we're going to pay you incredibly

1106
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:06,900
well. We're going to give you the best benefits we believe in the world overall. This is the number.

1107
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:11,620
Can we eliminate the rest of it? Why do we need to play games around salaries?

1108
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:16,260
The other thing about hiring for us is that we look primarily first at their writing ability.

1109
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:22,260
No matter what the job is, you have to be a great writer. If you cannot write well, if you submit a

1110
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:28,020
cover letter and it's bad, you're out. I don't care if you're the best scientist in the world, you're

1111
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,620
out, because you have to be able to communicate with us and the rest of the company. It's primarily

1112
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:37,380
written, and you have to be able to express yourself that way. That's a core thing for us as well,

1113
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,380
like the first filter that we have. Now, you talked about this before, that when you were

1114
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:47,380
website slinging, your strength was more on the copy side. You've written how many books? Four

1115
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:51,780
books? Yeah, four. Five, maybe, depending how you count. You obviously like to write. Were you

1116
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:55,380
always a good writer? No. It came down to motivation. Again, I remember I was a terrible

1117
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:59,220
writer in high school, because I had to write papers I didn't care about, about subjects I

1118
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:06,180
didn't care about. Write about this. Okay, but I don't care. It's only when I got to college

1119
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:10,180
and I was able to write about things that I really cared about, I thought were interesting,

1120
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:15,940
that I started to develop a love for it. I love sentences. I love just a well-crafted sentence

1121
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:20,100
that just nails it. Just few things are satisfying to me, is reading a great line.

1122
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,740
Only when I began to be able to write for those reasons that I begin to love writing.

1123
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:28,340
And I think it's just like, it's so true with a lot of kids in schools. You don't get it until

1124
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,700
something applies to you and then you really get it. Or you find a teacher, a professor who knows

1125
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:37,060
how to put something in a perspective that makes a lot of sense to you, then you begin to excel.

1126
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:41,540
So that's kind of how that works. I mean, whenever Tim talks about his professor at Princeton,

1127
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:45,060
can't put my blank on his name right now. Do you know what I'm talking about? I've heard him speak

1128
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:49,620
about this, but I have one of his books actually. Whenever I hear Tim talk about it, I just get

1129
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:56,180
insanely jealous that I was not smart enough to have found a similar experience in college.

1130
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:59,540
Because even though I wouldn't have had, it's John something of his name, but even though I

1131
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:05,700
couldn't have had a professor that good necessarily, how did I not put more effort into writing?

1132
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,140
You're a good writer now though.

1133
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,860
I mean, I think I'm okay, but I wish I was a hell of a lot better.

1134
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,220
I agree with you. It's just one of these things that-

1135
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:17,300
You got to find topic. I mean, now you do. So you get to write things that you're interested in. But

1136
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,900
there's something else I think that's interesting about learning how to write in school, which is

1137
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,660
that I don't, especially in business school, I mean, I didn't go to an MBA program, but like my

1138
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:30,820
business classes, they don't really teach you how to write. They teach you how to put words on paper.

1139
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:35,060
And it's usually like length based. It's not even about like substance in a sense. It's like write

1140
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:39,940
a five page paper on whatever. It's like, why five pages? Like why is that a class that I'd love to

1141
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:43,780
teach if I ever taught writing, or I'd love to see, I don't care. Someone can take this idea and run

1142
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:48,260
with it. It's not something I need to do for every assignment. Let's say there's a writing assignment.

1143
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:51,700
I don't even care. You pick whatever type, if I was writing, teaching, writing, pick whatever topic

1144
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:57,220
you want. I want a five page version of this. I want a two page version of this on a one page

1145
01:29:57,220 --> 01:30:01,300
version, I want a three paragraph version, a one paragraph version, a one sentence version,

1146
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:06,900
and a one word version. They don't teach editing. That's the really valuable part. So I'd love to

1147
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,980
see you write a long thing and then keep writing a shorter, shorter, shorter and try to distill it

1148
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:16,420
down to assessments. Of course, one word is that's more of a fun exercise. But write these things at

1149
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:21,300
different lengths. That to me is the skill. It's not like, can I fill up five pages? Of course you

1150
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:25,860
can, but can I fill up three paragraphs and get pretty close to what I had on five pages? That's

1151
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:30,580
the real skill and that's not being taught. As I was thinking about talking today, I was like,

1152
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:36,100
I wonder if I can coax Jason into reading my book before it comes out. Oh, I'd love to.

1153
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:45,540
It is so long. My poor editor and the publisher are like, they're humoring me, but I think deep

1154
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:52,340
down they're losing their mind. How many words? The contract said 80,000. With the appendix,

1155
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:59,460
it comes in under 200. That would be a miracle. Obviously it won't be published at 200,000 words.

1156
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:04,420
It'll be better if it's half as long. You know that too. It just will be. I know you have a

1157
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:09,140
lot to say, but. You know what it is? The desperation is I don't ever want to write a book again.

1158
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:13,940
Part of it is I have 10 books inside me. I don't want to write them. I want to write one and never

1159
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,780
do it again. It's like there's this sense of I can't not talk about this and I can't not talk

1160
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:22,420
about that, which of course is sort of a dumb idea. Can you do a double album style thing? Two books?

1161
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:26,420
Yeah, it's Use Your Illusion One and Use Your Illusion Two, which is the greatest, in my

1162
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:31,620
opinion at least, the greatest double album ever simultaneously. Our contracts said 40,000 words

1163
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:36,980
and we handed it in 20,000. Initially we had to argue with a publisher about it because he's like,

1164
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:41,540
well, the thick books sell better and the whole thing. It's like, I know, but we just read. Can

1165
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:47,140
you read it please? Can you read? It's so funny. These industries, what about the book itself?

1166
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:51,940
What is the thickness and the word count? What about the material? Eventually we ended up

1167
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:56,900
padding it with pictures. Every essay had a picture, not this current, our latest book,

1168
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:00,980
but our previous book, Rework, had a picture with each essay to thicken it up. That was the

1169
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:06,020
compromise. Content was great, but it wasn't thick enough to sell apparently, which is so ridiculous.

1170
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:12,500
Anyway, so you mentioned that in 2007 you're given some talk at Y Combinator and you're up there

1171
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:19,860
in all your confidence basically saying, hey, there's nothing about luck here. I made my destiny,

1172
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:24,980
here we are. Well, we're 12 years later and you don't have a bone in your body that reeks of that.

1173
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:33,540
So what happened in the last 12 years that changed your outlook on the role of luck and presumably

1174
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:36,580
a lot of the other things that you've written about that I want to talk about with respect to

1175
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:42,580
work-life balance? It was probably a slow shift. I typically think most things are event-based,

1176
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:46,180
like something must have happened, but I don't recall something that happened. I think it's just

1177
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:53,300
a mellowing of age and growing older and sort of seeing things and being more honest with myself

1178
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:57,140
and self-reflection. I don't think I reflected much when I was younger. I thought I was just like,

1179
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:02,180
because you don't have as much to reflect on. I think just sort of recognizing that like

1180
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:09,540
at some point that I probably couldn't do this again if I tried and wondering why would that be?

1181
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:13,940
I thought I was really, really, really good and I kind of probably realized that maybe I was really,

1182
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:19,780
really, really good at that time, at that thing, in that place and I've been able to continue to

1183
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:24,820
be good at that thing. But starting another business, for example, I don't think I would

1184
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:29,780
do well with that at all. Part of this also might come from the fact that I've written about this,

1185
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:34,660
which is like they ask the wrong people for advice. Maybe this was sort of the genesis of this.

1186
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,940
People ask me all the time how to start a business. I don't know. I haven't done it for

1187
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:45,220
20 years. I'm the wrong person to talk to about how to start a business. Advice has a shelf life

1188
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:50,100
and it expires pretty quickly. You're much better off talking to somebody who just started a business

1189
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:54,660
six months ago than me. Even if they're struggling, I don't care. That's the right person to talk to.

1190
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:59,300
They know the ground game there. They know what's going on. I don't know. I don't remember. Things

1191
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:04,340
have changed. I think I kind of began to realize that reflecting on that. You kind of realize like,

1192
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:08,500
well, a lot of this has to do with when we started it, what was going on at the time.

1193
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:12,900
Hopefully, you just continue to reflect on that and you develop some more humility. I think you

1194
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:16,420
have to grow into that though. At least I did. Certainly had to grow into that and I still have

1195
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:23,780
more to grow. When did this ethos around, wait a minute, what if you don't have to work 80 hours

1196
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:28,420
a week? What if you don't have to be checking email all the time? What if we don't have to have

1197
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:32,980
meetings all day, every day? How did that begin to take hold for you?

1198
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:38,500
I remember this was a distinct moment. I used to write proposals to get work back when I was in

1199
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:44,980
like 98, 99, whatever. I was mostly on my own, actually 97 probably. I would spend all night,

1200
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:49,220
I would stay up all night and do these proposals for client work to get a project,

1201
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:54,180
20 page proposals and whatever. I would just do this and do this and do this and do this.

1202
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:59,540
I realized I won some jobs and I didn't win others, but I put a lot of work into that

1203
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:04,900
process because I felt like that's what I had to do. Then I was redoing my kitchen at my apartment

1204
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:10,900
and someone sent me their proposal. What did I do? I turned to the last page and looked at how long

1205
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:15,060
is it going to take and how much is it going to cost? I realized that's all people really care

1206
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,140
about when it comes to proposals because if they've asked you for one, they already know what you can

1207
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:22,420
do. They already know what you're doing. They just want to know how much is it going to cost and how

1208
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:26,980
long is it going to take. That's what they're really comparing. That's it. I started going,

1209
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:30,580
okay, wait a second, maybe I should just write shorter and shorter and shorter proposals.

1210
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:37,060
Why do I need to put all this work into this document? I was doing 10 page and five page

1211
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,900
and three page, kind of like the writing assignments. I eventually got down to basically

1212
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:44,420
one or two pages and it was like, here's the thing and here's the cost and here's all I'm going to

1213
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:49,700
take. If you want to know more about me, call me or here's my link to my website, whatever.

1214
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:54,180
I didn't win any more jobs or lose any fewer jobs. It was the same.

1215
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,740
Except you got to sleep more.

1216
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:00,340
I got to sleep more and I realized, wait a second, all this work I've been doing,

1217
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:05,620
I don't need to do. That was the first moment I realized I can kind of poke this expectation of,

1218
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:09,700
God, you have to, because all the proposals I'd seen up to that point were huge and they're fancy

1219
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:14,580
and they're glossy and all this work and everything's personalized. It's like when I was on the other

1220
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:17,700
side of that, I just looked at the time and the price. That was the moment when I realized,

1221
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:21,300
I don't have to do all this work. Then that kind of extended into a whole bunch of other things,

1222
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:24,740
like why do we need to work 12 hours a day? What am I doing? Why do we need to push this

1223
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:30,100
hard on these things? Maybe I can just do a little bit less and figure out what the essence

1224
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:36,420
really is. What is the price and time of all this other work that I'm doing? Then when you finally

1225
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:41,700
kind of get into that mode, you realize most of the time you spend on things is probably wasted

1226
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,780
time. This is a huge exaggeration, of course, but there's a lot of time you put into things that

1227
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:50,900
you don't need to put into things. I've gotten really good at editing that down. I can put a

1228
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:54,340
little bit of time into something because I just know what the essence of the thing is and just do

1229
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:59,300
a really good job on that and leave the rest alone. We've tried to develop that habit and that skill

1230
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:04,340
internally at Basecamp with all our employees. We really get to the essence of something we call the

1231
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:08,100
epicenter of whatever it is that we're doing. What are we doing? You could think of like if I was to

1232
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:14,980
open a hot dog stand on the street, it'd still be a hot dog stand if I didn't have ketchup and

1233
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:21,620
mustard and onions and pickles and relish, even the bun. I could just sell the hot dog. If it was

1234
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:26,260
a hot dog, it would be the hot dog stand still. If I didn't have the hot dog, it wouldn't be a hot dog

1235
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:30,580
stand. All those other things wouldn't matter then. The epicenter is the hot dog itself, not

1236
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:34,020
the quality of it necessarily. I don't care about that, but all these other things, they're nice to

1237
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:38,900
have, but you don't really need them to still say that you sell hot dogs on the street. That's how

1238
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:43,460
we kind of think about features and functionality. What is the core essence of this thing that we're

1239
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:48,020
trying to do? There are always going to be more powerful versions. But there's so much judgment

1240
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:53,860
involved in that. I've tried to play this game with myself and I'm so bad at it. I would talk

1241
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:57,860
myself into saying, well, really you can't just have the wiener because then it's like the wiener

1242
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:02,580
stand. You have to have the bun. I can't be just handing people buns. I at least have to have the

1243
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:06,740
napkin. Honestly, there's going to be somebody that wants a paper plate. I ought to have that.

1244
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:10,340
How could you not have ketchup and mustard? Who's not going to want a drink? By the way, there's

1245
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:14,020
ancillary revenue in the drink. I probably have a bigger margin on the drink. I should have the

1246
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:20,820
drink. You can see how I would spiral that into something that is the antithesis of what you've

1247
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:26,180
just described. I don't think I'm alone in that. I'm not either. I think about that too, but then

1248
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:33,140
I edit down. It's all about editing. Is this something that only works now? Let me just

1249
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,780
actually throw this thing at you too because what you could also say is, you know what? I'm going

1250
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:41,860
to be the hot dog guy that just serves hot dogs on a stick or I'm going to be the hot dog guy that

1251
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:47,140
just has a hot dog with a fork in it or something. I'm going to be the hot dog guy that whatever.

1252
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:52,180
I don't know. You could be the other hot dog guy. That's an angle too. It's not just like,

1253
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:56,340
I need to be like everybody else. I think this is the problem, especially in the software world.

1254
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,940
As you see, well, this competitor has these five features and this one has these seven,

1255
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,860
so I need to have these 12. I need to cover everything because if I don't cover everything,

1256
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:08,180
they're going to go here. They're going to go there. I think the more interesting thing is to

1257
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:14,420
see what do you really need to have and what can you live without and execute at a really high

1258
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:18,980
level on the things you absolutely need to have and then let other people deal with the things

1259
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:22,500
people can live without. Recognizing that the market's large and there's lots of people who

1260
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,700
will not like what you do and there's some people who will love what you do and some people hate

1261
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:30,020
what you do and it'll be controversial, but I think there's a lot of value in that. Further,

1262
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:35,380
it allows you to work less. I take pride in that. I think there's a lot of macho

1263
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:41,780
boasting in our industry of people who work long hours and get no sleep. It's every industry.

1264
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:46,020
Yeah, now it's turning into every industry, especially finance and a bunch of these industries.

1265
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:50,180
I think it's actually been a bit of an export though from tech. Tech gets a lot of publicity

1266
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:54,580
for this. Which may have exported it from medicine. Well, yeah, medicine. I don't even know how

1267
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:59,780
that's legal to work like 24 hour shifts and the whole thing and whatever, but people brag about

1268
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:05,540
how little sleep they get and how much they work. I don't understand that. If you pay attention to

1269
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:09,940
what they're doing, if you really ask them about why they're working so long, and this is I think

1270
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:15,300
the deeper insight, it's not that there's more work to do. It's that there's less time to do good

1271
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,460
work because people's days are broken into smaller and smaller and smaller chunks of time.

1272
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:25,380
I think you need contiguous amounts, blocks of time to do great creative work. You can't do it

1273
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:28,900
15 minutes at a time, then check your phone, then get 20 minutes and there's a conference call,

1274
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,700
then you're pulled into a meeting. Before you know it's the end of the day, you've got nothing

1275
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:35,700
done even though you've been busy all day. If that's what's going on at work, then it's crazy

1276
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:39,780
at work. Our whole point of view is that it should be calm at work. Like the title of our book,

1277
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:44,820
it doesn't have to be crazy at work. It doesn't have to be crazy at work. You have to give people

1278
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:49,940
a full block of eight hours a day to themselves and you cannot allow people to look at each

1279
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:54,340
other's calendars and take time from each other. If you get to that place, which is where we're at,

1280
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,980
you can get a lot of work done in eight hours. I mean, a ton of work. Eight hours is a long time.

1281
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:03,460
Fly from here to, I just flew to Amsterdam with my family, it's about an eight hour flight. It's a

1282
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:06,820
long flight. It's long. You look at your watch, like, oh my God, it's only half done. You look at

1283
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:11,300
your watch again, you're like, gotta be done. It's only six and a half hours in. Eight hours is a long

1284
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:16,660
time if you have eight hours. Most people don't have eight hours at work. They have 45 minutes

1285
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:20,820
to themselves and therefore they're working late nights and working on the weekends because there's

1286
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:25,140
no other time to get the work done that they're expected to do. Work is, is, shoot it all up.

1287
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:31,380
What you're saying makes sense, but the part I still struggle with is, but how do these teams

1288
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:36,660
coordinate with those teams and how do these guys, you know, present their work to their manager or,

1289
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:41,060
you know, whatever it else that someone might be having to do? A few things. Number one, we try to

1290
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:46,260
work independently versus being dependent. So I think there's a lot of companies that work,

1291
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,620
they're, they're grinding gears. Like this gear has to push this gear and there's a lot of

1292
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:52,980
dependencies and so people are waiting around and there's so many things that can go wrong if

1293
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:58,660
one person's late, the whole thing. We try to glide past each other. We're more like glide wheels than

1294
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:03,460
gears with teeth. Almost no one should ever have to depend on another team to get anything done

1295
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:09,060
at base camp. Every team is autonomous and so under their own control, sometimes they might need

1296
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:13,460
something from operations to make sure a new server is online or something like that. But for

1297
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:19,140
the most part, every feature and everything is built and can be deployed independently of one

1298
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:24,180
another. So there's no dependencies. How is that possible in a software business? I'm glad you're

1299
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:27,700
asking this because this is really interesting stuff. I think at the end of the day, the size of

1300
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:34,660
the project matters. So we only work on things that take six weeks or less to do. So every feature

1301
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:38,900
we build into base camp, there has to be a six week maximum version of that. And many features are

1302
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:44,020
only two weeks or three weeks. Can you give an example because I can't fathom what this could be?

1303
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:48,580
Let's see, like let's take a calendar feature in base camp. So for a number of years, base camp

1304
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:54,020
didn't have a calendar. A lot of people wanted calendars. So you start thinking about like, what

1305
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:58,980
does that mean? What is a calendar? A calendar is like complicated. We've built calendars before

1306
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:02,820
and they've taken this is before we started working in six week cycles. Years ago, we built

1307
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:08,260
calendars and they can take six months, eight months to do well. But what do people really want?

1308
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:14,020
A calendar is just a manifestation of something. What do they really want? And you're talking to

1309
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:17,780
people and start digging into requests and you start to understand what they really want is

1310
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:22,660
they want to see days that have something on them and they want to see what those things are

1311
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:28,100
on that given day. That is a lot easier to build than like a full blown calendar where you can drag

1312
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:33,620
things across cells and have events that span different cell blocks and have to have to span

1313
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:36,740
like another line. There's a whole bunch of complexity that gets involved with building a

1314
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:41,780
full blown. Like if you try to build a Google calendar in six weeks, you cannot do it. But

1315
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:47,140
there's a version of Google calendar you can build in six weeks that solves 80 to 90% of the issues.

1316
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:51,860
So you have to kind of file it down to that. You really file it down to that and go, we're going to

1317
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:56,820
build that. And then if we want to build something else, that's a separate project. What we don't do

1318
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:01,220
is we don't hold that back, that calendar feature. We don't hold it back until we have seven or eight

1319
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:05,940
or 10 other six week projects and then launch it all together. We launch these things as we go.

1320
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:10,660
And therefore they're small enough that they don't depend on other things. And there's nothing held

1321
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:14,900
up that ends up becoming stale because other people have committed new work. So. And how many people

1322
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:18,820
would have spent the six weeks working on that calendar? Three max. So this is the other thing.

1323
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:23,060
On any given feature, we have three people maximum working on that feature. Typically two

1324
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:28,100
programmers and one designer, sometimes just one program, one designer. And that's intentional too.

1325
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:33,300
The number three is really important to us. It's a small team. It's a wedge. It's odd. So there's

1326
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:39,780
never any ties. It can be self managed. Once you add a fourth person, like something happens where

1327
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:45,620
you can now have sides and someone has to come in and mediate. And it just becomes more complicated.

1328
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:49,460
It's all hard to get four people on the same schedule. Everything gets harder the more people

1329
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,940
you add. So three people maximum to any one feature. They have six weeks maximum to complete

1330
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:58,340
it and oftentimes it's less than that. And then we move on. But all these things slot in

1331
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:04,180
independently. But that trio reports not to you. They must report to a manager who reports to

1332
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:08,740
somebody who reports to you. Kind of, but not really. We're very flat. So organizationally,

1333
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:14,820
so there's me and David. So David's the CTO. I'm the CEO. We have someone who runs what we call

1334
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:20,340
core product, which is like all the designers and developers for like the desktop version of Basecamp.

1335
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,180
We have an iOS team, which is three people. We have an Android team, which is three people.

1336
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:27,380
We have a customer service team. We have a technical operations team. And then we have

1337
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:34,020
a few other people who are working independently. These teams, like for example, the product

1338
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:38,500
feature team with three people, we have like maybe four of those teams running at the same time.

1339
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:43,540
They sort of self report. So in Basecamp, the product, there's a way every at the end of every

1340
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,620
day, Basecamp asks everybody automatically, what'd you work on today? People write up what they

1341
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:51,860
worked on today. They also write up what they what they plan on working on this week. And then

1342
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:55,940
every six weeks, the team lead writes kind of a summary of what's happened over this past six

1343
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:00,180
weeks. So these these things are self reporting, and we're all paying attention to the work itself

1344
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:04,820
as it's going. So there's no moments when there's a big presentations. There's no presentations.

1345
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:08,740
It's like work is happening. We're paying attention to the work itself. Everyone's writing

1346
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:13,140
up what they're working on every single day. And people just know what's going on. You just know

1347
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:18,260
what's going on this way. When people go off for months at a time, and do these big huge massive

1348
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:22,020
projects, then they have to report back. That's a whole different structure, which we don't have. I

1349
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:25,700
don't think that's the right structure. Does that make any sense? I feel like sometimes it's hard to

1350
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,540
explain these things. Well, it does. But it begs this question, right? Which is how much of this

1351
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:38,820
is a product of the type of work you do specifically, and how applicable is it to,

1352
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,380
I don't want to use my work as an example, because I want to go so deep on that that we don't even

1353
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:48,500
have time. We'll save that for a dinner. I'd love to figure out how to change my life to have eight

1354
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:56,020
hours a day to think. But it seems hard to imagine most jobs being amenable to that.

1355
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:57,460
I just don't think it is.

1356
01:46:57,460 --> 01:47:01,220
Do you get a lot of people asking you this? That's Jason, I read your book. I love your book. I mean,

1357
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:05,860
oh my God, it sounds like a Nirvana. Yeah. How do I do it? Yeah. Well, yes. And we just wrote

1358
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:09,860
another book actually called Shape Up, which is a web based book. So if you go to basecamp.com

1359
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:15,300
slash shape up, it's a very, very detailed, like this book here, it doesn't have to be crazy work

1360
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:20,740
is more the big picture. It's the framework. Shape up is actually how we work day to day to build

1361
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:28,580
software. But whatever you're building, it has elements to it. And if you can scope these things

1362
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:32,500
down into smaller elements, I think you can work this way. There's certainly some things that are

1363
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:35,620
going to like, I'm not saying like you can build an airplane, like people always go, what about an

1364
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:38,580
airplane? It's like, well, you're not building an airplane. Everyone thinks they're building them

1365
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:42,260
like most critical thing in the world. They're not like, no one is. There's just some people

1366
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:45,620
building airplanes. Or I was like, what about air traffic control systems? It's like, you're not

1367
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:49,300
building your traffic control system. A lot of people are saying, well, you're not building an

1368
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:53,300
air traffic control system. A lot of people I think think that their work is so mission critical.

1369
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:57,300
It's not like you can work this way. You can slow things down a little bit. You can break things

1370
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:04,020
into smaller bits. And you can apply a few people and apply pressure to a problem with just a few

1371
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:07,940
people over a short period of time and solve that and then and then layer that in and keep doing

1372
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:12,500
that over a year, you end up getting somewhere if you have multiple teams, like on any given six

1373
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,180
week cycle, we're doing four or five or six or eight different features, just different teams

1374
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:19,220
are doing them. And they all come together in the end because they don't they don't mesh, they

1375
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:24,260
don't have to rely on each other. That's why you can do this. The big problem is when you've got six

1376
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:27,460
or four or whatever different teams working on their own things that all the puzzle pieces have

1377
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:32,260
to come together at the end and work together. In some product worlds, that's true. But we've

1378
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:36,740
made the conscious choice that's not in our world. And I think the key here is that it is a choice.

1379
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:43,060
What's the price you pay for that? Because every choice comes with a cost. And is the cost that you

1380
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:50,260
are less profitable over a given time horizon or less innovative or I mean, making these things up,

1381
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,700
because I don't know what the answer is. Everything has a trade off. So I look at more

1382
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:57,300
as a trade off than a cost specifically, but whatever. Yeah, fair enough. Good point. Yeah,

1383
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:02,420
it's a trade off, which is like, maybe some of our stuff is not as high fidelity, perhaps as like it

1384
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:06,260
could be like maybe if there's a transition, like you click a button and it'd be nice to have a

1385
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:10,740
smooth transition between these two screens, maybe instead the screens just flash like we just decided

1386
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:16,580
that that trade off is worth it to get the feature out. Or maybe we have to cut some features like

1387
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:20,580
in our book, we cut our book from 40,000 and 20,000 words, certainly there were some words in there

1388
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:24,900
that we cut that we probably shouldn't have. But that's okay to make this book readable in three

1389
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:30,020
hours because overall, the advantage is there. So there's absolutely trade offs and we're very

1390
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:33,860
conscious of them and we make them all day long. And we actually talk about the trade offs like

1391
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:37,940
this is something we have a we have a term internally called trading concessions.

1392
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,540
I run the basically run the design team, David runs a technical team,

1393
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:45,540
I'll bring an idea to Dave and I'll say, here's how I'd like to do this. And he'll go,

1394
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:51,780
we can do it that way. It'll take probably maybe 12 days or something of worth of work. This is an

1395
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:54,900
estimate, although we don't really talk about estimates, we talk more about appetites, which is

1396
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,940
another thing we'll talk about in a second, but he'll say, this will take a little maybe couple

1397
01:49:57,940 --> 01:50:02,580
weeks to do. He goes, but there's a version of this I can do in three days. And here's the

1398
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:07,620
difference. The difference is it won't do this, that and the other thing. And then I'll go, that's

1399
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:12,100
worth it. Let's save those 10 days or nine days or whatever. And let's do that simpler version

1400
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:15,700
and get that done. Because now we can do three or four more things in the same amount of time.

1401
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:19,940
So it's about trades. You make trades with people and some things I'll go, you know what? No, this

1402
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:24,340
is I believe, I mean, it's just a guess. What do I know? It's like, this is what I think. I think

1403
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:29,620
this is worth actually going all in on like this feature. Let's do the two week version of this.

1404
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:34,900
And he'll go, you care more about it than I do. I'll do that. And the next time maybe he'll get

1405
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:38,660
the win on that. Like it's like you pay for lunch, I'll pay for lunch, you just kind of all

1406
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:42,580
evens out in the end. But you have to talk about the trade offs. And then you have to discuss them

1407
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:47,220
and go, that's worth it. That's worth it. I think the thing is, is that, especially in software,

1408
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:52,340
a lot of people don't talk that way. They just think that we have to build the best possible

1409
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:57,380
version of whatever it is that we're making, no matter what. It's like, well, why? Like, why does

1410
01:50:57,380 --> 01:51:00,980
it? Why does it have to be the best possible version? And what is the marginal gain past a

1411
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:04,500
certain point you can put, again, we've done this in the past, where we used to work on things for

1412
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,260
long periods of time. And truthfully, like, let's say we worked on something for three months,

1413
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:13,060
like, as you said, Parkinson's law work, expansive fill the time available. What we realized was that

1414
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:17,300
that project probably could have gotten done in half the time and probably been 95% as good. And

1415
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,580
probably the stuff that we squeezed out was probably worth it. It's just you can keep squeezing

1416
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:24,900
these things until you get down to the atomic level. And then you can do more of them. That's

1417
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:28,100
the other thing you can do more of them. The other thing I would say getting back to culture,

1418
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:33,940
is that there's nothing more demoralizing than working on something that you don't know when

1419
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:38,820
it's going to end and that you don't like. No matter what you're doing, you're going to work

1420
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:43,700
on some things you don't like to do. At Basecamp, the worst thing that could possibly happen is you

1421
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:48,180
have six weeks of something you don't want to work on. Certainly other bad things can happen. But

1422
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:53,940
like, when you begin, you can see the end. Six weeks max, and we've thrown out work, we've built

1423
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:58,900
built something six weeks, like, we don't like it. What's the cost? Six weeks. Versus what ends up

1424
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:04,180
happening is if you work on something for six weeks, or 12 weeks, and 24 weeks, and you keep

1425
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:10,260
going, you then have this huge momentum that makes it impossible for you to cut your losses. Because

1426
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:14,340
we put in months and months and months, it's only going to take, we're almost done another month,

1427
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:17,620
another month, another month. It's never just one month. It's always another month after that.

1428
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:21,300
Before you know what you're nine months in, 10 months in, and you're not going to cut your losses

1429
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:24,820
at that point, because you've invested too much. It's very hard to do that organizationally. So

1430
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:28,020
you end up keep pushing and pushing and pushing, and this thing keeps going and going and going.

1431
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:33,380
And by the end, it's no good. And you've wasted a year. And that could kill morale, and can destroy

1432
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:38,180
teams. So at the very worst, we have basically what we call circuit breaker, which is after six

1433
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:42,100
weeks, like if this isn't going anywhere, if we're not where we need to be, we can pull the circuit

1434
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:46,660
breaker and call it quits on that. And like, we lost six weeks, but that's not the end of the world.

1435
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:51,140
Now, how does one apply this to themselves? You have the luxury of being the boss. This is the

1436
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:55,780
culture is your company's way you've created it. How does somebody who's listening to this, who

1437
01:52:55,780 --> 01:53:01,060
works at a company that functions the way a normal, you know, a normal quote unquote high

1438
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:04,980
functioning company works, how do they get to apply this to their lives when they don't control their

1439
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:09,860
calendar shy of quitting and working at a company like Basecamp? And do you get the sense like,

1440
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:15,060
what percentage of companies do you think function, even let's just limit it to software? What

1441
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:20,100
companies within software do you think function within sort of the neighborhood of the way you've

1442
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:25,700
described that? I'd say pretty small percentage. Currently, we're out to change that. But I was

1443
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:30,100
say most do not right now. How does someone do it? This is like kind of about like figuring out

1444
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:34,900
what you have control over and what you don't. If you're new at a company, you're probably unlikely

1445
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:39,220
you have any power to change any of these things. The best way to do something like this is to take

1446
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:44,260
a small step and you're probably not going to have the influence to change the way the company works,

1447
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:48,420
but maybe on some project that's on the side that no one really cares about, you can take that on

1448
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:52,260
and show people how you can do this perhaps in a shorter amount of time. And they might have expected

1449
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:56,020
it was going to take three months and you do it in six weeks. I go, what is that? Like, how'd you do

1450
01:53:56,020 --> 01:54:00,820
that? And then you begin to build on some wins. But I think that's even maybe too big of a leap.

1451
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:06,660
I think around time, which is really important here, which is you may not have full control of

1452
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:09,860
your own time because you have a shared calendar system and people pull you into meetings and you're

1453
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:13,540
junior and you have to say yes, because you can't if you don't say yes, you're not a team player and

1454
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:18,740
you're out of there, you can start to do some things with other people. So, you know, there's

1455
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:22,740
that the famous, I guess it's the Gandhi quote, be the change you wish to see in the world,

1456
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:27,060
basically. So, if you don't like being interrupted by other people all the time,

1457
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:32,900
you can interrupt other people less or fewer times. Whatever you have in front of you that

1458
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:36,420
you can modify and you can change, begin to change that for yourself. You're not going to

1459
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:40,820
change the whole company, but hopefully you can influence some other people and they might be

1460
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:44,500
willing to make some more changes and you can kind of bring that up the chain. But I'm not under any

1461
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:47,940
illusion here that like someone's going to read this book or read some other book we've written

1462
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:52,420
and like the company's going to change. Where that change happens is from the top. So, a CEO reads

1463
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:57,220
it and goes like, and I also will also tell people like if the way you're working works,

1464
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:01,220
like keep doing it. But the way most people are working is not working and they know it,

1465
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:05,620
but they don't know what to do about it. They just like, this is what you do. We pour in more hours,

1466
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:09,460
projects go long, we're running in circles. Like if you're at the point where you're struggling

1467
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:13,300
with that and going, I can't do this anymore, I don't want to do this anymore, then it's time to

1468
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:16,500
change. The only time people are going to change is if there's actually a struggle. You're not going

1469
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,700
to change because you've heard of something. You're going to change because you're struggling

1470
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:25,140
so bad with what you have that now you're open to a new wave of working. So, that's really,

1471
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:29,700
I think ultimately the only way for these sorts of ideas to take hold is when there's a true

1472
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:34,180
struggle and you have the chance to implement some of those things. But as far as like other ideas

1473
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:38,340
we have, which are not about working as a team, like there's a lot of individual things you can do,

1474
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:44,340
certainly. How do you think about it personally? I was on the phone with a friend yesterday who's,

1475
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:51,780
I said to him, I said, man, I am so impressed by your ability to say no. I was pitching an idea to

1476
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:56,980
him that I'm interested in and putting a group of guys together to invest in something. And

1477
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:01,140
I reached out to him saying, look, I realize you're probably not going to do this, not because you

1478
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:09,220
don't love it, but because you have the strictest no policy of anyone I know. And in the end, it was,

1479
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:16,100
I love this so much, but like I can't. It is irresponsible for me to take on one more single

1480
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:20,260
idea. By the way, I should be saying the same thing. I should absolutely be saying no,

1481
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:26,340
but I'm not. But I've been investigating this within myself lately, right? Why do I struggle

1482
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:35,700
to say no? And I have this nasty, nasty habit, which creates so much tension in my life of

1483
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:43,300
agreeing to do things into the future. And then when D-Day comes, I take it out on everyone around

1484
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:51,620
me, but I'm really just pissed at myself. I'll agree to go do a talk next March in Germany. And

1485
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:58,340
I'm like, well, you know, there's nothing on my calendar March 14th next year. And then February

1486
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:05,460
27th comes along and I'm like, I'm so pissed. And I do this awful thing. I take it out on other

1487
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:10,980
people. I'm like, how could you let me do this? And I was like, you baby, nobody, you did it

1488
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:17,540
yourself, you idiot. But the fear that I'm examining is I have a fear of missing out. Like,

1489
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:21,620
well, you never know. Maybe that one talk, you meet somebody really interesting and they're doing

1490
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:25,940
this really cool thing in research and you learn this one thing that's going to change the way you

1491
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:32,660
do this. Or, you know, it's like, I don't know. I don't know how I keep rationalizing doing things

1492
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:40,100
that in the end I really believe I'd be better off doing less, but I don't know how to do less. I

1493
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:44,820
mean, this is like, now it's just turned into a therapy session. This is hard. And I've realized

1494
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:50,660
that too, which is why I've gotten better at saying no. I often regret saying yes, I've realized,

1495
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:55,540
to things far out in the future. One of the reasons why is because yes is really easy to say.

1496
01:57:55,540 --> 01:58:00,820
Yes requires no work, like later, like, yeah, I'll say yes to that trip to Germany, because it

1497
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:05,060
takes no work to say yes to that trip to Germany. And then you get to like, it's like, I'd rather be

1498
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:08,180
somewhere else right now than have to get on a plane, fly internationally, and I'm going to be

1499
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:12,340
tired and the whole thing. Like, I've just gotten better at looking at like trying to zoom to that

1500
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:16,260
point in time and going, would I want to do that then? It's not about do I want to do it now. It's

1501
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:22,180
what I do. I think I want to do it then. And that helps me be able to say no to things. But to me,

1502
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:28,900
no is far more surgical and far more precise, which I think will, this will appeal to you.

1503
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:32,020
When you say yes to something, you're basically saying no to 1000 other things.

1504
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:36,340
Because you can't do when you go to Germany, yeah, you might meet someone interesting,

1505
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:40,340
but look at all the things you can't do, like at that same time, you don't have the flexibility

1506
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:44,180
and the freedom to do things. Because you've already booked something far in advance. And

1507
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:48,180
that thing is costly. It's costly in your time and your health and all these things that you have to

1508
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:53,220
do. When you say no, you just say no to one thing. And now you have more options available to you.

1509
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:57,540
And that's how I've been thinking about no, no is a very surgical, very precise strike.

1510
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:03,220
Yes, as a shotgun. And for me, I've discovered that I prefer this is again, just for me,

1511
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:08,900
I prefer flexibility. And I like to have options, which is also one of the reasons why we're an

1512
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:12,980
independent company. And I will always remain an independent company because my freedom and

1513
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:17,220
flexibility is the most important thing to me, the ability to do what we need to do with the way we

1514
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:21,140
want to do it is way more important. And the way for me to spend my time on things I want to do is

1515
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:25,540
way more important than booking my calendar in the in the future, and feeling regret when that

1516
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:30,100
moment comes. It's unfair to the venue for me to go and feel regret, like I should be honored to

1517
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:34,180
speak. But I feel like it's not the speaking moment. It's the everything around it that I

1518
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:40,020
don't want to do. Yeah, one hour talk is still 48 hours of your time. Right. So I've gotten much,

1519
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:44,340
much better this I heard something. I don't know if this is true. I've heard this is sort of how

1520
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,780
Warren Buffett manages his time. I don't know if you've heard of this thing. I think I've heard

1521
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:51,700
the story. But please, I don't know if it's true. So like, I kind of feel weird about talking about

1522
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:56,420
it. But I've heard that basically, he will not book things far in advance. If you want to see

1523
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:01,460
Warren Buffett, if you're a business associate, whatever, you basically have to ask his secretary

1524
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:07,220
a day before and say like, is Warren available tomorrow that he wants to keep his schedule open

1525
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:11,460
for anything that comes up and not be blocked for months and months and months? Because how do you

1526
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:15,300
know what you're going to want to be doing in three months on Tuesday at four o'clock? How would you

1527
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:19,380
ever know what that's going to be like? Like, you might, in that moment feel like you want to read a

1528
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:22,340
new article, or you want to go on a trip, or you want to think about something else, or something

1529
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:28,660
else comes up the day before that you want to work on. We block our future with present obligations.

1530
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:34,420
And then we never have time to do things we want to do. So when you realize that, and it's hard

1531
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:39,380
still, even if you realize it, it's hard to do it. But I've found it to be a lot easier once I realized

1532
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:43,860
that I was I don't want to be regretful. And I don't know when I'm going to want to be doing that

1533
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:47,540
far in advance. So I'll book something a few days in advance or a few weeks in advance or a few

1534
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:52,180
months in advance sometimes for people I know. But like, I turned down way more things than I

1535
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:56,740
say yes to these days, and I feel better about it. Do you have any tips for saying no, the actual act

1536
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:01,700
of declining something that as you said is flattering to have been offered and you feel

1537
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:05,940
like an idiot for not being more grateful? I think just being really honest about it. Like,

1538
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:11,700
for example, I was just invited to speak overseas. And I said, it's an honor to be to be invited. I

1539
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:16,260
appreciate the invitation. However, I'm just not, I don't feel comfortable flying internationally

1540
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:20,100
for talks anymore. It's just too tiring for me. It's hard on my family. And I just I don't want to

1541
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:24,660
do that anymore. So I don't often say like, if you want to do a virtual thing, like I'm happy to call

1542
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:30,500
in via Skype or like provide some other option, but I can't book travel around a business engagement

1543
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:34,660
anymore. And I'll even do that in the US where like, if it's a if I have to go to San Francisco,

1544
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:41,300
like that's a four hour flight for me from Chicago. And that's a day minimum, probably two days. And

1545
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,620
it's like, I'm just very careful about that now. So I'll just be honest about it. Because otherwise,

1546
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:50,900
if you like, sprinkle powdered sugar on it and BS people, it's like, and everyone responds like,

1547
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:54,820
I totally understand. I appreciate that. Thanks for the consideration. And you're just nice to

1548
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:57,220
people. And they're nice to you back. And you're honest, and they're honest back. And everyone

1549
02:01:57,220 --> 02:02:03,140
understands. Nobody's mad ever. Yeah, maybe they're like, I really would have liked to have you speak,

1550
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:07,860
but they're they understand. I agree with that, by the way, the times I muster up the foresight to

1551
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:13,860
sort of say, No, I agree, people, I don't really recall a time when it's been so poorly received,

1552
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:19,140
if I've just been very transparent. The biggest challenge is examining the motivation, the fear

1553
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:23,780
of not doing something that that for me is something I'm still really exploring.

1554
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:27,700
Well, here's how you can look at that. Because I understand that. Just flip it, like look at all

1555
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:33,060
the other things I can do instead. Of all the possible things you can do, you can now do any

1556
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:38,820
of those possible things versus you're only able to do one thing. Like I've met wonderful people

1557
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:43,380
at events that I didn't want to go to. And there's clearly opportunities that I've missed,

1558
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:49,380
because I haven't done some things, obviously. But I think that the power of no is that you have

1559
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:53,300
a lot more options, it gives you a lot of options, and you can experience something else that day.

1560
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:56,820
And it might be something where where you kind of keep track of the things you've said no to,

1561
02:02:56,820 --> 02:03:00,340
like I've said no to seven things this year that I think would have been really interesting. So like,

1562
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:04,420
I have to do seven interesting things instead. Like you can make your own little trade offs with

1563
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:10,660
yourself. Oh, that's interesting. I like that. That thing that came up in March that I said no to

1564
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:17,620
the biggest reason I said no to it was actually the realization that it would basically kill any

1565
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:22,420
chance of going away with my family that month. And there might be a window to go, you know,

1566
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:27,060
if spring breaks line up, that would basically nuke a spring break opportunity, which

1567
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:31,460
then you'd feel like an idiot, right? If you're like, I can't believe I agreed to do this thing.

1568
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:36,500
And it now means I'm not going to do something with my family. Yeah. I look at no as yeses to

1569
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:41,060
other things. That's kind of how I look at it. Do we even dare talk about watches at all? How did

1570
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:46,900
you get into watches? You and I both love watches. We have a circle of friends who are equally,

1571
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:52,980
I think if I can just be affectionate, idiotic. Is it an aesthetic thing for you? Obviously,

1572
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:57,060
you've expressed a huge interest in aesthetics. Yes, it's an aesthetic thing. My dad, I don't

1573
02:03:57,060 --> 02:04:01,700
think he does this anymore, but he used to buy these old watches on eBay back when I was in high

1574
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:07,540
school. So like old Elgin and Illinois, these old tank watches from the twenties. That aesthetic

1575
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:12,260
doesn't speak to me today. Well, some of it does, but I just remember these little cool objects that

1576
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:16,900
would come in the mail. We'd open them up, we'd look at them together, and they were all different.

1577
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:20,500
I've always sort of been interested in things that like look like there's only one way to do

1578
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:23,780
something, but then there's like a thousand ways to do something. So like watch design is a great

1579
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:28,340
example of that. So you have a, you have 12 hours or whatever you have, you know, some 24 hour dials,

1580
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:32,580
whatever it is. And you're like, there should be like one way to do this, you know, there's like

1581
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:36,980
two hands and this is, but really there's thousands of different designs and stuff. I've always found

1582
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:40,980
that fascinating. So I followed my dad has probably hundreds of these little watches,

1583
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:45,620
like 20 bucks a pop. I don't know what they were. I kind of got into it that way. And my first watch

1584
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:51,620
actually was, that I remember getting was a Seiko Data 2000, which is a digital watch with a keyboard.

1585
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:57,060
And being the bad student that I was, I would cheat in school with it, because you could put

1586
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:01,860
notes into it with a keyboard and would sync it. And you'd have like, there's a screen with two

1587
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:05,940
buttons, which you can scroll through, like how would it, it was amazing. This is like an amazing

1588
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:11,780
thing. So it had a keyboard like the size of a, like an iPhone today. And the back of the watch

1589
02:05:11,780 --> 02:05:15,860
was this just metal and it would snap into this spot on this keyboard. And there was like an

1590
02:05:15,860 --> 02:05:19,940
induction thing going on. It was like pretty interesting. Then it would go into this text

1591
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:24,100
mode where you can basically have like a text file and I could type stuff into it. And then

1592
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:28,180
it would just save it. And then you take the thing off and put on your wrist and then you can

1593
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:34,020
just kind of scroll through the notes. And you know, back then in whatever it was, the early 90s

1594
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:39,940
or like whatever it was, no one would ever suspect that you had like data on your watch. Right now,

1595
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:43,140
like it's you'd be cheating, but I guess people can have notes today. But anyway, so I would just

1596
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:47,540
kind of look through and tap through and have some notes for math and some history notes,

1597
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:51,220
because I was terrible with like names and dates and stuff. So I just kind of put those in there.

1598
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:54,020
And that didn't feel like cheating to me, to be honest. Like what does it matter if you know

1599
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:58,740
someone's name or date exactly? Like what is the difference really? But anyway, I would do that. And

1600
02:05:58,740 --> 02:06:02,500
that kind of got me into like the utility of watches. Now everyone talks about tool watches.

1601
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:06,340
That was like a great tool for me truly. And so I got into that. And then I eventually got into

1602
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:10,500
mechanical watches because I was just like blown away by the fact that like something could run

1603
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:15,460
without a battery and can run perpetually forever. Just because you're moving, that's really kind of

1604
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:19,540
a cool thought. And then I got into the mechanics of them. And then of course I got into the aesthetics

1605
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:24,260
of them. I definitely have this sickness, although I've been sort of trimming back lately,

1606
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:27,220
which is kind of nice. But it's probably just to kind of build back up again.

1607
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:31,780
My tastes have changed too. So I think like that's the other thing is kind of neat to see things that

1608
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:35,620
you bought that you thought you liked six years ago. And you look at them now and you're like,

1609
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:39,060
my tastes have changed. And I think it's kind of a neat thing to do because there's of course,

1610
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:42,900
you can look at clothes and look at other things. But I feel like I kind of dress the same way I

1611
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:46,820
always have like a t-shirt and jeans. So that hasn't really changed much. But the things that

1612
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:51,540
I like, the objects that I like definitely have. And since these objects are permanent objects,

1613
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:56,580
you do keep them around. Unlike a phone, like flip phones, like you go way back when,

1614
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:59,380
you don't have those anymore. So you can't really look back on those things, but watches,

1615
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:02,980
you can look back and go, that's what I was into then. And this is how I've changed. I kind of like

1616
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:08,900
that. Now, how did you get involved with Houdini? I was just a fan. And then Eric Winn, who used to

1617
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:14,820
work with them, he reached out to me. Eric is a great vintage watch dealer. I've bought several

1618
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:18,900
watches from him. Eric's a wonderful guy, very knowledgeable. He reached out to me via email

1619
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:22,500
because I had some stuff on Instagram back when I was doing Instagram. I don't do it anymore. But

1620
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:27,060
when I was doing that, I had some watches and somehow he found me and he's like, Hey, you seem

1621
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:31,300
to be into watches a lot. And I want to introduce myself. I'm Eric from Houdini. And I write this

1622
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:35,700
thing called bring a loop or whatever it was called back then. I think it was like the precursor to

1623
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:40,100
talking watches. Yeah. And this is like a thing every Friday they would show vintage watches that

1624
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:43,940
they found on the web. And I think he once said, like, can I show one of yours? I think that's kind

1625
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:49,380
of how it was. And I kind of got into that. And then I eventually met Ben and met the crew. I'm

1626
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:54,500
a big fan of what they're doing. I'm also an investor. So full disclosure. So like, I'm a fan

1627
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:58,660
and I'm an investor, but I am on the board there. So like, just to get that out of the way. So

1628
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:02,580
everybody knows where I'm coming from there. But I like what they've done. And I think they've

1629
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:09,940
elevated this sort of weird geeky thing into a bit of a more refined collector's experience,

1630
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:14,100
which I think is pretty cool and pretty hard to do in like niche circles. So a lot of like niche

1631
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:19,780
collector things are often like really poorly done bad taste, not like offensive, but just like,

1632
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:24,100
there's no design involved. Well, I think that's what's sort of cool about Hodinki. And I don't

1633
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:28,820
talk much about watches on the podcast, actually. But I do think a number of people listening know

1634
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:35,460
how much I love watches. And Hodinki is really great. I mean, I think their writing is very good.

1635
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:42,260
And I find myself forwarding articles to my wife all the time. You know, one thing I had to do two

1636
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:48,340
years ago was take this stupid Hodinki alert off my phone and computer, because it was just really

1637
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:53,780
bad every day to get like two pings with a Hodinki article. And I was like, you know, talk about not

1638
02:08:53,780 --> 02:09:00,260
being productive is just getting watch porn thrown at you all day long. I've eliminated pretty much

1639
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:04,820
all notifications on my phone, except like things I need during the day. I actually think phones are

1640
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:08,500
highly addictive. I think they're basically cigarette modern day cigarettes. And they might

1641
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:13,460
be at least as bad for you. I think they might be worse. Oh, probably not worse. Like lung cancer

1642
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:16,660
is pretty damn bad, right? And cardiovascular disease is pretty damn bad. But you know what,

1643
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:23,380
if you took the area under the curve of suffering, I actually think phones have a bigger AUC of

1644
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:29,940
suffering than cigarettes. And even though maybe for a while people didn't realize cigarettes were

1645
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:35,460
bad. Like people know that they're bad and they still do them. I don't think people realize phones

1646
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:39,940
are bad. So I think that's their manipulative in that way, in a way that the cigarette is very

1647
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:44,500
direct. It's like I smoke, there's smoke. Well, it's the cigarette, it's the cigarette of 1950.

1648
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:47,860
Right. Where no one really knew I thought it was cool and whatever. Yeah. Doctors recommended them.

1649
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:49,620
Doctors recommended them. Great way to lose weight.

1650
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:54,020
menthol was good for you or something. Yes. In fact, this was the preferred brand during smoking,

1651
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:58,980
during pregnancy rather. Is that right? Oh, I'm sure I think there was a mothers should smoke this

1652
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:03,300
one variant. Wow. You know, at Hopkins in the old wing of the hospital, which I don't think is in

1653
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:09,140
use anymore, there are still ashtrays in the patient rooms. And I remember still in the old

1654
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:14,020
ORs even seeing ashtrays. That's interesting. And they should keep that around just as a reminder,

1655
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:17,620
how delusional we can all be. But I think phones are kind of like that. So I've kind of taken

1656
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:22,340
notifications off my phone. I don't like if I want to know something, I'll go find it versus I don't

1657
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:27,540
want to be pulled to anything. Like I'll go look for it if I'm curious. I think we've become slaves

1658
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:33,620
to phones telling us what to do, and apps telling us what to do. And this actually all comes back to

1659
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:37,460
the kind of the beginning of this conversation, which was that the business models surrounding

1660
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:42,740
many of these things on phones are all about engagement. And engagement is an addictive

1661
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:49,300
behavior. And so these companies basically are designed to addict you to their services and

1662
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:53,940
prompt you the right amounts of time per day and reward you for engagement and whatnot.

1663
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:59,140
And they build these terrible addictive behaviors. I'm aware of them, but I try to stay as far away

1664
02:10:59,140 --> 02:11:02,580
from them as I possibly can. But the business models are tied to this. This is the other thing.

1665
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:06,500
It's all about eyeballs, number of people using it. It's all about advertising dollars. It's all

1666
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:11,940
about all these things. And this is where the business model, you can't see things changing

1667
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:16,660
unless the business model changes. There's lots of talk about companies need to be more responsible

1668
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:19,860
and designers need to be more responsible and programmers shouldn't be building software like

1669
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:23,300
this. But as long as the business model supports that, and that's what keeps you in business, and

1670
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:27,460
that's what the job is, you're going to keep doing it. That's just human nature, unfortunately.

1671
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:32,100
Now, I remember you sort of opted out of Instagram a little less than a year ago, if I recall.

1672
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:34,260
Yeah, in 2019, beginning of, yeah.

1673
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:36,180
Yeah, I remember you put up a black picture, right?

1674
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:40,580
Yeah, it's a black square. And I still look at it sometimes. I find myself actually browsing,

1675
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:43,620
and I feel sick though when I do it, but I still do it.

1676
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:43,700
How come?

1677
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:45,780
It's like powerful, why do I feel sick?

1678
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:46,260
Yes.

1679
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:52,100
A couple of reasons. First, I feel like I'm going against what I said I would do.

1680
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:57,380
So I have stopped posting completely, but I was hoping that that meant I would stop using,

1681
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:58,580
but I'm not.

1682
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:00,580
So why haven't you uninstalled it on your phone?

1683
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:06,900
It's mostly because of the watch thing. So I still use it to look at watch people that I know,

1684
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:12,500
because I feel like I learned something from that. But I don't think it's worth it, because I

1685
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:17,060
probably still spend too much time browsing through things mindlessly, looking at pictures

1686
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:22,180
of watches, which don't really matter to me. Really? Really don't fundamentally matter if

1687
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:25,140
I see that picture of that person wearing on their wrist. I'm not really learning anything.

1688
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:32,740
I've convinced myself that I am. It's like I'm an addict convincing myself that it's okay.

1689
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:38,340
That's what it is. Now, there's recreational enjoyment out of it, and I do learn some things

1690
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:41,700
that I've met some people that way clearly. But I don't, again, getting back to trade-offs,

1691
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:45,460
the trade-offs are probably not worth it, yet I'm still on the wrong side of that deal.

1692
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:49,220
I'm using it less and less and less. What I don't like looking at is, I guess I don't like

1693
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:54,180
looking at vanity that much. Because you still use Twitter. I use Twitter. So it's not a social media

1694
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:58,180
thing that you're opposed to. It's not social media, although I am strongly opposed to Facebook

1695
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:03,140
for a number of other reasons. But I'm not opposed to Twitter, because to me, Twitter is something

1696
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:09,460
that I can, I mostly broadcast. I don't really read that much, except I'll engage if someone

1697
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:14,020
writes me back, typically. But Twitter for me, it's just different. It feels very different.

1698
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:18,340
One of the things that bugs me about Instagram is that a lot of people just show off.

1699
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:22,900
It's not that there's not valuable stuff on there. It's just that I don't like to see people showing

1700
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:29,620
off. And that happens. And I remember myself doing that, I'd buy a new watch or something. And the

1701
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:33,060
first thing I would do, I would like I want to share this with other people, not because I want

1702
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:38,900
them to see it. It's because I want them to know that I have it. And that is not healthy behavior.

1703
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:43,060
It just isn't. So I cut myself off from that at least. But then now I still see other people

1704
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:49,220
doing it. But then it's hard to turn away too. This is the addiction a little bit. So I use it a

1705
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:52,900
whole lot less than I did. And I'm almost all the way off it now. I should probably just delete it.

1706
02:13:52,900 --> 02:14:00,260
In fact, I will delete it after this conversation. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Done. Holy cow. Why not now? Like,

1707
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:03,300
when am I going to do it? Well, it's funny, before we jumped on this podcast, we were having another

1708
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:06,900
great discussion about a whole bunch of other really cool stuff with respect to exercise and

1709
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:11,700
meditation. And you are very much a person who does what he says he's going to do. I'm going to

1710
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:15,620
do it right now. We're going to do it right now. Right now. I mean, you'll have to tell people that

1711
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:21,140
I'm really doing well. Yeah, there it goes. And of course, I look, I can always reinstall it later.

1712
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:25,380
But I'm not going to know about you. That's gone. And it's interesting to know that was your home

1713
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:29,860
screen. Second. Oh, no, you're right. Yeah, I was your home screen. So you opened up some real estate

1714
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:34,180
on the most important screen. And here's what's going to happen. It's not going to matter. That's

1715
02:14:34,180 --> 02:14:40,260
the thing like, you might go, I might lose connection with like, oh, well, like the fact that

1716
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:45,060
you can't do something because one thing goes away because of it. Like, I don't want to be

1717
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:51,700
beholden to those kinds of things. And also, I'm just aware that like, that made me feel weird for

1718
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:58,980
a second. That's them making me feel weird. Like, I shouldn't let them make me feel weird. That's

1719
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:02,660
just, they shouldn't have control over me that way. That might be the most important moment of

1720
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:07,940
the podcast. Last, last question I want to ask you, which again, purely stems from selfish

1721
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:11,220
desires though, I do, but I think there'll be enough people listening that this question will

1722
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:16,820
serve a broader purpose. What is your relationship like with email? Which is, I mean, just to let my,

1723
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:21,860
I've probably spoken about this more than people want to hear. I really find email to be a troubling

1724
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:29,140
thing. I find you take everything you feel about Instagram, cube it, raise it to the power of E

1725
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:36,500
and cube it again. That's how bad I think email is. I think email is an awful, awful thing, which

1726
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:40,900
is not to say there aren't valuable things that come from email, but I think the net effect is

1727
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:47,460
toxic. I agree with you. One of the things that blows me away about email, anybody with your email

1728
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:51,300
address can get in your face. I don't mean like getting your face in a rude way, but I mean,

1729
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:56,100
getting your attention, right? They land in your inbox. It's yours and they can put themselves

1730
02:15:56,100 --> 02:16:00,500
there no matter what. And to build on that, they can add to your to-do list. It's sort of like,

1731
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:07,780
it's this to-do list that everybody gets to add to. And it's an introduction list that everybody

1732
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:13,140
can just make. But actually, I don't think email is the biggest offender. I think in organizations,

1733
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:18,020
I think chat is a bigger offender. Now, I don't know if you use chat tools in your organization,

1734
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:22,660
but no, but I can worse. Yeah, because it's even more instant. It's real time. And there's an

1735
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:27,860
expectation of immediate response. And that makes it especially bad. Also organizations,

1736
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:31,700
organizations begin to think one line at a time. Yeah, it discourages this writing thing

1737
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:35,940
that you seem to place an emphasis on. You've got like, write and present and like, think something

1738
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:39,540
through and put it out there as a complete thought. Like if you've ever tried to be in a

1739
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:44,820
chat room and a company, you're sort of typing some idea out and someone else jumps in and takes

1740
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:48,980
like, ask a question like, well, wait, let me just finish. And it's like, it's just a mess. It's like

1741
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:53,540
this race to get your idea out because you're doing it one line at a time. Meanwhile, if you write

1742
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:56,900
something in long form, you can get your whole idea together, put it out there for people. People

1743
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:01,300
can read it on their own schedule and then get back to you tomorrow. There's not this expectation

1744
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:05,460
of like immediate response because the medium is encouraging immediate response. So well,

1745
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:11,700
that's why I hate WhatsApp. I just can't stand WhatsApp for that reason. But imagine if you had

1746
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:15,780
a company of 200 people and everyone's on WhatsApp and that's the primary way they communicate with

1747
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:19,300
each other. This is what's happening inside many organizations these days. And it's going in the

1748
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:24,180
wrong direction. And people are beginning to realize it just like 15 years ago, everyone thought open

1749
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:28,740
floor office plans were a great idea. People are realizing now they're not good ideas at all. But

1750
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:32,420
at the time, it was the best idea in the world. So everyone switched to it. There's other ideas,

1751
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:35,620
other reasons why they did because it's cheaper and it's easier. It's more flexible. I get all

1752
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:39,620
that too. But they're very distracting. People don't have any privacy. It's hard to get in the

1753
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:42,980
zone and do some deep work when people are mulling around and there's noise around.

1754
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:51,140
Chat rooms are basically all day meetings with an unknown set of participants and many, many

1755
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:56,660
different topics all at once. And they're basically virtual open offices and they're

1756
02:17:56,660 --> 02:18:01,540
running 24 seven and they're terrible. But that's sort of the current trend. But I think it's going

1757
02:18:01,540 --> 02:18:05,860
to trend back towards more asynchronous long form communication because I think it's a better method.

1758
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:11,140
I hope so. I mean, I would just close by saying I think evolutionarily, I don't think we evolved

1759
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:15,540
for the tempo of the electronic environment. Obviously, we didn't evolve with electronics,

1760
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:21,540
but it's less about the electronics, I think, and sometimes and more about the way it's changing

1761
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:27,140
our brain and the way we, the chats are obviously a horrible example, meaning a great example of how

1762
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:31,940
horrible it is. But yeah, I just, I don't think our ancestors when they were working on a problem,

1763
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:38,660
whether it was finding their next meal or building something, like I just don't think that we're

1764
02:18:38,660 --> 02:18:43,700
great synaptically at doing that stuff. Tied to that too is like, what's the rush?

1765
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:48,180
Someone might hear me say that and go, well, you guys work in six week cycles instead of like three

1766
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:54,020
months. Like what's the rush? Well, six weeks aren't rushed, but like, why is everyone feel

1767
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:58,420
like they need to rush around? I mean, you can ask people what it's like at work today. And most

1768
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:03,380
people say like, I'm super busy. I'm like, okay, get back to these people. And like, everyone all

1769
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:08,020
of a sudden is rushing all the time. What is so important that we're rushing about? And most of the

1770
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:11,700
stuff we're rushing about and rushing to get to and rushing to do doesn't really matter anyway.

1771
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:16,660
It's just this pace that I think has absorbed the business world specifically,

1772
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:22,980
that is unhealthy and unsustainable. And I don't think the outcomes are better. Why is it better

1773
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:27,620
to talk faster at work? Like, why is that better? Why is it better to talk shorter at work? Why is

1774
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:32,740
it better to not be able to explain yourself clearly in one fell swoop? Why, you know, why

1775
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:37,700
are these things actually better? I think they're more convenient. And that's why they're happening.

1776
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:41,700
But I don't think that they're better. And I think that enlightened companies are going to

1777
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:46,420
begin to realize this and go convenience is one thing certainly, but we're actually able to do

1778
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:50,580
better work when we're more deliberate about it. When we slow down a little bit, we get to communicate

1779
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:56,180
in complete sentences and in complete form. And when we also don't allow human nature to get in

1780
02:19:56,180 --> 02:20:00,900
the way, which is that specifically around projects that things should not last forever,

1781
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:04,980
and go on and on and on and build up to such momentum that we can't pull the plug anymore.

1782
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:09,220
And that morale goes down the tubes and all these sorts of things begin to happen. So I think, you

1783
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:14,100
know, a small percentage of companies are going to sort of see the light and are beginning to. And

1784
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:18,340
it's not going to change everyone because convenience and speed is something that a lot of people value

1785
02:20:18,340 --> 02:20:21,300
as well. But I think that there's a lot of trade offs that aren't being evaluated.

1786
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:27,140
Well, Jason, I on a personal level, find this stuff so interesting, because, like I said, if I were to

1787
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:31,460
sort of evaluate, give myself a scorecard on how I'm doing with respect to my eating, my sleeping,

1788
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:36,020
my this, my that, my other thing, I think this is definitely the area where I fall short. And it's

1789
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:41,780
not even close. Like it's not, it's not even a contest. This is really tough. This will be a long

1790
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:45,940
commitment for me. But I'm very interested in figuring out ways to make this better, because

1791
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:53,780
I think I come at it from a different framework, which is honestly, I've had the, I don't know if

1792
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:57,540
privilege is even the right word, but I've certainly seen many people at the end of their life,

1793
02:20:57,540 --> 02:21:01,940
not so much today because of what I do today. But back in my previous life, where I really did get

1794
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:08,180
to see people who were at the end of life, cliches are a cliche for a reason. I really don't recall

1795
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:12,980
anybody at the end of life wishing they had worked a little longer, a little harder, which isn't to

1796
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:15,860
say that there isn't somebody out there who feels that way, or there isn't somebody who feels like

1797
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:21,220
they left something on the table. And who knows, maybe in his final days, Steve Jobs did wish he

1798
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:26,180
had worked a little harder to get that next product just to that next level. I don't know. I mean, I,

1799
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:33,060
I won't blanket that statement as completely diffuse, but most people, so I have to assume I

1800
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:38,740
will be the same way. When you're on the back end of that, you start to think about the relationships

1801
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:47,940
that got neglected or the amount of just joy that got sort of missed by being busy, which is for me,

1802
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:52,980
busyness is a bit of an addiction. Busyness is the other thing we don't really talk much about, but

1803
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:57,940
busyness is something I try to avoid at all costs because I feel like busyness is basically

1804
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:01,860
shifting between a bunch of different things at the same time. And that's why you feel busy.

1805
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:04,500
Because you're like, I got to run to this. I got to run to that. I got to come back to this.

1806
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:08,420
And I'll have more time to do this later. It's like, if you can figure out ways to work in

1807
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:13,700
contiguous blocks of time, you can cut back a lot of the busy feeling. I think that's another really

1808
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:19,220
interesting area to improve on is to give yourself time to start and finish something in the same day

1809
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:25,780
versus within a contiguous block of time versus like, I'll get this done later between lunch and

1810
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:32,100
after this call and whatever. You'll do a better job and you'll have a calmer day than trying to

1811
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:35,860
wedge things into empty spaces. I think that's one of the big things. I think people's days are

1812
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:40,260
pretty scrambled actually. That's one of the reasons they feel busy. Again, it's not that

1813
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:44,580
there's more work to do. I don't feel like there's more work to do. And in fact, shouldn't technology

1814
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:49,300
hasn't the promise been like less work and all these things are automated for us. So where's all

1815
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:52,580
this more work coming from? I don't think it's that. I think it's our days are chunked into smaller

1816
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:55,700
bits. It's hard to fit everything in that and you feel really busy and manic.

1817
02:22:55,700 --> 02:23:01,380
I think that's a great point. Jason, thank you so much for making the time. I know you'd take time

1818
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:05,860
very seriously. So you're here as little as you need to be. So well, thanks Peter. It's great to be on.
