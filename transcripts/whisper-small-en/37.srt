1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Hey, everybody.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,760
Welcome to this week's episode of The Drive.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,840
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,240
and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
If you're listening to this, you probably already know.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
The two things I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,520
I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,440
I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,280
all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,660
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,700
And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,440
The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
with you.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,200
In fact, we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,160
has mirrored this.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,680
So all of this raises a natural question.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,920
How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this?

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,520
As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,320
But after a lot of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,820
The first and most important of these is trust.

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,340
I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it.

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,720
Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,400
I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,680
So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,740
work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,800
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,560
If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
works for you.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,960
In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
It's that simple.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
get back more than you give.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,960
So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,260
other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,260
These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,840
of our shows.

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
episodes.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,540
That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,520
podcasts when they come out.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,960
Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,340
deals possible on the products that I love.

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,920
And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,240
do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,960
about for free and have them pass savings on to you.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,160
enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,440
members to support us at a level that makes sense for you.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,400
I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,920
If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,320
by signing up for a monthly subscription.

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,400
My guest this week is Zubin Damania, AKA ZDoggMD.

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,600
Zubin and I have been friends for about 20 years and we talk about that actually at the

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
outset, so how we met and things like that.

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,520
We kind of lost touch for a few years, but then reconnected at TedMed in 2013 when we

71
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,460
both spoke.

72
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,560
This is a kind of interesting episode in the sense that I wanted to interview him, but

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,920
he wanted to interview me.

74
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,960
So when it got to his studio in Vegas, which is where we did this, and his crew is there,

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,360
we filmed it and actually ran it as a sort of a Facebook Live.

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,800
In the end, it really I think comes across as a pretty equal balance of about a 50-50

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,040
of just two dudes sitting there talking about this stuff, and it was really a mutual interview.

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,640
Zubin or as we call him ZDoggMD is kind of one of the most talented people I've ever

79
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
met.

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,440
I mean, not only is he talented as an amazing doc, but he's just musically gifted.

81
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,400
He is comedically gifted, and he has put those things to an amazing use in what he

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
does.

83
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,280
So he has all the usual accolades.

84
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
He trained at Berkeley, UCSF, Stanford, internal medicine, and of course that's where we met,

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,080
and he went on to found something called Turntable Health in Las Vegas, which was part of this

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,880
broader ambition of the urban revitalization in Las Vegas that was spearheaded by Tony

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,320
Shea, who is the CEO of Zappos, and that's the guy who recruited Zubin there.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,520
This all started because Zubin was working as a hospitalist at Stanford in internal medicine,

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,800
but he had this whole side gig of doing comedy and music, and it was that which Tony saw

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,760
that made him think, hey man, you got to do something a little bigger than just being

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,680
an internist at Stanford.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,960
His videos are amazing, and we're going to link to a lot of them.

93
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,040
In particular, ain't the way to die, lose yourself in seven years are my three favorites,

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,280
but I've seen every one of them multiple times, and I've been following this for a long time.

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,640
Many of these videos have gone viral, and I think in aggregate he's got about half a

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,640
billion views on Facebook and YouTube, and these are educating patients, educating providers,

97
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,220
and kind of mercilessly creating a satire of our entire dysfunctional healthcare system.

98
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,800
We do talk quite a bit about healthcare, and Zubin's given this much more thought than

99
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,040
I have, but it was just so interesting to get into this stuff, and we get into some

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
really deep philosophy stuff.

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,600
Basically, he just stumps me all day long with philosophical questions about consciousness

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,320
and the mind and other things like that.

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,880
I would say overall this is probably one of the most enjoyable discussions I've ever had

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,040
with somebody in this sort of format.

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,280
I've talked a lot about how the discussion I had with Jaco a few years ago was one of

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
my favorite.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,200
I would put this up there as well in probably the top three discussions just in terms of

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,680
overall enjoyment.

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,680
The show notes will link to a bunch of really cool stuff, but you can also go to his site

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,280
ZDogg, and that's just two Gs on the dog, MD.com.

111
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm really excited to introduce all of you to Zubin Damania.

112
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,200
We are live.

113
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
What is up Z Pack?

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
It's your boy ZDogg, MD.

115
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I am live and direct out of Studio Z.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,760
You are not going to believe it, but we're doing something absolutely different.

117
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,040
What's this big phallic symbol in my face?

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
It's called a microphone.

119
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Okay?

120
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Learn about it.

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,720
I have it because I have a good friend that goes way back to my Stanford days.

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,280
He is a physician.

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,700
He's an engineer.

124
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,260
He's done crazy stuff, worked with the world's top performing individuals to try to teach

125
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,740
us not just how to live longer, but how to have a longer, healthy life, a health span.

126
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,380
He is one of my favorite people because he's uber smart, hangs out with all kinds of hoity

127
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,380
toity people like Tim Ferriss and Sam Harris and all these smarty pants, intellectual dark

128
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
web people.

129
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,700
But more important than that, he's a bald, off-white doctor.

130
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,020
Welcome Dr. Peter Attia.

131
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,100
Thank you so much for having me on this co-hosted event today.

132
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
That's right.

133
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,780
So what we're doing different now is we're co-hosting this.

134
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,560
You're in Vegas to give a talk.

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,300
You have your own podcast called The Drive, which is a stunning deep dive into the nerdiest

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,980
shit I've ever seen in my life.

137
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,380
I love it.

138
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,180
Like you're talking about with—I heard Seyfried, Dr. Seyfried's one, about how cancer may be

139
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,620
a metabolic illness and how the mitochondria are abnormal and you're like in his face

140
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,820
going, well, just because they're morphologically abnormal doesn't mean that the function have

141
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,900
you actually fractured.

142
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
What's your ideal trial?

143
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,600
And I'm just going nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, get some.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,200
But also, you are even more than that.

145
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,560
You're talking about how to maximize human potential in a way that's uniquely human.

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,040
And that's what I love about you ever since our Stanford days.

147
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,240
Well, speaking of those, let's retell that story.

148
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,600
So I'll do this from the lens of how I would introduce you to my listeners, but I think

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,100
your listeners will also be intrigued by this.

150
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,800
So I was one year behind you in medical school.

151
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,160
Now you went to UCSF, I went to Stanford.

152
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Is that correct?

153
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
That's right.

154
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
It was a gang war type of deal.

155
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
That's right.

156
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
And it was trying to happen unsuccessfully.

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
That's right.

158
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,720
So there was pure animosity between the two best programs on the West Coast.

159
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
That's right.

160
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,920
You guys thought you were all that because you were rich and we were ghetto as fudge.

161
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
But in the end of the day, you come to Stanford to do your residency in internal medicine.

162
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,760
So you are now an intern in the internal medicine program.

163
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,240
I'm a fourth year medical student.

164
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,080
And I had already decided I was going into surgery.

165
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,080
So I had done the heavy lifting to begin that application process.

166
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,240
So I'm doing internal medicine, but there's no pressure because Stanford is pass fail.

167
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,320
And it's like, how can you fail the rotation?

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,640
You know, it's not like I wasn't going to show up, but I didn't have to like be the

169
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
smartest kid in the room.

170
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,280
I didn't have to like impress the hell out of the residents.

171
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,680
I was like, Hey, I'm going to be a surgeon.

172
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,940
I might as well learn whatever things in medicine apply to taking care of surgical patients.

173
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,040
So we show up on day one and you're the intern.

174
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
I don't remember who the second year was.

175
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I don't either.

176
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,160
The third year I'm blanking on his name, but you called him Darth Vader because his

177
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,120
fantasy he said was to walk.

178
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,560
We can't name him now because if you remember, but he's described that his fantasy was to

179
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,600
walk down the hall of the hospital with a cape because he was so smart and everyone

180
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
would think he was Darth Vader.

181
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
I know exactly who I'm talking about.

182
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Oh my God.

183
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I remember his name now.

184
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Malignant.

185
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
We're not going to say it.

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
We won't say it.

187
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Yeah.

188
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Welcome to Stanford.

189
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,240
This guy seems like a douchebag, meaning the chief resident.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,720
I was pointing at me because that also is true.

191
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,880
The second year was a nonpersonality, was my recollection.

192
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,400
They were sort of there, but not there.

193
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,960
You were the intern and it was out of control.

194
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,920
I could not imagine how much one could enjoy a rotation of internal medicine.

195
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
I don't even remember where we were.

196
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Were we the VA?

197
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
We were at the mothership.

198
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
We were at Stanford.

199
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
No, it's weird.

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,680
It's like this weird emotional reaction because I remember you so well.

201
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,040
The thing is, look, look, look, dude, I've taken care of a lot of people.

202
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I've been through a lot of teams.

203
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,920
There are very few people I remember.

204
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,240
I remember fucking Peter Attia coming up, medical student, fourth year, cocky as hell because

205
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,960
you were going into surgery.

206
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Did you already match?

207
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
No, I hadn't matched.

208
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
In your mind, you were-

209
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,040
I knew I wanted to go into general surgery.

210
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
You knew.

211
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,160
On a medicine team, we've already written you off as someone who doesn't matter to us

212
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
because you're not going down.

213
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,680
There's no point putting any energy into teaching me anything.

214
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,240
When you sat down and did the entire monologue from Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and the therapist,

215
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
like, oh, my life is- I don't even remember it.

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
You were bald at the time or shaved head and had the finger here and did the whole thing.

217
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm an intern.

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,280
The only way I can cope with this shit is through comedy, through humor.

219
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,440
Humor was my coping mechanism from the beginning.

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,400
This guy does this thing and you're a medical student.

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,060
First of all, you have the balls to come up and do that thing, which in a hierarchical

222
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,440
system like that, already I'm like, this guy's my hero because I'm oppositional defiant.

223
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
You nailed it perfectly.

224
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,280
I'm like, who is this guy?

225
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
There's an interesting backstory to that.

226
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,360
My very, very first rotation was pediatrics because when I went to medical school, I thought

227
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,240
I was going to be a pediatric oncologist.

228
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,480
I figured I better figure this out quick.

229
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm going to do pediatrics first.

230
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,920
This was the moment when I knew I couldn't be a pediatric oncologist was when I realized

231
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,520
I couldn't be a pediatrician.

232
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm not saying that to upset the pediatricians because maybe it was just I couldn't be a

233
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,480
Stanford pediatrician, but on about the fourth day of the rotation, there was this really

234
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,960
chubby cute little baby in the nursery.

235
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,280
I forget what was wrong with it, dehydrated or something like that.

236
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,240
We were taking care of it and I just decided at that moment, it made sense to walk down

237
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,200
the hall and pretend I was fat bastard and talk about wanting to eat the baby.

238
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,280
I came out of the room and I was like, baby, get in my belly.

239
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,520
The whole rest of the night, all I did was talk about the other, other white meat.

240
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Oh my God.

241
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,080
I mean, literally not one of them, not one of them even smiled.

242
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,200
They were mortified by my existence.

243
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Humorless bastards.

244
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
Forget about fat bastards.

245
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
You know what's so funny?

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
See, this is why you and I get along.

247
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
You're an introvert.

248
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm an extrovert.

249
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,440
You're incredibly science minded, diligent, industrious.

250
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm the opposite.

251
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
I'm lazy.

252
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I procrastinate.

253
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,400
I use smoke and mirrors to get any success I can and grasp onto it desperately.

254
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,960
The truth is we have a very similar disturbed sense of humor.

255
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,200
One time in hematology, so here I am like I'm a second year resident and the attending

256
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,480
is a guy named Steve Gautre, really renowned guy.

257
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,720
We're on Everybody's Stressed.

258
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,400
It's young people who are dying, like all over the place.

259
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,960
I had already built, you know what happens in medicine?

260
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,000
You start building this brick wall around yourself so you don't feel what's going on

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,180
because the minute you feel it, you're in the stairwell crying back and forth and it's

262
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,700
just morally distressing.

263
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,700
So to cope with that, I built a wall, but then I started using humor.

264
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,260
So Gautre, we had these really hard sick service and there was this creepy puppet that one

265
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,660
of the patients had donated to F Ground, which was our own floor.

266
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,460
And it was this weird hobo, like home, had a little stick and these little things you

267
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,020
put your hand in its butt and you make it do stuff.

268
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,060
And that's how that came out wrong.

269
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,060
It's I know what you mean.

270
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,060
You know what I'm saying?

271
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
They have a very large anus.

272
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,380
Extremely loose sphincter tone.

273
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
Yeah.

274
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,620
And so and no curvature in the colon.

275
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,620
It's more of a mono.

276
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,180
Like the GI tract basically goes the esophageal anal canal.

277
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,980
It's a straightened and shortened track.

278
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,980
You know what?

279
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
That always bothered me.

280
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,380
That being said, rounds are happening and Koutrego.

281
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,100
So Damania, did you see Mr. Pickles in three?

282
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,340
And I go, I didn't.

283
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,300
And he and you could see him just like, you know, this guy fucking sucks.

285
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,420
And I go, but Minnie Z did.

286
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,380
And I pull out the hobo clown and he's like, this guy is OK.

287
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,780
He's federal overnight.

288
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,820
He's probably got some Torelyza syndrome.

289
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,900
And Koutrego looks at me for a second and I'm thinking I'm done.

290
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,380
I'm fired.

291
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,460
And he breaks into laughter with tears rolling down his face and the whole team is laughing.

292
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
And I'm like, you know what?

293
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,980
I found my path.

294
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,380
It is to it is to try to bring some levity to situations that are disastrous.

295
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,980
And that gave me hope because it could easily have gone the other way.

296
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,420
I've been told things like, hey, you speak and then think you should just reverse that

297
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,620
or better yet, just think.

298
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,220
And attending told me that at UCSF.

299
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,620
So when you and I took USMLE two, so the final exam to graduate from medical school, we were

300
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:23,140
about the last classes to do that before they switched to like live patient actor interactions.

301
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
Is that right?

302
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
We were very close.

303
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,500
We were close because they had just a scant that's right.

304
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Yeah, as did I.

305
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Yeah.

306
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
But then they brought in.

307
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,140
They said, you know, Stanford's going to be one of the test sites for, you know, doing

308
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,660
this whole thing because USMLE two is moving towards half the test being written and half

309
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,500
the test being clinical with actor patients.

310
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,140
You know, we were basically just being asked to do this so they could figure out the kinks

311
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,140
in the system.

312
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,940
So for whatever reason, it was just too long a day.

313
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,900
And I just wasn't really in the mood to deal with these actors and actresses who were annoying

314
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,500
as hell to me.

315
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,820
You know, you'd go in there and you sort of knew what was going on.

316
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,260
You'd ask all the right questions and then they'd give you this scathing feedback.

317
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,700
Like they didn't even know what they were talking about.

318
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
And they just bugged me.

319
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Right.

320
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
But you can picture this, right?

321
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,580
I don't know if you guys can hear me breathing angrily, but this is I had the exact same

322
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
experience.

323
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
Keep going.

324
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,260
So we had to do nine of these in a full day.

325
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,620
Each encounter took 30 minutes, 20 minutes to do the thing, 10 minutes to get the feedback.

326
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,380
I do a really honest to good job for the first eight.

327
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,980
I really I'm trying as hard as I can.

328
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm doing the best I can.

329
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,180
I'm taking my beatings.

330
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,420
We're going into the last one and I just lose it.

331
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,540
I can't do it.

332
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,260
And so I pull the chart out of the medical thing and it says you're seeing Mrs. Smith

333
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,860
and Mrs. Smith is here to talk about her daughter, Susie, who is wedding the bed at night.

334
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,100
That's all the information you have.

335
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,620
So you got to go in and now play the pediatrician or whatever.

336
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,100
So I walk in and I say, hello, Mrs. Smith.

337
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,300
And she looks at me kind of funny and she says, hi.

338
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,580
And I said, my name is Dr. Evil.

339
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,620
I went to evil medical school and she's OK.

340
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,060
Well Susie is some and she starts talking about Susie.

341
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,900
And I said, I don't really want to hear about the details of Susie's life.

342
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,180
Let me tell you about the details of my life.

343
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,980
And then I do the entire monologue from Austin Powers.

344
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,860
They are quite inconsequential ending with a zerostrian in Vilma ritualistically shaved

345
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
my testicles.

346
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,140
And as a zerostrian, you can appreciate this close to home.

347
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,260
And I keep going and then all of a sudden the door like basically breaks down because

348
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,580
they're videotaping this whole thing, which I knew that this was happening.

349
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,740
And they get so pissed.

350
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
They run and they go.

351
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
This is over.

352
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,180
This is absolutely done.

353
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,620
It is totally inappropriate what you just said.

354
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,140
And I said, I said testicles.

355
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,780
I said, shorn testicles.

356
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,900
That's a medical term.

357
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,460
That's completely legitimate.

358
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,100
Did you tell them, have you ever experienced shorn testicles?

359
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
It's quite exhilarating.

360
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I suggest you try it.

361
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,780
I suggest you try it.

362
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,860
So I got the boot.

363
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,340
It was a huge deal.

364
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,460
They basically dragged me out of there.

365
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,260
That is the most amazing thing I've ever heard in my life.

366
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:15,540
I am so proud of you, Peter, Attia, as your superior officer in school, because I thought

367
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,700
that those patient actor things were the stupidest bullshit.

368
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
And well, okay, this is what they do.

369
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
This is what they tell you.

370
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
You know what?

371
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
You need to have empathy.

372
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
You need to be able to read people.

373
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,660
You need to be able to see through lies and get to the heart of what's going on.

374
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
So what do they do?

375
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,180
They put you in a room with a professional liar.

376
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,980
And when you see through it, when you see it for what it is, which is zeros and ones,

377
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,780
you go, this person's faking it.

378
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
How can I show empathy to someone who's pretending?

379
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
You want me to pretend?

380
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
I can become a liar too.

381
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,740
And so I did the same thing.

382
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,820
I went in the room, hands in my pockets like this.

383
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,500
The woman had fake bruises on her face.

384
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,400
She was supposed to pretend to be abused.

385
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,800
And my first reaction was, how dare you pretend?

386
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,540
How dare you mock people who've actually been abused?

387
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,060
You're doing a shitty job of it.

388
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,620
You're not a great actress.

389
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,780
And I'm being judged on how I pretend.

390
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,780
Right.

391
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
Like, this is horrible.

392
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,860
Give me a real patient.

393
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,700
So did you pass?

394
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,820
Well, it didn't matter because it was right.

395
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,260
We were being used as a trial site.

396
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,580
So the next day I get a page.

397
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,100
It was back when we used to carry those alphanumeric, not even the alphanumeric pages, just the

398
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,580
straight numeric pager.

399
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,860
And it's the dean's office.

400
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,020
And I'm like, you've got to be freaking kidding me.

401
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,700
It's like a month before graduation.

402
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,700
So I call and it's like, hi, this is Peter Attia returning a page.

403
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,100
And they said, oh, Dean so-and-so wants to speak with you, wait a moment on the line.

404
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,160
And I'm like, god damn it.

405
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,180
So I just get all defensive.

406
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,300
So he gets on the phone and he goes, hi, Peter.

407
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,140
And I'm like, Dr. so-and-so, look, before you say it, I just want to say one thing.

408
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,460
This was totally ridiculous.

409
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,580
And I go off on like a four minute rant about how idiotic the whole process was.

410
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,300
And he goes, well, look, I just want to say I watched it last night and I thought it was

411
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
hilarious.

412
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,180
And I really think you should question whether or not you should be at least incorporating

413
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,200
some of that into your career.

414
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,100
So I just wanted to call you to say good job.

415
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,980
You know, and I was like, that is fantastic.

416
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
That's like the highlight of my medical school.

417
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,500
There is hope in the universe, Peter Attia.

418
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,060
I had a similar experience at UCSF when I did a graduation speech that actually launched

419
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,540
my whole career as e-dog MD because I later put it on YouTube.

420
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,660
It's in my 1999 UCSF graduation speech.

421
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
It's there.

422
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,660
It's all captioned and everything.

423
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,220
And I just went through it as I saw it.

424
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,980
And it was all just like, this is bullshit.

425
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
This is bullshit.

426
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
This is bullshit.

427
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
This is why.

428
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
This is bullshit.

429
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
It's about actually connecting with our patients, isn't it?

430
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,860
And the majority of the faculty behind me were just like stone faced for 90% of it and

431
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,860
then finally start to crack.

432
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,140
And you see Michael Bishop, who's like a Nobel Prize winner, finally he's like, and afterwards

433
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,660
they were like, that was very well done.

434
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,980
But there was one guy who was like, that kid shouldn't be allowed to graduate and actually

435
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,100
was lobbying to have my graduation revoked for giving that speech.

436
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,820
I mean, so this is the thing.

437
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,340
It's a hierarchy.

438
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,940
And I can tell you don't like hierarchies so much.

439
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,500
I probably have more respect for it than you actually.

440
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Being a surgeon.

441
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,100
Yeah, I don't.

442
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I don't know.

443
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,580
I feel like I'm not as I don't bristle as much at it is probably some people.

444
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,780
I mean, I would say for a surgical resident.

445
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,780
I respected it much less than the other residents and I definitely got into trouble on a few

446
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,340
occasions as a result of it.

447
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,700
I've met people who completely have absolutely disregard for any hierarchy and many of them

448
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,940
go on just to the most amazing things.

449
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,420
So I always felt like I wish I had less respect for it.

450
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,860
Well, you know, it's a complex thing because I think certain personality types don't like

451
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,260
to be in the middle or bottom of hierarchies.

452
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,220
They either want to be on the top or they want to be off the hierarchy.

453
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,820
It's hard for them to feel like other people are controlling them or their beholden to

454
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,940
others in the higher hierarchy.

455
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,700
And they either have a tendency to dominate those underneath or to treat them as equals

456
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
inappropriately.

457
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,620
In which case the lower down in the hierarchy don't have the competence and what they need

458
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,420
is actually to be trained and lifted and supported.

459
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,740
And instead it's like, why aren't you at the level that I'm asking you to be?

460
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
And so it's interesting.

461
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,140
It becomes tough in the higher echelons of performance and stuff.

462
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,100
I think the problem I had in residency was I really loved hierarchy when I could respect

463
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,300
the person I was reporting to.

464
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,460
So luckily I did my residency at a hospital where most of the residents were just exceptional.

465
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,340
So it for the most part was really easy to respect the hierarchy.

466
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,100
But the problem was when I encountered somebody and I didn't think that they were good enough

467
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,180
or smart enough or new enough, I wouldn't hesitate to just steamroll them.

468
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,940
And that gets you into a lot of trouble.

469
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,380
I saw that in you when you were a medical student.

470
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
I remember it.

471
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,100
It was one of your characteristics that I actually respected a lot.

472
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,180
Because again, like you said, you kind of described our team pretty well.

473
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,620
The person at the top was fairly narcissistic.

474
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,860
The one in the middle was kind of a non-entity.

475
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,780
Then there was me who was the class clown.

476
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,180
And then there was you.

477
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:48,500
And it speaks to our medical training in general that it really is about kissing the ring of

478
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
the authority figure.

479
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,220
So one day you will be the ring that's kissed.

480
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,740
That's the majority of our training.

481
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,900
The first two years we're fed a bunch of information, 50% of which is wrong.

482
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
But they don't tell us which 50%.

483
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,740
And then the 50% of the residual will be outdated by the time you finish.

484
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Exactly.

485
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,820
So it's 100% bullshit.

486
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,180
And yet we're expected to kind of suck it all in and regurgitate it with respect for

487
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,180
this hierarchy.

488
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
And we don't ask questions.

489
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,940
We don't step out of that.

490
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
And you're right.

491
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,020
You have to respect your authority figures, which is important when you trust and respect

492
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
them.

493
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,140
But when you're questioning things like, why are we doing this?

494
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,220
Why are we giving Lasix to this person?

495
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
What's going on with this renal failure?

496
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,260
What about the root cause of that?

497
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,140
You start asking this question, no, no, no, no, no.

498
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
That's when I was told, hey, you speak then think.

499
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
You should reverse that.

500
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,780
They don't want to hear that from a medical student.

501
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,380
And we had the short white coats and everything.

502
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,500
You guys said the long white coats.

503
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It wasn't as hierarchical.

504
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
It was very unusual.

505
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Yeah.

506
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,660
I didn't realize how quote unquote special that was until I saw that there were many

507
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,700
programs where even the interns were still in short white coats.

508
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,300
And I didn't realize what a big deal that was.

509
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,980
How much obsessing went into the white coat thing.

510
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,540
I feel like an idiot even just voicing this right now because I've never thought about

511
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,380
this for like 20 years.

512
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,100
But what a big deal that white coat is.

513
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
And I feel bad.

514
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,340
Maybe I should be more respectful of the white coat.

515
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,660
You know, when I came from UCSF, nobody wore a long white coat except for fellows and attendings.

516
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,580
So even the residents wore short white coats.

517
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,860
I think Hopkins was that way.

518
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,220
They're just starting to change it.

519
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,740
When I came to Stanford, I saw you wearing a long white coat and my conditioned unconscious

520
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,300
wanted to smack you.

521
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Like how?

522
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,140
You haven't earned it.

523
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,540
I haven't earned the long white coat I'm wearing as a R1 as an intern.

524
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,060
It's such an interesting process.

525
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,180
It's almost militaristic.

526
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,740
It's a very military hierarchy.

527
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,380
And the question is, is that good?

528
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,060
Do we need that?

529
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,300
I think some degree of organization hierarchy is important when people's lives are on the

530
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
line. Same within the military.

531
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,140
Right.

532
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,180
You're friends with Jocko Willink and these guys.

533
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,580
I mean, what would he say about this?

534
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,460
I don't know.

535
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,500
I'd hate to speak for anybody, especially Jocko.

536
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:54,420
But the challenge comes when you have to make a decision that is probably not the best decision for the

537
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,540
patient, but it's the one that's coming down from the person just above you.

538
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,660
And I always found the stickiest situations were.

539
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,900
And I had an example and I want to be very careful.

540
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,780
I don't reveal too much because this was such a vivid example of my residency.

541
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,380
But there was a time in my residency when I was an intern and it was a small surgical service.

542
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,060
So it was me and a chief resident only.

543
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,500
So you didn't have all like the 17 layers.

544
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,940
So it was, you know, you basically had attending fellow chief resident intern.

545
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,260
So there was only four people in the chain of command.

546
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,900
And there was a situation that was in my mind, clearly a case of someone that needed to go to the

547
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,540
operating room.

548
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,940
I don't think you even needed to be a physician to know that this person needed to go to the

549
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,460
operating room.

550
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,700
I think if you walked into McDonald's and just polled 100 people there, 97 would say,

551
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,020
yep, that's a surgical case.

552
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,780
Yeah. The third would be like, I want extra.

553
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,500
The other three, I missed some finer detail.

554
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,620
So I called the chief resident and this was a weekend that I was on call and I said to him,

555
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,940
hey, I got this case and, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

556
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
It needs to go to the OR.

557
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,540
And he was like, just deal with it yourself.

558
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,340
And I said, look, I know you're upset at me.

559
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,700
I've already called you twice today.

560
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,860
This was 8 p.m.

561
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,580
And I had already called him twice on the Sunday and he had had to come in both times

562
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,380
because of the injuries were so severe that I was calling him about that they had to be taken to the OR.

563
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,300
So he'd already been to the OR twice that day.

564
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,140
It's a Sunday.

565
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,740
He's pissed.

566
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,460
It's his day off.

567
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,460
So now I'm calling him at 8 a.m.

568
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,140
or 8 p.m.

569
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,260
to say this is a surgical case.

570
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,740
He's saying you fix it yourself.

571
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,940
I'm saying, look, I technically could address this in the ER, but that's not the best thing to do.

572
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,100
And he was like, stop being such a fucking pussy.

573
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,060
So this is your attending.

574
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,260
No, no, this was the chief resident.

575
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,740
Chief resident.

576
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,420
This is the chief resident.

577
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,100
Yes.

578
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,340
Yeah.

579
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:51,020
So again, I don't want to get into details of it because it could kind of give away the identity of any of the people involved.

580
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,220
In the end, I did deal with it in the ER and I dealt with it the best I could.

581
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,780
Admitted the patient the next day.

582
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,180
Everyone's rounding and they see the patient and they're like, God, how did this not go to the OR?

583
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:19,060
So what I realized in that moment, and I was very early in my internship, I mean days into my internship, actually, what I realized was the mistake I made was I didn't call the attending directly.

584
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,980
Go right above.

585
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,220
Yeah.

586
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,620
Again, it was so obvious that this chief resident was wrong.

587
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,140
It's so obvious he was being a lazy sack of shit.

588
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,180
So I should have just called the attending.

589
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,460
Now at the time, that wouldn't even occur to me.

590
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,220
I mean, that's like, but you can't break the chain of command.

591
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:49,020
But I look back at that and I view that as probably certainly one of probably my five biggest failures in residency was the weakness, the inability to break that chain of command and deal with the consequences of it because there would have been consequences of that.

592
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,580
Even though it was the right thing to do.

593
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:57,060
And even though that patient would have gotten much better care, I would have paid an enormous price for that through the duration of my residency, at least in that era.

594
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,020
And I don't know.

595
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,940
I feel like in some ways I was just a coward.

596
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
You know, or deer and headlights.

597
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,260
I just didn't know what to do.

598
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,820
So I thought, okay, I'll do the best I can.

599
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,380
You know what?

600
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,220
I want to dig into that because this story is at the center of what we're now calling burnout.

601
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,860
And I don't think it's burnout.

602
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,300
I think it's moral injury.

603
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,820
And Talbot and Dean and others have written about this in stat and other places.

604
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:25,460
You were in a position where all the system was arrayed to make it very difficult for you to do the right thing for the patient.

605
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
You knew it was the right thing.

606
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,580
You knew the patient needed to have this done.

607
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,060
And you knew that it would cause serious consequences to you to have it done.

608
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:40,580
And you erred on the side of, okay, well, maybe the system is this way for a reason and it'll be okay in the morning and it may not have been.

609
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:49,660
And then you had to live with the shame and the guilt of not having done something that was self-destructive, that was not in your best interest to help this other person.

610
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,820
And to this day, I can tell sitting across the table from you that this bothers you deeply.

611
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,860
You're saying it's one of five things.

612
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:11,700
It bothered me so much that for at least 12, 15 years after I would contemplate asking one of my friends who was still at Hopkins, you know, by this point now, a few of my friends who had finished were still attendings at Hopkins.

613
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:19,900
I had contemplated asking them to dig through the medical records to find out what happened to that patient because I couldn't remember the patient's name, but I remembered the date.

614
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,580
So I was going to say, hey, go back to this date and look at everyone that came in the ER on that day and I will be able to figure out which this person is.

615
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,580
I want to know what this person is doing today.

616
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,380
And I kid you not.

617
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,140
This is actually a really funny story.

618
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,300
I mean, funny in this, this one twist.

619
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,700
I know you're a huge fan of Dr.

620
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,340
Oz, right?

621
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,980
Massive.

622
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,460
Love him.

623
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:40,740
Yeah.

624
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,020
So glad you were on his show, by the way.

625
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,300
Right.

626
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:49,780
So I was on that show and a little embarrassed, truthfully, because I felt silly and I didn't think it made sense for me to be on, but nevertheless, I was on.

627
00:29:50,340 --> 00:30:01,180
And I didn't know when it actually aired, but when it aired, I heard from the patient's mother who was also there.

628
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,700
And to make it very long story short, it reconnected me with the patient who was doing exceptionally well.

629
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,260
And it was, you know, in a way, maybe it's wrong that I could alleviate some of the guilt by knowing that the patient turned out okay.

630
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:20,380
But it was unbelievable because even this patient said they'd never watched this show before, this Dr.

631
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,780
Oz show.

632
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,380
They just happened to be in the waiting room.

633
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,660
I don't know, getting their car fixed or something.

634
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,740
And they saw it on TV and they're like, Hey, I know that dude.

635
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,860
That patient recognized you across the years.

636
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah.

637
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,340
This would have been 15 year Delta and then connected with me through my blog or something like that.

638
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,700
Really?

639
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,740
We have to let that sink in that at the heart of all of this and you're, you know, listen, you're an amazing scientist.

640
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,500
Your podcast is unbelievable.

641
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,420
Like I listened to it.

642
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,100
I'm enthralled by it because I'm also a huge nerd.

643
00:30:48,860 --> 00:31:06,020
But the fact is that was a human connection that you made that also was a victim of a system that was so broken that it caused you moral distress that lasted for years and was only partially ameliorated by reconnecting with that human at the center of that.

644
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:14,540
Now let's take that that you suffered and scale it by a thousand times every single day when we have to take care of patients.

645
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,340
We know full well what needs to be done.

646
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,020
We know where the fuck ups are and where things have gone wrong and where our system has failed and we have powerless, not only powerless.

647
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,500
If we do the right thing, we will lose money.

648
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,300
We will lose time with our family.

649
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,860
We'll be charting all night and still may not work for the patient.

650
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,420
Now, for my listeners who aren't as familiar with this stuff, help me understand what that means.

651
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,340
So you trained in internal medicine when you finished at Stanford.

652
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,660
What was the first job you took as an attending?

653
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,180
So I'll be honest with you about your two of my residency.

654
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,380
I wanted to do GI because I was always intellectually interested in your dad is a gastroenterologist.

655
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,460
He's actually a primary care doc who also trained in pulmonary.

656
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,540
Oh, but I just for some reason, I always love GI physiology, love hepatology.

657
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,140
I love the way that digestion works and the mind body gut connection.

658
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,980
I thought was fascinating.

659
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:10,180
Like I loved irritable bowel syndrome because I thought how interesting that the mind can influence what we sense in our in our gut when we get butterflies and that kind of thing.

660
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,100
So second year, though, I did the rotation, had a terrible mentor.

661
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,140
It was just scoping routinely doing colonoscopies and E.G.D.s.

662
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,820
And it was horrible.

663
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:31,020
The idea that that could scale for a career was mind numbing because when I hear someone saying I want to go into GI, I assume they mean they want to be a they want to do scopes because that's the most lucrative part of GI.

664
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,340
Right.

665
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,300
But you were more interested in like the medical part of GI.

666
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,500
I like the medical part of it.

667
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,140
And even hepatology was a little too much, but I wanted to scope that was cool.

668
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,780
That was video games in people's buttocks.

669
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,660
Awesome.

670
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,180
Great.

671
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,980
But I like talking to patients.

672
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:52,020
I like the relationship and I like the physiology of it, talking to people about their issues because abdominal pain, chronic abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting.

673
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,060
A lot of times these are these are deeply connected to the mindset.

674
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,620
And so that's what I love.

675
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,460
But then when I saw the scoping part of it, I was like, I hate this.

676
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,220
I hate it.

677
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,940
And this is most of how I make a living.

678
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,260
It was repetitive, mindless to me.

679
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,580
It didn't sit with me.

680
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,740
Plus I was starting to get disillusioned in general with medicine because most of what we did seemed like bullshit.

681
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,980
Most of what we did either harm people or just wasn't thought out.

682
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,260
You know, it's half baked.

683
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,500
And the thing is that caused the kind of moral distress.

684
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,260
So I was like, forget it.

685
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,020
I was burned out.

686
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,500
I was tired.

687
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:29,620
So by third year, I remember my program director had to pull me in and he's like, you're a bad influence on the interns.

688
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,500
It's one thing to be burned out and tired.

689
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,420
It's another thing to model that for the younger.

690
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,700
And it changed me totally.

691
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,980
Then I became this great teacher and got focused on that as a way to have self-worth.

692
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,100
And what were you doing to be at a bad start chasm or like had the humor gone too far?

693
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,900
Like what was it?

694
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,180
The humor got very dark.

695
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,460
It became more of a wall than a coping mechanism.

696
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,540
So it was more like, how can I mentally victimize everyone around me by throwing blame to build a wall around myself?

697
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,660
The fact that I feel morally bereft doing this job.

698
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,260
So, you know, calling patients, Gomorrs, you know, this slang that we use.

699
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,340
What does it stand for again?

700
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,740
It stands for get out of my ER.

701
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,540
It comes from the book House of God.

702
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:06,860
Yes.

703
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,260
And so I would use every very...

704
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,100
I haven't heard that in like the longest time.

705
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Because it's a horrible thing.

706
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,580
Residency.

707
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,900
Yeah.

708
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,820
But we heard it all the time.

709
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,580
I just had forgotten what it was.

710
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,540
Not only did you hear it all the time.

711
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,660
I had conjugated every form of that verse.

712
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,060
So I was like, that guy's Gommed out.

713
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,140
He's in status Gomaticus.

714
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,980
You know, this guy's preparing to Gom.

715
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,420
He's like proto Gom.

716
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,220
He's got serious Gomopathy.

717
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,580
Like every version of Gomor I could use.

718
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:35,420
And it came from this black hole in my center where it was like, I'm a bad person.

719
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:35,700
Right.

720
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
I'm a worthless poor...

721
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,220
And that's burnout.

722
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,860
But it's really moral injury.

723
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,420
So because of that, I decided I was taking...

724
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,180
I told our program director Kelly Skeff.

725
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,460
He knows the story I've told publicly.

726
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,860
I said, Kelly, I can't.

727
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,540
No, I'm not going to match.

728
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,380
I'm not going to do a fellowship and I'm not going to practice medicine.

729
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,380
I'm going to go into tech because I'm in the Silicon Valley.

730
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,020
I'm going to work for a couple startups and see what happens.

731
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,860
And I did that for a year.

732
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,460
And in that year, I learned a lot about myself.

733
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,820
I learned that without that stimulation of that deep relationship, like money as a

734
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,140
stimulus was never going to cut it for me, which I wanted it to, Peter.

735
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,460
I wanted to be rich.

736
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,260
It couldn't happen.

737
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,380
I was doing well.

738
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,820
I was moving up in these companies and then I just felt empty.

739
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,540
So my buddy John offered said, hey, there's this hospitalistic gig at Stanford.

740
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,740
You should take it.

741
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,500
It's all your colleagues from residency.

742
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,460
We're doing this cool stuff.

743
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:22,940
It's great.

744
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,620
And I said, I'll try it for a couple of months.

745
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,940
I was there for nine years.

746
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,620
And that was the first real medical job.

747
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,140
I was moonlighting and I loved it, but this was it.

748
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,940
And being able to spend time with patients when they're acutely sick in the worst day

749
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,860
of their life, in the hospital, sitting with them, spending time.

750
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,980
It was before the EHR, the electronic health record kind of destroyed our

751
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,180
ability to make eye contact.

752
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,780
And it was beautiful, man.

753
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,220
I kept a diary because I was weird in those days.

754
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,940
I was like 30 and I was like, this, I'm blessed.

755
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,660
Like who gets to do this?

756
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,420
Like I found my perfect niche and it lasted probably four years before things started to change.

757
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,220
So then what changed four years into that nine year stint?

758
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,020
I think what changed is what's been changing in medicine across the board, which is the

759
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,820
creep of medicine as business, medicine as assembly line, medicine as processed to be

760
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,940
improved, not medicine as deep human relationship.

761
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,980
That's a sacred calling.

762
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,020
So what ended up happening is the EHR goes live, productivity.

763
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,980
We start to lose house resident support.

764
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,380
So we're more, they're expecting us to just see a bunch of patients to generate revenue.

765
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,780
And it's not so much about teaching.

766
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,900
It's not so much about mentorship.

767
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,980
It's not so much about a team.

768
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,380
What I love about the hospital, you go through, hey, Bob, how are you doing?

769
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,060
Social workers there, case managers there.

770
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,420
We know everybody, RTs, and they're all supporting each other.

771
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,540
It's not hierarchical.

772
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,500
It's like whole arcacle.

773
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,460
Everybody brings their thing that started to disappear with the pressure of click, click,

774
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:36,660
click.

775
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,260
Then I was going home and charting at home.

776
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,780
And then I had my daughter, my first daughter in 2007.

777
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,820
And that was a tipping point where I was like, I'm treating my daughter like, you know, my

778
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,140
burnout is expressing in how I'm treating my daughter.

779
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,260
And I can't spend time with her.

780
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,300
I can't read her stories at night.

781
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm thinking about clicking these boxes in Epic.

782
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,340
And I haven't finished this note.

783
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,100
And did I remember to check the potassium on that guy?

784
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,300
And I, you know, I'm the type of guy can't just sign it out.

785
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,180
I have to like, I own it too much.

786
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,260
So it just got horrible.

787
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,540
And I started being nasty and like my relationships were suffering.

788
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,620
And, you know, what did your wife think at the time?

789
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,580
So she was a radiologist, academic radiologist at Stanford.

790
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,740
So she found a path that was really perfect for her.

791
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,780
Introvert, very science minded, loved the team dynamic of it.

792
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,060
She looked at me and was like, you're in a bad.

793
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,500
Did you guys meet at UCSF?

794
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,060
We met at Stanford as interns the year that I met you.

795
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,900
She did all of medicine and then came to an epiphany.

796
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,420
Don't like medicine.

797
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,980
Parents were really into medicine.

798
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
Both were medical people.

799
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,260
She's like, they didn't see radiology as a real doctor.

800
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,620
You know, Chinese parents, it's a lot of pressure.

801
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,740
So she's like, you know what, I'm not going to specialize in pulmonary critical care.

802
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,500
I'm going to go back and do chest radiology.

803
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,060
And Zubin, you're going to support me, by the way, for four years, if more

804
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,100
residency and fellowship.

805
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,140
And I was like, all right.

806
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,500
And so when that table turned and I was miserable and depressed, she was the first

807
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,900
to say, you know, because we had gotten this.

808
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,780
I mean, that's another story.

809
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
We started making videos, putting them online and Tony Shea, the CEO of Zappos,

810
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,620
reached out. But before that, she was like, what can we do for you?

811
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,820
Do you want to just stop working?

812
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,220
I'll go up to full time.

813
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,020
She was 80 percent and you can just stop working.

814
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,620
We won't have a ton of money, but we'll in the Bay Area, you're poor no matter what

815
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,140
you do. And that and I was like, I don't know.

816
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,620
I don't know.

817
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,580
And this is how long after 07?

818
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,700
This would have been 08.

819
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,340
OK, so your daughter's a year old.

820
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,940
She's one. And then by 09, what had happened was we went to visit.

821
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:35,260
So Tony Shea went to Harvard with my wife and Tony Shea built Zappos and then sold

822
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,220
it to Amazon for like a billion dollars and just wrote a book called Delivering

823
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,860
Happiness became this national sort of thought leader in the space.

824
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,580
We went to visit him for Thanksgiving.

825
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,540
He's having a bunch of friends over.

826
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,460
So he does this thing that Tony does.

827
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,420
You know Tony as well.

828
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,460
We all kind of roll in the same circles and he kind of looks at me and he's like, so

829
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,140
are you happy doing what you're doing as a doctor?

830
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,220
It sounds really amazing.

831
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,260
And I looked at him and I'm like, absolutely not.

832
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,380
Absolutely not. And to see you living this life where you're doing what you love and

833
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,340
you're financially successful and you're affecting people's lives and people come up to

834
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,460
them in restaurants going, you changed my life with your book and this and that.

835
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,260
I'm like, it was a mix of jealousy, like deep jealousy.

836
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,700
Like how can someone be so connected and me feel so isolated?

837
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,460
And self hatred.

838
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,020
Yeah. Because it wasn't the money.

839
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,580
You certainly saw money everywhere in the Silicon Valley.

840
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,860
I remember one of the things in Tony's book that I liked so much.

841
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,380
They paid you to quit after a period of time, right?

842
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,420
Was it three months in?

843
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,700
Three months in, they give you twenty five hundred bucks to just go away.

844
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,300
To just walk away.

845
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,380
Yeah. I love that.

846
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,980
And if you walked away, then you weren't really a good fit.

847
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,060
They were happy to pay the money.

848
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,340
That's a Zappos culture in Tony.

849
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,100
Oh my God.

850
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,580
It's amazing.

851
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,140
Brilliant.

852
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,420
Imagine if we did that in health care.

853
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,260
Give somebody it'd have to be like a hundred thousand dollars.

854
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,180
OK. Quit now.

855
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,460
And if you're still with it, it means that you're doing this because there's

856
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,020
nothing else in the world you'd rather do.

857
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,420
And that's what I tell medical students, you know, like, whoa, should I go into it?

858
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:51,820
I don't know.

859
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Is there if there's anything else you'd rather do?

860
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,220
Do it first.

861
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,620
If there isn't, then this is your path because it is hard, but it is a sacred

862
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,780
calling and you'll feel it and you'll feel it.

863
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,380
So you had that discussion over Thanksgiving with Tony and then what?

864
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,420
I've never been so depressed in my life because I went back to Stanford.

865
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,260
It's winter.

866
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,860
You know, winter is in medicine wards.

867
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,220
Every single old person with pneumonia tries to die in the hospital.

868
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,860
It's gloomy.

869
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,500
The residents are stressed.

870
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,580
They're midway through.

871
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,780
I'm supervising an intern who is a young lady who I remember was such a wonderful

872
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,060
human being, but she was stressed and I was stressed and we're looking at each

873
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,860
other like how do we help each other get through this?

874
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,420
Because it was just she and I because they peeled back our support from a big

875
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,780
team to just one intern, one attending.

876
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,380
So I'm an Uber mentor.

877
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,340
I'm resident attending second year.

878
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,020
Sub-i, everybody in one.

879
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,100
I would literally cry in the shower so that the wife wouldn't know that I was

880
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,340
crying and you know, and it's funny because I talked about some of this in the

881
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,660
TED talk where we met again.

882
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,260
So super burned out.

883
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,740
But Tony had, and this is why I think it's so important to have mentors that

884
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,660
matter. Tony told me, so if you had one thing you could do that was in that visit,

885
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,420
what would you do?

886
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,460
And I'm like, dude, like I, I did this speech for graduation.

887
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,220
I felt so connected to the audience.

888
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,220
I felt like I was revealing truth through humor that could help motivate

889
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,100
people to change stuff.

890
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,740
I would do that for a living.

891
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,860
I would put these videos on YouTube, which was a new thing.

892
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,820
And but I can't because I'll lose my job and it's dumb and no one will watch.

893
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,220
And he's like, you're wrong.

894
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,980
Like, look at this guy, Vaynerchuk.

895
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,340
He's like a wine salesman.

896
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,140
He made a whole living out of this.

897
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,900
Look at, look at this guy who co-founded Dig.

898
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,580
What's his name?

899
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,180
Kevin Rose.

900
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,780
Kevin Rose.

901
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,700
Kevin does this show and I watch the show and I'm like, that's funny and awesome.

902
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,260
So part of my depression was why can't I just get through this inertia to do this

903
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,620
thing?

904
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,140
And when I finally did, when I put my first video on YouTube on my birthday,

905
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,140
basically in 2000 and which one was the first one?

906
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,660
The first one was colon Wars.

907
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,020
And it was a parody of me talking about GI through the lens of Luke

908
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,500
Skywalker going down the trench.

909
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,060
So he's doing a colonoscopy and he's like, stay on target.

910
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,780
I can't hold it.

911
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,540
Stay on target.

912
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,100
You can't do any more good back there.

913
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,060
Why did you pull up, pull up about this whole thing?

914
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,140
And it got a bunch of views and people were like, that's nerdy as fuck.

915
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,860
I like that.

916
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,540
And that's when the depression started to lift.

917
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,140
And then just on the side as this character ZDoggMD, which I created to

918
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,460
cry to make sure Stanford wouldn't fire me.

919
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,220
And the thing is they never even knew because they don't, they weren't on

920
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,700
YouTube.

921
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,300
And so it's more and more videos and more.

922
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,700
And then we did one called manhood in the mirror, which was our first big music

923
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,340
parody.

924
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,540
This is the first one I saw.

925
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,180
Right.

926
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,660
And it's good because I'm grabbing my crotch repeatedly, which is important

927
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,340
for you to see.

928
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
Yeah, very important.

929
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,300
And it was Michael Jackson's man in the mirror, but it was about

930
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,460
testicular self-examine.

931
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,820
I'm checking out my nance in mirror.

932
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,860
I feel my junk for lumps and stuff.

933
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,980
Oh, and it gets a bunch of views and people are playing it in these like

934
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,260
student health clinics on repeat and they're saying, Oh, kids are catching

935
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,260
early testicular tumors.

936
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,300
And I'm like, shit, am I responsible for over diagnosis now?

937
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,060
Are people having their testicles removed that don't need to?

938
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,900
And all this self-blame again, but it woke me up.

939
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,300
So you were still at Stanford when you made that video full time.

940
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,660
Okay.

941
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,140
I didn't realize.

942
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,180
I thought you had already left by then.

943
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,580
No.

944
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,060
So two years at Stanford while making these videos full time until Tony saw

945
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,580
the videos and was like, okay, here's a proposition unplug from that matrix.

946
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,860
Come to downtown Vegas.

947
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,900
We're doing startups here and I'm investing in some things.

948
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,260
Do something that's going to transform medicine.

949
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,900
That's about you and about the community.

950
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,700
And that's when we imagine that conversation with my wife.

951
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,700
Hey, you told me to follow my dreams, honey.

952
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,500
So my dream is we quit this beautiful Bay Area lifestyle and we moved to downtown

953
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,300
Las Vegas, which is currently a demilitarized zone for this pipe dream of

954
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,180
starting a clinic.

955
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,820
And it's a little warmer than Palo Alto in the summer.

956
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,420
Vaguely.

957
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,540
Yeah, vaguely and very different.

958
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,940
And did she bristle or was she all in?

959
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,060
You know, it was crazy.

960
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,540
I was the one who bristle.

961
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,900
I was like, that's dumb.

962
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,980
I can't do that.

963
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,780
And she was like, listen, this is your chance.

964
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,860
You gave me a chance for four years to pursue what I cared about.

965
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,140
Now's my chance to pay you back.

966
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,180
We'll go.

967
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,020
We'll give it a shot.

968
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,060
And if it doesn't work, no problem.

969
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,620
We'll come back and who cares.

970
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,900
And if it does work, then great.

971
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,380
So she was the one who pushed me.

972
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,020
I mean, without being married to the right person, I think so much the biggest

973
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,140
decision you can make in your life is who you partner with.

974
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,700
I mean, I agree completely.

975
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,540
And my decision to leave medicine, that was a hard decision to make.

976
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,060
You know, when you're two years left in your 200 year residency and I was like,

977
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,140
yeah, I don't want to do this anymore.

978
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:26,220
But actually my wife helped me see that because she said you are so miserable.

979
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,700
Why are you so miserable?

980
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,740
And I gave her 12 reasons.

981
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,180
You know, she sat on it for a few days and then she said, I know you enough.

982
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,020
We hadn't been married that long, maybe a year.

983
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,220
And she said, but I know you enough to know that there's only two

984
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,980
ways you're going to get better.

985
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,340
You either have to fix those 12 things on that list or you have to leave.

986
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,940
And I thought about that for a few days, probably for a few months, actually.

987
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,220
Cause this would have been the, yeah, August of that year.

988
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,660
So when did you guys get married?

989
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,900
We got married in 04.

990
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,780
So this is now summer of 05.

991
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,380
So I'm really thinking this isn't for me, you know, reasons X, Y, and Z.

992
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,420
Like it would be, I mean, I loved the operating part.

993
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,700
It was just, there were too many things about the system.

994
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,780
I couldn't stand.

995
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,500
So then I came to that really hard decision, but I thought her

996
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,860
framework was the right framework, which was it would be great to stay if I could

997
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,260
fix all of these things, but I can't.

998
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,460
So I probably need to go.

999
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,580
And so that was the decision to go.

1000
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,020
Now I didn't know what go meant.

1001
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:31,220
I didn't know if it meant go into another specialty, leave medicine altogether, go

1002
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,540
into the lab full-time and cause I had just come back from NIH where I had

1003
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,460
spent two years in the lab.

1004
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,140
So all of these options were spinning through my mind, which was, look, maybe

1005
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,140
I'll just get a PhD and just full-time do research or go and do this or go and do

1006
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,780
that. I mean, it's funny.

1007
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,620
I found it recently.

1008
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,900
I found the document that I made.

1009
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,060
This is how nerdy I was.

1010
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:55,080
I put a table together in word and I had all of the things that I was

1011
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,760
considering doing with my life and the pros and the cons and the optionality

1012
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,240
triggers. And if you do this, it'll cut you out of this.

1013
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,160
But if you do this, you might be able to then pivot and do this.

1014
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,400
Like it was this whole thing.

1015
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:07,960
Wow.

1016
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,840
Engineer mindset.

1017
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,640
That's amazing.

1018
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,040
See, we're so different that way because I was like, let me throw some feces and

1019
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,880
see where it sticks.

1020
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,520
Oh, it sticks there.

1021
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:14,800
All right.

1022
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,080
I'm going to leave medicine.

1023
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,720
So for you, it was thought out, but it was prompted by your wife in a way.

1024
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,600
Did you feel like you needed permission from your wife?

1025
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,040
I think so because people often say to me when they find out, I

1026
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,680
left before finishing at Hopkins, they said, you must have really hated Hopkins.

1027
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,320
And the answer is not at all.

1028
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,320
I freaking loved that place.

1029
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,320
In many ways, it was it's hard to say one of the best chapters of my life because I

1030
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
feel like I've been really lucky.

1031
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,840
I think the only really shitty chapter of my life was college.

1032
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,320
But medical school was an incredible chapter.

1033
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,360
Residency was an incredible chapter.

1034
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,600
You know, work post residency was all of these things have been very enjoyable.

1035
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,040
So, no, the reality of it is like I had amazing friends there who I am still

1036
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,360
incredibly close to.

1037
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,800
Wonderful mentors.

1038
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,120
Obviously, like all hospitals, there are I think 20 percent of the surgeons at

1039
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,000
Hopkins you wouldn't let operate on your cat because they're absolute.

1040
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,760
I mean, assassins.

1041
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,520
It's true everywhere.

1042
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,640
Yeah, yeah, it's true everywhere.

1043
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,880
But you also were surrounded by some of the most skilled, gifted, remarkable

1044
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,560
surgeons and the residents above me, meaning the people that I was trying to

1045
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,320
emulate, these chief residents and senior residents and the fellows.

1046
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,800
I mean, oh my God.

1047
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,200
I mean, some of them were just gods to me.

1048
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,360
And I still keep in touch with most of them.

1049
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,600
Right.

1050
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,160
Many of these people who were like, you know, my heroes are still my heroes in

1051
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,520
a way I actually just ran into one in the Vons like very recently.

1052
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,040
She was my fellow on pediatric surgery when I was an intern and she's now, you

1053
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,040
know, an attending in pediatric surgery in San Diego and we jumped into each other.

1054
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,440
So, and she was, yeah, Vons of all places.

1055
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,200
Did you have your card?

1056
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,160
Because that's important.

1057
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,040
You don't get a discount.

1058
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,640
I just can never remember it.

1059
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,920
So I mooch off my wife's phone number every time.

1060
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,320
That's what I do.

1061
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,560
Yeah.

1062
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:50,760
Same thing.

1063
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,600
In a way, I think I needed permission.

1064
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,400
I think my parents thought it was crazy.

1065
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,720
You're Egyptian.

1066
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,080
Yeah.

1067
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,960
So do you have the classic immigrant parents or were they first

1068
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,640
generation, second generation?

1069
00:47:59,640 --> 00:47:59,840
Yes.

1070
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,160
No, no, no.

1071
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,080
Super classic.

1072
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,800
My mom actually is completely supportive.

1073
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,120
So whatever I do, my mom is, I literally could be a garbage man and she would be

1074
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,960
delighted, but my father was very upset when I finished engineering, turned down

1075
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,760
my scholarships to do the PhDs in engineering and then had to go back and

1076
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
do a post-bac year to go to medical school.

1077
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,320
He was super upset about that.

1078
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,800
Right.

1079
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,880
Because you did that post-bac where you got all the prereqs for medical school.

1080
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,360
What changed your mind from engineering?

1081
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,120
It's a tough story to tell.

1082
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,120
It's hard for me to get into that.

1083
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:27,480
Yeah.

1084
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:27,720
Okay.

1085
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,560
Super emotional.

1086
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,560
In a future.

1087
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,400
Maybe.

1088
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:30,640
Yeah.

1089
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,240
When we're both more woke.

1090
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,640
Yeah.

1091
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,200
Because it's tough.

1092
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,480
There are things I won't talk about and it's because it's so personal and it's a

1093
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,920
thing that I'm still working through.

1094
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,720
We're constantly in this evolving thing.

1095
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,760
You know, and again, our identity as type A kind of crazy driven people, and you

1096
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,040
work with like some of the top performers around the world and you do crazy

1097
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,800
shit like guys, for my fans who don't know Peter, this guy does shit that will

1098
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,720
blow your mind.

1099
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,760
I don't do any shit.

1100
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,720
I don't do anything.

1101
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,040
But how many miles?

1102
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,960
I have in the past, but I don't do anything.

1103
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,600
What's the longest swim you've ever done?

1104
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,720
Pretty 25 miles.

1105
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,480
Oh, just 25 miles.

1106
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:05,720
Yeah.

1107
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,360
But I mean, if you dropped me five miles from shore today, I would pretty much die.

1108
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:11,600
Yeah.

1109
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,800
But you know, because you're evolving to something different every minute, which

1110
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,760
we were talking even before this started just a little bit about our mutual admiration

1111
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,160
for Sam Harris and his idea of the self and how it's an evolving, transient, almost

1112
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,120
illusory thing.

1113
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,520
But so is our identity.

1114
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,160
We the story we tell about ourselves.

1115
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,760
Absolutely.

1116
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,360
So the story of I'm an engineer.

1117
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,400
No, I'm a doctor.

1118
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,160
No, I'm a consultant.

1119
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,360
What's your story now?

1120
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,160
I mean, people who have listened to my podcast sort of know this and I've gotten a

1121
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,720
little bit of grief for it.

1122
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,520
If ever given the choice, meaning if I'm at a party or if I'm somewhere where I'm asked

1123
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,160
what I do, I only have two answers.

1124
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,640
The first is I'm a shepherd and the second is I'm a race car driver.

1125
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,440
And the reason is usually the former, nobody really asks you any more questions.

1126
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:57,840
Right.

1127
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,800
Like I'm a shepherd.

1128
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,280
What do you mean?

1129
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,560
Like, is this a religious thing?

1130
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:00,760
Yeah.

1131
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,480
It's like, no, no, no.

1132
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,200
I mean, it's just like, you know, I tend to sheep and they're like, are there a lot of sheep

1133
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,800
in San Diego?

1134
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,040
Yeah, no, no, there's, I mean, it depends.

1135
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,120
You have to go inland, but yeah.

1136
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,360
And then that's just my way of like, I don't want to talk about it.

1137
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,400
And then with the race car thing, at first they think it's sexy, but then I explained that I'm on

1138
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,200
the formula 2000, like the formula Renault circuit.

1139
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,720
And I can just throw two or three sentences out and they already, the eyes glaze over.

1140
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,760
Nobody would like, if you're not doing NASCAR or Formula One, it's not like they have a

1141
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,680
follow up question.

1142
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,360
So it usually just gets me out of having to talk.

1143
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,960
That's amazing.

1144
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,720
All I would be doing in that conversation.

1145
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,160
And we haven't caught up in a long time.

1146
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,520
Last time I talked to you, you were talking about installing a race car simulator in your

1147
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:36,880
house.

1148
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,760
In fact, I remember it was at that long ago.

1149
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,480
Yeah, I was actually driving back from the track.

1150
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:40,960
That's right.

1151
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1152
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:41,880
That's right.

1153
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,560
And you were so I'd never heard the amount of passion in your voice.

1154
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,080
You were like, this thing is amazing.

1155
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,560
All these buttons and like my wife is a little pissed, but the thing is, it's like amazing.

1156
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,600
And you got to, you got to try this next time.

1157
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,720
And I'm like, who is this guy?

1158
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,840
So now you're actually driving on these circuits.

1159
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,440
Yeah.

1160
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,600
But more importantly, it's just to me, it's like I'm only interested in how well I drive

1161
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,520
versus myself.

1162
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,160
Like I'm not, you know, this is not like something that's going to occupy much space in

1163
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,360
my life beyond just my own obsession with it, like all the other things I obsess over.

1164
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,320
But the point is I don't have a narrative.

1165
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,880
I struggle with all of that stuff.

1166
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,920
You know, even when my kids are asking me now what I do, like, because my daughter's 10, my

1167
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,640
son is four and a half.

1168
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,680
I have a younger son who obviously doesn't ask me anything.

1169
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,400
But yeah, I think they know I'm a doctor.

1170
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,920
I think they know that that's my job, but they don't have a clue what that means.

1171
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,720
And I just say, yeah, it means, you know, you take care of people.

1172
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,280
And my daughter then asks, what kind of doctor are you?

1173
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,160
And that's where I'm like, yeah, I don't.

1174
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,640
I mean, you know, I just I usually change the subject.

1175
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,680
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

1176
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,840
You know, for you, I always see you as this kind of oscillating electron probability cloud

1177
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,160
wave, that what you settle on at any minute can be on how you're observing yourself or what

1178
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,840
you what you're obsessed about at that moment.

1179
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,600
And it's always changing.

1180
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,720
So when people ask you, tell me your story, tell me your narrative, it's almost like when

1181
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,640
they ask me that I get a little insulted.

1182
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,080
I'm like, you can't reduce the cloud that simply.

1183
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,240
It's more complex than that.

1184
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,720
But I think that's true for everybody.

1185
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,640
And that's why I think maybe that's why I find that type of question difficult to answer

1186
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,560
and frustrating.

1187
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,840
And I think it's why like even today I did it.

1188
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,280
The Uber driver who brought me I came from a hotel over here and really nice guy.

1189
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,440
I always love taking Uber in cities that I don't know, because really the only two cities I

1190
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,760
spend a lot of time in San Diego and New York and San Francisco.

1191
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,600
So if I'm in a city like Vegas, I'd love to like, hey, man, where are you from?

1192
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
Did you grow up here?

1193
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,800
No, he'd been here 14 years.

1194
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,920
But blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1195
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,760
So I'm asking him like 30 questions.

1196
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,400
So I now know his life story.

1197
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,280
And then he turns to me and he's like, well, what about you?

1198
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:51,800
Where are you from?

1199
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,400
And I'm like, God damn it.

1200
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,400
How do I get out of this?

1201
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,640
So I'm like, you know, I'm from San Diego.

1202
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,760
What are you doing in town?

1203
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,520
Business or work?

1204
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,640
Now the reality is I'm kind of here to give this talk, but I was like, I'm just here to

1205
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,080
see a buddy.

1206
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,560
Yeah.

1207
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,200
Oh, you still here for the weekend?

1208
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:04,440
Nope.

1209
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,200
Going home tomorrow.

1210
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,040
It was like, you know, and I wasn't rude about it, but I think he could tell what this

1211
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,840
guy's a boring dude.

1212
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,120
Like there's nothing else to ask.

1213
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,640
So I was like, I got to dodge the whole bullet.

1214
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,240
Same thing.

1215
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,480
Cause how do you, you have to tell almost like it's a huge complicated unfolding.

1216
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,680
And he didn't want that.

1217
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,400
I mean, like there is no circumstance.

1218
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Like the other place where I will be equally dodgy is at like the parties of the parents

1219
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,200
at the school where you're with all the other doctors and all that stuff.

1220
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,800
And this is my favorite thing to do is like, I will spend an entire evening talking to

1221
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,200
a group of doctors and like learn everything about what they do and manage to not reveal

1222
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,280
one thing.

1223
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,520
They will think the entire night, this guy, you know, I'll be dressed like this and

1224
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,600
they're all dressed nice.

1225
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,840
And you know, they will think I'm a shepherd or a race car driver.

1226
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,800
That is magical.

1227
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,600
I actually want to hear about what they do.

1228
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,960
And truthfully, I think it's just selfish.

1229
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,200
I mean, if I'm going to be brutally honest, you know what it is?

1230
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,120
I don't learn shit when I'm talking.

1231
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,280
Well, right now I'm not learning anything.

1232
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,960
When the other person is talking, I get to learn and I'm kind of selfish when it comes

1233
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,560
to desiring knowledge.

1234
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:09,960
Yeah.

1235
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,760
So I think the real reason I enjoy being in that setting and hearing what does that doctor

1236
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,960
do and what does she do and what does he do is I'm soaking it up and I don't have to waste

1237
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,160
any of my time hearing myself say the same stupid thing.

1238
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,280
And you and I both read this book, which I have.

1239
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,320
I just happen to have here The Mind Illuminated.

1240
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,800
I was trying to understand myself better, understand meditation better, stop screwing

1241
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,040
around, trying to meditate for five years and just being like, I can't seem to get.

1242
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,320
I actually think I read that on Sam's recommendation two or three years ago.

1243
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,120
Really?

1244
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:38,400
Yeah.

1245
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,000
I discovered it just randomly on Amazon, read it and was transformed in my practice

1246
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,520
because it was, do you remember The Greatest American Hero?

1247
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:51,200
It was a show in the 80s with a guy, this guy, Ralph, he's like an insurance broker or

1248
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,400
something and these aliens come down, find him, give him this suit that's a Superman

1249
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,480
type suit and he gives him superpowers and they give him the.

1250
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,520
I actually do remember this.

1251
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,120
Do you remember this?

1252
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,480
Believe it or not, I'm walking on air and they give him the instruction manual to the

1253
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,480
suit and they go, here's how you use this shit.

1254
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,440
And he's like, cool.

1255
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,360
And he reads it and these bad guys are coming.

1256
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,000
So he learns how to shrink himself down.

1257
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,560
He shrinks himself down with the suit and then he gets himself grown again for gets the

1258
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,160
fucking manual and it's microscopic now and it's gone.

1259
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,200
So he has to figure out how to use this powerful suit all by himself for the rest of the

1260
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,760
season.

1261
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,080
And that's where it's fun.

1262
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,440
Well, that's what it felt like with me for meditation, trying to understand myself and

1263
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,800
my own, what is my narrative and who am I and what's going on.

1264
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,200
Blindly scraping around, trying a little of Harris's meditation and doing a little head

1265
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:39,840
space and doing that.

1266
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,520
Then I got this book and I'm like, it's the goddamn manual for nerds and for type A's who

1267
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,720
want to process.

1268
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,880
And part of what this thing talks about is this sub mind system.

1269
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:55,000
This idea that our mind is really like a boardroom where you're projecting stuff on a

1270
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,640
screen and that's our conscious awareness.

1271
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,040
And what's doing the projecting are these sub minds.

1272
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,200
There is a auditory sub mind projecting sound of visual sub mind protecting vision.

1273
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,880
And then there's a narrating sub mind that ties these things together, integrates them

1274
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,200
and projects them as this sort of integrated picture.

1275
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,960
And that's what tells our story at any given second.

1276
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:20,480
I am a race car driver and a shepherd or I am a former burned out doc who's now trying

1277
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,360
to transform medicine, which is the lie I'm currently telling myself.

1278
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,320
And it's created like a beads on a string in these moments, these slices.

1279
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,240
The liberating thing about that is that at any moment, your next slice could be something

1280
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,280
completely different.

1281
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,120
It's influenced by the momentum of the previous slices, but it is in itself an unknown and

1282
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,240
anything is possible.

1283
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,360
So what got you curious to start exploring this?

1284
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,080
You know what it was?

1285
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,400
It was moving to Las Vegas from the Bay Area, which was what year 11 in 2012.

1286
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,240
Now I'm a type A materialistic high strung.

1287
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,320
I need a house and a car and keep up with the Jones's and my career and so on.

1288
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,480
That's how I'm conditioned.

1289
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,080
And I come here where people like Tony share, like, are you happy?

1290
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,800
Like, are you connected?

1291
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,880
There's this thing called community and relationship.

1292
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm like, these people are hippies.

1293
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,400
They don't know where they go to Burning Man.

1294
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,040
They have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

1295
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,160
And then I had an experience.

1296
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,080
Now, look, I've done psychedelics in college, LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, those kind of things.

1297
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,720
They are transformative drugs.

1298
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,360
But when I was dabbling in them in those days, I didn't have an intent to change myself.

1299
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,680
Something crazy happened.

1300
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,320
I was up in Tony's place and he has a friend who will call the sorceress because that's

1301
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,120
what she called herself.

1302
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,160
She's this former fashion designer and she's like, hey, we're all hanging out.

1303
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,240
You want to smoke some weed?

1304
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,560
And I was like, I haven't done this in months and months and months because I'm an

1305
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,960
upstanding doctor and a father and my kids are taken care of right now.

1306
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,680
Everybody's in bed.

1307
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,040
Sure.

1308
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,360
I ended up smoking a heroic dose like a Terrence McKenna level, heroic dose of weed

1309
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,680
because again, low tolerance, etc.

1310
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:57,920
High.

1311
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:06,720
And it turns out she is very adept as a guide and had known me for a few weeks now and broke.

1312
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,960
She sat down with me and said, this is what I see in you.

1313
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,200
I see a person who's this, this and this and this and this and this.

1314
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,400
And now you're here and you do these videos, but really you're trying to deny that that's an

1315
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,600
important part of who you are because your identity is a doctor.

1316
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:22,280
She goes this whole thing, basically breaks me down, destroys my ego.

1317
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Everything I thought I was dissolved.

1318
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,640
And then she started making.

1319
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,640
And this is with marijuana.

1320
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,600
This is just with weed.

1321
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,640
So interesting.

1322
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,400
I've never liked marijuana.

1323
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,400
I actually can't stand it.

1324
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,080
I can't stand the way it makes me feel.

1325
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,600
So it's hard for me to imagine that that could happen because I don't view it as sort of one of those

1326
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,400
ego dissolving drugs.

1327
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,280
I guess for me, I just would always get paranoid, especially if it was sativa.

1328
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,480
I mean, that would just make me beyond paranoid.

1329
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,920
So this was the most potent sativa you could imagine.

1330
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:58,440
And in my paranoia, which I also get and I also don't love weed in my paranoia came this

1331
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,440
paradoxical dissolution of ego as a protective mechanism.

1332
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,400
So so interesting.

1333
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,760
So you would just you might have gone to a place I'd never been to.

1334
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,480
That's what it was.

1335
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,320
And I'd never been there.

1336
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,120
And with this guide who you know, she's a bikram yoga instructor.

1337
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,400
She you know, something very spiritual about her.

1338
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,160
But in a strange way, I would have thought is woo woo and forget it.

1339
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,200
Crazy, you know, says some very unscientific things, you know.

1340
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:25,080
But as a guide for this triggered me to look at myself and go, what a worthless piece of shit I am.

1341
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,080
Like what a lying fraud and imposter that I am.

1342
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,360
And she starts noticing these things.

1343
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,840
And what happened is a protective mechanism to live with this thing I thought was myself.

1344
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,440
Was to dissolve that thing and realize that wasn't really me at all.

1345
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,840
Like the me is the awareness in which all this arises in moment to moment.

1346
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,280
And I can be something totally different the next day.

1347
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,480
And I should have gratitude for all these amazing connections and things that I have.

1348
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,360
And I tell you, and I thought I told her at the time when I was super high, I said, I'm going to forget all this in the morning.

1349
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,320
But this is transformed crying and all this shit.

1350
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:57,960
Wow.

1351
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,360
And the next morning I woke up and I remembered everything.

1352
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,520
The transformation was still there.

1353
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,680
And over the course of weeks, I had this glow.

1354
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,800
My wife was like, what happened?

1355
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,080
And I told her, I'm like, I've been changed.

1356
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,440
And she actually went and talked to this lady and was like, yeah, she's got something.

1357
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,960
And we're both hardcore scientists, skeptics.

1358
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,280
Right.

1359
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,160
And that change, it decayed over time.

1360
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,240
But and so the ego reasserts itself.

1361
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,240
But I've never been the same.

1362
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:31,160
And that combined with living in the desert of Vegas, which is a blank slate and being told basically reinvent yourself or go out of business, was a personal awakening for me.

1363
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,520
And since then, that got me interested then.

1364
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,160
And I listened.

1365
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,080
Sounds cheesy, but I listened to Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now.

1366
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,920
Just listen to the audiobook and listen to his voice.

1367
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,840
You know, there's nothing but now and consciousness.

1368
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,640
And I'm like, OK, this is bullshit.

1369
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,600
And then about 20 minutes into it, I'm like, yeah, no, yeah, this is amazing.

1370
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,520
Like he's got some truth here in all the woo.

1371
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,240
There's truth.

1372
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,760
And then I started down this path.

1373
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,760
I mean, I have found this to be some of the most insightful, difficult material to digest.

1374
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,800
You know, you and I were joking about this before.

1375
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,640
A lot of things come easily to me in terms of understanding.

1376
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:12,200
I feel very blessed and privileged that, you know, whatever subject I needed to learn in school, like if I decided I wanted to learn something, I could learn it kind of thing.

1377
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:20,920
When it comes to understanding consciousness, when it comes to understanding the nature of my mind, I feel like a complete moron.

1378
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,760
And you could argue, well, everybody struggles with that.

1379
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,640
But it's like, no, no, I feel like I'm three orders of magnitude below the average person in this regard.

1380
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,160
It's very difficult.

1381
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:37,760
And for me, like the biggest breakthroughs have been catching the narrative, catching the self talk.

1382
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,840
That's like that's a huge breakthrough for me.

1383
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,360
I didn't realize how much I talked to myself.

1384
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,720
That was a huge breakthrough.

1385
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,840
And also recognizing the transient nature of emotions.

1386
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,960
Also just an incredible insight, very powerful insight for someone who's so prone to volatile emotions as I am.

1387
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,160
You know, that's funny.

1388
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,360
So I just took a personality test.

1389
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,080
I scored off the charts in volatility and in withdrawal, which is another aspect of neuroticism.

1390
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:17,080
And I think and again, I don't want to I can't put myself in your mind, but kind of knowing you the way I do, the people who are very good at learning and are very good thinkers have these sub minds that are very loud.

1391
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,680
They're always pitching you ideas.

1392
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,160
It's like being in an elevator with the most obnoxious fucking startup guy in Silicon Valley.

1393
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,880
Okay, this is the thing.

1394
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:32,040
It's going to be called Dickly and it's about taking dick pics and really democratizing them, like including vaginas and also balls because I think balls are important.

1395
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,680
They're often missed.

1396
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,320
And so anyways, that's my elevator pitch.

1397
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,120
Can I have 20 million dollars and you get 20 million dollars?

1398
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,600
It's like constantly along with the self narrative.

1399
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:51,680
So when you say I feel like a moron, I understand exactly what you're saying because being able to see clearly through the turbulence on the top of the water to the dick at the bottom because that's really what it's a big dick with extra hairy balls.

1400
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,120
That's very hard.

1401
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,520
So meditation is one way psychedelics are a way to jumpstart it.

1402
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:04,360
I know you and Tim talked about this on the show and I don't want to rehash all that, but I want to say that I think you guys are on the exact all these paths converge.

1403
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,880
And it seems like pretty smart people are all saying the same thing, which is we need to restart psychedelic research.

1404
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,360
We need meditation as a crucial tool.

1405
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,240
I've kind of followed Tim's journey remotely.

1406
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:23,080
I've never met him, but he kind of takes the classic path that a striver type A takes in meditation, which is I'm first I'm going to use this to help me perform better.

1407
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:39,520
Then I'm going to use it to quiet the demons and I'm going to and ultimately what it is, you use it to actually understand and appreciate your mind and transform it so that your day to day actually all these defilements, these little voices and the emotional reactivity are uprooted permanently.

1408
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,160
And in this book, he talks about it and having that those inside experiences.

1409
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,200
It sounds very esoteric.

1410
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,200
I found that book very difficult to read, which is not to say it's not well written.

1411
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,760
I just I think it again speaks to the problem.

1412
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,680
I mean, look, I had to read Waking Up by Sam Harris like four times.

1413
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,800
And I think I'm at the point where I understand the first third and the last third.

1414
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,160
I still don't understand the middle third of the book, Sam.

1415
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,200
It's just too hard for me.

1416
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,640
Like I just I don't have the CPU.

1417
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,400
I don't have the neurons.

1418
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,120
There's something that I can't fully understand.

1419
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,680
This is a huge problem.

1420
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,160
You know, we talk about the ineffability, the inability to describe these kind of experiences, and it's a huge problem.

1421
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,440
I found that the mind illuminator was the closest I got as a rationalist to understanding it.

1422
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:29,480
And even then, it's like shooting electrons off something and trying to reconstruct the image that this guy already ineffably feels that, you know, he knows it.

1423
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,800
And it's taken me a lot of repetition.

1424
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,120
I think the point is we can't give up.

1425
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,480
I still don't entirely understand.

1426
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,800
Yeah, you brought up swimming earlier.

1427
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,440
So I learned to swim as an adult.

1428
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,840
So I was about 31.

1429
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,400
Wow.

1430
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,600
And I decided relatively early in my flailing that like I really want to do this thing.

1431
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,440
I want to, you know, swim these long marathons.

1432
01:04:48,160 --> 01:05:01,560
And like the amount that I had to put into doing that, the amount of hours I had to swim to catch up from being, you know, what I called an adult onset swimmer to being able to do this thing was a lot.

1433
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,600
And I used to sometimes get frustrated like at swim practice because, you know, like I couldn't swim as fast as like half the people there.

1434
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,560
And, you know, you had to sort of remind yourself like they've been doing this since they were four.

1435
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,560
You know, these people have been on swim teams in high school, in, you know, college and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1436
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,800
You know, there's a song by the Smiths where there's this line where Morris, he says, you just haven't earned it yet, baby.

1437
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,200
And I just love that line.

1438
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,320
It's like that is my mantra.

1439
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,600
Like every time I find myself getting sort of frustrated that I'm not good enough at something, I just say, you just haven't earned it yet, baby.

1440
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,680
You know, you just have like these people have swum 20 times the number of hours you have.

1441
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:42,080
And similarly, when I find myself getting a little frustrated at, you know, my ability to understand consciousness.

1442
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,680
And I always think about Sam because he's just such an amazing teacher.

1443
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,000
I think, well, dude, you just haven't earned it yet, baby.

1444
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,680
Like Sam's been on this journey his whole life.

1445
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,240
You know, and Sam is probably in a similar boat to us in terms of he's a hyper rationalist.

1446
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,520
You know, we use this metaphor that John Hite uses the psychologist, Elphin and Ryder.

1447
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,240
So Elphin is our limbic system, emotions unconscious.

1448
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,800
And then our writer is the cortex on top that's conscious.

1449
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,400
And the thinker and the planner, our writers are hypertrophy.

1450
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:16,640
They're super big, but they're still fucking completely beholden to this totally dumb elephant that's like pissed off.

1451
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,000
Look up something online that backs me up.

1452
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,160
It's like, well, according to my data, this.

1453
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,080
And so Sam had to get through that by long retreats.

1454
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,440
And what I find is I'm in a position in my life now whereby straight necessity to alleviate personal suffering.

1455
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,080
And that happened in 2012, where I just had this break where suddenly I see things differently.

1456
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,280
Sometimes it takes that letting go or relaxing.

1457
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:54,480
So something I hear in what you're describing concerns me in the sense that and again, this is from my own experience, that it's the striving to treat this like a pursuit like swimming or anything that requires like racing that will hinder.

1458
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:00,280
Ultimately, you'll reach a wall where you can't release until you relax into it and let it go and surrender to it.

1459
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,520
And it sounds woo woo, but I think there's something there.

1460
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,640
So this morning I do an hour a day now using this.

1461
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,840
And I know Tim was talking about like 10, 20 minutes a day.

1462
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,720
And that's great to start.

1463
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,400
But what I find is there's a therapeutic threshold.

1464
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,320
And I think it's around an hour and it's hard to pitch that to people.

1465
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:22,160
But once you get into that mold, first, you have to set that intention when you sit down like this is what I'm doing in this sitting.

1466
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,680
And the intention creates a momentum of those mind moments that then drives you into the meditation.

1467
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,840
So you're not lost when you get lost in thought.

1468
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,480
You remember the intention and you come back.

1469
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:36,840
But at about an hour, you're in a state where the noise actually quiets.

1470
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:44,640
And when noise appears, you recognize it and you ignore and you're floating on the breath and the body feels like this pulsing wave of energy.

1471
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,640
And you realize, oh, this is all just experience happening in the present moment.

1472
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,200
And it's not even I can't describe it.

1473
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,200
It's it's an insight that you have.

1474
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,160
And then it vanishes about 20 minutes after you're done, where you lose it, you're back in the world.

1475
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:04,480
But I'll tell you, if you keep repeating that, I suspect if we can maintain that even for five minutes a day, it's such a relief in human.

1476
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,000
I think I think the benefits even greater than five minutes a day.

1477
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:15,600
I mean, I think so going back to the example you used about the psychedelics, there's a book that Sam recommended called altered states or altered traits.

1478
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,920
Altered traits. Yeah, yeah.

1479
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,080
The point it makes now it's a book about meditation and it talks.

1480
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:41,280
I think it does a great job explaining that like exercise, the purpose of the hour you spent in the gym this morning was not because there's something particularly insightful about moving a dumbbell from here to here, here to here, here to here isolating this muscle and, you know, putting this thing on your back and moving it in this direction.

1481
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,400
And in other words, those are simply tools that we're using.

1482
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,880
There's a state that we create in that hour of exercise.

1483
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,720
But the goal is to give you traits that last for the other 23 hours.

1484
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,440
I would suspect you're getting a hell of a lot more than, you know, 20 minutes or five minutes of benefit thereafter.

1485
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:05,200
My guess is that kind of a meditative practice is infused into the other 23 hours of the day and how you react.

1486
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,080
I mean, because I don't even practice that long.

1487
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,400
And I feel the difference.

1488
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,680
Like I feel infinitely less aggressive.

1489
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,960
I feel infinitely more empathic.

1490
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,200
I'm a little jealous actually.

1491
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,080
And I really feel like I need to up my game.

1492
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:23,960
And no, I'm not saying that in a competitive way, but like realizing there's because I just had this discussion with Kevin Rose the other day.

1493
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,440
Yeah.

1494
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,600
And he said the same thing, which is, you know, he has just totally upped his game and he's going like 45 minutes a day.

1495
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:38,080
And he also mentioned that there's a real threshold you're getting over in terms of the practice and the settling of the mind.

1496
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,920
And this is the thing.

1497
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,960
It is a threshold effect because something does happen.

1498
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,240
People who've talked to me, they haven't talked to me in a long time are like, what happened to you?

1499
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,800
You're so much nicer.

1500
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
There's something edge that's been taken off.

1501
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,000
Again, you don't know.

1502
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:58,680
So now one thing that he says in the Mind Illuminate is that if you practice meditation without somehow applying it in your daily life, it's like a bucket with no bottom.

1503
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The stuff goes through.

1504
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,760
It's like a sieve.

1505
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:08,400
Whereas if you're starting to collect some of that mindfulness and mindfulness is just simply a lack of reactivity, being able to go, oh, that's happening.

1506
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,040
Okay.

1507
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,520
Instead of making a choice.

1508
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,040
Tim said it best on your podcast.

1509
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,800
He said you become response able.

1510
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,160
So you're able to actually make a response to an autonomic knee jerk to your elephant.

1511
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:18,760
All right.

1512
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,280
We just have to acknowledge, we took a pee break.

1513
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,240
We probably forgot what we were talking about beforehand.

1514
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,640
And the last thing we were talking about was I was revisiting your dick pic joke that was making me laugh.

1515
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,400
So that's right.

1516
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,800
And I realized I didn't add taint into the mix because the taint is often neglected.

1517
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:41,000
You know, we had a joke actually, uh, when we were admitting patients when I was in attending at Stanford, the team would come to me and go, yeah, they're trying to, the surgeons are trying to admit this gallbladder to us, even though we don't do operations.

1518
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,160
They're saying it's non-surgical and this and that.

1519
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,320
I go, you know, this reminds me of, uh, when I worked on the taint transplant service and they're like, what do you mean?

1520
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:55,720
You know, you've never worked on taint transplant where you're taking donor taints and you're flying in and you're, you know, homeless guy dies on the street and you take, you excise the taint, you put it on ice and you fly it off.

1521
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:01,320
And, and I would ask them, I say, listen, is this person in the hospital for anything other than their taint?

1522
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,480
If the answer is yes, it doesn't belong on our service.

1523
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:10,960
If this is for a taint issue and a taint issue only, I mean, I'm talking about taint the balls, taint the ass, the space between those two.

1524
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,320
Then it's ours.

1525
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,680
It's a simple algorithm.

1526
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,160
And by the way, the graft versus host disease on a taint transplant.

1527
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
It can be devastating.

1528
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,240
It's devastating because both your balls and your anus are affected.

1529
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,160
And when they both go down, what do you have?

1530
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:36,200
You know, really, can I pitch something to you because it was, we were talking about meditation and I want to talk about what you do as a doctor and, and you can ask me anything you like it, but I want to pitch you this theory of consciousness and reality.

1531
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,560
And I want you to tell me as a smart person, what you think.

1532
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,200
All right.

1533
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,640
Dr.

1534
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,760
Donald Hoffman is a professor of cognitive science and computer science at University of California, Irvine.

1535
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,720
He was on our show.

1536
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:52,400
He has posited this theory and it starts with this basic idea, which is.

1537
01:11:53,800 --> 01:12:00,200
Do we see the world as it is or are we seeing some fabrication that isn't even close to reality?

1538
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,520
And he actually was able to look at this evolutionarily.

1539
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,280
He studies visual perception and how people actually perceive stuff.

1540
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:19,360
And what he determined through lots of different studies and also different approaches and different fields was that organisms that see reality as it actually is go extinct.

1541
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,360
So if you see the matrix as zeros and ones, you go extinct.

1542
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,640
And the reason is it takes a lot of energy to actually see reality and all its complexity.

1543
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,560
And so the second proposition as well, then maybe we just see part of reality, but it's still real.

1544
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,600
It's just not all of reality.

1545
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,400
And that's what most visual scientists propose.

1546
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:46,680
What he proposes is based on his cognitive models and his computer models and his simulations is that organisms that see any aspect of reality as it is go extinct in just a few generations.

1547
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:55,360
Whereas organisms that see reality as a fitness icon designed to help them reproduce thrive.

1548
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:01,040
So in other words, there is no bottle of water here as such.

1549
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:01,720
There's no water.

1550
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,520
There's no atoms.

1551
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,160
There's no paper.

1552
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,680
There's none of that.

1553
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,840
This is a graphical user interface that I as a human have evolved to see to help me survive.

1554
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,200
I see something wet that I know that if I drink it, I will not die.

1555
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,920
So we have this shorthand hack in how we see the world.

1556
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:27,600
And over and over and over, he gives examples of insects who will go extinct having sex with a beer bottle because it's perfectly hacked their interface to look like a female insect.

1557
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:35,040
And these male insects in Australia, these beetles will have sex with this bottle to the exclusion of beautiful females nearby because it is so perfect.

1558
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:40,480
This has been hacked in advertising with humans to make things look hyper appealing.

1559
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,880
Any McDonald's ad where they're opening the burger and you see the juicy cheese and all that.

1560
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,480
By the way, the vegans hate us, don't they?

1561
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,120
All that that's designed to hack our interface.

1562
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:58,280
And his theory is the interface theory of perception that every species sees reality through a series of evolved hacks that allow us to reproduce.

1563
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,320
And so here's the punchline of that.

1564
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,920
What is reality?

1565
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,360
Is there a reality?

1566
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,960
And what he argues is yes, there is.

1567
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,360
There is an objective reality.

1568
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,080
It's not we're all not just making this up.

1569
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,800
Our visual cortex is just constructing it.

1570
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,560
It's not something where and he's looked at the number of neurons in the visual cortex is way more than it takes to reconstruct an image.

1571
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,960
But just enough to construct an image.

1572
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,520
So we are constructing the world second to second in our minds every day.

1573
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,040
The question is based on what?

1574
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,440
And if you look, he then digs into quantum mechanics.

1575
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,400
I read his manuscript, the book that he hasn't released yet.

1576
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:39,920
In quantum mechanics, they've pretty clearly established that there is no such thing as local realism.

1577
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,400
In other words, something doesn't exist until it's interacting with a conscious observer.

1578
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,680
It's a probability wave.

1579
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,520
So the moon maybe doesn't exist until conscious entities interface with it.

1580
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,120
What is it that we're interfacing with?

1581
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:56,720
And this is what when he described this in a TED talk and then I read his stuff and I had him on the show, I was convinced it felt intuitively correct to me.

1582
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,560
I want to see how you feel.

1583
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,880
You may say it's bullshit.

1584
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:14,160
The world is actually nothing but consciousness subdivided into things he calls conscious agents, which are little subdivisions of consciousness that sum up and break down kind of the way you can have a one bit conscious agent.

1585
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:22,640
And all a conscious agent is, is it's able to, it's a simple mathematical function and he has the formulas to kind of show this, how they interact with each other and how they sum.

1586
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:31,400
The smallest one bit conscious agent is a plank length thing, the smallest thing you can imagine that can have three things.

1587
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,920
It can perceive, it can decide, and it can act.

1588
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,040
And the currency of reality is experience.

1589
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:44,280
It's conscious experience from the tiniest levels all the way down all the way to the largest structures that we have.

1590
01:15:44,640 --> 01:16:00,000
And so when we try to explain the consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, how does the brain, how does this three pounds of wet goo create the experience of me seeing Peter in his cool racing hat with his kind of sexy stubble, which I wish I had.

1591
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,520
Yeah, it's an icon, but I like it.

1592
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,920
I'm going to call it my con because I want it.

1593
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,920
How does it create that experience, the smell of, of baking, you know, bread?

1594
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,280
And the answer is we've been going about it wrong.

1595
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,200
We have to invoke a miracle in our current understanding.

1596
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,320
How do we go from atoms, neurons to experience?

1597
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,240
Well, at some point there's a jump that no one has been able to explain.

1598
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,200
You can wave hands.

1599
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:34,880
What he's saying is how about you start with the miracle, which is everything is awareness and consciousness and matter and neurons are icons that we use in a species specific way to understand this vast network.

1600
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,640
The social network of social, the social network of consciousness interacting with itself.

1601
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:52,240
So when I see Peter, I see a sexy dude, but what is really there on your inside is this vast realm of experience and perception and awareness and thought and emotion that I don't see.

1602
01:16:52,440 --> 01:17:04,440
What I see is my species specific hack that allows me to get through the world, allows me to reproduce, allows me to stay alive and allows me to survive in a way because we don't have enough processing power to see what I really think is there,

1603
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,240
which is this incredibly complex series of nested consciousness all interacting.

1604
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:21,600
And when you talk about books like this, where they talk about sub minds and meditation, what you're doing is you're taking your highest instantiation, which is the kind of aggregate of all these sub minds.

1605
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:28,400
And you're looking and listening at those inner nested consciousnesses interacting with each other.

1606
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:33,320
And you're also connecting to maybe the deeper connection between all of us as a higher consciousness.

1607
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:39,240
Sounds like woo, but in his formulas, he actually shows how these things work mathematically.

1608
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,880
And actually, the formula reduces to the Heisenberg sort of formula for electron probability cloud.

1609
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,120
So it's really quite fascinating.

1610
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,880
Can it be tested experimentally?

1611
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:47,640
Right.

1612
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,280
So this is what he's working on now.

1613
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,000
You can computer model this stuff.

1614
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,440
And the problem is it's as valid as any other model because it's hard to test.

1615
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,040
So the question is, how do you test that we're all awareness interacting with awareness?

1616
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,480
Yeah, there's a famous actually, I don't remember which physicist it was.

1617
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:06,480
I don't think it was Fermi, but a very famous physicist once said, all models are wrong, some are useful.

1618
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,360
That's right.

1619
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,800
And he himself says this is probably only partially correct.

1620
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:17,760
Because the idea is then, well, why would evolution even happen if conscious agents just exist and they're outside of time and space?

1621
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,880
It's really just a, it's an important piece of this.

1622
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,360
So we're wondering about time and space and are they real?

1623
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,240
Are they an actual thing?

1624
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:35,080
No, they are a species specific data compression algorithm that allow us to make sense of this social network and allow us to survive.

1625
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:43,400
So space and time are different for you and me for what we're similar because we have the same species, presumably, although you're probably more involved than me.

1626
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:49,320
But like a dog or a cat or a fruit fly are all awareness interacting with other awareness.

1627
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,200
But the way they see the world in space and time is a totally different construct.

1628
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:57,280
And so all of it is constructed, which transforms in my mind.

1629
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,720
Let's say it's true and we'll talk about how we can test it because I think we should brainstorm ways to test it.

1630
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:04,280
But I think it transforms how you think about mental illness.

1631
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,560
So what is mental illness?

1632
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:12,680
But in our reductionist, materialist viewpoint, which we're very good as doctors at thinking because we've been conditioned to think that.

1633
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,920
And I think there's a lot of truth.

1634
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,840
The way we do medicine now is we are really good at moving the icons around on the desktop.

1635
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:29,960
We know that a serotonin icon, when put into a human icons bloodstream, does something to a subjective description of experience from that human subject in terms of depression.

1636
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,760
But what is really happening?

1637
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,600
We're like monkeys moving these icons around.

1638
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,040
But what's the transistors and the electrons that actually make it up?

1639
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:48,720
If the serotonin molecule is really a conscious agent, that's the sum of little conscious agents and it's interacting with our conscious agent, that really shifts how we think about how these medicines work, how the mind body

1640
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,280
connection action.

1641
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,120
What if that's not correct?

1642
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,480
What if the serotonin agent doesn't have the ability to perceive?

1643
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,000
So if serotonin is actually electrons, if electrons are materially real.

1644
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:58,240
Yeah.

1645
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:03,960
What if serotonin is simply nothing more than atoms with all of its constituent elements, right?

1646
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,320
Electrons, protons, neutrons.

1647
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:12,120
So if that's true, then it negates the entire model because it says something is materially real.

1648
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:18,880
This model says there is nothing real beyond awareness itself and it creates reality on icons that allow it to evolve.

1649
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,640
And this is difficult stuff to grasp as scientists, which both of us are.

1650
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:36,560
You're much more than me because it goes against everything we train, which is big bang happen somehow matter organized into complex structures that through which consciousness emerged.

1651
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:51,400
We're saying consciousness was and subdivided into these smaller agents that combined into bigger agents and evolve over time into complex agents like ourselves that interact with other agents and social networks that probably form higher levels of consciousness.

1652
01:20:51,560 --> 01:21:00,720
So you could actually posit what is God, but all these conscious agents at its highest instantiation in a way that it knows more than almost anything because it's the sum of all these agents.

1653
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,200
Now, how do you test it?

1654
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,440
So if serotonin is a molecule, then yes, our reductionist approach is right and we should continue to hammer at it.

1655
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:12,880
If it's wrong, we should still hammer at the reductionist approach because we're moving icons.

1656
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:25,320
So as Hoffman says, he says, just because a desktop trash icon on my computer desktop isn't literally a trash icon and I'm not dragging real documents into it, that doesn't mean I drag my life's work into it and hit delete.

1657
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,800
Just because I don't take it literally doesn't mean I don't take it seriously.

1658
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,760
So yeah, we take our icons seriously.

1659
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:44,280
We should know all about them, but we're going to hit a wall and I think we're getting there in our understanding because until we understand what is the fundamental nature of reality, we're not going to be able to manipulate it in a way that reduces suffering, which I think is what we're trying to do.

1660
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:44,480
Right.

1661
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:52,280
When you talk about health span, you're talking about the longest possible life with the most enjoyment or happiness or fulfillment or whatever is there.

1662
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,920
Individual's goal is and to me, that's like a lack of suffering.

1663
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:01,680
No one wants to live to suffer unless you're a BDSM bondage person and even that's not suffering because it's actually pleasure for them.

1664
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,120
So suffering is a mental construct.

1665
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,360
Pain is eternal.

1666
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,200
Suffering is optional because it's how we frame it.

1667
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:07,840
What do you think?

1668
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:08,800
I don't know.

1669
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:21,520
It's hard for me to actually internalize that because I mean, letting go of subatomic structures as sort of not being real, that would just require a lot more understanding on my part.

1670
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,280
Let me say this.

1671
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,760
Subatomic structures are absolutely real as icons.

1672
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,320
So in other words, they mean something.

1673
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,480
They're an image.

1674
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,800
Yeah.

1675
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,920
I think trying to imagine that they have their own state of consciousness is, you know, it's not even for me to understand.

1676
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,880
It's not even that.

1677
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,000
So, OK, let me let me dig into that a little bit because this is something that I have to think about a lot.

1678
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,040
That's a dualist belief.

1679
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:47,120
So in other words, the subatomic structure electron is an electron with some awareness.

1680
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,400
That's a belief called dualism.

1681
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,000
It means that there is matter and there's consciousness and they're related.

1682
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:03,280
Well, what Hoffman's saying, what I think I intuit from this is and I could absolutely be wrong and people get violently disagreeable to this idea.

1683
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,560
There's no electron at all.

1684
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:11,880
Electron is a conscious agent that we see as electron through our species specific interface.

1685
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,040
It's how we've evolved to see the world.

1686
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,560
We see it as and we don't ever see electrons.

1687
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,360
We use equipment to intuit them.

1688
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:26,040
But then how would we explain physical experiments that have independently validated the same construct?

1689
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,080
Meaning.

1690
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:45,880
So, for example, when Newton came along, he was the first to define a set of physical laws and they held pretty well until the early part of the 20th century when at one layer below the Newtonian understanding, there was a new layer of physical laws that had to be described.

1691
01:23:46,320 --> 01:24:06,120
Many of these laws have been independently validated and I would think that if it was all a hack, meaning if we were all creating our own construct, our own icons, it strikes me as improbable that we would be converging on the same descriptions, the same experimental identifications.

1692
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,720
This is a great way to think about it.

1693
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,440
And here's how I would think about that.

1694
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,200
We have our hack, but it's based on reality.

1695
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,400
And reality is these conscious agents exchanging experience with each other.

1696
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,320
We see it as the laws of physics.

1697
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,480
We see it as an electron binding to this and this chemical reaction happening.

1698
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:35,200
And of course it will be validated because it's actually happening in the sense that these agents are behaving relationally to each other in predictable, precise ways that we can measure and science can quantify.

1699
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:42,200
But wait, but why would the electrons, the protons behave in a predictable way when you and I can't behave in a predictable way?

1700
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:53,320
Because we don't behave predictably, Peter, because we are complex instantiations of multiple conscious agents that emerge a very high level of consciousness.

1701
01:24:53,320 --> 01:25:05,320
So part of the reason you have these voices that are telling you you're an asshole and I have them is that we have that are unconscious to us agents that are making decisions in the background that are feeding it up to our higher instantiation.

1702
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,200
It's very unpredictable.

1703
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,280
It's complex system.

1704
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:15,960
The simplest systems, in other words, one bit, two bit, 12 bit, 100 bit conscious agents behave predictably because they have three actions perceived aside act.

1705
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:20,480
It might be that the one bit conscious agent can only have two perceptions, two actions.

1706
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:26,440
And so it sums up scientifically, mathematically as absolute predictability.

1707
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:26,960
Wait a second.

1708
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,600
If you collapse that to one and one, you could have a reductionist world.

1709
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,800
If you had no choice, if all of the sub particles had no choice, right?

1710
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,400
It would become a semantic game.

1711
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:42,640
Well, if none of the particles had a choice, meaning you were, you always knew how they were going to behave.

1712
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,240
Right, right, right.

1713
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,520
Well, then you have it's the same as being materialist.

1714
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,280
It's saying they have no consciousness.

1715
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:47,840
So that's right.

1716
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,000
The definition of this is they have choice.

1717
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,240
And here's something that's even more interesting, which again, I just can't.

1718
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,480
So probabilistically, that just strikes me as impossible.

1719
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,120
Yeah.

1720
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:58,720
Right.

1721
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:06,840
Because you couldn't have the order that we have in the universe if there was any choice to be made at that level.

1722
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:17,880
Again, I'm saying this as a guy who's bullshitting because he's hearing about this for the first time, but that's my initial reaction is I don't understand how you could preserve any order in the universe if there was any choice to be made in that regard.

1723
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,320
Yeah.

1724
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:24,120
So what's interesting is when you look at actual quantum mechanics, there is uncertainty at the quantum level.

1725
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,320
There is uncertainty.

1726
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,640
But there is a predictable uncertainty.

1727
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,720
Yeah, but exactly.

1728
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:32,720
It's defined by a probability function, but it collapses to something that's known once it's observed.

1729
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,320
Correct.

1730
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:42,760
So what is observation but two conscious agents interacting and exchanging experience that then allows this particular conscious agent to settle into a particular choice?

1731
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,840
So to me, it's not exclusive of that having choice at the smallest level.

1732
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,640
Now, again, this is the simplest of choices.

1733
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:55,880
Yeah, and one thing you said was interesting to me because I struggle with this, which was how can if we all see things differently as a hack, how can there be reality?

1734
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,720
How can there be objective, predictable, scientifically valid reality?

1735
01:26:59,040 --> 01:26:59,920
Well, look at it this way.

1736
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,120
So he gives the example, which I think is very powerful of synesthetes.

1737
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:07,040
So people have synesthesia, which is they experience the world very differently.

1738
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:12,680
And they smell colors or they hear sights and you see colors when you hear sounds.

1739
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:19,520
And he gives examples of a guy who any time he tastes mint in his hand, he feels a basket of ivy.

1740
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,560
And it turns out that guy is a synesthete.

1741
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,960
So his inner face is a mutation.

1742
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,600
Something has changed in the way.

1743
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,240
How do you know that without functional MRI or is that the way that one can validate that?

1744
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,880
He's actually done some of that on these guys.

1745
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,440
It's interesting.

1746
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,400
And it's parts of the brain that light up with touch light up when he's actually thinking about mint or something.

1747
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:44,440
So you've basically just you've disaligned, if for lack of a better word, the relationship between the external and internal sensory.

1748
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,680
You know, the cortex is basically been remapped.

1749
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,800
There's some remapping.

1750
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,080
Now, I would argue that the cortex is an icon we use to actually comp consciousness interacting with itself.

1751
01:27:54,080 --> 01:28:02,160
But imagine that person now is a mutation of some kind that interfaces with the world differently because he can feel mint.

1752
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,520
It turns out he's a glorious chef.

1753
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:10,000
So he has a career as a professional chef because he's able to take flavors and tactically feel them.

1754
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,600
And it's and to him, it's well, that's interesting.

1755
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,840
It's like a basket.

1756
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,600
He's putting his hand in a basket of ivy when he tastes something else.

1757
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,400
I forgot he would make a horrible surgeon.

1758
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,520
Can you imagine having to taste all of those body parts to be able to because, you know, you rely on your feelings like a chilled monkey brains.

1759
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,720
Dr. Jones.

1760
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,320
It's true.

1761
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,760
So a surgeon would go extinct having that skill.

1762
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,240
But a chef would evolve.

1763
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:38,920
Now, imagine evolution starts to put pressures on us where only the best chefs get laid and have sex and reproduce.

1764
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,400
Now that becomes the default.

1765
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,800
But see, to me, that is totally explainable through Darwinian biology.

1766
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:45,280
Right.

1767
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,360
That is completely understandable.

1768
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,720
So Darwin is essential for this theory as well.

1769
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:56,640
You have to in fact, the core universal principles of Darwinism have nothing to do with DNA and molecules.

1770
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,800
They have to do with is something heritable?

1771
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,680
Is there evolutionary pressure on it?

1772
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,920
And those sort of things.

1773
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,960
And that works just as well with conscious agents as it does with material stuff.

1774
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:13,080
So conscious agents can evolve over time to have perceptions that actually allow them to succeed in this social network where they're competing.

1775
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,640
I mean, and again, forgive me for just not having a goddamn clue what you're talking about.

1776
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,880
Why is it that if that bottle is an icon, you can't make it lift up off the table by thinking about it?

1777
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,960
Because in the social network of conscious agents that happen to be this way, that is not a perceptual decision or an action.

1778
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,560
Why can't you override it?

1779
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:34,520
Well, there are rules between how these things actually interact.

1780
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,600
In other words, it's not a free for all.

1781
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,800
It's not magical thinking.

1782
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,640
It's not like, well, just because everything's awareness, I create like Deepak Chopra.

1783
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,520
He'll say something like, everything is consciousness.

1784
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,480
And so you can secrete, which is my way of using secret as a verb.

1785
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,320
You can secrete success and happiness and all that.

1786
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,000
Well, that's not true.

1787
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,840
That's magical thinking.

1788
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:54,880
What we're saying is no.

1789
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,080
Have you seen the Big Lebowski?

1790
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,080
Dude, dude, the dude abides.

1791
01:29:59,080 --> 01:29:59,680
Stop.

1792
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,840
There are rules, dude.

1793
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,040
Okay.

1794
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,120
This isn't fucking nom.

1795
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:02,840
All right.

1796
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,240
There are rules.

1797
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,320
And the rules are these things behave just like.

1798
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:12,760
You know, one of the worst parts about trying to be health conscious is that you can't drink white Russians as liberally as the Big Lebowski.

1799
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,640
Who says so?

1800
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,440
You say so.

1801
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:20,120
I mean, the Kalua is just, if you want a proper, I mean, now you could drink a Caucasian.

1802
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:20,560
Yes.

1803
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:20,800
Right.

1804
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,080
Yes.

1805
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,520
It's just half and half.

1806
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:22,760
Yeah.

1807
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,680
Which is a little cleaner, but if you want to do it right, you got to have the Kalua in it.

1808
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,960
And between the vodka, the Kalua and the cream.

1809
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,720
Sugar, alcohol.

1810
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,320
But I've never craved a drink.

1811
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:43,280
I enjoy alcohol, but I've never craved it until the first time I saw the Big Lebowski, which was got 25 years ago.

1812
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:43,720
I'm the same boat.

1813
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:49,600
And I was like, I want to have one of those drinks and I need to grow a mustache because I need to be able to lick that off.

1814
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:50,080
No.

1815
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,120
So good.

1816
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,120
I love it so much.

1817
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,560
We should have white Russians and that gets me this thing.

1818
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,320
So guys, could you, is there any way you could fire up a white Russian right now?

1819
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,600
Two white Russians throw a black Russian into just the heck of it.

1820
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,880
We want, we want to be equitable.

1821
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,560
And one Caucasian.

1822
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,280
And one Caucasian.

1823
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:12,280
We initially reconnected over your work on nutrition and diet and we had a patient in common and so on and so forth.

1824
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:18,040
And you did a bunch of testing on me that really transformed how I think and know about myself.

1825
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,720
For example, I dabbled in ketosis.

1826
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,680
Yeah, I also dabbled in pacifism.

1827
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,520
Not in numb.

1828
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:27,640
I dabbled in ketosis as well for probably eight months.

1829
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:30,640
You were in it for three years with one day exception, I understand.

1830
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:37,040
And I learned a lot because I learned that I make these very small, dense lipid particles that didn't seem healthy.

1831
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,680
And we ended up going to Mediterranean.

1832
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,360
I did a lot better.

1833
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,920
But the idea that a white Russian would just, I couldn't do it, it was devastating to me.

1834
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,160
So it wasn't sustainable.

1835
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,600
How do you think about nutrition now?

1836
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Because you have this patient panel, your, you know, your functional medicine doc, which I want to talk about as well.

1837
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,040
See, again, I say the squirm.

1838
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:53,520
Yeah.

1839
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,640
Like, I don't know what to say.

1840
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,880
I don't even know what functional medicine is.

1841
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,560
I mean, I know what the definition is, but like, I don't know what I do.

1842
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,560
I don't know anything.

1843
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,640
I mean, I know what I know, but I don't know how to put a label on it.

1844
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,640
And I don't know what I'm all I'm interested in.

1845
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,560
I can define my objective.

1846
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,000
I can define the strategy and I can define the tactics.

1847
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,400
But other than that, like I can't actually take an existing description and apply it to it.

1848
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:24,240
But the objective, which is the easiest part to state is I want to figure out a way, and I'll just use myself as an example, but I obviously would apply this to every patient.

1849
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:32,720
I want to figure out a way to live longer than I am otherwise on a trajectory to live, which means I have to delay the onset of the things that will kill me.

1850
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,040
Yeah.

1851
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:47,880
And I want to improve the quality of my life, which I define rather simply as having three legs, one leg being cognition, the second leg being everything that has to do with the exoskeleton of my body.

1852
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:58,200
So the maintenance of muscle mass, the ability to move, maintain mobility, stability, which I actually think is much more important than mobility that gets no attention.

1853
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:09,400
I can explain in a moment freedom from pain, sexual function, all of the things that people our age take for granted, but you stop taking for granted when you are in your eighties, in your nineties.

1854
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,400
Before we got started, we were looking at pictures of our kids playing instruments and stuff like that.

1855
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,200
I mean, because we're Gunners, man.

1856
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,560
Like, well, how good is your kid at the drummer?

1857
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,880
Oh, it's pretty awesome, man.

1858
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,320
Well, mine's a virtuoso violinist.

1859
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:20,680
How about you?

1860
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:28,160
Well, you know, but if you think about the way you were able to interact with your kids in your forties and now imagine.

1861
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,560
Would you be able to reproduce that in your eighties?

1862
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,280
And so a lot of stuff you took for granted, right?

1863
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:36,920
Like, could you lay down on the floor, play blocks or dolls or whatever, and stand up easily?

1864
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,520
Or is that like a debilitating activity?

1865
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:46,480
If your grandkid or great grandkid came running towards you, could you dip down into a goblet squat position and pick up a little 30 pound terror?

1866
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,400
So that sort of all is encompassed in this physical part.

1867
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:58,160
And then the third piece, which I don't have a great name for it or anything, but it's, and it's by far the hardest to impact as a physician, because I think the first two are a little bit more.

1868
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,880
Within the tools that we can apply.

1869
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:10,920
The third piece is this ability to be happy, as nebulous as that is, and to have what I describe as borrowing from a friend of mine, Paul Conti, who's always explains what you know Paul.

1870
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,400
Yeah.

1871
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:14,360
Is just to have the highest degree of distress tolerance possible.

1872
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,880
And of course, mindfulness and meditation becomes the single most important tool to impact that.

1873
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,200
But there are other parts to that as well.

1874
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:24,160
Social support, sense of purpose, all these other things.

1875
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:31,680
And as you alluded to earlier, most people, if you took those things away from them, they wouldn't want to live one more minute.

1876
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,800
And there are exceptions to that rule.

1877
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:41,240
I mean, you look at Stephen Hawking, he had one of those three completely taken away, yet for all indications lived a completely fulfilling life.

1878
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,480
And I'm sure wanted every additional day of life he could have had.

1879
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,320
But for many people, they want all of those things, especially if they at some point in time have had all of those things.

1880
01:34:50,200 --> 01:35:00,440
So I guess the only way I describe myself, and this is why I generally like to be referred to as a shepherd or a FR 2000 race car driver, is I'm a doc who's obsessed with that problem.

1881
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:10,400
And I have to say, having experienced what you do from both a clinician as a patient side, seeing you with a patient and with me, you have a gift for this.

1882
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:19,080
This is something that very few people I've seen in medicine do, which is you look at the patient as a unique individual, you educate them in a way that sometimes is hard to understand, actually.

1883
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,840
The same way when I'm talking about consciousness, we're all struggling with it.

1884
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:27,240
Sometimes some of the concepts that you talk about are so intuitive to us, but our patients look at us like we're crazy.

1885
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:39,120
But even then, this idea that you can optimize a particular regimen to the goals of that unique patient is the foundation of what we call Health 3.0, which we tried in our clinic, Turntable Health.

1886
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,720
And it is the same idea.

1887
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,720
And if we had clinicians like you surrounded with a team, do you do it all yourself or do you have a team?

1888
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,680
Oh, no, no, I have a monstrosity of a team, actually.

1889
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,360
Tell me about your team.

1890
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:55,920
Yes, I have two, soon to be three people who are basically interacting with the patients on all of the logistics of what we do.

1891
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:02,720
We have a dietician soon to be another, probably we need two health coach dieticians.

1892
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:14,520
What we're realizing is that the hard part is not, I mean, it is hard to figure out what is the optimal way for a person to eat, but there is a finite number of iterations you can make until you start to converge on it.

1893
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,520
So that's what we call the efficacy problem.

1894
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,640
By far, the harder problem is the effectiveness problem.

1895
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,160
I'm a walking experiment of somebody who knows exactly what he functions best on.

1896
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,600
Problem is, I just don't want to do it.

1897
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,320
So I'm one of those guys who actually did incredibly well on a ketogenic diet.

1898
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,680
I mean, everything couldn't have gone any better.

1899
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:37,080
Now, whether I should have been on it indefinitely or cycled it or whatever, we don't know the answer to that question.

1900
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,560
The point is, I just didn't want to be on a ketogenic diet.

1901
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,920
I mean, I miss too many things.

1902
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,800
So now I take a totally different approach.

1903
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:52,120
I have a different framework around nutrition entirely that starts at one end with the SAD, the standard American diet, and at the other end ends with complete caloric restriction.

1904
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,080
So water only, which obviously you can't do indefinitely.

1905
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,080
You should cycle that.

1906
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,000
And then in between, there are three other steps.

1907
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:05,800
And it's one thing to figure out how to optimize a person based on how they cycle between those layers.

1908
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:12,440
But, you know, like I said, the harder part is figuring out how to make that the default as opposed to something you have to work into.

1909
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:20,720
You know, I'm influenced a lot by Dick Thaler's work in Nudge, which is the easier you can make something for someone, the easier it's going to be to do.

1910
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:26,320
And just figure out a way to make them opt out of good behaviors rather than opt in to good behaviors.

1911
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:33,400
Nudge is very similar to Switch, which is by the Heath brothers based on this elephant rider motif from John Hyde as well.

1912
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,080
And it's the same thing.

1913
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,360
You create a path for the elephant rider to walk that is default good.

1914
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:41,560
You motivate the elephant by making them feel something like they want to change or they want to do this.

1915
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:45,880
And then you gently direct the rider, the rationalist on how to make that change.

1916
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:51,800
And, you know, when I talk publicly to I talk about this as a model of how we can do health 3.0 to influence change in our patient.

1917
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,880
I remember what you were asking us to do was very hard.

1918
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,520
You have to be motivated to want to do it.

1919
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,360
We happen to be.

1920
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:04,320
But let me ask a question like, are fat people fat because they just don't have the willpower that it's their fault that they're fat?

1921
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:13,040
Or is it that we just haven't cracked the hack for how to motivate people, make the system by default better and find their optimal plan for them?

1922
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,960
I mean, it's such a complicated question.

1923
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,680
There's something called the Dunning Kruger effect.

1924
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:18,600
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

1925
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,000
No, anti-vaxxers love this because they know a little.

1926
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,840
They're on that first spike.

1927
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,120
Yeah.

1928
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,200
Can we come back to Vax?

1929
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,000
Absolutely.

1930
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,680
Oh, can we?

1931
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:27,080
Yeah.

1932
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,800
I actually lost a patient over this once.

1933
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,040
Lost not died.

1934
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:32,760
Lost left.

1935
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,520
Lost left.

1936
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:33,840
Yeah.

1937
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:46,520
Patient of mine had some questions about not wanting to get his kids vaccinated and came to me assuming that I would agree with him that he should not have his kids vaccinated.

1938
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,120
And I said, Nope, I, you absolutely should get your kids vaccinated.

1939
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,560
And I said, look, here's the one deviation I made from the protocol.

1940
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,120
We waited six months to do the first panel instead of doing them on the first day.

1941
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,200
But yeah, that was no rhyme or reason.

1942
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,240
That was just my intuition.

1943
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,560
I said, give the little bastards a break for six months.

1944
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:07,440
But yeah, I can't imagine any reason why you wouldn't want to vaccinate your children.

1945
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:10,320
And he went loco.

1946
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,840
He was like, I expected more from you.

1947
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,360
I can't believe blah, blah.

1948
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,040
I mean, he was pissed.

1949
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:16,840
That was it.

1950
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:17,280
Like he left.

1951
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,400
I mean, he, he stopped.

1952
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,480
He didn't want to ever see me again.

1953
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:28,680
So as someone who dabbles in the anti-vaxx space a little bit, to the point where people are banging on this door, shouting obscenities at me during a live show with Paul Offit, I will say this.

1954
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,200
What you triggered was that person's elephant.

1955
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:42,600
So their unconscious was triggered in a way where their entire conception of the world, their ideas of liberty versus justice versus care versus harm, this moral palette that John Heit talks about, which we can talk about more later.

1956
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,480
But this idea that vaccines are a violation of the sanctity of the body.

1957
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,520
So you're putting toxins in the body.

1958
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:54,800
And the idea that he probably went to you thinking you were a little bit off the grid, that you're looking at the unique person.

1959
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,480
Therefore, you're not going to swallow the dogma.

1960
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:57,000
Right.

1961
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,440
But the truth is what he didn't realize is no, you swallow what works.

1962
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:06,080
And the things that have been shown to work are in fact, vaccines and not a whole lot of other stuff until you really look at it.

1963
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:12,240
And you look at supplements, you look at a lot of things, Peter, like stuff that would give standard American doctors or also sad.

1964
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:26,720
So you have the standard American diet and the standard American doctor or sad, the hives, because you have taken yourself self-experiment with tons of supplements and you've drawn blood a million times and you've done you are the quantified person because you care about finding out truth for patients and also for yourself.

1965
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:36,280
But this idea that you triggered that person in a way that they made a moral judgment about you that was so far off their moral compass that they couldn't tolerate stomach.

1966
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:44,840
The idea of seeing you until we recognize how people work, we'll never be able to connect with anti-vaxxers that way because we can't imagine why people would think that way.

1967
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,880
And it's just one thing to understand them.

1968
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:52,680
It's another thing to condone delusional and dangerous thinking in public forums like running into a theater and yelling fire.

1969
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,320
And that's what the hardcore professional anti-vaxxers do.

1970
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,840
And our platform has a zero quarter for that.

1971
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,960
Now I just ban them, I ridicule them, I shame them, I drop F-bombs on them.

1972
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,600
I will never stop until these professional anti-vaxxers are stopped.

1973
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:11,640
However, the mother on the fence, the person who's like been conditioned by this stuff on the Internet, that's where it's obligate on us to be patient.

1974
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,440
But I think that's what happened with your patient.

1975
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:18,120
Well, what's interesting is I'm not particularly equipped to delve into that.

1976
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:33,280
So I remember this discussion because my next step was, and it's been so long ago, God, I don't even remember this, but I think, I mean, I don't remember all the details, but I remember saying to him, look, there was this one paper that got made this an issue, but you know it was retracted, right?

1977
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:37,240
Like, you know that it wasn't retracted because the calculations were wrong.

1978
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,160
It was retracted because it was fraud.

1979
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:39,680
Straight fraud.

1980
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:51,080
And do you realize that all of this sort of propaganda you're buying into emanated from something fraudulent, which was, I think, a bit more of an intellectual approach.

1981
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:55,360
I don't think I had the resourcefulness or the insight at the time to take an emotional approach.

1982
01:41:55,360 --> 01:42:02,040
Emotional might be the wrong word, but less of a let me just beat you down with more facts and explain to you why this is right.

1983
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:15,760
So my guess is he was pissed not only in the fact that I was obviously a not outside the box thinker, but maybe on some level he was just pissed that, you know, I probably talked to him like an idiot.

1984
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,080
I was dismissive of him, right?

1985
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:22,080
You really put your finger on something that we do in medicine a lot and I'm guilty of it.

1986
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:30,120
And that is speaking all to writer, trying to give them data when we haven't motivated elephant or understood elephant unconscious motivation.

1987
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:35,720
And this guy, what I've started doing is sitting down and going, yes, why why do vaccines bother you?

1988
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,240
Let's just take Wakefield and his study out of the equation.

1989
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,600
What is it about about them that really bothers you?

1990
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,720
Well, they're forced on me.

1991
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,800
I don't like this idea of toxins in my body or I don't trust the government.

1992
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,080
I don't trust big pharma.

1993
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,520
And I'm like, you know what?

1994
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,320
I don't either.

1995
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,640
I wouldn't let government run health care.

1996
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,000
I don't want fully socialized medicine.

1997
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,880
I think that's crazy.

1998
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,400
But I do think that the government does a lot of things that are good and things are much more complex.

1999
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:03,880
But let's talk about ways that maybe we can come to an understanding because we both want what's right for the kid.

2000
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,760
It's very hard, though, because we get our own emotional.

2001
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,120
I get so angry, man.

2002
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:08,800
I've gotten triggered.

2003
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,400
I go on these expletive laced rants on my show.

2004
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:12,920
And you know what?

2005
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,640
Here's the thing, Peter, you know this as well as I.

2006
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,640
It will get a shit ton of views when I lose my shit.

2007
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,680
And I'm like, fuck these anti-vaxxers and everything.

2008
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,080
They're everything about them.

2009
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:28,920
And it will go crazy because doctors will be like, that's what I've been wanting to say forever because my elephant is conditioned a certain way, which is care versus harm.

2010
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,560
I want these children to live and not die of preventable disease.

2011
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,480
When you see a case of measles, you see whooping cough in the hospital, it will devastate you.

2012
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,160
And we're showing each other pictures of our kids.

2013
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,160
Like imagine one of our kids getting measles and you didn't vaccinate them.

2014
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,960
How am I going to feel about you as a person, as a doctor?

2015
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:47,200
So that kind of thing, it's easy and it's seductive.

2016
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:55,320
I like to think of the emperor in his robes going, yes, unleash your anger and you will replace your father by my side.

2017
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:58,760
And just beams of like dark force energy coming out.

2018
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,160
But the truth is that that is not going to influence those people.

2019
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:09,920
And I've had to struggle with this because my platform reached a lot of people and I get a lot of criticism on both sides of you're being too much of a dick or you're not being enough of a dick.

2020
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,640
And it's like the truth is nuanced and people hate nuance.

2021
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,120
And, you know, they hate it.

2022
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:17,120
And that's the thing about you.

2023
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:20,240
I remember you used to get really pissed when people would be like, so what are you eating now?

2024
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,360
What's your diet?

2025
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,480
And you're like, it changes.

2026
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,720
Not my diet isn't your diet.

2027
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,720
And then you would say the diet.

2028
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,520
And then in the comments, there'd be people like, I thought you were about ketones, man.

2029
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,760
You're a fraud.

2030
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,480
How dare you eat a molecule of carbohydrate?

2031
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,560
And they're super triggered because for them, this nutrition is a religion.

2032
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,560
And I've experienced that.

2033
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:43,280
We did a show about that documentary.

2034
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,280
What the health. Have you heard about this thing?

2035
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,440
Yeah, I haven't seen it.

2036
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:51,760
It's a bunch of docs there spouting vegan propaganda, cherry picking studies and saying,

2037
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,840
this is the only diet.

2038
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,760
There's a thing I have no problem with vegan diet.

2039
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,280
The thing is, it's not the only thing.

2040
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,800
Well, that's the funny thing.

2041
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:08,160
It's when you bring that up because that's the point I try to make is any diet that you do that's different from the sad, if you compare it to the sad is amazing.

2042
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,000
You can't do worse than the sad.

2043
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,800
The standard American diet.

2044
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:12,960
You can't accept eating more of it.

2045
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:27,960
So the only if you're if you're over here on the left side of my framework, you're eating a standard American diet, which is this incredibly perfectly engineered ratio of just the right amount of refined carbohydrates, the right amount of sugars, the right amount of fats.

2046
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:33,520
It's like you couldn't come up with a better way to kill someone than that diet.

2047
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:36,640
And I'm not really into the conspiracy theory that that's deliberate.

2048
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:40,160
I mean, I think the harm is absolutely not an intended consequence.

2049
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,560
It's the palatability.

2050
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,040
It's the shelf life.

2051
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,040
It's the cost.

2052
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,800
It's the all of these other things is the intended thing.

2053
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,160
It's basically driven by profitability.

2054
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:51,400
I mean, let's just call a spade a spade as an unfortunate consequence.

2055
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:57,000
The drug kills the user and that tends to be the case with good drugs.

2056
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,040
You know, eventually cigarettes are going to kill you.

2057
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,600
If you drink too much, it's going to kill you.

2058
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,600
If you eat too much sad, it's going to kill you.

2059
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:11,400
So you're starting out here in Sadland and then most people only realize one box on the on the framework, which is called.

2060
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:18,240
It's called a dietary restriction, which is when you restrict certain elements of what you can eat less sad.

2061
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:24,080
Well, it's yeah, but it's it's take something out of sad or reduce some element within sad.

2062
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,960
So you don't restrict when you eat.

2063
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,320
You don't restrict how much you eat.

2064
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,960
You just restrict certain elements of it.

2065
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,880
So it's an ad libitum diet that contains something or that is absent something in the sad.

2066
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:41,520
So a keto diet is a great example of dietary restriction, as is a paleo diet, as is a Mediterranean diet, as is a vegan diet,

2067
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:42,560
as is a vegetarian diet.

2068
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:44,040
These are all eggs.

2069
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:45,120
They're all so.

2070
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,600
So you think of all of the diets that people are out there talking about.

2071
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:56,480
They're basically talking about one little cluster of the state space in nutrition, which is dietary restriction.

2072
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:01,680
No one's talked about time restricted feeding, hypocaloric feeding, caloric restriction.

2073
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:05,560
So all of these guys are trying to nuke each other saying my diet's the best.

2074
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,120
No, my diet's the best. My diet's the best.

2075
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,200
But what they're forgetting is they're all comparing it to sad.

2076
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,320
Right. And guess what?

2077
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:15,280
You're all right. All of your diets are better than sad.

2078
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:19,160
I mean, that's like saying, like, my pancakes taste better than that dog shit over there.

2079
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,800
Yeah, I bet your pancakes will taste better than that dog shit, too.

2080
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,840
How dare you? My pancakes taste vastly worse than dog shit.

2081
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,240
By the way, that's a bumper sticker.

2082
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,760
My diet's better than sad.

2083
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,800
Like, that's like, yes, it is.

2084
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,560
So they're all at this reference point that's dumb.

2085
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,640
All of them contain. And it's relevant.

2086
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:38,040
It's just like there's too much focus on this whole thing.

2087
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:42,000
And so when people say to me, like, do you think a paleo diet is better than a vegan

2088
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,800
diet or vice versa? I'm like, it's kind of like an irrelevant question to me,

2089
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,360
truthfully. Like, if the alternative, if you're asking me, my choice is, you know,

2090
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,400
I'm going vegan or I'm going back to my standard American diet, I'm like, you better

2091
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,080
stay vegan. Yeah. Right.

2092
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:56,440
Yeah. Please don't ever deviate from this one

2093
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:59,680
thing if it's keeping you away from being on the standard American diet.

2094
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,400
Yeah. Well, you know, and for me, going from

2095
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:06,760
ketosis into kind of metatraining with intermittent fasting to now a feeding

2096
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,680
window of like once a day, that I finally found a sweet spot where it's not only

2097
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,920
good for me. In other words, I feel better.

2098
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:17,280
My labs are good, but I can do it and I enjoy that meal so much.

2099
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,480
And it allows me to be with my family during the meal we eat together.

2100
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,800
And I cheat on the weekend because I'm with my family.

2101
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,560
So it worked for me personally.

2102
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:28,600
Society that I think obesity is something that's going to take a multi-pronged

2103
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,520
approach and fat shaming.

2104
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:34,160
I did a video where it was a short rant and it was called It's Your Fault,

2105
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:35,160
Your Kid Is Obese.

2106
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,680
And my take was this and I love your opinion on this.

2107
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,760
I said, listen, yeah, there are social

2108
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,800
determinants of health. Yeah, food deserts exist.

2109
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,320
Yeah, it's hard to afford good food.

2110
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:50,880
But if your kid, absent a medical cause, is obese, it is fucking your fault.

2111
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,800
It is entirely your fault as a parent because you control what goes in that

2112
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:57,000
child's mouth. I'm talking about young kids and they don't make decisions.

2113
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,680
They'll say they'll throw a fit and stuff.

2114
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,040
And yeah, you can negotiate with them.

2115
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:03,040
But if you're giving them a soda or a big

2116
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:04,920
thing of orange juice, something like that, you got to understand, you're just

2117
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,680
giving them a load of sugar, they're drinking their calories and then they're

2118
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,160
obese, that is on you.

2119
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,280
You need to educate yourself.

2120
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,560
You need to understand these simple things.

2121
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:16,560
And a ton of people were like, yeah, it's finally some doctor says what we're

2122
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,040
thinking. But then a lot of people push back and they're like, sometimes this is

2123
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:24,600
fully systemic and you're asking somebody who has poor education to do this stuff.

2124
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,360
And I wonder where you stand on that.

2125
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,600
Am I wrong? Am I crazy?

2126
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:31,280
I mean, truthfully, I don't spend much time thinking about this problem at all

2127
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,720
anymore. It has been probably three years since this was something that was in my

2128
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:41,240
crosshairs. And as is often my want, when I'm laser focused on something, it is

2129
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,000
generally to the exclusion of almost everything else.

2130
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:49,000
So while I think that what you're describing from an end point is imminently

2131
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,800
relevant, I don't have the data to speak to it.

2132
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,800
My intuition is that it is probably not as extreme as you are stating it.

2133
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:05,720
I think I have over the years become more and more empathic might be the wrong word,

2134
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:06,960
but maybe it is the right word.

2135
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,960
Probably just a little.

2136
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:10,800
You know, I look at my family, for example, right.

2137
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:18,200
So my father knows everything I've ever thought, taught, described.

2138
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:22,600
My father will not for the life of him take one bit of advice from me,

2139
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:27,360
medically or diaterily. Is it because he's not intelligent enough to know?

2140
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,680
Is it because he can't afford to eat the way I suggest he would eat?

2141
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,720
No, there's some other reason there.

2142
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,680
And I don't know what it is, but I also don't know that it's his fault.

2143
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:40,560
You know, I just I don't know how to think of it in those terms.

2144
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,240
It's certainly vexing to me.

2145
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:49,640
And it's probably one of the sort of few triggers that still I have to be very

2146
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,960
conscious of not getting upset in that setting.

2147
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:54,440
But I just don't know.

2148
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,800
So in the example you gave, you know, you take those parents that are giving their

2149
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,320
kids whatever, I mean, the kids still drink regular soda.

2150
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,160
Is that still or has that been generally curbed out of the system?

2151
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,400
They still drink regular soda.

2152
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,520
And not only that, it's on the decline, isn't it?

2153
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:10,760
There are kids in this town that put the parents put Dr.

2154
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:14,240
Pepper fully sugared in a bottle and give it to the kid thinking it'll keep them

2155
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,920
quiet or it's healthy in some way.

2156
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:20,200
So, I mean, I guess to me, it's just hard for me to say that that parent is at fault

2157
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:25,040
because they're not playing with the same template that you or I are playing with.

2158
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,880
So again, if I were obsessed with this

2159
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,600
problem, I would solely be interested in changing the environment.

2160
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,640
So what is it that's making you put Diet Pepper in that bottle?

2161
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:34,720
Is it because it's cheaper?

2162
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,000
Is it because it's there?

2163
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,400
Is it because I had better shelf life?

2164
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,680
Is it because it tastes better and it shuts the kid up?

2165
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:42,000
Like, I want to understand why it's the Diet Pepper.

2166
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,960
And I want to figure out how it is you can put something that's not Diet Pepper in

2167
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,880
there that would still check what I consider sort of these four boxes of the

2168
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,840
default food environment.

2169
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,480
That's a nanny state, Peter.

2170
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:54,240
People don't want you taxing sugar or preventing it from being...

2171
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,240
And again, I don't know that taxing is the right way to do it.

2172
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:00,760
I mean, you know, one of the things that I had thought a lot about was an experiment

2173
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,600
that never got off the ground.

2174
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:06,800
So when I was still involved in this world, I used to have these sort of thought

2175
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,320
experiments and occasionally some of them become interesting ideas for actual

2176
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,000
experiments. I think this would have been one, but it would have been prohibitively

2177
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,200
expensive and I think logistically quite challenging.

2178
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:22,320
But it was to basically take two areas that were in reasonable proximity and

2179
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:26,360
similar to each other that were both quote unquote food deserts and do an

2180
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:31,600
experiment. So in the control group, you would give them an amount of money that

2181
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,480
was going to allow them to sort of buy whatever they want, but you wouldn't

2182
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,520
change the food environment or anything like that.

2183
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,640
So you just poured more fuel on whatever fire was there.

2184
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,080
And in the treatment group, and you, by the way, have to do this as a crossover.

2185
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,240
So it's not a random assignment.

2186
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:45,280
You have to cross them over.

2187
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:49,600
In the treatment group, you would do a whole bunch of other stuff, which is you

2188
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:55,320
teach them how to cook, you give them the money and oh, by the way, then you go

2189
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,480
into this is the really hard part of the experiment.

2190
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:02,800
You go into the stores where they will buy all of their food and you price

2191
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:07,520
switch everything, position, switch everything and see if you can create a

2192
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,240
new default. So the cocoa puffs are no longer $2.99.

2193
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:12,640
They're like $12.99.

2194
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:17,760
But, you know, the eggs and the avocado and, you know, maybe the steel cut oats,

2195
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,200
like those are now super cheap.

2196
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:22,080
And by the way, they're the ones that are sitting in the front of the store with

2197
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,040
like the buy two for one right now.

2198
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,960
But the cocoa puffs, you can still buy them.

2199
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:29,360
They're just four times more and you got to freaking find them and you got to ask

2200
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,600
Sally where they are.

2201
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,200
And Sally probably won't even remember where they are and they might not even be

2202
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:36,640
in stock. So it's like you totally change the food environment.

2203
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:40,520
And the fantasy I had was you ran these one year in parallel and then you crossed

2204
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,040
them over. And see, this is why it's so fucking hard to study nutrition, because

2205
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:45,160
that's what you would have to do.

2206
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,880
Yeah. And I had done the math on how much this was going to cost.

2207
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:51,720
I mean, there was a day when I used to think about this stuff so often that I I

2208
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,640
sort of had what a budget for this would be.

2209
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:57,920
And it was in the grand scheme of things not outrageous.

2210
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:03,240
I mean, it would be sort of one twentieth of the cost of developing a new drug, but

2211
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:05,480
still, you know, in the tens of millions of dollars.

2212
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,080
So we'll never do it because prevention, proactivity, looking at root causes, not

2213
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,320
something we do in American medicine.

2214
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,680
And, you know, when you were talking about giving people the tools, education, etc.,

2215
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,440
teaching them to cook, that's what we did at Turntable.

2216
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:18,760
So we had a teaching kitchen in our facility.

2217
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,800
We had health coaches that would teach, you know, Winnie the Pooh, how to cook in a

2218
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,400
food desert on a budget without honey.

2219
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,960
And it worked.

2220
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:29,720
So these patients transformed their lives and they would say, well, I really like the

2221
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:32,560
health coach and I felt accountable to them.

2222
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:36,560
And they felt like they cared about me and I didn't want to let either one of us down.

2223
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:40,800
And so this motivation component, the education component and then going to the

2224
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,480
supermarket, what the coaches would do, look at their shopping lists and go, yeah,

2225
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:44,320
you're fucking this up.

2226
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:47,480
So here's a here's a simple thing, you know, shopping the periphery of the

2227
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,120
supermarket, etc., all these little hacks.

2228
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,880
So it got to the heart of this issue of, first of all, patients need to feel like we

2229
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:57,000
actually care and they're being held accountable to some degree because we

2230
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,240
function in that way.

2231
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:01,480
If we're just left to our own device, like you and your dad, like your dad's like, I'm

2232
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,120
not going to listen to my son about this shit.

2233
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,600
And that's how my dad is the same thing.

2234
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:05,240
I can give him advice.

2235
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:05,840
He's like, whatever.

2236
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,440
There's an emotional component to it, but humans are humans and we're driven by these

2237
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,920
unconscious urges and processes.

2238
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:13,880
And until we are able to understand them, we can't hack them.

2239
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:17,000
And since it's all consciousness anyways, and if it matters, let me ask you a question

2240
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,120
that relating to this free will, do you think it's a real thing?

2241
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,720
Do you think humans actually make these choices?

2242
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:23,200
Oh boy.

2243
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:27,640
I mean, I would say this, if you asked me this question, uh, two years ago, I would

2244
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:28,760
have said, absolutely.

2245
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,880
100% on the free will train all day long.

2246
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,120
So people have free will.

2247
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:33,360
Yeah.

2248
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,680
Woo, woo, woo, woo free will all day.

2249
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:44,040
I am now in a gray area where I'm, I'm starting to begin to understand the

2250
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,840
counter argument.

2251
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:50,840
What I love about the counter argument is it's another great empathogen.

2252
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:56,960
That's, you know, how much easier it is to go through life when you stop being a

2253
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:01,280
pompous piece of shit who thinks you're so good because of your own free will.

2254
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,040
You just nailed what I was going to say, which is empathogen, which is an amazing

2255
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,880
word, something that generates empathy.

2256
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:12,920
When I came to the conclusion that free will was largely an illusion, but I have

2257
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:16,800
some nuance to that, but it was Sam, Sam Harris's book free will.

2258
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:21,160
And this idea that these thoughts and impulses bubble up from dark spaces that

2259
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,760
we cannot nail down.

2260
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:23,760
I made a decision.

2261
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,760
I made the decision.

2262
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:27,920
First of all, the state of eye is a bit of an illusion, but let's say there is an

2263
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,320
eye, a little guy behind our head pulling levers.

2264
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,760
How did he come to that choice?

2265
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,560
Well, it bubbled up from unconscious processes that we don't understand states

2266
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:35,600
and causes and conditions.

2267
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:40,720
And so as a result, when somebody does something dumb in a way, they could

2268
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:41,880
never have acted otherwise.

2269
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,480
The same person molecule for molecule could not have acted otherwise.

2270
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,440
And that's a tremendous empathogen because it means instead of judging them

2271
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:52,760
and getting angry, you can say, let's see if we can perturb this neuronal storm to

2272
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:56,320
spin in a slightly more productive way for what their goals are.

2273
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:59,080
And to clarify, I think one thing that someone listening to this might get

2274
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:03,400
confused by is that's not to say that there aren't consequences for the choices

2275
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:04,000
that are made.

2276
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:09,480
So if your absence of free will enabled you to decide you wanted to take a drink,

2277
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,880
you know, have a couple of white Russians and drive home and in the process you hit

2278
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,360
somebody, okay, maybe that, you know, maybe you didn't choose to do that or choose

2279
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:21,000
to make all of the decisions, the bad decisions that led you there, but there

2280
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,720
will be consequences for those actions.

2281
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,560
Yes, absolutely.

2282
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,080
And this is what people who say, you know, you don't think there's free will,

2283
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,360
then the whole criminal justice is involved.

2284
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:28,840
Exactly.

2285
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:31,680
They're sort of confusing and confounding two issues.

2286
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,080
They are because you murder someone.

2287
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,120
You made a choice to do it.

2288
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:34,800
You made a choice.

2289
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,720
Well, it wasn't free will.

2290
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,440
That's my argument.

2291
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,160
Your honor.

2292
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:37,440
Sure.

2293
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,840
You're going to jail forever.

2294
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:39,440
Why?

2295
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:43,040
Because we need to make sure that others who also don't have free will have their

2296
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,840
subminds conditioned that if you commit murder, you go to jail forever or you

2297
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:50,120
die, depending on what state you're in and whatever your beliefs are on the

2298
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:50,560
death penalty.

2299
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,240
And so as a result, that deterrent reconditions the unconscious that then

2300
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,600
allows different decisions to be made.

2301
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:00,040
So my feeling on free will is that it's actually much more nuanced.

2302
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:03,920
These subminds actually have their own free will and they feed it up and it's

2303
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,680
conditioned by our downward input.

2304
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,880
So what comes out as a consensus decision.

2305
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:12,320
And so in a way, yes, we are kind of in charge who we decide to be around.

2306
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,280
If I hang out with Peter Rotea, I'm going to be better for it.

2307
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:17,280
If I hang out with, you know, Charles Manson, I'm probably going to come up with

2308
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,480
some shitty, stupid ideas.

2309
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,000
If I fall into a Facebook hole where all I'm looking at is alt left or alt right

2310
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,520
or alt center, I'm going to miss.

2311
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:26,000
I'm going to be conditioned in a way that may be malproductive.

2312
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,320
So those things matter.

2313
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:28,200
There are consequences.

2314
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:28,680
We should hold them.

2315
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:33,160
So when I do the show about blaming, I say it's your fault that your kid is

2316
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:37,320
obese. My secret reason for doing that is not that I actually think they're to

2317
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:42,160
blame. It's that somebody will watch that and go, I never wait, what?

2318
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,200
I've been giving Dr.

2319
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,000
Pepper in the thing like it's my fault.

2320
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:45,600
What do you mean?

2321
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:49,040
And they and they just something clicks and they go, wait, so that I'm not

2322
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:49,640
supposed to do that.

2323
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:51,240
Okay, I'm going to I'm going to do something different.

2324
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:52,720
So it's a way of influencing.

2325
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,840
Now, it may not work.

2326
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,000
So blame may not work.

2327
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,080
There's some data that it doesn't.

2328
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:00,000
And in looking at hospital errors, just culture is one of these like blame free

2329
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:00,600
kind of scenarios.

2330
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:04,080
There's some data that people will hide and they won't come out and admit errors

2331
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,360
if they fear retribution, whereas in an environment where we're trying to make

2332
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,880
the system better, it could change.

2333
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,040
So again, it's a gaming this bigger system.

2334
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:11,800
Totally unrelated.

2335
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,600
In medicine, did you guys do Eminem?

2336
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,640
All the time.

2337
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:15,160
Okay.

2338
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:18,640
I was the presenting party in Eminem at least once.

2339
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,360
And that's morbidity and mortality.

2340
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:20,560
Yeah.

2341
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,040
Yeah.

2342
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,600
So, so it's really funny.

2343
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:25,560
I remember the first, this is totally off topic, but just what you said about the

2344
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,080
coming out.

2345
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:31,200
One of the things I miss the most about being in an academic medical center is

2346
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,720
Eminem, so the morbidity and mortality conference.

2347
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,560
So might as well just explain.

2348
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:38,360
And I assume it's the same in surgery as it is in medicine.

2349
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:42,240
Uh, what we would do is every Tuesday morning at 6am, there was no exception

2350
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:45,040
to this rule, like there was nothing that we get in the way of this conference.

2351
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,880
All of the surgeons, the residents, the fellows, the attendings, everybody

2352
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:53,760
would meet in a room and all of the complications or the morbidities, pardon

2353
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,480
me, the mortality, the morbidities, and then all of the deaths, the

2354
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:57,960
mortalities would be presented.

2355
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,480
And it was a very unemotional conference.

2356
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:04,480
So I would stand up there and I would say, Mr.

2357
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:08,920
Smith, uh, was a 47 year old man who came to the emergency room on such and such

2358
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,040
a day, presenting of left lower quadrant pain.

2359
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,480
We suspected diverticulosis, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2360
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:16,120
Took him to the OR did this, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

2361
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,720
and then, oh, and by the way, he had a pulmonary embolism and died

2362
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,600
six days later.

2363
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,760
Okay.

2364
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:28,560
And so you just unemotionally present the facts and then comes the process.

2365
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,120
Okay.

2366
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:30,640
Let's start with the basics.

2367
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,040
Was he on subq heparin?

2368
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,200
Was he up walking?

2369
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,800
Did he have a hypercoagulable state?

2370
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:35,400
Did you do this?

2371
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:35,920
Did you do this?

2372
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:36,400
Did you do this?

2373
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:40,720
And I've never been afraid of speaking in public with maybe one exception.

2374
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:44,360
That was a very difficult conference to present that.

2375
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,560
But by the time you were presenting, I.E.

2376
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,200
by the time you were senior enough to be the one to stand up there and present,

2377
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:53,200
you had seen the beauty of it and the benefit of it, which is it hurts.

2378
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,400
There's no denying it.

2379
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:58,720
It's, I mean, it's, it's a rectal exam without any lubrication.

2380
02:00:58,720 --> 02:00:58,920
Yep.

2381
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:00,480
But there's benefit.

2382
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:01,200
You see this.

2383
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:04,880
And so I remember when I left medicine, the first place I went to is to work at

2384
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:07,800
this consulting firm, McKinsey and company, which I loved, you know, another

2385
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,720
exceptional fun chapter of my life.

2386
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:14,680
But I remember like naively asking at one point, I'm like, why don't these

2387
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:15,720
companies do M&M?

2388
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:17,360
And everyone's like, what do you mean?

2389
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,400
They eat M&Ms all the time.

2390
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:19,600
And I'm like, Oh, no, no, sorry.

2391
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:20,520
I mean, morbidity, mortality.

2392
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:25,360
Like, why is it that there isn't a post hoc analysis of everything that goes wrong

2393
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:32,040
in a totally unemotional way that just, and the reason M&M works is it's

2394
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:33,080
completely closed.

2395
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:34,480
There is no legal recourse.

2396
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,680
So there's no hiding.

2397
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,760
Nobody who's not a part of surgery is allowed in that room.

2398
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,120
Yeah.

2399
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:43,760
And that's sort of what enables it to be that way, which I, look, if you're the,

2400
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:47,040
you know, if you're running a publicly traded company, you don't have that luxury.

2401
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:48,840
And I had the same experience with M&M.

2402
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:53,920
It was this horrible, painfully going up thing on this patient died because of a

2403
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,480
mistake that was made here and then having to go through that and everybody

2404
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,680
looking at you and being like, so what you did this, did you think about this?

2405
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,640
I did, but I decided this.

2406
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:04,760
Do you feel like that was a correct decision?

2407
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:09,400
Well, obviously not, but coming out just like, okay, first of all, I'm glad that

2408
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:12,600
that, that I was able to talk about this because you don't think I've been

2409
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:13,680
beating myself up about this.

2410
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,720
Like, I'm just a second year resident.

2411
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,320
Like this is devastating to me.

2412
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:18,840
Like I went into this to help people.

2413
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:23,320
My biggest fear is hurting people and I hurt someone and you come out so much

2414
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,040
stronger for it, even though you've been put through this wringer and we, you're

2415
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:26,800
right, we don't do that.

2416
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,440
Another, it's a blame culture.

2417
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:29,520
Like you get fired.

2418
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,560
If you screw up in, in a lot of businesses in the hospital, nurses often get fired

2419
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:35,080
if they make mistakes.

2420
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,600
And the truth is it ought to be a no blame culture.

2421
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:40,160
What was going on in that pixus dispensing system that allowed that medicine to be

2422
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:43,920
dispensed, even though you erroneously typed it in wrong and it was a paralyzing

2423
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:48,360
agent instead of a sedative and the person died under torture in the CT scanner and

2424
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:50,840
you didn't check on them because there was no protocol saying they had to be

2425
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:51,280
monitored.

2426
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:53,000
Well, we need to fix that.

2427
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,200
Was there malicious intent?

2428
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:55,000
Was there recklessness?

2429
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,880
Was there substance abuse on the part of the, of the nurse or the doctor?

2430
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:58,200
No.

2431
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:58,440
All right.

2432
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:01,480
Well, now we need to talk about how can we prevent this from happening and what is

2433
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,080
accountability?

2434
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:06,400
What does it mean in the setting of maybe free will not being entirely a real thing,

2435
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,440
but at the same time having us having to behave like it is or else people won't.

2436
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,720
It won't condition people to do the right thing.

2437
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:14,160
I love how we turn free will into M&M.

2438
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,440
I never get to talk about M&M.

2439
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:19,080
This is why this is why you and me need to do a show that no one will listen to.

2440
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:22,720
It's just you and me about stuff we care about, you know, having been through it all.

2441
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,640
What do you care about, Peter?

2442
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,920
Like, what are you interested in these days?

2443
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,360
What's driving you these days?

2444
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:32,520
And how can my experience because what I've done is so different as well.

2445
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,960
And I can't categorize it when people ask me, I want them just to stop talking because

2446
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:37,200
I'm like, I don't want to tell you this.

2447
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:38,840
Yeah, you have a part of a story.

2448
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:39,920
I don't know that it's harder.

2449
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,920
It's just it's just it's more complicated narrative.

2450
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:42,520
What do I say?

2451
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:45,320
I'm a professional clown because that's what my dad says.

2452
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,360
So you become a professional clown, huh?

2453
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:51,560
At least you're putting some non on the table because otherwise it's just f***, f***,

2454
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:52,280
you're just wasting.

2455
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,320
You went to all the medical school and now what are you doing?

2456
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,480
You're just, you know, jacking off on this camera.

2457
02:03:58,360 --> 02:03:59,400
He doesn't even know what that means.

2458
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,480
He just hears me say it and he's like, are you jacking off?

2459
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:04,720
I'm like, don't say that in mixed company.

2460
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:06,760
It's not something, you know.

2461
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:10,320
So, you know, you're spending your time with your you're between San Diego and New

2462
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:13,440
York, you're doing all this cool stuff, you're talking with like really smart people on

2463
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,240
your podcast.

2464
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:16,280
What's driving you right now?

2465
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,880
Personally or professionally, because there's a bit of a divide.

2466
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:22,720
I want to go personally, actually.

2467
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,440
OK, let's go professional first.

2468
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:29,640
I would say professionally, I am really, really obsessed with the question of what is the

2469
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:35,240
appropriate dose of caloric restriction and the frequency.

2470
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:38,720
And of the molecules that mimic that.

2471
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:45,280
So when you start to think about metformin, rapamycin especially and complete caloric

2472
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:49,320
restriction. So I've really lost interest in much of the junior stuff that gets close to

2473
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:52,840
there. So I sort of view that as filler when you're not fasting.

2474
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:55,200
OK, let me interrupt for a second for my medical audience.

2475
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:58,000
A lot of them are going to have no fucking clue what you just said.

2476
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:03,760
So rapamycin, metformin, caloric restriction operating on the principle that a lot of studies

2477
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:08,840
in animals, mammals show that some form of caloric restriction increases longevity through

2478
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:10,040
a series of mechanisms.

2479
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:14,440
And there are molecules and receptors that might mimic or be at least partially

2480
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:19,000
responsible for the action of this caloric restriction in terms of promoting longevity.

2481
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,960
Rapamycin is one, metformin might be another.

2482
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:21,320
Yes.

2483
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:24,720
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I understood because I am dumb about this stuff.

2484
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,280
Yeah, no, thank you for clarifying that.

2485
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:32,760
So molecules like metformin, which have a net effect of activating an enzyme called AMP

2486
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,680
kinase, which is a nutrient sensing enzyme.

2487
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:38,440
It mimics something that you see when you're being deprived of calories.

2488
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:44,080
Conversely, rapamycin inhibits something called the mechanistic target of rapamycin.

2489
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:45,360
They got very creative on the naming.

2490
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,200
MTOR.

2491
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:48,320
MTOR would be a great superhero.

2492
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:49,800
Sounds like a he-man bad guy.

2493
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:50,560
Absolutely.

2494
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:50,840
Skeletor.

2495
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:51,600
It should have been an X-Men.

2496
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:52,360
It should have been.

2497
02:05:53,080 --> 02:06:00,000
So rapamycin inhibits that MTOR, which is sort of the central nutrient sensor for amino acids.

2498
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:04,280
So again, when you inhibit MTOR, you are mimicking deprivation of amino acids.

2499
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:09,280
And then of course, there's just the old fashioned way to do it, which is just don't have anything but water.

2500
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:13,360
And that's, that seems to work really well, provided you do it in short enough periods of time.

2501
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:17,200
I mean, if you do it indefinitely, you arrive at a state called malnutrition and you die.

2502
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:24,320
But the problem is we don't have a clue what the optimal dose is.

2503
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:34,520
So if you treat caloric restriction like a drug, meaning don't eat for this long a period of time and then repeat that at this frequency, we don't know the answer to that question.

2504
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:38,880
Furthermore, we don't know, like, do you need to go all the way?

2505
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:45,320
Could you just eat 500 calories a day for a certain period of time and repeat that at a certain frequency?

2506
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:50,120
So you pretty quickly realize that it becomes an infinite problem.

2507
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:54,960
You have the number of calories you consume somewhere from zero to something not too big.

2508
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:03,080
The composition of those calories, if it's anything but zero, the duration at which you're exposed to that and the frequency with which you repeat it.

2509
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:13,880
And then by the way, if you want to add a fourth variable, since we're talking quantum physics, add that whole three layer three space onto the what you consume when you're not doing that.

2510
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,960
The problem becomes ridiculous and it's unsolvable.

2511
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,000
That's an unsolvable problem.

2512
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,840
So what do you do when you're an engineer and you have an unsolvable problem?

2513
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:32,840
You take a guess at states that would be discreet enough that they're not too close to each other, that they should overlap that much and you would test them.

2514
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:43,040
So you would ask the question, well, if caloric restriction and or rapamycin and or metformin extend life, what would be some of the readout states of that?

2515
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:55,960
So my obsession professionally is understanding those readout states and basically collaborating with and facilitating the funding of research to answer those questions.

2516
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:03,320
So there will be assays that need to be created to measure the readout states of that, including things like autophagy.

2517
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:07,760
So autophagy, as the name suggests, autophagy, self eating.

2518
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:18,760
That is generally regarded as probably the most important, though not the only mechanistic change that occurs under caloric restriction and administration of rapamycin.

2519
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,600
Undertaking this line of research, as you said, is very complex.

2520
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:26,640
And what you're ultimately trying to figure out is really what what is the best mix of variables?

2521
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:33,960
Yeah, because I have a fasting routine that I literally pulled out of my ass and I have patients that are doing slightly different ones or the same ones.

2522
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:37,520
And I have patients that aren't fasting at all because it's still a bit scary.

2523
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,360
And, you know, in the end, I just sort of want to be able to give a dose response.

2524
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:49,640
You know, I want to be able to say to a patient, look, if you want to go all in, this would be as reasonable or as aggressive a protocol as you might want to take.

2525
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,120
But look, you could get 50 percent of the benefit of that doing this and you could get 20 percent of the benefit doing this.

2526
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:58,720
And if you stack this with this, you can do X, Y and Z.

2527
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:09,760
So I have spent years experimenting on myself with this stuff, but the measurement tools that I have are too blunt to actually make any reasonable inference.

2528
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:10,880
So you need a better study.

2529
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,120
I need much better tools to measure what we care about.

2530
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,680
So that's your passion now.

2531
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:18,280
And you also treat patients trying to help them.

2532
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,760
Are you using these medications on patients?

2533
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,080
Metformin, yes.

2534
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:23,080
Rapamycin, no.

2535
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:25,720
Right. Because rapamycin is a transplant rejection drug.

2536
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:28,760
Yes. Now, rapamycin gets a bit of a bad rap.

2537
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:31,040
It's a much safer drug than people realize.

2538
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,360
Like I would be less afraid of a patient taking rapamycin than ciprofloxacin.

2539
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:36,800
Well, yeah, exactly.

2540
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:37,760
At the right dose.

2541
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:38,880
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2542
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,040
And at the right frequency.

2543
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:45,560
I mean, I wouldn't want a patient taking rapamycin at the frequency that we gave it to a kidney transplant patient.

2544
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:52,760
But we certainly know enough now based on all of the literature out there, including literature in humans, dogs, etc.

2545
02:09:53,160 --> 02:10:02,960
That rapamycin given at certain doses, at certain frequencies, actually enhances the immune system and improves many metrics of physiology.

2546
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:10,160
So if you talk about giving rapamycin at that dose versus giving, you know, cipro for a bad UTI, I'll take rapa all day long.

2547
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:22,200
I mean, given how small my interaction is with patients, because I have so few of them, the fact that I've already known two patients who in the course of their life have had tendon injuries during the course of fluoroquinolones,

2548
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,600
I've become sort of paranoid about these antibiotics, which might be an overreaction, by the way.

2549
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:29,480
I'm not sure it is, man, because we used to give them out like candy.

2550
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:35,800
It was a moxie cipro era when I was training and everybody with pneumonia got that because it covered all kinds of shit.

2551
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:38,720
And then, you know, essentially, we didn't see a lot of tendon stuff.

2552
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,200
It might be it was seen as an outpatient.

2553
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:49,360
It's just about to say the research I've looked into this is you have about a six month window of susceptibility to tendon injury following fluoroquinolone.

2554
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:54,000
What we saw more often was a higher incidence of C. diff, C. difficile, bowel infection.

2555
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,600
In fact, I had a patient.

2556
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,800
Have you done any songs on C. diff?

2557
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,600
Yes, it's called Dawn of the Diff.

2558
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:02,200
And I took a lot of rapamycin, saw a cabussa rap about.

2559
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:03,600
Yeah, it was it was really dumb.

2560
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:12,800
It was one of our early songs, but it was all about how people will come asking with intent for a cold antibiotics and go away with a debilitating bowel infection that could be fatal.

2561
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:20,880
And I had a patient who died of it coded in the CT scanner and had a huge paracolonic abscess from C. diff.

2562
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,160
And I remember telling his son, who was a marathon runner, that his dad had died.

2563
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:31,960
I was in the ICU and it was one of the most I'll never forget it because the whole thing was iatrogenic.

2564
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:35,360
I mean, it was caused by one error after one error after another.

2565
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:40,880
And this is one thing I want to say, because I think your listeners in particular, they're not all, you know, doctors and medical people.

2566
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,760
They may be scientists or people who care about this stuff.

2567
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:51,920
You don't understand how fucked up and terrible the hospital is as a place to be safe and taken care of.

2568
02:11:52,280 --> 02:12:04,840
It is a disastrous zone of chaos, of infection, of errors, of poor system design, of lack of coordination and of expense that doesn't need to be done.

2569
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:12,920
And until we feel that emotionally in our elephant, we're going to continue to perpetuate a broken system.

2570
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:17,960
We have to wake up and realize that even maybe we need AI to help coordinate our care.

2571
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:19,280
Maybe we need better technology.

2572
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:20,600
Maybe we need better processes.

2573
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:25,880
But none of it's happening because our incentives are still fee for service, which is we get paid to do things to people.

2574
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:28,240
And in a hospital, you can do a shit ton to people.

2575
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,600
The hospital gets paid.

2576
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:34,800
Nobody's incentivized to make it safer, even though we all have a story of someone who we love or we took care of who died because of it.

2577
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:36,600
And we got injured because of a medical error or got injured because of a medical error.

2578
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:39,280
So to me, this has become a recent passion.

2579
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:45,440
So when I hear you talking about rapamycin, I get excited because maybe we can keep people out of the hospital with do the selective use.

2580
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:50,480
I think the thing about rapamycin that's so exciting is it doesn't just increase lifespan.

2581
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:58,240
I mean, if that's all it did, it wouldn't be that interesting because the US health care system is pretty good at increasing lifespan in the presence of deteriorating health.

2582
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,960
We can torture you in the ICU for years.

2583
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:04,080
We can keep you alive for an extra year if your aorta ruptures, if we're really willing to go all in.

2584
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,120
ECMO. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

2585
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:09,760
But it's the increase in health span that comes with it or stated more accurately.

2586
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,440
It's the reduction in the rate of health span decline.

2587
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,800
That's because it's always going to decline.

2588
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:16,520
You're never going to be able to do it 90 what you did at third.

2589
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:24,960
That's right. That's right. My intention is to sort of understand what the 20 requirements are to be a kickass 100 year old.

2590
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:29,320
So consider like a new Olympic sport is the centenarian decathlon.

2591
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:37,560
So you figure out what all those metrics are and then engineer your way back to what you need to be able to do at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 to hit that target.

2592
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:40,680
So that's the second professional problem I'm obsessed with.

2593
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:57,280
So the first one is this whole thing around developing finer tools to probe the molecular places where we're going to see readout states on caloric restriction, rapamycin, metformin, other agents that are CR mimetics, meaning drugs that mimic caloric restriction.

2594
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:10,240
And then the second completely independent obsession is codifying what does the perfect training routine look like that makes me at 100 the thing I have in my mind.

2595
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:14,080
In other words, that's why I don't actually care if I can swim 25 miles today.

2596
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:16,520
I don't care if I can ride my bike 200 miles.

2597
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,360
I don't care if I can deadlift 500 pounds anymore.

2598
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:20,360
Like none of those things matter to me anymore.

2599
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:27,240
Not that they weren't interesting and valuable and beneficial at one point in my life, but I don't think they matter enough.

2600
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,880
To the centenarian decathlon.

2601
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,080
That makes a lot of sense.

2602
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:35,000
And it kind of brings it back to what your what your goals are and how you're changing over time.

2603
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,600
And we all are.

2604
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:36,320
That's the thing.

2605
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:38,280
People expect something static of human beings.

2606
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,720
They expect us to be the same person.

2607
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,400
We were here and here and here and here and here.

2608
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:46,360
And I think for me, that's very uncomfortable because I think we evolve over time and our interests evolve.

2609
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:51,160
And I think medicine as an entity is a complex evolving organism.

2610
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:54,520
We treat it like some easy system or something we can game or something.

2611
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,120
It's not.

2612
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:56,920
Do you have any thoughts on what you would do?

2613
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,800
If you had a magic wand, how would you reform health care from a payment model?

2614
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:01,880
Have you ever thought about that stuff?

2615
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:06,440
I have actually, but not in a very long time.

2616
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:12,560
I think my answers are conceptually quite simple, but practically almost impossible.

2617
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:20,360
So I'll start with a story and I've actually given a talk on this once, you know, before we were shooting this breeze here, I was explaining how much I hate giving talks.

2618
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:20,720
Yeah.

2619
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:23,800
But one of the talks I gave was actually on this particular issue.

2620
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,400
It's the only time I've ever spoken about it.

2621
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:26,480
It's like 100 years ago.

2622
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,520
But I started with this example.

2623
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:32,320
So I had a friend who's an expat, who's an American, but living in Saudi Arabia.

2624
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:40,320
But he would always spend like June, July, August, September back in DC because, you know, obviously it's pretty hot in Riyadh those that time of the year.

2625
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,920
And I remember him saying that I don't even know how this came up.

2626
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:47,920
It just was like in the conversation that he left the air conditioning on for those four months.

2627
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,320
And he would just set it like in a matter of passing.

2628
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:54,680
I was like, Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, what do you mean you leave the air conditioning on for four months?

2629
02:15:54,920 --> 02:16:03,720
He's like, well, like if you didn't leave the air conditioning on when you come back in October, like it's going to be 120 degrees in your apartment.

2630
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:09,360
And I was like, yeah, but you'll turn the AC on and in like three hours, it'll be 75 degrees.

2631
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:13,600
He's like, yeah, but that would take like three hours of being like balls hot.

2632
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:18,640
And I was like, dude, I'm struggling to understand the logic here.

2633
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:20,080
He goes, oh, you don't understand.

2634
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,480
Like we don't pay for our energy in Saudi Arabia.

2635
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,080
I forget what the number was.

2636
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:27,480
It cost like $2 a month to keep my air conditioning on the whole summer.

2637
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:33,280
So for me, spending eight bucks or 19 bucks, whatever it was to keep my air conditioning on all summer is totally worthwhile.

2638
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:38,280
And so we can listen to that in the United States and we can laugh our asses off at how ridiculous that is.

2639
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:41,920
And oh, those stupid governments subsidizing their people.

2640
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:44,920
And that's the root of all evil in the Middle East and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2641
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:49,480
And it's like, hey, dude, get off your high horse and take a look at the US health care system.

2642
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:50,720
It's a long story.

2643
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:58,600
But I basically got a bunch of data to plot out what the P and L looked like of the US health care system, which turned out to be much harder than I expected.

2644
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:01,840
This took all of my McKinsey ninja skills to get these data.

2645
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:12,360
And if you plotted basically where the dollars come in and who makes the decisions on where the dollars get spent, guess what?

2646
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:14,040
We're in Saudi Arabia, brother.

2647
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:19,040
The people who are driving the cost are not bearing the cost.

2648
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:29,600
And so it's not that dissimilar from you going to the Lexus dealer and knowing that you only have to pay 9 percent of the cost of whatever car you get.

2649
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:39,000
Do you really think that the parking lot that I'm looking at now would look as it does if people were only on the hook for 9 percent of the car that they got?

2650
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:40,120
No.

2651
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:49,880
So fundamentally, if you want to fix the cost issue, you must be able to couple decision making to spend.

2652
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:52,400
You can't have those uncoupled and they're currently uncoupled.

2653
02:17:53,240 --> 02:18:02,880
But the other thing that is worth mentioning and I'll get off my soapbox on health care is there are two other legs of health care that often get confused with the third.

2654
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:07,280
So so you have cost, you have access and you have quality.

2655
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,160
And you don't get to move one without the others coming along.

2656
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:14,440
So you can't fix one independently.

2657
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:20,520
So the other thing that sort of frustrates me when people talk about health care, which is why I never talk about it.

2658
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,240
I view it like religion and politics.

2659
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:26,560
I just I've decided I don't give a shit at all.

2660
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:27,880
I don't care what anybody thinks.

2661
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:31,280
I don't want anybody to know what I think, although you've asked and now you're stuck hearing what I think.

2662
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:38,120
But what bothers me is that when people talk about this, they talk about those three things like they're independent variables.

2663
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:44,360
Whereas the moment you decide, well, Canada's got the best health care system in the world because of X, Y and Z.

2664
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:47,240
It's like, no, no, no, that's actually not correct.

2665
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:49,760
You have to understand what Canada has optimized for.

2666
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:52,560
Canada has optimized for cost.

2667
02:18:53,280 --> 02:19:00,480
They've optimized for quality to some extent and they've optimized for access, but not in the immediate sense.

2668
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:04,520
So the difference is in Canada, it's cheaper and you have X, Y and Z.

2669
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:15,280
But like if you want to go and you know, like things that you and I would take for granted, like if you tore your ACL or suspected you tore your ACL, you would have an MRI within 24 hours here.

2670
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:19,880
That's not going to happen in Canada unless you have the money to cross the border and get it done in the United States.

2671
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,040
You could easily wait six months for an MRI there.

2672
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,840
Access to physicians.

2673
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,040
I mean, the stories are horrible.

2674
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:26,640
And I know this because my whole family is still there.

2675
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:29,160
So it's not just like I'm sort of making this stuff up.

2676
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:31,080
I mean, I'm seeing what they're going through.

2677
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:33,680
And yet there are still things that are amazing in Canada.

2678
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:39,000
Like when my father had an enormous operation there, I was totally impressed with his care.

2679
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:45,560
I mean, it was as good as care he would have received at a great US hospital and it didn't cost a penny.

2680
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:55,600
And that blows my mind because you don't need these sort of nonsense internal accounting system that we have in US hospitals where like the cup that you collect your urine in is 78 bucks.

2681
02:19:55,920 --> 02:20:00,640
And you know, like that bag of IV saline over there is 100 bucks and all this kind of nonsense.

2682
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:12,960
So the short answer is if I could wave a magic wand on this system, as much as I hate to say it, on some level, you have to have at least a blanket called a single payer system.

2683
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:20,160
I do believe that if you truly try to individually privatize this thing, you cannot get that silly decouple out.

2684
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:25,560
The second thing, and this is also very unpopular to say, is I do think we as patients need more skin in the game.

2685
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:32,240
Now, of course, under the current pricing regime, that would be impossible, right?

2686
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:37,480
You couldn't allow patients to be exposed to more than the 9% that we're already exposed to.

2687
02:20:37,480 --> 02:20:38,960
And it's probably higher by now, by the way.

2688
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:39,880
Those are old data.

2689
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:48,560
You would probably know what the current exposure is, but because the prices are so inflated and so nonsensical, and as you probably know, I mean, you obviously know this, but maybe the listeners don't.

2690
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:52,440
I mean, medical cost is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy.

2691
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:55,280
So the answer is in patients need to spend more.

2692
02:20:55,280 --> 02:21:02,680
They just need to own a greater share of the cost, which really means the total cost can't be a bullshit scam, which is sort of what it is right now.

2693
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:07,120
So as interesting and important as all of that stuff is, I never think about it.

2694
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:09,880
I love it.

2695
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:13,080
Yeah, here's my solution to this very complex problem, and I don't think about it at all.

2696
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:13,880
You know what's funny?

2697
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:19,160
Everything you just said, I've been batting around this quite a bit because it's part of what I try to do.

2698
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:20,320
I have a solution.

2699
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,160
I'm going to pitch you real quick.

2700
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:26,920
I think it fulfills most of what you're saying because our plans again converge like many things.

2701
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:29,640
It's strange when people think about these things independently and they converge.

2702
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:30,720
We've never talked about this.

2703
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:33,000
So my plan for fixing health care is this.

2704
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:37,520
First of all, you need to put patients in the game.

2705
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:41,360
And the way you do that is you give them a personal health account up to about $2,500.

2706
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,880
If you're very poor, that can be subsidized by the government.

2707
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:45,280
What do you use that for?

2708
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:50,320
You use that for primary care services or out of pocket expenses.

2709
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,200
Use it or lose it.

2710
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:54,280
Well, it's use it or maybe it grows.

2711
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,200
Maybe you keep it.

2712
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:56,560
But it has to be used within health care.

2713
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:58,120
So there's no incentive to not spend it.

2714
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:58,880
Exactly.

2715
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,000
You want to use it in health care.

2716
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,800
And the thing is you want to use it for primary care.

2717
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:13,160
And the way you do primary care right is the way we did Turntable Health, which is a flat membership fee for an unlimited all you can treat access to a relationship driven, preventative minded, team based health care.

2718
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:15,320
That's technology enabled, but not enslaved.

2719
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:17,760
That's evidence informed, but not evidence enslaved.

2720
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:18,800
You can look at the unique patient.

2721
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:29,760
You're not subject to metrics beyond the patient having outcomes that matter to them because otherwise they will take their money and they will they'll take their personal health account and they'll go somewhere else.

2722
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,960
So it's people competing with each other based on what they're providing to the patient.

2723
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,960
So you would be on that plan.

2724
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:35,680
They use the money to pay you, etc.

2725
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:40,960
Once they reach that $2,500, then it gets into deductible space.

2726
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:47,360
So at this point, if you're a rich person, that deductible may be $7,500 or whatever it is for your family, which it is now.

2727
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:48,360
So it's like that now.

2728
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:55,360
If you're poor, it might be subsidized by either your employer or by the government to some degree, but your skin is still somewhat in the game.

2729
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:56,840
And so you're paying for that.

2730
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:03,000
Now, once you reach the deductible, that's where the catastrophic Medicare kicks in.

2731
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:05,800
That is Medicare for all, but not in the single payer sense.

2732
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:06,760
It doesn't pay for everything.

2733
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:08,800
It's not like carte blanche fee for service.

2734
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:09,760
You get whatever you want.

2735
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:13,720
It's a catastrophic wraparound.

2736
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:17,560
If you go to the hospital, it will cover it after you paid your deductible after you use your personal health account.

2737
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,800
And it's given out and administered in the same way that Medicare advantages.

2738
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:28,520
In other words, different entities compete to be the most efficient with that money.

2739
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:33,320
So in other words, if a hospital system can actually keep you out of the hospital, it doesn't spend all the money.

2740
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,920
It gets to keep the shared savings, something like that.

2741
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:37,480
So you have businesses competing.

2742
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:38,960
You have the government covering everybody.

2743
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,160
Nobody falls through the cracks.

2744
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:41,520
Hospitals compete.

2745
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:42,400
Doctors compete.

2746
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:44,680
But everybody gets to practice the way they want.

2747
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:47,160
You get to choose your doctor and their skin in the game.

2748
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:50,720
And it doesn't bankrupt the country because you need maybe another six percent tax.

2749
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:54,160
And it's equitable, but not completely unfair.

2750
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:55,520
And I think that's how you do it.

2751
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:57,000
But the center of it is prevention.

2752
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,880
Primary care is the engine that drives it.

2753
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:01,000
And that also amelieates burnout.

2754
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:05,000
And then you focus on technology that actually enables that quality science that actually enables that.

2755
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:12,200
And if you discover that, you know, there's a particular dosing of rapamycin and you have a clinic that does that, you're going to win the competition game and your science will disseminate.

2756
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,160
And then other people steal it and it'll elevate the game.

2757
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,200
So that that's my theory.

2758
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:16,360
I mean, it's very interesting.

2759
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:18,600
Obviously, I think a lot of that makes sense.

2760
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:25,200
The one thing that is very challenging in these systems, which are because there's a portion of what you're describing is almost capitated.

2761
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:25,920
Yes, right.

2762
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:34,280
The challenge of these systems is and this is why as much as I would love to say this should all be done privately without the government.

2763
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:44,120
I think the one advantage the government has going for it, if it knows how to play its cards right, which unfortunately it doesn't always, is it owns the patient life forever.

2764
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:48,160
And therefore it is truly incentivized to participate in a capitated way.

2765
02:24:48,720 --> 02:25:03,600
The challenge of privatizing this is the median tenure of a patient with a payer, be it an insurance company or their employee employer is, you know, in the neighborhood of what, four or five years.

2766
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,800
So less than that.

2767
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:05,680
Yeah, maybe less than that.

2768
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:23,360
So, so if you have prediabetes right now, the cost to normalize you, in fact, if you are a newly diagnosed type two diabetic today, or you have naphal D today, and I know I only own your life for three or four more years.

2769
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:33,360
I have zero incentive to spend one penny because the macrovascular and microvascular diseases that are going to destroy your life in 20 years.

2770
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:34,720
I'm going to be so long gone.

2771
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,520
I won't even know you.

2772
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:36,800
I won't even remember your name.

2773
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:43,440
And actually, this is a central piece of this, which is in this country, we medicalize our social problems.

2774
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:48,800
So diabetes to a large extent, you know, in these very high utilizers is a social problem.

2775
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:54,000
It's poverty, it's bad, it's lack of job security, it's inability to exercise because of danger in the community, these kinds of things.

2776
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,920
It's adverse childhood experiences.

2777
02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:04,640
So as a result, if you start shunting money from healthcare into those social services, like every other industrialized country does, you can actually squeeze down on it.

2778
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,560
You can squeeze down the overall cost.

2779
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:08,080
So that may ameliorate some of this.

2780
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,400
But that would have to be done centralized.

2781
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:12,400
There is no way any entity but the government is going to do that.

2782
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:13,600
I agree.

2783
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:14,480
I agree with you.

2784
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:16,160
I think that's the role for government.

2785
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,160
And people will disagree, the hardcore libertarians will disagree.

2786
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:18,800
I don't care.

2787
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,080
Well, here's the funny thing.

2788
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:26,640
I consider myself, again, libertarian is such a broad term that it doesn't mean much because like you have such extremes on that.

2789
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:31,600
But I actually found Michael Lewis's book, The Fifth Risk, to be quite interesting.

2790
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:32,400
I'll check it out.

2791
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,320
I knew about half of it quite well.

2792
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:38,400
I knew a lot about what the DOE does and what the USDA does.

2793
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:41,600
But I didn't have much of a sense of what the Department of Commerce does.

2794
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,080
And his book is a very depressing book.

2795
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:46,640
So I don't want to get into the politics of the book.

2796
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:56,800
But absent all of the politics, if nothing else, whatever your political views are, is simply an exercise in civics to understand what your government does.

2797
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,760
Because we have a lot of examples of what they do poorly.

2798
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,440
I mean, and I'm as guilty of that as anybody.

2799
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:06,080
I can rattle off a hundred things that they are mindlessly incompetent at.

2800
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:09,280
I think Lewis does a great job explaining things that they are competent at.

2801
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:13,360
And in fact, so competent at that we don't realize how many close calls we have.

2802
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:13,680
Right.

2803
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:18,880
And he does that through going through what AG does, energy does, commerce does.

2804
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:20,320
It's a very quick read.

2805
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:22,320
I think I read it in a day and a half.

2806
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:23,440
It was a hard time putting it down.

2807
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:24,480
It was so good.

2808
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:26,160
A day and a half of busy work, by the way.

2809
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:26,320
Right.

2810
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:26,880
Yeah, yeah.

2811
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:30,320
But this is why the center probably holds the truth for in most cases.

2812
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,360
That's where I am too.

2813
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:32,640
I think government has a role.

2814
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,560
Listen, people will say, oh, get government out of healthcare.

2815
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:35,440
We can't have them in healthcare.

2816
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:38,800
They're already 50% of healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid, all this.

2817
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:40,640
Chip, they are a huge bear.

2818
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:41,440
Yeah, at least 50.

2819
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,560
Yeah, at least 50.

2820
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:43,440
So think of VA.

2821
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:43,920
Yeah.

2822
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:44,560
Think about that.

2823
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:46,880
So now you're like, okay, well, how can we optimize them?

2824
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:49,120
And don't let them break stuff that they have no business in,

2825
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,640
but then have them do what they really do well.

2826
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,560
And I think that some of that social support is something we do well.

2827
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:55,120
We don't have the political on this country, I think, to come together on that.

2828
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:58,880
But if we did, we'd stop putting the moral distress on us as caregivers.

2829
02:27:58,880 --> 02:27:59,760
Because we feel terrible.

2830
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:01,360
It's a hamster wheel.

2831
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:03,360
You know, when I go around at the county, I did this week,

2832
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:05,120
every single patient there doesn't need to be there.

2833
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:06,240
All preventable.

2834
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:07,840
It's all social determinants.

2835
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:09,280
It's substance abuse.

2836
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:12,640
It's adverse childhood experiences, people who were abused, sexually and otherwise.

2837
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:14,880
And that manifests as adult chronic diseases.

2838
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:15,440
We know this.

2839
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:16,720
So this is the thing.

2840
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:19,920
I want to say one thing because I think my followers and yours will want to know how.

2841
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:21,280
You're not scalable as a doctor.

2842
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:22,320
You do amazing things.

2843
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:25,760
How are people going to find doctors like you that think so differently

2844
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:30,720
and are treating people in a way that is trying to maximize these outcomes that you talk about?

2845
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:34,720
I mean, I think there were already sort of organizations that organized around this

2846
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:36,800
through functional medicine and things like that.

2847
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,840
I'm not being facetious.

2848
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,840
I probably get 250 emails a day.

2849
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:44,240
Now, obviously, a number of those are directly work-related, you know, patients,

2850
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:45,120
colleagues, whatever.

2851
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:50,080
But a very high number of those, which unfortunately I just can't respond to for the most part,

2852
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:53,360
are, you know, through the blog or through the podcast or something saying,

2853
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:58,560
hey, you know, Peter, I live in St. Louis and I've been listening to your podcast or reading this,

2854
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:04,320
and I'm interested in the way you're thinking about metabolism or this or that or the other thing.

2855
02:29:04,320 --> 02:29:09,520
My doctor kind of rejects everything you're talking about as I have 12 minutes to see him.

2856
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:13,520
And like, it's basically refilling my blood pressure medication and that's it.

2857
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:15,760
Is there a doc in St. Louis that you know that you like?

2858
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:19,200
And so the answer to these questions is inevitably and invariably always, I don't.

2859
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:20,640
I just, you know, I don't know.

2860
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:26,720
Once in a blue moon, I get asked that question and the person is asking it from a place that I know.

2861
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,600
And I'm like, great.

2862
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:31,680
I used to always tell people about you in Vegas until they couldn't come and see you.

2863
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,960
So what we're actually doing is creating a doctor database on our site.

2864
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:40,080
And we're making it a pain in the ass for the doctors to fill out

2865
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:42,080
because I want them to do some work, right?

2866
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:47,120
So it's like, you got to come to the site, you got to answer a lot of questions and really get into the weeds on like,

2867
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:51,920
how much time do you spend each month learning about this subject or that subject or this subject?

2868
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,400
What is your process of reeducation?

2869
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:56,080
What is your philosophy on medicine?

2870
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:01,920
Because I think in about 2500 words or less, and I maybe we allocated a thousand words or whatever.

2871
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:08,640
I don't remember what it was, but we gave quite a bit of room for people to basically explain how they think about medicine.

2872
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:15,120
Because even though I can't do it in 30 seconds, if given three minutes, I could probably provide a reasonable overview.

2873
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:22,000
And then the goal is to basically figure out a way to get that to be a critical mass such that it now becomes just a sort of directory for patients.

2874
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:31,440
So someone can say, if my zip code is this, boom, pull up all doctors within 20 miles, and then they'll be able to go and then read about those people.

2875
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:39,600
And obviously, it's impossible for me to vet these physicians so that this is in no way, shape or form means like, I'm putting an endorsement on this person.

2876
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:46,080
Chris Cresser has done a bit of that through his work, through he can at least vouch for, you know, so-and-so has taken this course.

2877
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:55,760
But my hope is that given the hurdle of how much work goes into that, it's not just someone mindlessly saying, I'm a doc, I want another portal of referral.

2878
02:30:55,760 --> 02:31:01,360
If it streamlines the process for patients by 50%, it's still valuable. I think it could be more valuable than that.

2879
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:05,280
How can my fans help with this? These are all healthcare people, activist patients.

2880
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:16,400
They should just go and sign up. So if you go to PeterAttiaMD.com, I don't look at my website enough to know, but I'm sure that somewhere on there, it is Physician Network or something like that.

2881
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:23,360
It's not a porn site, so you have no business on it, pretty much. That's my criteria, usually.

2882
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:39,600
We've touched on this briefly, but I don't think we've done it justice, which is your music videos are at once both incredibly funny and actually at times incredibly touching.

2883
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:52,720
Some of them are very moving and they're always entertaining. So rather than me try to like describe, you know, six of your favorite videos, we're just going to link to all of them in our show notes so that people can see them.

2884
02:31:52,720 --> 02:32:01,200
But every time I've asked you about it, either your modesty just downplays your process or you really are a savant.

2885
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:18,400
But like, I don't know how you actually do that. So can you just pick one and explain how you go from there's a very popular song out there to I have an idea that I would like to parody to I write the lyrics to I make this video.

2886
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:27,600
You talk about that as though like the same way I talk about making scrambled eggs. Yeah, it requires a little bit of work. You know, you don't want to get the shell in the bowl.

2887
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:36,480
So you want inside the doctor's studio with ZDoggMD. You want to get into how I do this. And it's interesting because exactly so much of it is it's like a creative process.

2888
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:44,000
Like, for example, when I see what you do and the way you dissect a paper or the way you think about science, it's inexplicable to me because my mind works very differently.

2889
02:32:44,000 --> 02:33:01,120
The way that I think about something, let's use an example of there's a song I did called Ain't the Way to Die. Yes, which is one of the I would say three of yours that I actually find very touching because as funny as it is, if you've been there and seen it, it's it's a tearjerker.

2890
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:08,800
And I'm sure we'll link to it so people can see it. The idea was everything we do is try to try to be mission driven. So the why of what we're doing.

2891
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:14,080
And sometimes that's unconscious. We don't consciously go, oh, why are we doing this video? It's more like what's the message we're trying to get?

2892
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:24,320
Now, when I was working full time at Stanford, one of the most painful things I saw was that people suffered and were tortured at the end of life because nobody had the balls to have a conversation and say, what is it you want when this happens?

2893
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:34,160
And be very specific, like talk to your loved ones. The loved ones say he never talked about it. He said he didn't want to be a vegetable or the loved ones three states away and needs to come before any decisions are made.

2894
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:45,520
But they won't come for weeks because they think it's not urgent. But this person is on a ventilator, paralyzed, partially sedated, probably suffering and didn't know that this was even a possibility.

2895
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:51,480
So it starts from that emotional place of what do we want to do with this thing? Then you start to think of I want to do a song about this.

2896
02:33:51,480 --> 02:34:02,640
What would be a fit for this? And this is kind of a bit of science. You're trying to fit this sort of peg in the right hole and figuring out what's the right emotional valence?

2897
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:11,360
What's the right lyrical structure? And you're going through you're maybe going through Spotify flicking through and then you see and I saw Eminem. I'm like, I like Eminem.

2898
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:17,360
I mean, he's one of those guys that you can listen to. You don't love it, but it's so clever. You just go, that's clever. I admire that.

2899
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:25,920
But he did that piece with Rihanna about domestic abuse. You know, just gonna stand there and watch me burn.

2900
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:32,320
And you're like, that's that hits you right in the elephant right in the emotional unconscious. Okay, we can motivate the elephant.

2901
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:37,840
And then later we'll think about the writer, how we direct them. So that made me feel something. It's about domestic abuse.

2902
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:44,720
Isn't domestic abuse the same as the institutional abuse that happens to our patients when we don't have this conversation?

2903
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:48,800
And then I really felt it. I was like, yeah, listen to the lyrics on it writes itself.

2904
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:54,320
Then I sit down and I go through the lyrics and I create a spreadsheet. So this is a kind of a Peter Attia approach.

2905
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:59,440
I did not expect this. Yeah, this is where my scientist inside me comes out and I go, okay,

2906
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:04,000
these two actually, so they'll sometimes help me with lyrics. They didn't help with this one, but my friend Harry did.

2907
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,600
He's a pediatrician. They didn't get me a white Russian either. And I'm still a little vexed.

2908
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:14,160
They're pieces of shit. Faded Peter to black. I see he faded Peter to black because Peter wants his white Russian instead.

2909
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:19,280
He got blacked out, which is another consequence of white Russians. The document, the nice thing about it,

2910
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:23,760
like a Google spreadsheet is you have all the original lyrics here. And since this is a problem with,

2911
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:30,880
you know how you get all these emails? I get that many emails and they're all like, you should do a parody of OPP,

2912
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:37,360
but make it about ECG. You done with ECG? Yeah, you know me. I'm like, that's dumb. It has no point.

2913
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:41,520
And they often get the meter wrong. So they're saying, here are my lyrics and the meter is totally off.

2914
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:45,520
While we were talking earlier, we were looking at awesome vids of your daughters playing the violin.

2915
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,840
Are you musically trained?

2916
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:53,040
So this is the funny thing. When I was in high school, we were talking about identity and self-hatred.

2917
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:57,600
I wanted to fit in. I was a short little kid with a funny last name who was kind of chubby.

2918
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:02,960
So I always struggled with way to unhealthy relationship with food to this day, but I've somehow managed to do okay.

2919
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:08,800
The way I got by was I would try to find these crutches to help me fit in socially in the Central Valley of California,

2920
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:15,280
which is all white or all Hispanic. And here I am, this like Zoroastrian, Persian, weird person.

2921
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:20,880
I had an afro at that time, which I've seen photos. You've seen photos. I used to pray and I'm not even religious.

2922
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:25,360
I used to pray for my hair to fall out because I hated my hair so much. And when it did, I was like, why, God, why?

2923
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:31,040
I was kidding. So awkward kids. So I picked up guitar as a way to try to impress ladies because I was like, you know what?

2924
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:37,200
Everybody, you know, you're more than words, which I eventually did a parody of, by the way, called More Than Warts about HPV.

2925
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:43,120
But the weird thing is I fell in love with the instrument because I always loved music and Weird Al was always like a weird because I was a nerd.

2926
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:48,720
I loved Weird Al. And so I was just in love with this concept of parody. So I picked up guitar, learned guitar.

2927
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:58,400
Then I went to UC Berkeley and had this delusion that I was going to be a rock star. So I felt like because Berkeley is, I mean, generally going to the best school in the state.

2928
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:02,400
It's an obvious linear pathway to being a rock star. It's a hundred for one to one correlation.

2929
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:10,880
You're a scientist. Why are you asking these questions? Yeah, for me, it was like no brainer. I'll go to Berkeley just to please my parents because they want me to go to a real school.

2930
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:16,400
And it's not Stanford. So I don't have to spend all the tuition because my dad was like, you know what? Berkeley is just as good and cheaper.

2931
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:21,040
I'm like, it's actually not that. Here's the secret. It's really cushy. OK, it's really cushy.

2932
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:27,760
So all that being said, I minored in music and I majored in molecular biology because I was like premed with the hedge.

2933
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:33,200
Then I'll be a rock star. I like it. And increasingly it became clear that I didn't have this thing called talent.

2934
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:37,680
I didn't have enough drive and talent and ambition in that line of intelligence music to be famous.

2935
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:44,640
There were so many kids that were so much better than me and I knew it. And the thing is rather than beat myself up about it, I'm like, cool, I'll be a doctor who plays guitar on the side.

2936
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:49,040
And that's what ended up happening. And so I actually majored in I did ethnomusicology.

2937
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,920
So it's like studying like the music of Indonesia and all these different musical forms.

2938
02:37:51,920 --> 02:38:01,920
And it turned out that was the perfect conditioning of my sub minds, these little conscious agents, to later in my depths of burnout, all this music came back out and the weird component came through.

2939
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:05,760
So here I am as a professional weird owl. Now I'm going, OK, here's my spreadsheet.

2940
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:11,520
On the left, I have the original lyrics to Eminem and their structure. And the right, I have a blank space.

2941
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:16,960
I come up with the title and then I reach out to my friend Devin Moore, who's our audio engineer, who's just a genius.

2942
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:21,280
He's like a professional musician. And he just we met in Vegas and he's like, this is how we do things.

2943
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:26,480
And I want to do your stuff because you suck at producing the songs because I was doing it on Garage Man.

2944
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:30,080
So he creates the backing track and he did that in that case. He sends me the track.

2945
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:34,880
Then I have the feel of it. Then I'll sit there with the original. I'll listen to it and I'll just start coming up with lyrics.

2946
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:38,720
In my mind, I may have some notes I needed to hit this point and this point and this point.

2947
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:51,040
And then I'll brainstorm. And usually this happens. My creative process is I get on a treadmill or a Stairmaster where I run and that silences the monkey mind on top so that the unconscious, which has been processing the stuff in the background,

2948
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:57,760
starts to bubble up these ideas. So these little clever phrases are little things that I remember from the ICU or a case that I remember bubbles up.

2949
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:06,640
And then I start to put it into the structure. So from open creativity to codified structure with parameters.

2950
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:10,880
So the nice thing is there's a parameter. There's a structure in the song already that I can't violate.

2951
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:17,200
So that bit of constraint allows me actually to excel at what I do. I need that constraint.

2952
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:23,280
If it's just open, I will fuck it up because it's too much possibility and I'll mentally masturbate for hours and it won't come out.

2953
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,920
So having that constraint is helpful. Then I put it in thing. Then I show it to friends. Then I go back.

2954
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:34,160
And then this is the thing. The rewriting process of lyrics is even more important than the initial writing.

2955
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:39,360
So it's going back and that one word is just emotionally wrong or it feels musically wrong.

2956
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:46,240
And you tweak it and tweak it and tweak it and get the source out. You go to rhyme zone and you find better rhymes and then you hone it.

2957
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:54,240
And when it's done, then I go into that studio, which is right there, which I won't say the name of it because it uses the R word, but it has TARDIS in it.

2958
02:39:54,240 --> 02:40:02,720
It looks like a TARDIS from Dr. Who, but it's not OK. It's a developmentally delayed TARDIS. And I record it and then Devin mixes it and then we put it out.

2959
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:09,120
So put some time on that for me. From the moment you picked the Eminem song, what was the length of time from the idea?

2960
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:12,400
I want to do a song on this topic to choosing the song.

2961
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:16,240
A couple days. Is that representative? Often it is.

2962
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:25,760
And then from the moment you pick the song to strip the lyrics out, make the spreadsheet, do the runs, write the song is how long?

2963
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:36,160
In this case, it was about one or two weeks. In the shortest case, it's a day. I do it right then and I have friends and they help me and the team here, Tom and Logan.

2964
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:40,800
In the longest, it's been a month where I'm just pounding my head on the shit and there's no time frame.

2965
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:43,920
And do you ever in that process say I picked the wrong song, I got to go back?

2966
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:50,080
Yes. Our history is littered with half completed projects where there's actually a track and it's just dumb.

2967
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:55,920
For example, we were going to do Amy Winehouse rehab about skilled nursing homes.

2968
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:56,800
Oh, interesting.

2969
02:40:56,800 --> 02:41:07,680
Doc, try to make me go to rehab. I won't go, go, go. Yes, I fell bad, but I got 12 cats at home, home, home. The little old lady who won't go to sniff.

2970
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:14,160
That was dumb. And the more we tried to make it work, the less happy we were. Now then we may come back to it. But yeah, so sometimes we just fail.

2971
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:17,320
But ain't the way to die. It just kind of started. Oh, yeah, that's that's a.

2972
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:25,440
And the more we realize we got the sense of, you know, that sense of moral elevation you get in your chest where you feel something hit and it raises you in this way where you feel it expand.

2973
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:30,000
It sounds very woo woo, but it's a real human since John Hyde and others have talked about the sense of moral elevation.

2974
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Like I've done something here. I've tapped into some ethos that will help people.

2975
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,800
And recording a song like that is done in one day.

2976
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:48,080
It depends. So that one we did over a couple of days, I went to Devon's studio actually, and we just kept banging it out and he would coach me sit there in the engineer space and be like, you know, that's I'm not feeling anything with that.

2977
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:54,800
Try it maybe this way and then we'll do like 30 takes. Oh, my God. And then he'll be like, that's it. I got goosebumps. That's it. That's it. Right.

2978
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:59,240
How does one do that? Like if you said to me.

2979
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:03,920
Can you repeat something six times like I wouldn't I would.

2980
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:08,880
This is the thing that's always amazed me about acting. I don't think I've appreciated it as much about singing.

2981
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:17,360
But, you know, if you've ever been on a set to actually watch a movie being made and there's like a list actors there, which I've had the privilege of doing once or twice.

2982
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:22,560
I'm amazed that first of all, an entire day of shooting produces 60 to 90 seconds worth of a movie.

2983
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:25,840
That's how many times things are being done over and over and over again.

2984
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:32,320
And it's to watch the actors and actresses show up with the same level of emotion,

2985
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:36,720
the same emphasis, correcting maybe whatever the director says to correct.

2986
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:41,600
I'm like, well, that's another great reason why I could never have done that for a living.

2987
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:53,760
And these are professionals that are really good at that. Now, see, I'm an untrained amateur. I like to call myself a pro am because, you know, it's one of those things where I get paid a little bit here and there with ads and stuff.

2988
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:56,240
But really, I'm just, you know, it's for the love of the game.

2989
02:42:56,320 --> 02:43:03,120
But the truth is it's a craft for me and the finished product matters so deeply to me that I cannot put out a stinky piece of shit.

2990
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:07,520
I've done it and I've regretted it. And sometimes I put something I think is good in retrospect. I think it's crap.

2991
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:09,920
Sometimes I think it's something that's crap and it turns out being great.

2992
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,120
But Ain't the Way to Die was one of those things I can't fuck this up.

2993
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:15,560
So you do in 2030 takes and you'll see as they're all sitting there in logic.

2994
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:18,640
That's the program we use and you just take, take, take, take, take, take, take.

2995
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:20,800
And what we'll do then is we'll comp sometimes.

2996
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:24,200
We'll say, let's take the best of this first verse, best of that.

2997
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:26,760
And some people think that's cheating, but that's how most people do it now.

2998
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:28,560
I didn't realize that would be thought of as cheating.

2999
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:33,920
So some of the purists in the old school musicians say, well, no, you just got to go on and sing it live and that's how you do it.

3000
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:38,400
But that's not how anybody does it now because you are trying to produce the best piece of art you can.

3001
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:42,240
And what's fascinating actually, Peter, is again, I'm not a trained musician.

3002
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:45,160
I don't sing, I don't rap. It's something that I had to figure out.

3003
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:48,720
I used to be really bad and Devin would tell me, you really suck.

3004
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:50,840
Like it takes 30 takes just to get it to sound good.

3005
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:52,080
Have you thought about taking voice lessons?

3006
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,640
And I'm like, don't insult me, dude.

3007
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:55,800
What's a, you can't train a voice.

3008
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:56,480
That's bullshit.

3009
02:43:56,480 --> 02:43:57,960
You have to, it's stupid.

3010
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:01,760
And then I went and got voice lessons, just a few lessons and then these CDs that I kept doing.

3011
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:06,000
And this is the thing, man, the voice, like anything, is a performance instrument, it's a muscle.

3012
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,640
And the vocal cords get stronger.

3013
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:08,600
Your control gets better.

3014
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:09,680
Your breath control gets better.

3015
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:14,480
So the way you breathe for singing is so different than the way you would normally talk or anything.

3016
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:19,520
And that helps when you do speaking because you don't get hoarse, you warm up right, you project better.

3017
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:22,880
So I'm a tiny little person who can project his damn voice.

3018
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:28,000
Yeah, but you also, as a Zorostrian, you come from the lineage of the greatest singer of all time.

3019
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,480
We are the champions.

3020
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:32,640
Exactly. Freddie Mercury.

3021
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,680
Oh, God.

3022
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:38,920
Oh, and Zubin Mehta, who I was named after, his conductor, it's a musical lineage, are people.

3023
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:42,040
My people call it Maze. Peter Atiha. Do you remember that commercial?

3024
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:43,920
It was an old Missola commercial in the 80s.

3025
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:46,000
It was that they had a Native American guy in the headdress.

3026
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,040
Oh, yeah.

3027
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:51,080
And he's sitting in a boat and he's eating corn and he's like, my people call it Maze.

3028
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:54,200
And it was like, Missola, corn goodness.

3029
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:56,800
Anyway, so I trained my voice.

3030
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:59,760
And so now I have to do less takes and I'm able to go live.

3031
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:05,200
So even though we do this art where we're cutting it up in the studio, when I have to perform Ain't the Way to Die Live,

3032
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:07,720
which I do 50 times a year when I do my live shows.

3033
02:45:07,720 --> 02:45:08,400
Oh, really?

3034
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:10,240
Yeah. So I do that one. I do seven years.

3035
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:11,160
I could do about 20 songs every night.

3036
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:15,280
So you're hitting on all the killers, like seven years is, I think, the most touching of them all.

3037
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:16,120
Seven years is my favorite.

3038
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:22,840
And Tom Tom was the genius behind how to Tom and Logan back there, genius of how to cinematographize that and the emotion of it.

3039
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:23,880
We're sitting in the edit.

3040
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:26,760
Speaking of that. So the edit, those were those were your kids.

3041
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:27,800
And those are my kids.

3042
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:29,040
That's your my clinic. Yeah.

3043
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:31,120
It's my family. It's my wife. It's my dad.

3044
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:32,240
So it was a personal thing.

3045
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:38,440
And we're sitting in the edit on the apex where you're pushing in on my daughter and it's like, you know, soon I'll be 60 years old.

3046
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:39,880
And it's all emotional piece.

3047
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:41,520
And we didn't feel it. We didn't feel it. We didn't feel it.

3048
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:43,200
And then we're like, how about this?

3049
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:46,080
Trim that one microsecond here.

3050
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:47,280
All of us are crying. Wow.

3051
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:49,720
We're like, OK, that's it hits end.

3052
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:51,520
That's the thing. That's the process.

3053
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:53,000
And it's the same with the musical piece.

3054
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:02,520
So then once you do it, you may craft this thing here, but when you go and do it live, it takes on a whole new persona because you have this input and you're doing it in one take.

3055
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:04,880
And that's where I think the real artistry starts to try to have.

3056
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:07,320
I'm calling it artistry. I'm a fucking professional clown.

3057
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:11,360
But it feels like that on stage because you're seeing the synchronization of the audience with the message.

3058
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:13,840
People are crying. You're feeling this energy.

3059
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:16,680
And afterwards, they'll tell you, this is how you made me feel during that.

3060
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:21,040
And I'm a 20 year veteran. I'm a 30 year nurse or I'm a 40 year R.T. or whatever it is.

3061
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:23,760
And that's what really gets you.

3062
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:25,400
So all of that is for this. That's the process.

3063
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:27,120
Then we'll put it out. Then we'll brainstorm the video.

3064
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:30,320
Then we'll go beg our hospital to let us shoot.

3065
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,160
Extras are all real medical people.

3066
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:34,760
Nobody's paid. We'll go and do a rent equipment.

3067
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:35,960
We'll get the crew and we'll do it.

3068
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:38,800
And how long does it take you to shoot, say, those two videos there?

3069
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:40,800
It's like a day. Wow.

3070
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:44,640
Because we don't have we don't have a choice because we're operating in a real hospital with real patients running around.

3071
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:48,160
So we have to go to a wing where maybe they're not on overflow right now so we can do it.

3072
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:49,600
And they're kind enough to let us do it.

3073
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:53,920
And then maybe they'll kick us out because they have extended the invitation to me so many times to be in a video.

3074
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,880
I just I got to take you up on one of these.

3075
02:46:55,880 --> 02:46:58,280
I'll be the guy that just like walks by and no one will even see me.

3076
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:00,640
We're doing a parody of The Bare Naked Ladies one week.

3077
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:02,280
I don't know if I sent it to you.

3078
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:04,160
You remember that song? It's been one.

3079
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:07,640
You don't realize this. I went to high school with the bare naked ladies. Fuck you.

3080
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:09,720
Yeah. Their dad was our guidance counselor.

3081
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:11,080
The Kriegan brothers, right?

3082
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:13,240
Andrew and Jim, their dad was our guidance counselor.

3083
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:14,360
Oh my God. Yeah.

3084
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:17,760
So I saw them in 1991 in Berkeley in a small little club before they were famous.

3085
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:19,280
And I was like, these guys are gods.

3086
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,480
You know, this is me and grade nine, baby.

3087
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,800
Yeah. Oh my God.

3088
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:24,600
And notice it's grade nine, not ninth grade.

3089
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:26,960
No, because it's Canada. It's grade nine.

3090
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:29,000
So I always loved The Bare Naked Ladies.

3091
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:35,680
One week wasn't my favorite song, but I wanted to do a tribute for foreign medical graduates from India and South Asia like my parents.

3092
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,000
Both of them were doctors.

3093
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:39,320
And I'm like, one seek.

3094
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:41,640
We'll make it about doctors.

3095
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:44,480
And so this is one where it just right, Tom.

3096
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:47,520
We were just like here the lyrics took a second.

3097
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:55,600
It was like, there's this one seek in the doctor's lounge, a Punjabi guy whose name no one can pronounce for Jane's in emergency saying get that

3098
02:47:55,600 --> 02:47:57,560
Cawndog away from Dr. Mukherjee.

3099
02:47:57,560 --> 02:48:02,040
And when the rap comes up, it was like, you know, tikka masala, the Desi chicken.

3100
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,040
You have a drumstick.

3101
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:05,960
You have a hard stop sticking of watching Bollywood with no lights on.

3102
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:07,040
Check out Amir Khan.

3103
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:09,240
He does a slow mo run in this one like Bobby Jindal.

3104
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:10,320
I'm trying to act white.

3105
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:11,400
Can that just ain't right?

3106
02:48:11,400 --> 02:48:12,920
Because I always drive Camry.

3107
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:17,480
So so we're shooting that in Texas next month.

3108
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:23,720
So you should come and be in Victoria, Texas, this tiny town on the coast about an hour from Austin.

3109
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:26,120
I know you have homies in Austin.

3110
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:27,520
Yeah, we're flying into Austin.

3111
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:28,440
We're renting all the equipment.

3112
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:31,840
We're going to this cardiology clinic that this Indian doctor couple runs.

3113
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:32,480
They heard the song.

3114
02:48:32,480 --> 02:48:33,360
They're like, we want to be in it.

3115
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:34,800
OK, but I've heard.

3116
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:36,200
And so we're going to shoot it there.

3117
02:48:36,200 --> 02:48:38,400
So you should come and be an extra on that.

3118
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:43,720
Well, when we're off, Mike, I'll ask you for the details so that we don't let all the fans in the world know where we're going to be.

3119
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:44,960
That's a great idea.

3120
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:49,040
Yeah, we don't want the anti-vaxxers to show up to these poor people's clinic.

3121
02:48:49,360 --> 02:48:50,680
Oh, that would be terrible.

3122
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:52,880
So that that's more or less the process.

3123
02:48:53,280 --> 02:49:01,800
Well, I got to say, I mean, if nothing comes of this discussion other than a set of people who are not familiar with you,

3124
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:06,920
a subset of people who listen to me who don't yet know who you are, figure out who you are.

3125
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:08,960
That's worth everything.

3126
02:49:08,960 --> 02:49:13,560
In fact, I almost feel bad that we took up all this time because what I could have just done is said,

3127
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:15,880
today's podcast is going to be really short.

3128
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:22,720
It's just going to be me telling you go check out all of Zubin stuff, because that's effectively the most important piece of this to me.

3129
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:28,800
Well, that's effectively what I'm going to tell my followers, which is Peter Attia is doing brilliant work in the space that nobody else is doing.

3130
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:31,920
And the people that are collaborating with him are amazing and you need to check him out.

3131
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:36,560
And also, he's my homie from way back and we don't give an F about a damn thing.

3132
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:39,640
That's one thing that separates us from some other so-called doctors.

3133
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:40,840
All right. Am I right?

3134
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:43,760
Brother, it has been a lot of fun.

3135
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:46,680
This has been long overdue by about two decades.

3136
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:47,920
Yeah, I think so.

3137
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,160
It's been a real pleasure, Peter.

3138
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:50,600
