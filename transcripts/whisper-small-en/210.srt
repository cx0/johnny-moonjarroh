00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey Ben, well, wonderful to sit with you today and talk about a subject matter that, you

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,780
know, honestly, I think five, certainly 10 years ago, nobody would have a clue what we

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:26,000
were talking about. And yet today we get so many requests to go back and revisit this

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,840
subject matter. So again, delighted to have you here and look forward to talking about

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,000
something that, you know, probably impacts a lot more people than, than, than most white

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,480
might appreciate. So let's take a step back and give me a sense of where your interest

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,200
in this little lipoprotein LP little A came from.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,420
So first Peter, thank you so much for the wonderful invitation. I'm really excited about

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:00,740
our discussion today. So I got involved in LPA research actually during my postdoc years.

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:08,500
I trained here at LaValle university in, in Quebec city, did some work in the field of,

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:17,580
of lipids looking at LDL particle size, triglycerides, ApoB, et cetera, on cardiovascular outcomes.

13
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:26,660
So that was in 2006 to 2009. And that was really at a point where not that many people

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:33,140
talked about LP little A because there had been so many negative studies on, on LPA and

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,060
the risk of cardiovascular disease like MI's and stroke and so on. And it's really the

16
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,580
genetic association studies that have kind of resurrected the field of LPA. And these

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:53,700
were published in 2009 to 2011. And that was during the time I was a postdoc in Amsterdam

18
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,800
and I was working over there with, with John Castellan. And he was working on the treating

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,140
to new targets trial, the TNT trial, which is the trial that one of the first trial that

20
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:17,060
have that show that if you reduce low density lipoprotein levels by increasing the statin

21
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,420
dose, you'll get an incremental benefit in, in cardiovascular outcomes. So we were working

22
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:30,260
on a bunch of sub analysis in the, in that trial. And they had just measured a whole

23
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:38,180
panel of emerging biomarkers that they thought was associated with that could be associated

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:47,100
with cardiovascular events like, like CRP, anti-pro B and P other markers, inflammatory

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:55,080
markers, other biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and LPA. And it turned out that of a huge

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,720
list of 18 biomarkers that they had measured in thousands of individual LPA was actually the

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,400
strongest of them that, that was predicting residual cardiovascular risk. So that was,

28
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,440
I think the first paper I published on, on LPA in, in those years. And at the time,

29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,880
we were also wondering if there was any genetic variants that could explain a statin response,

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:33,000
because statin work well in, in most people, but there's a huge inter individual variability

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,040
in terms of LDL lowering associated with statin. So this is, this came at a time where genome wide

32
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,360
association studies were increasingly used and they were used to, well, they were first used to

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,480
identify genetic variants associated with specific diseases, but they were beginning to be used in

34
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,720
pharmacogenetic studies. So we were part of a big genetic consortium that was called the GIST

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,360
consortium. So genomic investigation of statin therapy. And it turned out from that big analysis

36
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,960
that LPA was the most important genetic risk factor for that explain statin response. So we

37
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,240
shown that if you have high LPA, then your LDL would be, wouldn't be lowered as much as if you

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,440
didn't have a high LPA. Well, we're going to talk about that in some detail, because right now,

39
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,400
I think many people will not understand exactly why that's the case, because they won't necessarily

40
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
understand the relationship between LDL and LPA and why what you just described is completely

41
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,120
intuitive today based on all the work that's been done in the last decade. But let's take a step

42
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,800
back into that epidemiology so that for the people who aren't familiar with LPa, we can give them a

43
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,240
sense of why this is such an important topic. So we'll start with an observation, right? So we'll

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,840
start with the epidemiology, which is elevated levels of this particular lipoprotein, which

45
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:13,080
occur in about what fraction of the population. So depending on ethnicity, actually, it can be

46
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,040
very high as, for instance, in individuals of African ancestry who have the highest level,

47
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,680
and all the way down to Chinese and Japanese that probably have the lowest levels. But

48
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:35,880
we can say like in the ballpark, that about 20% of the world population has an LPA level that puts

49
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:49,720
them in a higher risk category. So if we go down in time, LPA was discovered in 1963 by a Swedish

50
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,840
scientist called named Kerry Berg. And he was one of the first to show in the late 70s and at the

51
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,560
beginning of the 80s in different European cohorts that LPA was associated with cardiovascular events.

52
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,960
And LPA has been measured, was measured more probably more currently at that time in these

53
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:21,000
big epidemiology studies. The thing is, however, that the assays that they were using were probably

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,200
not the best. They were certainly not as good as they are today. There was a lot of variability.

55
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:35,000
And a lot of these studies published in the 90s and in the early 2000s came out negative.

56
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,640
So and that really was really tough for the field because nobody talked about LPA at that moment.

57
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,960
Tell people what you mean about the studies came out negative and what would negative with respect

58
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,600
to what hypothesis and why. The hypothesis was that high LPA was associated with

59
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,600
cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction, stroke, etc. So the hypothesis was that people

60
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:12,520
with higher LPA levels were at the highest risk and it turned out not to be the case in many, many

61
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:21,720
of those studies. And so we realized afterwards that the assays that had been used were probably

62
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:32,200
not very good. So the assays really did not correctly identify people with high LP little

63
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:41,720
A and I think this has to be attributable to the complex structure of lipoprotein little A, which has

64
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:52,040
in the LPA genes there's a copy number variation and the antibodies that are used against that

65
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:02,760
sometimes they can bind to different epitopes of LPA. And so now we have antibodies that are

66
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:11,800
binding to LPA on other regions. So we get a much better sense of the number of LPA particles in the

67
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:20,040
bloodstream. But back in the days, the assays that were used, they were overestimating the

68
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,280
isoform size that was bigger and they were underestimating the small LPA isoform size,

69
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,600
which is associated with high LPA. So a lot of research has been done on that and now we have

70
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:46,600
better assay. We don't have optimal assays now, but most of these problems have been solved.

71
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:56,920
And you can really see in the literature the interest on LPA that actually match this effect

72
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:06,280
because the LPA gene was cloned in the 80s by the group of Angelo Scannu at the University of

73
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:13,560
Chicago. And you can see it, if you just look at the PubMed search, you would see a straight line

74
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:21,560
from the 70s to the mid 80s. And when these studies came back negative, you would see the

75
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:29,000
number of PubMed searches would go down. And they came back up in 2009 and 2010 when

76
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,200
genetic association studies were beginning to be published. Because the great thing about genetic

77
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,360
studies is that you don't necessarily need to measure lipoprotein A level. So you can look at

78
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,440
genetic variants, at common genetic variants that are associated with diseases. And there were three

79
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:56,440
big studies published in 2009 that have very convincingly shows that genetic variants

80
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,840
associated with high LPA levels were tracking with cardiovascular events. And now we can see

81
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,160
the PubMed searches on LPA going back up again. And they haven't been as high as they are today.

82
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,400
Yeah, and we should make sure people understand some of the semantics. So LPA is the gene that

83
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,760
codes for apo-like-the-protein little a, which then binds to an LDL and then turns an LDL from

84
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,160
being just a garden variety LDL into an LP little a. And I think once people understand that it

85
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,320
becomes easier, I think, for us to communicate in this way. So I'm going to restate that. And I

86
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,840
really want everyone to understand this. So there's a gene, LPA is the gene. And this gene,

87
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,160
everybody has this gene, but we have different variants of it. And so a subset of the population,

88
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,240
and it varies considerably by ethnicity. So African, East Asian, also quite high,

89
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,760
down to Caucasian, and as you mentioned, Chinese, Japanese, et cetera. So you're going to see

90
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:06,840
different expressions of the apo-like-the-protein little a. This apo-like-the-protein little a,

91
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,240
which we'll talk a lot about and what it looks like and its structure and what its heterogeneity

92
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,640
is all about. But it wraps onto a low-density lipoprotein. And then it becomes kind of a

93
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,360
supercharged low-density lipoprotein. It becomes a particularly nefarious LDL. And we're going to

94
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,880
talk about all the reasons why it's not responsive to the same treatments, et cetera. So would you

95
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,400
add anything to that? Like, I don't want to make it too complicated yet, but I want to make sure

96
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,080
everybody understands when we talk about the LPA gene, which is identified during the GWAS

97
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,960
experiments, how the genotype allows us to not know everything about the phenotype,

98
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,040
but we can start to get into trying to impute causal relationships. And eventually we're going

99
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,240
to talk, of course, about Mendelian randomization, where we can go even deeper. And anything you want

100
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,880
to add to sort of the basics of this? No, I think you've explained it perfectly, Peter. Maybe the

101
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,760
only thing I would add is that part of the genetic heterogeneity among different people is

102
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:21,080
the apolipoprotein A isoform size. So people express different LPA isoforms. Some are bigger

103
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,080
than the other. And that probably, well, that actually plays an important part of the

104
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,520
equation, explaining why some people have a higher LPA little later than others.

105
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm glad you reinforced that point because, and this is going to get into a little bit of

106
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,720
chemistry, which I know some people will understand and some might not. One of the

107
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,440
big challenges here, as you've now alluded to twice, is the difficulty in measurement.

108
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,160
Now, when we look at something like ApoB and people who listen to this podcast a lot will

109
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,440
be very familiar with ApoB. We talk an awful lot about it. One of the things we talk about is that

110
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,200
by measuring the concentration of ApoB, you can completely and accurately measure the

111
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,720
concentration of the atherogenic particles, the majority of which are LDL. And the reason for

112
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:15,480
that is twofold. The first is that every LDL has one and only one ApoB 100 particle on it. The

113
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,160
second is that all ApoBs are the same size. Therefore, they have a molar weight. And by

114
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,200
knowing the mass, you know the number. Now, I always like to point out two contrasts to this,

115
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,400
right? The HDL particle, by contrast, has multiple ApoAs on it. And this is totally different from

116
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,760
ApoA. So we're not going to talk about that other than to say it's ApoA. And therefore,

117
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,440
you don't have a unique number. And then, of course, with LpA, you have the problem that you

118
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:55,240
raised, which creates enormous challenges. There is no molar weight for ApoA, right? This is the

119
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,640
fundamental problem in the assay of trying to measure this thing. Exactly. And we're really

120
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:09,560
moving in the right direction in terms of getting the LpA measurement in nanomoles per liter. And

121
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,920
there's more and more labs that are doing this. And this is clearly the way to go. We have to

122
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,800
move away from measurements in milligrams per deciliter, which is really influenced by the

123
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,160
isoform size of LpA. And the measurement in nanomolar will actually give you a much better

124
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,120
sense of the number of LpA particles in the circulation. And that's what we should be

125
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,720
aiming at. Now, will that require electrophoresis? How will that actually be measured? Or will it

126
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:50,120
use NMR? I mean, it's going to be measured through immunoturbidimetric assays. So not by

127
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:59,160
NMR. NMR can actually give you a pretty good estimate of LDL particle number, but you have

128
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,160
to use antibodies to measure LpA. Okay. So we got a little in the weeds there. I apologize. We'll

129
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,400
come back to that stuff later. But let's pick it up back about a decade ago when the GWAS studies

130
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,680
were able to distance themselves from the limitations of the assay and focus instead

131
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,240
on the genotype and the heterogeneity of the genotype. These GWAS studies now found a much

132
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:36,120
stronger association between the variants of this genotype that produced high copy numbers of

133
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:44,120
apolipoprotein LpA and insipid cardiovascular events, correct? Exactly. So there were,

134
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:53,080
I think, three studies that were all published in 2009. The first one was the one by Robert Clark

135
00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:00,040
from the UK. They used the procardis consortium, which were, if I recall, well, there were 3,000

136
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,160
people with heart disease and 3,000 controls. And they've identified two SNPs in the LpA regions

137
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:17,000
that are completely different from one another. And you really saw the dose response effect of

138
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
these SNPs on LpA levels with a proportional effect on the risk of heart disease. So it was

139
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,760
like the kind of the first Mendelian randomization study where they nicely showed that if you had one

140
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:41,080
LpA-raising allele, you had higher LpA levels. Whereas if you had two or more LpA-rising

141
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,440
variants, then you had even higher LpA levels and the risk was proportionally higher. Also worth

142
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,680
explaining how important this type of analysis is because it really is the bridge between

143
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,320
observational epidemiology and clinical trials. And of course, we're going to talk about clinical

144
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,120
trials, many of which are ongoing. But the importance of what you just said, Benoit,

145
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,240
is the following. There are a handful of assumptions that make this type of Mendelian

146
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,320
randomization essential. One is the assumption that the sorting of these genes is random.

147
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Right? So in other words, you know, we look at a population and we can say we can look at this as

148
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:29,240
though nature did an experiment and it randomized the population to different copy numbers of these

149
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,240
alleles that are going to produce different amounts of the protein. But the second important

150
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,040
piece of a Mendelian randomization, being able to link something causal, is the assumption

151
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,360
that the gene of interest is not doing something else that you're unaware of. Right? In other words,

152
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,960
if the LpA gene was on the one hand responsible for making Apo-like protein little a, which it is,

153
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,400
but on the other side, it also changed your, I'm making this up, your susceptibility

154
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,880
to secondhand smoke. And people who had that gene would be debilitated by secondhand smoke.

155
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,040
People who didn't have that gene had complete immunity to secondhand smoke. Imagine such a

156
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,520
gene existed. Well, all of a sudden the Mendelian randomization wouldn't be very helpful because

157
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,120
those people who are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease from having more copies

158
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,360
of LpA, you don't know if it's that or if it's the exposure or susceptibility to secondhand smoke.

159
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,160
So do you have a sense? I mean, I think in the case of LpLit it's pretty straightforward

160
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,840
because it's a relatively simple gene. But when that type of analysis was done, was it relatively

161
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,600
easy to demonstrate that that gene wasn't doing anything else, both in its coding and non-coding

162
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,240
regions? Yeah. First, let me say that I think that a lot of genesis would disagree that LpA is a

163
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,960
relatively easy gene. I mean, there's like, I think 2000 different variants that are associated with

164
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:10,600
LpA and you add in the isoform and each isoform has a specific set of different variants. So that

165
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,800
being said, I think you really nicely explained it. And the beauty of working with LpA, but also

166
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:26,600
with most proteins in the circulation, is that you're looking at cis-acting SNPs. So cis-acting

167
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,680
means variants that are acting within the window of the gene that expressing their protein as in

168
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:42,840
opposition to like a transacting SNP would be, for instance, a SNP in the CTP gene, for instance,

169
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:50,520
which we know might be associated with LpA. But CTP does a lot of other things. It regulates HDL

170
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:57,720
cholesterol levels, it regulates triglycerides. So we don't use CTP genes when we do Mendelian

171
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:05,960
randomization on LpA. And the example that you mentioned, a specific gene being associated with

172
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,600
an intermediate phenotype that could, on the other end, influence LpA would be reverse causality. And

173
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:22,840
in the case of LpA, it's, you know, we're very, very confident that we're using the correct genetic

174
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:30,680
instruments to infer a causal relationship between LpA and a wide range of atherosclerotic

175
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:37,320
cardiovascular diseases. So to put a bow on that, we really have two independent types of analyses

176
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:47,080
now that make it very clear that LpA is playing a causal role in the development of atherosclerotic

177
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:53,560
cardiovascular disease independent of LDL, which you referred to earlier by commenting and using

178
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,960
the term residual risk, which I think people might not appreciate residual risk, meaning what is the

179
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,440
risk that remains in terms of ASCVD in the presence of LDL lowering. And of course,

180
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,000
LpA would be one such example. And those two pieces of information are now the regular

181
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,160
observational epidemiology, provided that the assays more accurately capture the measurement

182
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:26,200
of LpA. And now these Mendelian randomizations that effectively are nature's randomized

183
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,200
experiments, provided those two criteria we discussed can be met. Is that a fair synthesis

184
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,800
of the state of the art today in terms of our understanding? Yes, I think you can also add a

185
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,720
third assumption, which would be that the effect of the variance on the outcome, so the effect of

186
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,920
variance on cardiovascular disease are explained by higher LpA levels. And I think for LpA,

187
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:57,560
it's a fairly fair assumption to make. Okay, so let's talk about how this is done clinically today.

188
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,000
Over the past decade, I've seen three different types of commercial assays for measuring LpA.

189
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:14,600
I don't believe two of them are in existence anymore. One was the LpA cholesterol content.

190
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,120
So I assume that this was an assay that was looking at the cholesterol content of the

191
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,320
LpA, which means the LDLs that had apolipaprotein A on them, you just measure the cholesterol content.

192
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,000
So it was analogous to measuring LDL cholesterol, but for this narrow subset. Is that assay still

193
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,520
in existence? Well, I think there are certain labs that still use it, but it's really not the way that

194
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,480
the field is moving to because the cholesterol, and you can make the same argument for LDL,

195
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:55,160
the cholesterol within a certain lipoprotein does not necessarily tell you a lot of information about

196
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,760
the number of particles that are in the bloodstream, which is the most important thing

197
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,560
to measure if you want to estimate risk. So for LDL, ApoB, there's some discordance,

198
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:17,560
but for LpA, the discordance is even higher. Exactly. So what you really want to do is try to

199
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:24,760
find a lab that will give you an LpA measurement in nanomoles per liter. Right. Now, there are some

200
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,600
labs that have done that. I've seen a lot of those labs. So one of them was called

201
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,760
health diagnostics labs. I think that was the name of the lab. They no longer exist. They did

202
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,560
calculate an LpA in nanomole per liter. I don't know what their methodology was.

203
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,520
Most labs are using milligrams per deciliter. So they are simply telling you, I say simply,

204
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:57,720
they are telling you the mass of LpA. Now, just to be clear, are we in that assay looking at the

205
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,600
mass of the entire LpA? Are they just trying to estimate the mass of the Apo lipoprotein?

206
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:11,720
It's the mass of the particles. So it's a much better measurement than LpA cholesterol that you

207
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:21,480
just referred to. And we shouldn't let good be the enemy of perfect here. If you have an LpA

208
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,240
measurement in milligrams per deciliter and it puts you in a high risk range. So let's say

209
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:38,360
you're it gives you an LpA level of above 50. Then the chances of the LpA assay that will give you a

210
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:46,920
result in nanomoles per liter, it will also give you a high level. So if you have an LpA measured

211
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,640
in milligrams per deciliter, you can obviously try to get a second measurement in nanomoles per liter.

212
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:02,600
But if you have a LpA in a high range, both methods will give you the same information that

213
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,600
you have an LpA in the higher range. Now, you have to keep in mind though, that if you have an LpA,

214
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,200
for instance, of 50 milligrams per deciliter, the measurement in nanomoles per liter will be around

215
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,480
125 nanomoles per liter. So some people have measurements using both methods and they just

216
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,800
say, well, for some reason my LpA doubled. Well, that's not the case. The LpA didn't double and it's

217
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:35,800
remarkably stable over time. So most guidelines will probably tell you just to measure LpA once

218
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,760
in a lifetime and it's relatively relatively stable. Yeah, I mean, I think that's the take home

219
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:48,920
point here is unlike LDL and APO-B, which are so modifiable. And therefore it really matters that

220
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,760
you know what you're measuring because you're going to be measuring it over and over and over

221
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,920
and over again. With LpA at this point in time, this is going to be changing, but at this point

222
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,280
in time, it's basically something we measure to determine risk, after which point we don't really

223
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,800
need to measure it. We've established risk and now we need to take measures elsewhere.

224
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,880
So let's now kind of talk a little bit about the biology of LpA.

225
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:24,280
We'll include figures in the show notes to the podcast. So we'll be able to show people exactly

226
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:32,840
what this thing looks like and how it intersects with and binds to the LDL particle, how it's

227
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:40,120
distinct from the APO-B, et cetera. But let's talk a little bit about the production of this thing.

228
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,600
Is it hepatically produced? It's produced in the liver? Yes, exactly. So

229
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:51,960
all the lipoprotein A particles originate from the APO lipoprotein little a that's

230
00:26:52,520 --> 00:27:04,440
pretty much only expressed in the liver. So it's not entirely clear in the literature how

231
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:13,560
or where specifically an APO lipoprotein little a will become an Lp little a. So where it will

232
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:25,240
bind to APO-B and ultimately an LDL particles. There's multiple hypotheses that have been tested.

233
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,680
So some people say that the APO lipoprotein little a, which is like a glycoprotein, is secreted in

234
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:41,320
the bloodstream and there it will bind to whichever LDL is closer to it to form LpA.

235
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:51,000
There's another hypothesis that suggests that it's probably at earlier after the secretion of

236
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,440
LpA. So not entirely in the bloodstream, but when it leaves hepatocyte in the space of this in the

237
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,680
liver that the binding of APO lipoprotein little a with LDL. But now I think we have

238
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:12,440
very good evidence that to suggest that this happens within liver cell, the binding of APO-A

239
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:20,440
to APO-B to eventually form LpA. So there's good evidence to suggest that as soon as the

240
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,840
APO-A is produced, it can form an LpA when it meets with an APO-B particle.

241
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,200
And for whatever reason, that just seems a bit more intuitively obvious given the mechanics of

242
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,240
it. You're bringing so many LDLs to the liver, you're making APO lipoprotein little a in the

243
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,360
liver. It seems like a more obvious place for the marriage to occur than in the periphery. But again,

244
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,960
it remains to be seen, although it seems like it's more likely that that is the case, correct?

245
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,720
Correct. And so the levels of LpA are determined by the levels of production,

246
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,240
by the rate of production of LpA particle and little by its catabolism. We're still

247
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:16,600
not entirely sure of how the catabolism of LpA occurs. Most of it is by the liver. There's a

248
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:25,160
little bit of catabolism by the kidney as well. But identifying the receptor at the surface of

249
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,040
hepatocyte that will remove LpA from the bloodstream has been challenging. So there's

250
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,280
some evidence suggesting that the LDL receptor might be one of them. There's some evidence for

251
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:45,880
and against that. And there's also the plasminogen receptor. And I think we're going to eventually

252
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,720
talk about the homology between APO lipoprotein little a and plasminogen.

253
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,600
So let's go back to this point, which is that it's really the production of APO lipoprotein

254
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:06,280
little a that determines the concentration of LpA. And if that weren't the case, it might be

255
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,640
that by simply reducing the amount of targets for it, i.e. reducing the amount of LDL,

256
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,880
you might reduce the amount of LpA. But in fact, that does not appear to be true,

257
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,520
with one notable exception that we will get to down the line.

258
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:25,960
In other words, if you give somebody a statin, which is a very potent drug to lower LDL,

259
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:34,360
the primary mechanism by which it does so is by increasing hepatic clearance of LDL.

260
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:41,320
So you have more and longer lasting LDL receptors on the liver, and they're pulling those LDL out

261
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,680
of circulation, which is lowering the plasma concentration. And yet that does nothing to

262
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,040
offset the amount of LpA, which goes back to the explanation that started your journey here,

263
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,480
which was why is it that some people respond really well to statins and some don't?

264
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,160
And obviously, it would be the higher your LpA, the worse your statin response,

265
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,080
because there's a subset of your LDL that are not responding to the statin.

266
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,320
So maybe let's start by explaining how a statin takes an LDL out of circulation,

267
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,360
and why this doesn't work for an LpA, which is basically just an LDL with this one other

268
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:33,000
little thing covalently bound to it. Exactly. So the statins actually reduce LDL particles

269
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,880
in the circulation by upregulating the LDL receptor at the surface of the hepatocytes.

270
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,120
So the density of the LDL receptor at the surface of the hepatocyte is super important. The more

271
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:53,800
LDL receptor you have, the higher the catabolism of APOB containing lipoproteins will be because

272
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:01,720
APOB binds to the LDL receptor. So under the assumption that LpA is catabolized by

273
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,840
the LDL receptor, you would think that statins would actually reduce LpA levels.

274
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:17,080
Whereas we see that there's not really a lowering effect of statins on LpA. And there's even been

275
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,760
more than one studies that have shown that if you put somebody on a statin, you'll even have

276
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:30,440
a small increase in LpA levels. Now that shouldn't be a reason not to put someone on a statin,

277
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,800
of course, because there's been trials like the heart protection study that have shown that

278
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:46,040
a treatment with statin is beneficial in patients with high LpA level, even maybe even more so

279
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:55,000
than patients with low LpA levels. So one should not prescribe a statin because you're afraid of

280
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,320
a small LpA level. It might be an interesting thing to do to measure LpA levels before and after the

281
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:11,320
initiation of a statin. But overall, we have so much experience with statin that we know they work

282
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,040
in the overwhelming majority of individuals and especially even better in patients with high LpA.

283
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:25,160
Yeah, I mean, one hypothesis for that might be that the statins are bringing a higher influx of

284
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:32,200
LDL to the site of the production of the apolipoprotein, little a, and that might possibly be why

285
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:39,320
you're seeing an increase in LpA. Again, if that were true, that would make it even more likely

286
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,920
the scenario that that's the source of the merger between apolipoprotein, little a, and LDL.

287
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,440
What's the approximate magnitude by which LDL or ApoB, let's be specific, I guess, because that's

288
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,760
really the metric we care about. What's the magnitude by which ApoB would go up in the

289
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,360
presence of a statin for an Lp, little a, pardon me, let me restate that. What's the magnitude by

290
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,560
which Lp, little a would go up in the context of a statin? Well, that depends on the study.

291
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,680
There's been a lot of studies that have shown that statins don't have an effect.

292
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:25,160
Most of the studies have shown like a 10% increment in LpA levels. If you have low LpA levels

293
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,120
and you're treated with a statin, you'll still remain with a low LpA level. If you have high

294
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,600
LpA level, then you'll obviously still remain with a high LpA level, although it's going to be

295
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:50,120
a little bit higher. It's important to say that as we move forward with LpA lowering drugs that

296
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:57,960
are being tested on top of statin therapy at the moment. We have published a paper in Patients

297
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,960
with Aortic Valve Stenosis at the Astronomer Trial where you can actually get, I think it

298
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,800
was a 20% increment in lipoprotein, little a. It might not be trivial. The signal is there,

299
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,680
but let me restate that statins are very effective in patients with LpA, even though

300
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,680
there's a small increment of LpA. Yeah, and an easy way to think about this would be

301
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,320
if you give a statin and let's say in the most aggressive case, the LpA goes up by 10%,

302
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:38,680
but the ApoB comes down by 60%, you'd have to make the case that an LpA is six times

303
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,120
more atherogenic for particle basis for that to be an equivalence maneuver.

304
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,880
So that begs the question, what is it about LpA that's so virulent? What is it about LpA

305
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:01,400
that makes it, I assume, more atherogenic on a particle for particle basis than its

306
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:08,440
garden variety ApoB bearing cousin? Yeah, there's no question about this, Peter. I mean,

307
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:16,120
on a per particle basis, LpA is much more atherogenic than an equivalent LDL particles.

308
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Well, first of all, an LpA has an LDL particle on it. So by definition, it's, you know, as

309
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:35,080
atherogenic just to start with. There's also evidence that LpA might influence the rates of

310
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:41,880
thrombosis because LpA has a sequence homology with plasminogen, which plays a role in

311
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:54,760
clotting and has anti-fibrinolytic activity. But I think the most important thing is the number

312
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:03,320
of oxidized phospholipids that are transported by lipoprotein little a, which is much higher than

313
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:12,280
the amount of oxidized phospholipids that that you see on LDL particles. And oxidized phospholipids

314
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:20,600
have effects on a wide variety of cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, macrophages,

315
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:27,320
cells of the aortic valve like valvular interstitial cells. Now they're sending in

316
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:37,160
signals that will drive pro-inflammatory, maybe pro-trombotic and pro-calcifying signals to these

317
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,960
cells. So that is probably the most important reason why on a per particle basis LpA is more

318
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,480
atherogenic than LDL. So let's talk about these oxidized phospholipids. I think most people might

319
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,440
not be familiar with what a phospholipid is. But before we do that, let's explain to people

320
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:09,400
what an LDL looks like physically in relation to an LDL. So if an LDL is a largely spherical

321
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:20,040
compound that has on its surface a single lipoprotein called ApoB100 that wraps around it,

322
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,520
how does that now interact with the ApolipoproteinA to become an LpA?

323
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay, so to answer this question, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the structure of

324
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:42,280
ApolipoproteinA. And to explain that, I'm going to talk about plasminogen for a minute. So

325
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:50,440
plasminogen is a gene that's expressed on chromosome 6. It has five cringles repeats.

326
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,720
Now a cringles is, it's called a cringles because it resembles a Danish pastry. So it's a little

327
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:06,520
round of proteins and you have five of them that are one another in the protein. Now LpA is the

328
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:14,360
gene right next to plasminogen on chromosome 6. And we have reasons to believe that along the

329
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:23,160
lines of evolution, it probably emerged from a duplication of the plasminogen gene. So LpA

330
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:30,200
which would have been very important tens and hundreds of thousands of years ago, because

331
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:36,040
trauma was such a threat to our species, much more than it is today. And of course,

332
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,880
trauma carries with it in the short term an immediate risk of hemorrhagic shock, blood loss.

333
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,760
Ultimately septic shock probably would have killed just as many people from the infection.

334
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,640
But anything that would have reduced your risk of hemorrhagic shock would have been a generally

335
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,680
positive thing up until a hundred years ago or a couple hundred years ago. So tell people exactly

336
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,720
how plasminogen would have played a role in that and why this is something that if a duplication

337
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:12,040
was created probably worked to an evolutionary advantage again until we lived long enough for

338
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:22,040
it not to. Yeah, there's a lot of hypotheses out there and the effect of LpA on wound healing is

339
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:30,040
certainly one of them and this is being studied ex vivo. So that might be one of the reasons why

340
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:38,520
we have high LpA levels in 20% of the population and why before that even there was the duplication

341
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:46,440
of the plasminogen gene. Now when we're talking about that duplication, it's only the

342
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:55,640
cringles four and cringles five that remain in the LpA gene and the cringles four is even separated

343
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,800
in 10 different subunits. So there's the cringles four type one all the way to the cringles four

344
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,360
type 10. Now the most important is probably the cringles four type two which is where the copy

345
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:18,120
number variation is. So one can have one cringles four type two or only a couple and you can also

346
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,600
have the way all up to 40 cringles four type two repeats. So this is where when we talk about LpA

347
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,720
isoform size it's due to variation in cringles four type two. So there's other cringles

348
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:41,160
repeats that are parts that are important. Cringles four type 10 is probably the most important for

349
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:48,200
the binding of oxidized phospholipid and to answer your question Peter about the interaction

350
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:56,200
between ApoA and ApoB you have to look at the cringles four type nine which contains cysteine

351
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:09,080
residues which are important to do a disulfid bridge with ApoB. So it's a covalent bound that's

352
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:16,360
happening because of the cysteine residues on cringles four type nine. So interesting sort of

353
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:23,880
thought experiment. And the reason I'm asking this question is not just to be difficult it's to try to

354
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,520
understand the pathophysiology a bit better especially as it pertains to the oxidized

355
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:36,840
phospholipid. If you could create a drug that would cleave that does that disulfide bond so it

356
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:43,240
couldn't it wouldn't lower ApoB and it wouldn't lower Apo lipoprotein little a it would just

357
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:51,000
prevent their union and therefore it would eliminate Lp little a but you still had a high

358
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,440
concentration of Apo lipoprotein little a floating around by itself dragging with it oxidized

359
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:06,280
phospholipids. Would you guess that it would still be problematic or would your guess be that no

360
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:14,440
because it wouldn't be able to gain residence in the tissues such as the subendothelial space

361
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,680
the interstitial space of the aortic valve all the places where it wreaks havoc.

362
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:26,840
Yeah I'm only going to speculate here of course there's I don't think there's solid data on the

363
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,360
the form of ApoA that's not bound to to LDL particles. So we know that

364
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:47,080
ApoA can still have oxidized phospholipids and we are not entirely sure how if you're talking

365
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:55,080
about LpA how it it gets inside the cells if it gets inside the cells. Now we have some evidence

366
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:00,600
and we've we've published that with a colleague of mine Patrick Mathieu here who's a who's a

367
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:09,080
heart surgeon. We've looked at the an LpA receptor in the valvular interstitial cells so these are

368
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:17,160
the types of cells that are very abundant in the in the aortic valve and just to remind our

369
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,720
audience LpA is also associated to a very significant extent to aortic valve stenosis

370
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,040
and when I'm talking about LpA receptor I'm not talking about the receptor for

371
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:38,120
lipoprotein little a I'm talking about the receptor for lysophosphatidic acid which is generated by

372
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:47,240
LpA by an enzyme called autotaxin which is actually carried by LpA in in the blood. So on top of

373
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:56,200
oxidized phospholipids ApoB LDL LpA has its specific proteome so it carries a lot of of

374
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:03,240
different proteins that have different function that makes LpA even more atrogenic. Now these

375
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:13,800
oxidized phospholipid can have a signaling effect in the in the aortic valve and that might be

376
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,240
totally independent from from from LDL so so we don't know I'm only speculating here but there's

377
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:28,760
some signaling effects of of oxidized phospholipids that I think are very important and they they

378
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:38,680
activate a lot of of different inflammatory processes and also osteoblastic processes

379
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:46,760
because these types of valvular insert in interstitial cells are becoming like osteoblasts

380
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,800
which are the cell types that that that make bones so it makes a lot of sense you know when

381
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,840
you're talking about aortic valve calcification that there's a bone-like process that's that's

382
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,320
happening within this tissue. Yeah for all of our patients that have elevated LpA one of the first

383
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:12,280
tests we do is get a baseline look at their aortic valve so typically we'll do it with an echocardiogram

384
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,640
if we can get a good enough view if not we'll use a cardiac MRI but it's for exactly this reason.

385
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,800
What's the approximate hazard ratio? How much does risk go up for aortic stenosis

386
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,280
in an individual with elevated LpA and how much does it depend on whether or not they have a normal

387
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,920
aortic valve to begin with which has three leaflets so-called tricuspid valve versus if they have a

388
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,720
relatively common anatomic variant with only two leaflets which is called a bicuspid valve which

389
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:50,760
even outside of LpA would increase your risk for stenosis. Exactly so there's not really good

390
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:57,000
evidence showing that LpA is associated with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis because we

391
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,920
we're studying genes that that are associated with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and we don't see

392
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:10,040
really an effect of of LpA there. Now that being said it might accelerate the

393
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:18,840
the formation of aortic stenosis in patients with bicuspid aortic valve. Who are already at risk.

394
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:27,560
Exactly so LpA is probably an initiator of aortic valve stenosis and we've known that

395
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:37,000
since 2013 when George Tanesoulis and Wendy Post they published this

396
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:43,960
genome-wide association studies of aortic valve calcification in the in the charge consortium and

397
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:51,880
they've shown that LpA the with that one variant associated with high LpA level was the most

398
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,360
important variant associated with aortic valve disease. Now we had known for a few years that

399
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:05,160
LpA was present in the valve and in the valve it actually co-localizes with oxidized phospholipids

400
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:15,000
so we knew this but that study was really I think a game changer for our understanding of

401
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:24,120
aortic valve stenosis. Now when we're looking at the effect of high LpA on aortic valve stenosis

402
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,480
it really depends on the level of LpA. So if you're looking at patients that have

403
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:40,520
high ish LpA levels such as well let's say 50 milligrams per deciliter or 125 nanomolar their

404
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:49,560
risk can be increased by 50 percent to maybe 100 percent or double but when you're going into

405
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:56,520
and you look at patients that have very high LpA their risk can can increase quite

406
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,960
substantially. So if you have patients with with very high LpA level then what you're doing

407
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,720
looking at the at the aortic valve especially by echo because it's probably the most

408
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:16,280
widely available tool to investigate this. Now in our lab we performed

409
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:25,800
sodium fluoride PET CT so positron emission tomography coupled with computed tomography using

410
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,600
a radio tracer that's called that that's called sodium fluoride and in patients that have high

411
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:39,560
LpA levels but these were patients from the general population we can already see like a signal

412
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:49,480
before the onset of aortic valve calcification using this this this radio tracer. So this really

413
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:56,680
tells you that there's an effect of LpA on the initiation of the of the process of aortic valve.

414
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,320
And what is it so you're seeing before any gradient appears before any flow related metric

415
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,720
you're seeing a metabolic change of the valve? Yeah exactly so the the sodium fluoride will

416
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:21,160
actually bind to a chemical called hydroxyapatite which is literally the complex of calcium and

417
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:29,400
phosphorus which will eventually be involved in the petro physiology of aortic valve stenosis.

418
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,240
And we see that process happening very early at the earliest stage of the of the disease and we

419
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:41,720
also see an effect of LpA on the later stage of the disease. So the the data that's available so

420
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:49,000
far that have looked at the progression rates of aortic valve stenosis has shown that patients with

421
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,840
high LpA might even progress more rapidly than patients with who have low LpA especially with

422
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:04,120
in younger patients that have that have high LpA because when you're looking at patients you know

423
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:12,760
that are above 75 or 80 there's a lot of calcium that's already present in the valve and the

424
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,440
mechanism might be very different in younger patient compared to to older patient when you're

425
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,560
when we're investigating the progression of aortic valve stenosis. Yeah and if we're going to create

426
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:29,560
a public service announcement here for primary care physicians it's so important to identify

427
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,760
aortic stenosis in its earliest stages because the outcome data are quite clear that the earlier

428
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,920
you intervene the better the outcome. So you know I think 25 years ago we had a certain threshold

429
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,440
in terms of surface area of the valve and gradient of pressure across the valve at which point you

430
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:54,040
would you know replace the aortic valve. If you look at the literature today it seems that you're

431
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,320
getting better and better outcomes when you proceed earlier and earlier before the heart is overly

432
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,880
taxed based on that based on that pressure head that it faces and of course the increased risk of

433
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,200
spontaneous cardiac death and other things that goes up with aortic stenosis. So aortic stenosis

434
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:16,360
is a very serious problem independent of ASCVD atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which is

435
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,600
what most people think of when they think of LpA assuming they know something about what we're

436
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:28,680
talking about in terms of this molecule. So let's go back to another point you raised so you and

437
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:34,360
again I think when people look at the diagram this will be much easier. We get into the anatomy

438
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,440
of the fourth and fifth region of these cringal repeats and which of the subunits can create this

439
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:49,480
vast heterogeneity. Why two people can have an LpA gene that over expresses Lp well LpA through

440
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:55,320
apoliproptenin little a but they can have one of them can have a molar mass that's very high one

441
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:01,000
can have a molar mass that's very low because of these number of cringal repeats. What does the

442
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:09,160
number of these repeats tell us about the pathophysiology of this? Well if you had asked me that

443
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:18,200
question 10 years ago I would have said a lot but our understanding of the pathophysiology of LpA

444
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:27,720
is increasing every every week now basically. So maybe 10 years ago there was this debate about

445
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:35,240
LpA as to whether or not it was the LpA concentration that matter or if LpA concentration

446
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:43,560
didn't matter at all because it's the apoA isoform size that that matter small isoform size being

447
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:49,960
associated with higher LpA levels and there has been some epidemiological studies that have

448
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:58,920
measured apoA isoform size either through PCR or immunoblotting etc so in the same patient you

449
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:07,400
can have LpA levels measured and you can have the apoA isoform size and using the techniques that

450
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,400
were available back then they did multiple adjustment adjusting LpA concentration for

451
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:20,440
the apoA isoform size and looking at the association of apoA isoform size with outcome adjusting for

452
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:27,000
LpA levels and the data back then was going all over the place basically so some studies were

453
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,280
saying it's the concentration some other studies were saying it's the apoA isoform size that matters

454
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:42,360
and once again these questions were ultimately resolved by looking at genetics so there's

455
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:51,400
there's one variant that's associated with small LpA isoform size but that's also associated with

456
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:58,680
a low LpA so you can see this was our way to do a discordance analysis by looking at that specific

457
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:06,840
SNP and that genetic variant was not associated with cardiovascular diseases at all and in many

458
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:16,120
studies now it's been shown that probably the best study that has investigated that is a study from

459
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:25,320
the D code cohort which is a cohort from Iceland they have they sequenced they did a whole genome

460
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:33,160
sequencing and I think it was 50,000 sorry 15,000 individuals and they've shown unequivocally that

461
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:41,240
the LpA isoform size even though you can sequence it really was not associated with

462
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:48,440
the risk of heart attacks and strokes once you take into consideration LpA level so it's really

463
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,760
the LpA number that matters and that's actually very positive for for the field that because

464
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,360
there's so many puzzles that we still need to figure out in terms of of the association between

465
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:08,120
LpA and risk so at least we can you know I think I can we can convincingly say that it's the the

466
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:13,640
the number of LpA particles that that matter and not necessarily the isoform size and that the

467
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:20,200
isoform size matters because it's associated with different levels of of LpA and not true an

468
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,960
independent effect. So really this for once creates a beautiful symmetry here which is it

469
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:34,840
mirrors ApoB the first second and third order factor in the in the uh in the harm caused by

470
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:41,480
an LDL particle is the number of the particles the size all of those things only factor into the

471
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:47,560
number so why is it that smaller particles are more often associated with a poor phenotype

472
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,800
because when you have smaller particles you generally have more of them.

473
00:56:53,720 --> 00:57:06,040
So that's good to know. Do we have a sense of the complexity in why some families because again we

474
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,360
didn't talk about the inheritance of this so in fact before I ask this question let's go back and

475
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,240
explain the inheritance of this it's a very important piece of the puzzle. How is this gene

476
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:22,440
inherited and what are the implications for people who have elevated levels of this as far

477
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,000
as their offspring? Yeah that's a that's a very good question. So the pattern of inheritance is

478
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:38,680
true autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance so it's like any like for instance if you compare

479
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,480
it with a monogenic disorder let's say familial hypercholesterolemia. In in Quebec we have a very

480
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:54,840
famous mutation which is a 15 kilo base deletion in the LDL receptor so if uh if you inherit that

481
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:02,600
then if you inherit at least one copy you know you'll you'll have FH. For LPA if you inherit

482
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:09,320
a genetic variant that's associated with high LPA chances are you'll have high LPA as well

483
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:15,240
because you only need one variant and not necessarily two so you need either the allele from

484
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:22,600
your father or your mother that will rise LPA but it's a bit more complex than that because we

485
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,400
we cannot necessarily consider it monogenic disorders because there's

486
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:36,760
2,000 different variants in the LPA region that are associated with high LPA so your father can

487
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:43,560
have an high LPA because of a specific variant and your mother can have an an LPA variant that

488
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:51,000
lowers LPA but it depends on the combination of SNPs that you will ultimately get so it's not

489
00:58:51,960 --> 00:59:00,600
it's not as clear as any monogenic disorder even though it's a dominant mode of of inheritance

490
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:11,400
it's been shown that the children you can they have a very different LPA levels than their

491
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
their mothers and fathers and you cannot really estimate it so you really have to

492
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
to measure it and for people that are asking the question at what time I should get an LPA

493
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,680
measurement let's say if I had a heart attack at an early age and I want to prevent that in

494
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:38,440
in my children then we know that the LPA gene is fully expressed by age two in the liver of course

495
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:46,600
and that the levels that you will get at five years old are probably going to remain

496
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,520
this well maybe not the same levels but if you have high levels by age five

497
00:59:53,640 --> 01:00:01,320
so it'll probably increase through adulthood but very very slowly yeah so again some very

498
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:08,120
important information there right piece one of that is you cannot predict the phenotype of the

499
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:16,440
offspring from the phenotype of the parents and let's contrast this with apo-e the gene by the

500
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:23,160
way there's a lot of parallels between apo-e and LPA apo-e is a gene that today doesn't seem to

501
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,160
serve much of a purpose all it seems to do is increase your risk of Alzheimer's disease and

502
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,440
even increase your risk of cardiovascular disease independent of that there are three

503
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,920
isoforms the two three four type and it's this fourth type that's high risk so you can argue

504
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:45,080
how in the world does this gene exist and of course the answer is evolution wasn't really

505
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,240
thinking about Alzheimer's disease so therefore there must have been some benefit of it and of

506
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,440
course we now know there is right this this genotype was associated with protection from

507
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:01,080
parasitic infections in the brain which would have been far more to our advantage 100 000

508
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:08,600
years ago 50 000 years ago 10 000 years ago than the downside of Alzheimer's disease in your 70s

509
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:18,920
or 80s but with apo-e because you have these three discrete isoforms you only have six combinations

510
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:25,960
and therefore if you know what the parents isoforms are you can probabilistically give a

511
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,640
distribution for what the children will be you still would need to measure it of course

512
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,880
but there's a finite number of outcomes now of course there you're measuring genotype and not

513
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:43,480
phenotype we don't measure the phenotype of apo-e yet so here you have so many genes

514
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,800
that are associated with this thing that if the parents are both elevated the probability that

515
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,600
the offspring are going to be elevated seems pretty high if one parent is elevated and the

516
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:01,080
other is not there's a pretty decent chance that the offspring will not tell me about the situation

517
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:08,760
in which both parents are not elevated but yet could carry genes that or could carry variants

518
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:16,120
of LPA that when combined could elevate that is that has that been observed or does one safely say

519
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:23,000
if both of your parents are below 30 milligrams per deciliter the probability that you are going

520
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,400
to be north of 50 is very small i think it's very small but you still have to to measure it

521
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:36,760
peter i i i to be honest i don't think i would know the answer to that uh so that's why we we

522
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:44,920
simply suggest to measure LPA well the guidelines now most guidelines will tell you to measure it in

523
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,200
everybody at least once in their lifetime but and there are people guidelines suggest that that

524
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,320
start do the guidelines suggest doing it in adolescence when you have a long enough runway

525
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:02,120
to take action if the LP little a is elevated or do they not specify i don't think they they

526
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:09,480
specify that and the the guidelines are actually just starting to advise for for LPA measurements

527
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:17,880
so some some guidelines uh like the american heart association guidelines uh which are um probably the

528
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,280
less favorable for LPA measurement they'll tell you to measure i don't remember exactly but in

529
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:29,720
patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or with a family history of atherosclerotic

530
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:34,760
cardiovascular disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or in patients with aortic

531
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:41,720
valve stenosis so but the guidelines don't usually so in other words when measure the LP little a

532
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:49,560
once they've demonstrated that the disease that it causes is present yeah pretty much that's

533
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:54,840
fantastic advice so so so if you look at the yeah but if you look at the canadian guidelines though

534
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:59,800
they'll tell they'll tell you to measure it in everybody at least once in their in their lifetime

535
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,320
so there's and by the way this is where canadians also stand out over americans canadians have long

536
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:12,760
adopted the measurement of apo b as the superior measurement to quantify LDL risk and yet here in

537
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:18,760
the united states the guidelines still favor the use of LDL cholesterol which is clearly inferior

538
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:26,360
to apo b yeah absolutely so uh i i would like to comment on on that i think i think the the

539
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:31,640
canadian guidelines are are much more up to date with the with the recent literature on that there's

540
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,760
clearly no no doubt about it but as are the european guidelines while we're on the topic yeah the

541
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,680
european guidelines the canadian guidelines are in line with the available evidence and the united

542
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,520
states guidelines are you know just 40 years out of date but that's all yeah absolutely and the

543
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:54,120
european guidelines actually they they advise to measure lpa in everybody for a different reason

544
01:04:54,120 --> 01:05:02,520
it was to identify patients who have very very high lpa levels because we realize uh throughout

545
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:11,000
the years that the having a super high lpa might be a cause for familial hypercholesterolemia

546
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:20,680
so um so and you need to measure ldl to diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia and after them after

547
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:28,360
mutation in the ldl receptor mutation or variation in the lpa gene might even be the second cause of

548
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:35,000
familial hypercholesterolemia and the reason for that is quite simple because when you measure ldl

549
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:45,320
uh you also measure lpa cholesterol so if you have a very high ldl and also a very high lpa

550
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:53,480
there's a very good chance that the high ldl cholesterol will actually be high lpa uh cholesterol

551
01:05:53,480 --> 01:06:00,840
so um so yeah this is i think it's really underappreciated and and actually that's the reason why

552
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:07,800
it's in the european guidelines uh but now i think most of the guidelines that will that will be uh

553
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:15,720
put forward will just simply for whatever reason to measure lpa at least once and i don't know if

554
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,480
it's in the pediatric guidelines because i don't really follow that that literature but uh maybe

555
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:33,560
in children uh who have strokes at a young age many of them have high lpa so it's not as um as

556
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:40,040
clean as the literature in adults but there's been a lot of studies looking at high lpa and

557
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:48,120
stroke in children so uh if you have a family history uh or relatives that had uh stroke at

558
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:54,680
at a young age it might be a good idea to uh to to measure lpa as well yeah that's actually a

559
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,760
terrifying thought by the way um you know my view on these things of course is just that

560
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,920
the amount of energy that goes into debating it is so ridiculous compared to the relatively low

561
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:12,760
cost of simply measuring the thing the the people who debate why oh why would you spend 14 dollars on

562
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,400
an apo b test it's like if your life isn't worth 14 dollars we shouldn't be having this discussion

563
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:24,520
same is true for measuring lp little a so uh i think it should be done on everybody non-negotiable

564
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:32,040
certainly before your 18th birthday that would be my that would be my thinking on this um so uh

565
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:39,480
let's go back now by the way i what's the greatest that you've seen uh number of lpa to lp little a

566
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:45,640
to ldl i i had a patient once when we were measuring both in nanomole per liter who had an

567
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:53,240
lp little a of 690 nanomole per liter in the context of an ldl particle concentration of about

568
01:07:53,240 --> 01:08:02,200
1800 nanomole per liter so a little over one third of his ldl were lp little a i assume you've seen

569
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:09,640
numbers even in excess of that uh yeah well um just to to be to be clear peter i don't see i

570
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:15,160
don't see patients i'm not i'm not a physician i'm a biochemist but i've seen and i've seen some

571
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:24,280
very interesting case reports uh on uh children that have uh fh and high lpa some of them even

572
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:31,720
had to have liver transplant because uh the the lipids were just so high and they were having

573
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:39,640
events in children years so uh so but those are only uh case reports of course it's it's it's not

574
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:45,160
the not mainstreaming i wouldn't want to scare anybody but this is this is as dangerous as it

575
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:51,560
can get so let's talk about other therapies that have been proposed so there was certainly a day

576
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:57,800
and sadly there are still a number of physicians that i interact with including those who

577
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,960
carry the uh the title of lipidologist who are recommending the use of niacin

578
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,640
to lower lp little a can you talk a little bit about the history of that

579
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,840
and at the risk of spoiling the punchline why we do not believe that is a good idea

580
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:23,160
yeah um well it was even in the latest in the last guidelines of the european atherosclerosis

581
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:32,120
society to advise niacin treatment in some patients with with high lpa and we did not have

582
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:40,200
cardio large cardiovascular outcome studies uh on uh on on literally any effect of of niacin therapy

583
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:47,960
now we know that niacin therapy will actually reduce lpa levels it will increase hdl it will

584
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:56,840
lower triglycerides so the effects on on plasma lipids are are actually pretty good um however and

585
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,200
and you know if you're looking at lpa the reduction the mean reduction will probably be about 20 or 30

586
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:08,200
percent with the with niacin and there are as you say some lipidologists that have seen like very

587
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:14,200
important reductions of of lpa with niacin that that actually so they've decided to keep those

588
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:20,520
patients on on niacin and i don't see any any any problem with that uh the thing is however when

589
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:27,480
you look at the actual evidence we have two large cardiovascular outcomes trials we have the aim high

590
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:36,040
trial and the heart protection study two trive trial that have shown that there's no cardiovascular

591
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:44,280
benefits in treating uh well uh anyone with uh with niacin and we see a lot of side effects as well

592
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:51,320
uh flushing being the most uh the most important side effect of of niacin so we have those risks

593
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:59,160
and we don't have that many benefits so that's why niacin is not as prescribed as it uh as it

594
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:04,120
once was there are still people that have that are using it niacin reduces the production of

595
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:12,440
of lpa but uh and an lpa still predicts the risk of events in patients treated with niacin so we

596
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:20,600
know that from the from the aim high trial so when you're looking at the cost to benefit ratio for

597
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:26,520
for niacin the evidence really isn't isn't there to support so why why do you think this is i mean

598
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:33,640
if we look at the effect of niacin on raising HDL which it does right HDL cholesterol goes up

599
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:40,120
with niacin administration at a high enough dose um but the outcome trials are very clear that that

600
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:46,840
does not translate into benefit it makes you think a little bit of the CTEP trials where you give a

601
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:53,320
CTEP inhibitor HDL cholesterol goes up in some cases you actually saw more events but usually at

602
01:11:53,320 --> 01:12:00,200
best you see no effect there it's a little easier to argue why that could be happening

603
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:07,560
when you look at the complexity of HDL biology and you understand how much we don't understand

604
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:13,400
and therefore that HDL functionality is what really matters and we don't have an assay for

605
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:19,480
HDL functionality so these things that we measure like the amount of cholesterol in an HDL particle

606
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:26,440
is a pretty useless measurement in that it tells us nothing about how the HDL actually works

607
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:31,160
especially when you consider that you can have high cholesterol in an HDL particle because of all

608
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:35,240
the cholesterol that's entering it or you could have high cholesterol in an HDL particle because

609
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,480
not much cholesterol is leaving it those would be two completely different states of affairs

610
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:48,600
and again it makes sense why you can dismiss the notion that raising HDL cholesterol is valuable

611
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,960
pharmacologically in the case of LP little a it's a bit more confusing because as you said

612
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:02,200
niacin actually inhibits the production of apo lipoprotein little a and for all of the

613
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:08,760
nastiness associated with LDL and LP little a their biology is actually easier to understand

614
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,080
in other words the things that they're doing to hurt you are easier to understand than what HDL

615
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:19,240
is doing to help you so why do you think there is not a more clear signal between the use of

616
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:26,120
niacin and the reduction of events yeah it's a very good question and the Mendelian randomization

617
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:34,440
studies have been very clear that you will need a very large reduction in LPA to produce

618
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:42,200
cardiovascular benefits there was the first study has uh has shown that i suggested that because

619
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:48,680
it's basically only modeling right we there's no trial data so we can at best estimate the

620
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,600
treatment effect so it suggested that you needed a hundred milligrams per deciliter reduction in

621
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:02,200
LPA to get a benefit in a trial that would be comparable to a statin treatment like over what

622
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,160
period is that a five year you'd need to see that in a five year window or what yeah well that's

623
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,080
actually the problem because when you're looking at Mendelian randomization studies you're looking

624
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,920
at primary prevention and we're looking at lifelong reduction so it's very hard to estimate

625
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,960
oh so the MR says if you want to reduce if you want to take that mortality curve down

626
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:28,040
to the next rung it's a hundred milligram per deciliter reduction and lifetime exposure

627
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:34,440
which means in a clinical study that showed that there's other study that came out after that that

628
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:40,520
said well it's probably not a hundred it might might be around 50 milligrams per deciliter but

629
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,560
it's still high so you need a large effect so it's not a 20 reduction but there's a bigger point

630
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:52,120
there which is which you alluded to if that that's over the course of your life that's that yeah

631
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:57,000
well that means over five years you might have to basically obliterate it if you're going to want to

632
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,040
see a benefit yes and well that's what the anti-cense the anti-sensology nucleotides will do and we'll

633
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,680
I guess we'll come back to that later but when they compare it to LDL though they also compare

634
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:15,880
it to lifelong exposure to lower LDL so so they're not necessarily comparing lifelong reduction to

635
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:22,440
trial data that we you know with statin trials we have between two and seven years length of

636
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,600
treatment in patients that already have disease so you cannot really compare apple and oranges but

637
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:32,120
when you compare the lifelong effect and that's obviously a caveat of those of those studies

638
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:38,840
because you're trying to get lifelong effects to to estimate the results of a trial using lifelong

639
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:46,520
effects so so you have to you know take some and and leave some for those for those kinds of studies

640
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:52,760
but I want to come back to something that you said about CTP inhibitors because we we do have

641
01:15:52,760 --> 01:16:00,040
evidence at least for the anacetrapib that it might lead to cardiovascular benefit the trial

642
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:06,200
was that the Merck one yes they stopped the trial even though it was trending in a positive direction

643
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:13,560
is that correct exactly so there's one reason for that was that they saw a lot of drug accumulation

644
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:21,000
in adipose tissue which is not something you want if you want to prescribe a lifelong treatment

645
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,720
and the second thing is that well the treatment effect was not spectacularly high so it was I

646
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:35,320
think it was a six percent reduction in the rate of events but because I'm saying this because you

647
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:40,440
talk about HGL and functionality and in that trial I don't remember the name of the trial it was a

648
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:45,320
revealed trial they they've shown yeah that was stopped about two years ago it was relatively

649
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,800
recent maybe three years ago right oh maybe a little bit more than that but it was a big trial

650
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:56,040
I think 30 000 patients so this is why we need big trials in that in that in that arena

651
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:04,200
so what they showed is that the it was the reduction in the number of apo B lipoproteins

652
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:11,640
that actually mattered it really didn't matter like the risk was not proportional to the HGL

653
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:18,760
rising effect it was proportional to the apo B lowering effect and when you're looking and if

654
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:26,200
you plot all the all the clinical trials together if you plot the apo B lowering effect to the

655
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:33,560
reduction in cardiovascular disease you can see that all these trials line perfectly on the line

656
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:40,200
and even that that specific trial with anisetrapib it fell right on the line same with

657
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:49,480
uh pc sk9 inhibitors same with isetamib any LDL lowering drug that's that that's out there will

658
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,360
basically well there's maybe some few a few exceptions but it will land on this line so it's

659
01:17:54,360 --> 01:18:00,040
really not about HGL so much well when they developed the drug they thought it was about

660
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:06,600
HGL of course but it's really it's really funny because actually it's it just further convinced us

661
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:14,760
to hit low hit on apo B containing lipoproteins as hard as we can yeah it is kind of the silver

662
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,160
lining and all of this sometimes it's easy if you think about this stuff too much philosophically to

663
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:24,200
lament the fact that we even have apo B right because there's no real need for apo B you know

664
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,800
we could we could survive with no circulating apo B and we wouldn't have any atherosclerotic disease

665
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,200
so every time you get a little depressed and have that thought you can also realize how fortunate

666
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:40,040
are we that the biology of apo B is so much more well understood than that of apo A now I'm talking

667
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:48,280
apo big A and that eradicating apo B is becoming easier and easier and easier and safer and safer

668
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:54,840
and safer and it's the single most important thing that you can do in the plasma to reduce the risk

669
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,200
of atherosclerotic disease I mean all these things make for a very fortunate turn of events for our

670
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:05,960
species and that's why turning to this pesky LP little a is so important because of what you

671
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:12,280
described at the outset which is this residual risk in the individuals and it's interesting you

672
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,680
you talked about 20 percent that's higher than I that's that's higher than the number I quote my

673
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:21,880
patients I usually tell my patients it's 10 percent so I've been understating this for some time

674
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:27,560
I didn't realize it so all comers 20 percent of the population would be over 50 milligrams per

675
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:35,320
deciliter yeah depending on on ethnicity so it's certainly above 15 percent no no no doubt about

676
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:41,160
it and some population especially in populations of European ancestry they have the highest

677
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:50,680
LPA level I'm sorry of African ancestry they have the highest LPA levels and they also have the

678
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:59,560
highest LPA levels adjusted for LPA isoform size as well so in most of individuals what if you look

679
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:06,280
at the distribution of LPA in the population it's really skewed towards the null so it means that

680
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:13,720
there's a lot of patient most individuals have very low levels of of LPA and there's some

681
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:20,360
individuals as we as we mentioned 15 to 20 percent that have high LPA levels now in individuals of

682
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:27,240
African ancestry it's it's a more like a Gaussian distribution so so that's one of the reason why

683
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:34,360
they have higher LPA does that mean they have higher risk if they have a higher LPA not

684
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:41,320
necessarily because the the risk is really proportionate to to the to the level so there's

685
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:48,520
nobody within shouting distance of the of what I'm about to say I believe which is LPA little a

686
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:56,680
is hands down the most common hereditary driver of ASCVD correct I mean FH wouldn't even get within

687
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:02,920
the same zip code when you think about genetic things that are driving atherosclerotic cardiovascular

688
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:11,240
disease correct it is by far the most prevalent form of dyslipidemia so you can argue that maybe

689
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,240
and and we have to talk about penetrance as well so the penetrance is the proportion of

690
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:23,400
individuals with a certain genotype that will have the phenotype exactly so the penetrance is

691
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:29,560
obviously not a hundred percent right so so when I hear people say that you know LPA for the

692
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:36,200
pharmaceutical industry is a market of 1.4 billion people I say well hold on a second it's not it's

693
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:43,080
not everyone that has a high LPA that will have an event and we need to figure out what are the

694
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:50,440
the drivers of risk in patients with with high LPA and we're starting to study that then we see

695
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:56,840
that there is some residual risk effect even in patients with with high LPA so we see that for

696
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:04,520
instance if you have a high LPA but have lower CRP levels or lower like inflammation you might

697
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:13,320
be you might not have a risk that's as high as if you have high CRP so you can argue that residual

698
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:20,680
inflammation is very important but there need to be more studies on this because one can make the

699
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:26,680
case that while it might be the same for smoking or type 2 diabetes or any other cardiovascular

700
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:34,680
risk factor that you can think of but even then even if LPA is not fully penetrant it is so common

701
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:42,360
that it is by far the most important form of dyslipidemia that will explain a lot of

702
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:49,080
cardiovascular events at the population level and what I find so tragic about that statement

703
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:56,280
is the number of good physicians out there really great doctors that are working hard taking

704
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,960
care of patients frontline physicians family medicine physicians internists who have no idea

705
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:07,960
what it is you know you ask them about it and they look at you as though you've asked them something

706
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:14,920
in a different language I still struggle to understand that disconnect given its urgency I

707
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:20,360
wonder if that's a uniquely American phenomenon do you have any insight I know you're not a clinician

708
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:26,680
but do you have an insight as to whether or not the literacy around this in Canada and Europe is

709
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:33,480
higher I don't have any reasons to believe that the literacy in Canada or Europe is higher than

710
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:39,400
it is in in America even with your guidelines being more forward leaning oh yeah but these

711
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,600
guidelines are new and it will take a lot of time before they implement it sometimes it's you know

712
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:50,760
it it takes a full decade before it you know it's transmitted to younger generation of physician

713
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,560
and it's and people actually talk about it so that's one of the reason I'm so glad that we get to do

714
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:02,200
this this podcast hopefully this this will raise awareness for the physicians out there that no

715
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:08,760
didn't have any information about LPA and you know you can't blame them because well it it's

716
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:13,480
obviously in the guidelines but you know not all physicians and read all the lipids guidelines

717
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,960
there's so many guidelines out there that you can't blame them for that but I mean that's why

718
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:26,040
we have to do more education to to physicians and I think one of the reason that people are reluctant

719
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:31,880
to measure LPA is that because there's no treatment for for high LPA so sometimes

720
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:42,200
you know when you any so so any any medical procedure that you do even if it's asking for

721
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,280
a measurement of of any labs that you can mention it has benefits but it also have it also has

722
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:55,000
consequences so for instance you can you know you don't want to stress anybody saying hey you have

723
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:02,200
this risk factor it's super important and you don't want to do like an over diagnosis and an

724
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:09,400
overtreatment so so I used to I used to think that a lot but now you know we're in the age of shared

725
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:17,960
decision making you we can communicate the the correct information to to patient tell them tell

726
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:24,520
them what we know and even though there's no specific therapy for high LPA it doesn't mean

727
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:31,640
you can't do anything and I mean there's trial data showing that if you prescribe for instance

728
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:37,960
a statin and if you lower LDL cholesterol levels in patients that have some risk factors for

729
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:44,040
for cardiovascular disease you'll reduce their risk of events so in patients with high LPA

730
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:50,760
you need to manage LDL you need to manage LPA you need to manage lifestyle smoking cessation

731
01:25:51,560 --> 01:26:01,320
and etc and we've actually shown that I I worked I've been working for more than 15 years with

732
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:08,440
investigators in in Amsterdam and Cambridge on the epic Norfolk study so the epic Norfolk study

733
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:15,560
is the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition and they have LPA measurement

734
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:24,840
in 18 000 individuals and we've looked in that in that population at the effect of LPA on the risk

735
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:33,080
of events but according to what the American Heart Association calls the life simple seven so

736
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:43,480
smoking having a healthy diet being physically active having low body weight LDL cholesterol

737
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:51,640
no diabetes and blood pressure that's on target and if you look at patients that have high LPA

738
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:57,560
and that manage all of these risk factors it's observational study of course but you can

739
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:04,600
if you consider it a causal relationship you could reduce your risk by by two thirds so so

740
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:11,080
that's not trivial so so we're trying to so that's one reason why we should we should measure we

741
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:17,800
should measure LPA if it's just to target the the other risk factors will have a lot of benefits

742
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:24,120
in terms of prevention of cardiovascular diseases at the population level and I think this is another

743
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:30,040
great example of the parallel with apo-e the genotype as recently as even a couple of years ago

744
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:36,760
I would have enormous arguments with physicians about patients that we were co-managing right so

745
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:42,680
this would be a patient who has both of us as their physician and the patient would say look

746
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:47,720
I want to have my apo-e genotype measured I would say I completely concur the other physician would

747
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,120
say that's an absolutely horrible idea what good comes of that if they discover that they have an

748
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:57,400
apo-e4 gene and their risk is higher all you've done is create anxiety to which I would argue

749
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:03,160
perhaps in some individuals sure and that's why it should be something that is done with consent but

750
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:09,080
it that assumption can assumes you can do nothing about it and while you can't change the gene

751
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:15,800
the evidence that you can modify behaviors that will lower the risk is enormous now in the case of

752
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,600
apo-e it's even more complicated because we now know what we didn't know a few years ago which is

753
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:27,000
there are so many other genes that will either amplify or attenuate the risk of apo-e so frankly

754
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:34,840
today knowing that you're apo-e4 positive in my opinion carries much less information that it once

755
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:42,520
did so I want to ask you about something parallel with lp little a I've had patients who have had

756
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:54,520
modest lp little a meaning 150 125 nanomole per liter 60 milligram per deciliter

757
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:06,040
who have had the most devastating ascvd that you can shake a stick at I mean six vessel disease

758
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:14,520
calcium scores of 2000 I mean these are people who are having you know coronary artery bypass

759
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:21,640
surgery in their 50s and their lp little a is you know a little elevated and by the way their LDL

760
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:27,240
and apo-b were not through the roof they're not smokers they're not hypertensive they're

761
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:36,760
they're not type 2 diabetic etc hard to explain those ones similarly I've had patients whose

762
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:45,400
family histories do not suggest advanced or premature ascvd and I told you about one of

763
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:54,360
them earlier 690 nanomole per liter lp little a now this person had a zero calcium score admittedly

764
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:59,400
they were in their 40s so at least say you know a calcium score of zero when your 40s doesn't

765
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:04,760
generally tell you anything but at least tells you that this person isn't having advanced

766
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:12,040
atherosclerosis their family history is very uninspiring and at least one of their parents

767
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:18,040
had to have an elevated level grandparents nothing and I scratch my head and I think

768
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:25,880
why is it that this person seems somewhat immune from their very elevated lp little a

769
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:32,760
whereas this other person who's elevated but not through the roof is ravaged by it

770
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:40,600
well you're describing my next grand proposal Peter so this is absolutely exactly what we're

771
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:47,800
trying to study and I alluded earlier to the penetrance of high lpa and that's exactly what

772
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:53,800
you're what you're referring to so there might be misunderstood then well I thought you were

773
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:59,640
referring to the penetrance in terms of the expression of the protein you were referring

774
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:05,960
to the penetrance of the disease yes exactly I misunderstood that so so but you know we can say

775
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:14,440
a lot about that because we actually measured so in our lab we isolated the lpa particle from the

776
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:21,960
blood of donors and patients with aortic valve stenosis so the reason being that well we're

777
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:27,720
going to study those those particles because those patients they were matched for age sex statin

778
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:36,120
therapy smoking etc so they're like the same people demographically speaking but one of them

779
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:42,600
has a disease and the other one doesn't so and they have they all have high lpa so and they were

780
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,400
matched for lpa levels so we thought well maybe there's something happening in the particle maybe

781
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:53,800
they have more oxidized phospholipids maybe they have different proteins so we've studied that and

782
01:31:53,800 --> 01:32:03,480
we we realized that these patients might have more cell adhesion molecules that are transported

783
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:13,560
by lpa which make them more quote unquote sticky to endothelial cells or or fibrin clots or whatever

784
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:19,720
they would make them or maybe even macrophages because patients with high lpa also have

785
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:29,400
activated macrophages which can penetrate much more easier in the in the vessel wall there's

786
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:37,400
more apoptosis in the in the macrophages more cytokine production like il6, il8 etc so

787
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:45,400
there might be something that's different in the lpa particle that's just a hypothesis this was a

788
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:52,280
study of i think there were 20 patients in each in each study arm because you know it's not easy

789
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:58,200
to measure to to remove lpa from the blood and have it in a sufficient quantity that you can

790
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:04,520
actually do proteomics on it so this is it took my a phd student of mine at least one year just to

791
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,240
recruit the patients and isolate their and that's just because the the electrophoresis is complicated

792
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:13,800
or the isolation after the electro is it getting it out of the body that's complicated or isolating

793
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:20,360
it once it's ex vivo well once it's ex vivo you have to isolate it it's not difficult to isolate

794
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:28,920
it because you need to do ultra centrifugation but it has the same density of well i well it

795
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:35,640
probably has it has the same size as ldl and the same density as hdl so you have to do chromatography

796
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:42,520
columns to just basically separate it from ldl particles and also hdl particles so you need to

797
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:52,600
do a size exclusion chromatography and an affinity based chromatography so so it's it took a lot of

798
01:33:52,600 --> 01:34:00,120
time just to set up that that technique and we worked with a great colleague of mine marles

799
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:07,880
kusinski who's at the robots research institute in london ontario and she's been doing this for

800
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,680
for ages but she helped us doing that and we're actually i think one of the first to actually

801
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:20,520
isolate lpa from the blood of of patients so so that might be an explanation for this different

802
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:26,920
expression of the disease in in in people that have all high lpa but some that that are lower

803
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:33,080
than others so that's just a hypothesis there's you need to look at other risk factors maybe

804
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:40,440
um there's another gene that's out there that might be might code for a receptor

805
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:50,840
of ldl there's labs that are really devoted to finding other genes uh aside lpa uh that that

806
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:56,120
might explain this and the gwah hasn't identified any because that would be your first tool before

807
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:01,400
i'd go looking for that gene or that receptor rather i i would be trying to just find out what

808
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:07,560
the association is right absolutely and those studies have been done probably the best gwah's

809
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:15,320
on on lpa levels was published i think last year by the group uh of george tenesoulis in uh at

810
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:22,120
magill uh in montreal and uh and james engert what they showed is that well obviously the biggest

811
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:30,040
hit was at the lpa locust uh but we and we had known this for a while that apo e actually uh also

812
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:36,120
regulate uh high lpa levels so that's another reason why is there concordance is there some

813
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:45,000
concordance with high with with apo e and lpa yeah so so the the apo e that will the apo e allele

814
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,480
that will rise the risk of heart attacks will also rise lpa levels so you have that you have

815
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:59,000
the ctp gene and and then we haven't talked about the low the lpa lowering effect of ctp inhibitors

816
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:05,880
which is actually higher than what you can get with niacin therapy so some have suggested that

817
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:13,240
uh the benefits of all the quote-unquote benefits of ctp inhibition might be too to a certain extent

818
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:20,520
to high lpa levels but the problems with with niacin trials and ctp trials is that they weren't

819
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,880
done particularly in in patients with high lpa so i guess they're probably underpowered

820
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:30,280
at least when it comes to trying to understand that yeah because you would have to recruit only

821
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:35,640
patients that have high lpa which would mean to get rid of 80 of the trial population so

822
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,320
so these trials will be will be very hard to do and when you look at the other genes you have ctp

823
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:51,080
and you also have apo h which is on another chromosome and apo h codes for beta 2 glycoproteins

824
01:36:51,640 --> 01:37:00,200
and that protein might actually influence the the presence of oxidized phospholipids on apo a so

825
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:07,960
that might be interesting and i don't know uh i can't think of a study that have tried to look at

826
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:14,200
that locus with high lpa to see if it has a a modulatory effect on on outcomes but that would

827
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:20,440
be a very interesting study to do so these are these are the genes that that i can think of

828
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:31,000
interestingly the ldl receptor and also the most probably important regulator of ldl receptor

829
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:39,400
pcsk9 they did not pop up in in that gwase which is which was a little bit surprising to me

830
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:46,840
uh given the effect of of uh pcsk9 inhibitors on on lpa before we get to that i want to go back to

831
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:52,200
and really make sure we flush out this oxidized phospholipid plasminogen

832
01:37:53,480 --> 01:38:00,680
basically the atherogenicity of this particle is it clear that lp little a's enter the subendithelial

833
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:07,080
space as ldl's do or is that unclear yeah well there's not as much research has been done on

834
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:16,280
lpa but you know it's if you look at um post-mortem studies uh you can see lpa in

835
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:24,360
in atherosclerotic plaques and you can and you can certainly see it on on aortic valves

836
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:30,280
because there's more easier like aortic valves are much more easier to get than atherosclerotic

837
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:35,480
plaques as you can remove the valve and then you can study it in the under the microscope so

838
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:43,000
there's there's good evidence um that the lpa can actually penetrate there usually what they do

839
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:53,560
is they will bind to uh to clots that are in the region of of the ataroma and that's one of the

840
01:38:53,560 --> 01:39:01,800
reasons why they might also be present present there but and they can also send their oxidized

841
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,840
phospholipid through different uh through different receptors uh because we don't really

842
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:15,800
know what is the receptor for lpa in those uh in those tissue um so at the surface of

843
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:22,840
macrophages there are scavenger receptors uh toll-like receptors cd36 that might um

844
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:29,320
that might bind lpa they bind a bunch of things and but they also might bind npa which will

845
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:35,400
uh ensure that lpa get get strapped in the macrophages myloperoxidase

846
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:43,400
uh lpa sorry sorry i meant lpa but if i'm hearing you correctly then it would almost suggest that

847
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:52,440
lp little a plays less of a role in the initiation of atherosclerosis which is really initiated by

848
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:59,880
the monocyte becoming the macrophage in the sub endothelial space and engulfing the oxidized

849
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:08,360
LDL to become that foam cell that's really the initiating trigger you're saying lp little a might

850
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:12,360
not be playing a role in that or maybe it is i want to make sure i'm not misquoting you but

851
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:21,400
where it really lights things on fire is once you already have a plaque that's where the ability

852
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:28,280
to form a clot goes up potentially if you say it has more vcams on it it's attracting even more

853
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:33,160
macrophages to the site of injury so so am i capturing what you're saying correctly

854
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:41,960
absolutely uh i think it's actually both so the macrophages of patients with high lpa are already

855
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:49,800
activated and they will get uh as soon as there's and some endothelial dysfunction they'll get there

856
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:58,520
they might even cause endothelial dysfunction so lpa is is is associated it's probably a main driver

857
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:08,680
before the onset of any discernible plaque but it also has this double whammy where it's

858
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:15,400
it initiates the disease but it also is associated with the progression with the progression of the

859
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:22,440
of the disease and we see it in uh for instance i i talked to you a little bit earlier about the

860
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:34,280
pet imaging of with sodium fluoride these studies have also been done by eric strus in in amsterdam's

861
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:42,600
what they showed is that if you you don't use sodium fluoride but you use fdg so fluoro deoxy

862
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:51,800
glucose which is um basically a marker of macrophage activation and if you look at the

863
01:41:51,800 --> 01:42:01,480
carotids and also the aorta of patients that have no disease but that are separated on the basis of

864
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:07,640
whether or not they have high lpa you'll see a lot of light in patients with high lpa so that tells

865
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:13,080
you that it also it's also associated with uh with inflammation with the inflammatory plaque

866
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:21,000
in uh even in patients that don't have established a disease so that's one of the reason why it's um

867
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:27,960
it it's this kind of particle is so dangerous and the association is obviously very strong for

868
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:36,360
as cvd and aortic stenosis how high is the association specifically for cerebrovascular

869
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:42,760
disease it's clearly not as high so there's there's obviously a signal if i if i would have to

870
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:52,040
rank those uh atrosterotic cardiovascular disease the first one will be aortic valve stenosis that's

871
01:42:53,240 --> 01:43:01,960
it's obviously less present or prevalent than uh than mi or or or stroke but the

872
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:06,200
but there are fewer contributing factors beyond lp little a the way you have apo b

873
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:12,120
exactly exactly so the relative risk is actually higher that the absolute risk is lower because

874
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:17,800
there's not that many people that have that these might be two percent of the of the population

875
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:25,160
age above 60 but if you look at top quintile versus lower quintile uh the the biggest risk

876
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:32,920
is with aortic valve stenosis after that it depends on the study sometimes it's myocardial infarction

877
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:39,480
sometimes it's peripheral artery disease and we haven't talked about that but lpa is very strongly

878
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:49,000
associated with pad as well so it's aortic valve stenosis pad and mi then ischemic stroke

879
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,560
and it's important to uh make the the distinction between uh hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke because

880
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:03,320
lpa is only associated with uh with ischemic stroke um and uh yeah i think that's it it's

881
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:09,000
also associated with uh chronic kidney disease so that's it really it's only associated with

882
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:16,440
aortic stenosis mi's peripheral vascular disease ischemic cerebral strokes and kidney disease but

883
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:24,280
aside from that it really does nothing yeah there was some some literature maybe uh 15 or 20 years

884
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:32,200
ago on deep vein thrombosis and and lpa and there has been new studies published on that there's been

885
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:39,800
genome-wide association studies and we really don't see a signal for lpa being associated with

886
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:45,480
with deep vein thrombosis too so so that was part of the conversation part of the conversation for

887
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:51,720
a while but now i think it's pretty clear that it's really more closely associated with

888
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:59,000
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and less with uh trombolic events

889
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:08,280
do you think i mean we do have an assay i believe for ox uh ox ldl correct yeah is that

890
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:15,800
assay picking up the oxidized phospholipid of lp little a included in that calculation no absolutely

891
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:22,200
totally different yeah yeah well there is actually an assay to measure uh oxidized

892
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:29,400
phospholipids on apo b containing is that is that sam tamekis's assay exactly exactly so they they

893
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:37,560
have an assay that measures ox pls on apo b including lpa of course and also ox pls on uh

894
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:45,160
apo lipoprotein little a so but the correlation coefficient between these two is very high and

895
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:55,400
the correlation between lpa levels and ox pl on apo b is also very high so uh of course that can

896
01:45:55,400 --> 01:46:03,000
provide some information and there's been uh and obviously sam tamekis has measured uh ox pl on

897
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:10,760
apo b in all of the cohorts that that that he could put his his hands on and it's a good predictor of

898
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:18,280
all of the diseases that we've uh but is it is it a predictor beyond the level and the number of

899
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:24,520
lp little a particles no i don't think there's good evidence to suggest that it's it's a better

900
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:32,520
marker than or it predicts above and beyond lpa i think we should advise people to measure lpa

901
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:39,800
that that would be a gigantic step and then we can see if the if if at some point we have convincing

902
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:44,920
evidence that you know measuring oxidized phospholipid will bring in an added value but

903
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:51,640
i haven't seen much data that that that suggests that yeah and and i and i stopped measuring ox ldl

904
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:57,640
because i didn't see any benefit to it over apo b so it sounds like it's potentially the same thing

905
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:02,360
here and of course the whole you you'd hope that it would have benefit above and beyond so that it

906
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:07,960
would help you stratify risk further but uh interesting that it does not very complicated

907
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:13,640
to know what to make of this these these oxidized phospholipid tails that are sitting around their

908
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:19,320
wreaking havoc and potentially also forming part of this explanation for the for the for

909
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:25,240
the differential expression of the disease right yeah so so it's and it's the same for for ldl as

910
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:32,200
well so the ldl particles they get oxidized they also have oxidized phospholipids and that's one

911
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:39,800
of the reasons why ldl particle uh cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but uh

912
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:47,800
the measuring them in the plasma will not it will not tell you how many oxidized ldl particles you

913
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:55,160
have in your in your plaque so uh so that's why we need to stick with uh with apo b and an lpa

914
01:47:55,160 --> 01:48:02,200
because uh you'll get a you'll get a sense of all of the lipoproteins that that cause

915
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:10,680
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases so you alluded earlier to a pcsk9 protein which

916
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:18,600
we'll talk about um tell people before we get into the drug just tell people about the pcsk9 protein

917
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:27,400
how it works what its relationship is to the ldl receptor absolutely so pcsk9 uh it means

918
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:38,680
pro-protein convertase septilizin kexin type 9 it was discovered in 2003 by a collaboration between

919
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:46,760
nabil cedar who is at montreal and katrien bualo who is in france they had identified this family

920
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:56,040
in france that had familial hypercholesterolemia but they couldn't find a mutation in the ldl

921
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:04,280
receptor gene uh that explain the familial hypercholesterolemia so by the way before you

922
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:09,720
get into this i just want to say this is one of my absolute favorite stories in all of medicine

923
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:13,960
certainly in the modern era of medicine you know if you think the last 20 30 years this

924
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:22,440
story is remarkable so please yeah thanks for doing me the honor so so they had identified

925
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:28,520
this family that had fh without a mutation in the ldl receptor and the paper was published

926
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:35,240
in nature genetics in 2003 so you can think that they had been working on this for for a few years

927
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:42,440
so that was probably at the time where the human genome was being sequenced so that was uh during

928
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:49,000
the days of so that was pre genome-wide association studies and whole genome sequencing where

929
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:59,960
you were doing linkage analyses with satellite dna and yeah so i was an undergrad at that time

930
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:07,160
i was learning these these techniques and i wasn't in the lipids field so so i i heard that story

931
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:15,320
after but uh so so what they found is that uh they they were able to map the the gene in in that

932
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:23,640
family to a protein that was at the time called narc1 and so they they didn't know that that that

933
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:30,600
it was a pro-protein convertase so when they identified that uh that family in france they

934
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:39,480
partnered up with uh with nabil cedar who's um a world renowned scientist on uh pro-protein

935
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:50,520
convertases and they mapped it to narc1 which eventually became uh pcsk9 so the the way pcsk9

936
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:59,080
works is that it's a regulator of the ldl receptor so when the cells makes an ldl receptor

937
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:07,640
it will also make pcsk9 now pcsk9 can bind to the ldl receptor that can happen inside the cell

938
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:15,640
and when that happens uh the ldl receptor gets degraded in the lysosome that can also happen

939
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:22,600
extracellularly um when uh the ldl receptor obviously in the hepatocyte gets stuck at the

940
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:29,000
membrane but pcsk9 gets secreted so you can actually measure pcsk9 levels in the blood

941
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:35,480
but when it gets secreted it can actually bind the ldl receptor and when that happens the ldl

942
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:43,240
receptor cannot bind uh ldl particles and i told you earlier that uh ldl receptor density at the

943
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:52,920
surface of hepatocyte is super important for ldl clearance um so uh because pcsk9 can be uh can be

944
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:59,480
secreted and by the time that they had realized that they had shown that uh there were actually

945
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:07,480
families in in montreal that had a gain of function mutation in pcsk9 that had uh familial

946
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:17,320
hypercholesterolemia and then uh in 2006 the group of helen hobs at ut southwestern had shown that

947
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:24,360
there are common variants in pcsk9 that are associated with lower levels of of pcsk9 lower

948
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:31,320
levels of ldl and protection against uh cardiovascular diseases now the pharmaceutical

949
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:38,440
industry didn't need much more information to develop pcsk9 inhibitors right and and i remember

950
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:44,680
that paper like it was yesterday i mean it's hard to believe it's been yeah what is that now 16 16

951
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:52,920
years ago 16 years yeah absolutely yeah i i remember i was uh i was a master student at the

952
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:59,800
time and we were we were witnessing that and it was it was very a very exciting time um so let me

953
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:04,520
just make sure we go we synthesize that for people because it's such a big deal right so

954
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:11,000
familial hypercholesterolemia is a very heterogeneous disease there are at least 35 hundred mutations

955
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:18,440
that produce the exact same phenotype very very elevated cholesterol these are patients that have

956
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:24,440
total cholesterol typically north of 300 milligrams per deciliter ldl cholesterol by definition above

957
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:31,320
190 milligrams per deciliter of therapy and often much higher this disease is unequivocally linked

958
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:41,960
to accelerated as cvd and what was discovered in 2003 was yet another gene that was associated

959
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:47,000
with it but what made it different is most of the genes not all but most of the genes associated

960
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:53,720
with fh directly involved the ldl receptor this one didn't seem to instead they discovered that

961
01:53:53,720 --> 01:54:00,440
it was this protein that wreaks havoc on the ldl receptor when it's over expressed either by

962
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:05,960
degrading the ldl receptor in the lysosome before it gets brought to the surface or frankly just

963
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:14,360
interfering with the receptor when it's at the surface does pcsk9 also degrade um ldl receptors

964
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:20,280
or increase their turnover when they are at the surface of hepatocytes yeah exactly that's that's

965
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:25,720
exactly what i was going to say that's the third mechanism through which uh pcsk9 can influence

966
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:32,920
ldl receptor density because what people don't really appreciate is that the ldl receptor when

967
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:39,800
it does its job of bringing ldl particles within the hepatocytes gets recycled at the surface of

968
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:45,560
the hepatocyte and that can happen a hundred times in the in the life of the ldl receptor because it

969
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:53,640
takes a lot of energy to the cell to make the ldl to produce the ldl receptor and once and a pcsk9

970
01:54:53,640 --> 01:55:01,800
is bound to an ldl receptor then it prevents its recycling so so the cell has to make more

971
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:08,840
ldl receptor and when it does that because they're under genetic control of the srebp2

972
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:17,960
um transcription factor so then the ldl receptor gets produced and so is pcsk9 so so you can have

973
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:25,080
this uh this vicious cycle so um and it's interesting to think that if if the story had

974
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:31,000
stopped there it's not clear we'd be where we are today without the 2006 paper which showed

975
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:39,080
wow as bad as that gain of function is the loss of function is really amazing where now you found

976
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:46,200
these people who had the opposite of fh these are people who were basically missing their pcsk9 not

977
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:53,320
completely just significantly under expressed and these were people that as adults walked around

978
01:55:53,320 --> 01:56:02,040
with neonate levels of ldl cholesterol 10 20 30 milligrams per deciliter yeah so so the the most

979
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:09,000
frequent um uh variant that they look at was present in two percent of the population and

980
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:15,880
they saw a very mild ldl reduction so they i don't remember this is 2006 so i'm gonna say

981
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:21,240
20 reduction in in ldl but you know it's a lifelong reduction right that's right the mr

982
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:28,200
would still suggest that that's beneficial exactly but there has been some that there has

983
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:35,080
been some studies on as you say patients or individuals that have virtually no ldl because

984
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:42,280
they have no pcsk9 really and they don't have of course atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

985
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:49,400
because you need ldl for that but they have uh they're perfectly fit uh you know that doesn't

986
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:56,680
influence reproduction or hormones or or anything uh they have uh they don't have like

987
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:01,800
dementia no exactly no increase in the risk of other diseases so they have normal risk for cancer

988
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:07,160
alzheimer's disease every other disease and they just don't have the risk of ascvd and their ldl

989
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:12,680
cholesterol is 10 20 milligrams per deciliter very important teaching point here i think for

990
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:20,040
for the listener which is it might be tempting to say how can someone with such little cholesterol

991
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:27,240
in their plasma not have other problems when we understand the importance of cholesterol in

992
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:35,080
creating lipid bilayers of cells and being a precursor to steroidal hormones and i addressed

993
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:39,800
this in a previous podcast but i think it's worth stating this again when you look at how much

994
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:46,600
cholesterol is in the body and isolate that fraction which is in the plasma even if you take

995
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:55,720
that to zero you've maybe reduced the total body pool of cholesterol by about 10 percent so yeah

996
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:02,520
and and there's still some cholesterol in the blood right because uh deliver will secrete very

997
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:08,680
low density lipoproteins that will not necessarily be targeted by by pcsk9 and there's high density

998
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:16,120
protein as well so you still have a total cholesterol that might fall from 180 milligrams

999
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:22,520
per deciliter it might fall to 70 milligrams per deciliter or 60 milligrams per deciliter but it's

1000
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:29,160
not zero you're right but you know the the point is you still have so much cholesterol in extra

1001
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:35,800
like an extra apo b tissue right the this the red blood cells all of the tissue the hepatocytes

1002
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:43,400
etc so yeah and we're seeing that also in the the trials because uh well obviously the industry

1003
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:49,640
develop antibodies monoclonal antibodies against pcsk9 and these have been tested in two large

1004
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:56,680
cardiovascular outcomes trials and they've shown that if you reduce LDL through these pcsk9 inhibitors

1005
01:58:56,680 --> 01:59:02,920
you get a reduction in in cardiovascular events and and now in these trials now these were all

1006
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:10,120
patients that were already treated with statins and you add on to that a pcsk9 inhibitor and you

1007
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:19,160
really bring LDL cholesterol levels to the floor and in postdoc analyses of these trials you can

1008
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:28,600
see that the benefit was also correlated with the reduction in LDL levels so patients that have

1009
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:35,960
the lowest LDL levels had the lowest risk of having a second event is i say second event

1010
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:43,000
because these were these trials were done in patients with stable cad and also acute coronary

1011
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,400
syndrome so it really tells us that there's there doesn't seem we haven't identified yet the the

1012
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:57,720
level of LDL that's that's so low that it's going to harm any physiological or disease process

1013
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:02,280
yeah it's such it's such an important point um and and again i think you know you're referring

1014
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:09,880
to foyer and odyssey i gotta tell you this is one of those beautiful moments again where it

1015
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:15,560
i i was a little worried that foyer and odyssey were not going to be positive trials especially

1016
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:24,040
foyer um because you'll recall foyer the patients had an average starting LDL cholesterol in the

1017
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:31,240
70s i can't remember if it was 71 or 77 i think the mean was 90 and they brought it back down to 30

1018
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:35,320
milligrams what was the mean 90 i thought the mean at the beginning was in the 70s but i could be

1019
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:41,000
wrong there there was not an entry level of LDL sometimes you see that in these kinds of trials

1020
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,800
you have to bring the LDL down to a certain level uh but that was not the case so it was they were

1021
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:52,040
just being treated with uh standard of care which is obviously yeah so these were on very high doses

1022
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:58,760
of statins so if you're right and they were if they came in on a statin maximally and their LDL

1023
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:05,480
was 90 that's still very low that still puts them at the 10th percentile i thought it was 70 so that

1024
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:10,520
would have been at the fifth percentile but the point is when patients come in and they already

1025
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:18,120
have such a low LDL you add a drug that lowers them to the 30s but the trial was only five years

1026
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:25,960
and my thought was there's no way in five years you that's not long enough to see a benefit

1027
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:32,200
when the patients are starting out so low and that turned out to be wrong so the trial was

1028
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:38,360
supposed to last five years it was 4.2 but they saw a benefit at 2.2 years oh wait that's right

1029
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:46,280
it was 2.2 and four years exactly and odyssey was 2.4 years or something exactly exactly so me too uh

1030
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:51,480
so basically they stopped the trial when they knew they had an effect but when the trial was

1031
02:01:51,480 --> 02:02:00,360
published uh that was in 2017 no august of 15 i think okay well that long okay well there had been

1032
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:07,640
postdoc analyses uh from from phase three trials that were uh that were very positive in the new

1033
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:13,320
england journal i i don't know if you're referring to these papers but uh anyway so for your trial

1034
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:20,840
uh sorry yes yes i'm referring to the fda approval which was on the earliest analysis which was

1035
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:26,920
august of 15 obviously subsequent analyses came after but but i believe at that point you had the

1036
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:34,360
2.2 and the 2.4 year data because basically rapatha and praluent were approved within a month of each

1037
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:39,080
other if my memory serves me correctly yeah based on their LDL lowering and not necessarily on their

1038
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:46,200
effect of cardiovascular disease so i was actually very surprised because in that trial the

1039
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:53,240
relative risk reduction if you compare pc sk9 with placebo was only 15 so people were kind of

1040
02:02:53,240 --> 02:03:01,640
expecting like a 20 plus percent reduction and uh many people were kind of disappointed by by that

1041
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:08,200
but i mean it happened over 2.2 years only so that's what's underappreciated i remember

1042
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:15,160
i can't remember if i wrote a blog post about this and if i didn't i'm sure i wrote it in an email

1043
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:20,520
to a friend and i hope i could find that email but it was a friend of mine who worked at a hedge fund

1044
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:25,320
yeah so it must have been an email i don't think i wrote a blog post he said because you remember

1045
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:31,560
amgen's price share price declined with those results yeah and it was i think it was because

1046
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:38,840
they didn't hit the relative risk reduction it was so modest and and i said to him i said that's a

1047
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:45,400
miss that's that tells me wall street doesn't understand atherosclerosis if you can hit a 15

1048
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:54,600
percent relative risk reduction which ultimately turned into a bigger risk reduction in 2.2 years

1049
02:03:54,600 --> 02:04:01,400
on a group of patients who show up on the maximum dose of astatin whose LDL is already at the 10th

1050
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:06,440
percentile you've you've changed the you've changed the field of cardiovascular medicine

1051
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:13,480
yeah i i completely agree and i was saying i remember thinking this that you know if they

1052
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:19,880
really wanted to make a trial to increase their stock price they they would have made make it

1053
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:24,840
the full four years right because then you would have seen the biggest increase because if you look

1054
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:29,880
at the cap and myer curves they're still going in opposite direction they haven't stabilized

1055
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:38,200
so and i talked earlier about the cholesterol treatment trial is curve the the data from the

1056
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:44,600
four year in odyssey trial they fall exactly on the same curve where you're looking at achieved

1057
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:50,040
apob levels and reduction in event it's right there at the at the lower end of the curves of

1058
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:54,840
the curve of course because that's that's the in that's a trial in which they they saw the the

1059
02:04:54,920 --> 02:05:01,160
biggest reduction in in ldl apob so let's go back and close the loop on one thing before we now talk

1060
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:07,240
about pcs canine and lp little a so you've explained now why a pcs canine inhibitor the drugs we're

1061
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:12,760
talking about are so effective in lowering apob because they're basically mimicking the most

1062
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:20,600
extreme loss of function of this gene you're taking away that protein that does those three

1063
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:33,720
things to reduce lp ldl clearance why is it remind us that statins don't lower lp little a

1064
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:39,720
you would think well we know why statins get the ldl receptor to be more dense that should do it so

1065
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:47,560
the the the obvious explanation here is ldl receptors don't clear lp little a but why is

1066
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:53,160
that isn't an lp little a just an ldl with a little extra thing on it why is that causing

1067
02:05:53,160 --> 02:06:01,400
so much difficulty for the statin i told you earlier that lpa levels were determined by their

1068
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:12,360
rate of production and one of the players that was an unanticipated player in in april a lpa

1069
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:19,640
slash a poa production is actually pcs canine because if you uh incubate cells liver cells with

1070
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:27,960
with with pcs canine you'll see the expression of a poa going up and in lipoprotein turnover studies

1071
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:38,360
you also see that so if you treat people with a pcs canine inhibitor you will actually see a

1072
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:46,440
reduction in the production rate of of a poa and there was a nice study that's a bit complex to

1073
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:54,840
to fully appreciate by gerald watts who's in pert australia he's shown this but he also showed in

1074
02:06:54,840 --> 02:07:02,840
a second group that if you treat patients with a pcs canine inhibitor and the statin you see the

1075
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:11,800
and that's probably what where the ldl receptor presence gets maximized at the surface of the

1076
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:17,960
liver cells you can actually see clearance or increment in the fractional catabolic rate

1077
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:28,600
of of lpa so there's still so much that we don't know in this in this area so and it's not totally

1078
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:36,200
clear why we see this difference of pcs canine inhibitors that's depending on whether or not

1079
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:42,920
you're treated with a with a statin and i think all comers we see that a pcs canine inhibitor is

1080
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:51,000
lowering lp little a by is about 30 is the on average yeah and so the average is is probably

1081
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:59,000
between 25 and 30 percent in all comers yeah but the variability is enormous i mean i exactly the

1082
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:07,320
very the variability is is very important and it's another example where we need to study patients

1083
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:13,160
that have high lpa because these are the patients that we want to provide an answer to and there's

1084
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:20,920
only been one trial that had tested the effect of a pcs canine inhibitor on in patients with lpa

1085
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:29,160
there there had been sub-analyses in foria and odyssey outcomes and when you look at that trial

1086
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:36,360
it's called the anichco trials and all these postdoc analyses of of randomized control trials

1087
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:43,720
of pcs canine inhibitors you see that in patients with high lpa the reduction is approximately 15

1088
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:53,000
so it's not spectacular and in in the anichco trial what they did is that they've looked at

1089
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:59,400
arterial wall inflammation using fluoro deoxy glucose this is a trial run by

1090
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:08,120
zai fayed at mount sinai in new york and eric streuze in amsterdam they showed that even though

1091
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:17,000
you you reduce ldl by i don't know what percentage but it was a spectacular reduction in ldl a very

1092
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:26,280
small reduction in lpa of 15 you don't see any effect on arterial wall inflammation so that means

1093
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:31,320
that you know there's an important residual risk that's associated with lpa because

1094
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:39,240
if you lower ldl with pcs canine inhibitors you know there's no outcomes data although they did

1095
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:47,480
link lpa with recurrent cardiovascular disease in this in these trials you see that the pro

1096
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:56,040
inflammatory effect of lpa on the vasculature still remains so we're gonna have to go after lpa even

1097
02:09:56,040 --> 02:10:02,520
in patients that have very low very low levels of ldl there's no doubt about it and so is one

1098
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:10,680
interpretation of the fact that pcs canine inhibitors can lower lpa by 30 but that might

1099
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:16,520
not be sufficient to ameliorate the lpa risk specifically is that it's just simply not enough

1100
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:23,400
it gets back to what you said earlier yeah it you're going to have to eliminate lpa and it

1101
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:30,200
becomes a bit more of a step function than the gradient we see with apo b yeah i don't know if

1102
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:35,560
we need to eliminate lp little a but we need to take we need to get it probably below and bring

1103
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:40,840
it down yeah yeah yeah to a lower level so that brings us what they're testing yeah so that that

1104
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:47,480
brings us to where we are today right so what's the state of the art today in 2022 with my patients

1105
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:55,240
who have elevated lp little a i take a two two prong effect uh when it comes to lipid management

1106
02:10:55,240 --> 02:11:00,760
obviously there's many things we're doing outside of lipid management the first is absolutely

1107
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:07,320
eradicating apo b so we're very aggressive on this because it's very clear that you can do this

1108
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:13,320
safely and effectively we target an apo b of about 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter so we target an

1109
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:20,440
apo b at what we would call a physiologic level so the level that a child would have it's clear

1110
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:25,960
that a child can have an apo b of 30 and have no problems with development which is the most

1111
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:30,360
cholesterol demanding period of their life so there's absolutely no reason that we shouldn't

1112
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:34,920
be able to take an adult there um without side effects meaning provided we can do it without

1113
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:39,320
side effects from the medications but the second thing we do is we're very liberal in the use of

1114
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:45,560
pcsk9 inhibitors because even though we don't know the answer yet our belief is even if it wax

1115
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:52,520
it 30 which is about what we see we see on average about a 30 reduction lp little a it's worth it

1116
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:59,480
until we get to antisense oligonucleotides so let's talk about antisense oligonucleotides what are

1117
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:06,760
they yeah now before we get into that uh i'll tell you that i do the same thing i mean uh i'm

1118
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:13,720
going to turn uh 4d this year so i decide i decided to have to have a lipid check and

1119
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:20,520
have my lpa remeasured and it's very high it's at 200 nanomolars i knew that because i had my

1120
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:27,880
genotype done with uh direct to consumer uh company and and they let you look at your own data so

1121
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:33,640
they they send you all of your SNP information so i went and looked at my favorite SNP in lpa and i

1122
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:42,280
was a carrier of one of the most famous mutations in lpa so and that's exactly what i decided to do

1123
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:49,160
so my LDL was a bit higher than than average my lpa was high so i just started to uh to take a

1124
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:55,880
statin and of course i've been on close to vegetarian diet for more than three years i

1125
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:01,880
i'm physically active but you know at some points you have to look at at your at your labs and say

1126
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:09,080
well there's i need to do more so so even i started taking a statin even though i'm not 40 yet

1127
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:17,640
because i i i see those studies and i see the importance of going after LDL very early and

1128
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:23,800
very aggressively now i'm not on a super high dose i need to have it to check it after three months

1129
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:30,360
but um but if it doesn't go down i'll increase the dose so so and that's i think what uh people who

1130
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:39,960
have high lpa should do so coming down to the uh oligo the antisense oligonucleotides against

1131
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:47,960
lpa this is a very exciting time for uh for lpa research so the probably the the first horse in

1132
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:58,280
the race will be uh the the compound by ionus pharmaceuticals so it is an antisense oligonucleotides

1133
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:06,600
against the lpa gene well all of them all of them will be and the second one is uh the and they

1134
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:13,240
just released some data on this in the in nature medicine a couple of months ago uh and it's called

1135
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:21,960
all passurin it's uh it's not an oligonucleotide it's an si RNA against lpa it's the compound by

1136
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:29,160
amgen and i believe they'll they'll need to do a phase three trial but with the first one with the

1137
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:34,120
ionus compound there ionus is the company that used to be called isis like before exactly before it

1138
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:38,200
became horrible to have the name isis it was it's a san diego based company i remember i used to swim

1139
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:43,240
with a guy who worked there and he had a his his duffel bag which was from works at isis on it and

1140
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:48,600
i was like yeah you're probably going to want to change that yeah you can't board a plane with that

1141
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:57,880
so um so yeah so they they have they they already uh have phase two data that's been published in

1142
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:04,840
2020 uh in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease a very nice dose ascending

1143
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:11,480
study and they've shown that in the dose that they're going to use in their trial which is a

1144
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:20,920
monthly uh injection you can get mean reduction of lpa levels of 80 even in patients with high lpa

1145
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:28,600
so that's very encouraging because this is what we're going to need to uh to to prevent uh heart

1146
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:35,800
attacks and and and obviously to have successful cardiovascular outcomes trial and in that study

1147
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:44,760
they also showed that uh 90 of patients who were treated on that dose had lpa levels below 50

1148
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:54,360
milligrams per deciliter so it's very potent it's a second generation um antisense oligonucleotide

1149
02:15:54,360 --> 02:16:02,280
and they have launched a trial a cardiovascular outcomes trial that's called horizon and they're

1150
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:12,520
recruiting a little under 8 000 patients with stable cardiovascular diseases and they will

1151
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:22,280
study the effect of lpa in of their antisense oligonucleotides in the prevention of major

1152
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:29,320
atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and is this a secondary prevention trial it is a secondary

1153
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:34,760
prevention trial so this is where you have to start uh you have to take the patients that have

1154
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:41,880
the highest risk to have uh to have a positive trials there's uh to my knowledge there's no uh

1155
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:48,440
plan for a trial in primary prevention but that will that will be the off way eventually have to

1156
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:53,400
come yeah so yeah do you do you have a sense of how far they are in their enrollment because

1157
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:58,920
this trial and maybe it's just because of how emotionally invested i am in this i don't i have

1158
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:02,200
a normal lp little a but it's just i think i take care of enough patients that don't

1159
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:10,280
this trial feels to me like the molasses rolling uphill in january trial and as a as a kibbe kwa

1160
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:17,880
you can appreciate the speed with which molasses will roll uphill in january what is taking so long

1161
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:23,960
this is a trial that feels like it's a year away from being completed every year for the past seven

1162
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:34,040
years yeah well uh first of all uh being an investigator in a research center at times of

1163
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:43,720
covid was very very difficult to bring people into the hospital for an exploratory trial so

1164
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:51,960
so so that has had i i don't know for that specific trial but i can tell you for any lab

1165
02:17:51,960 --> 02:18:01,480
or any clinical research facility the any patient that were recruited and especially in our hospital

1166
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:07,800
we're the the covid hospital for the entire region so i mean people don't want to come here

1167
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:14,600
during during a pandemic so so i i'm thinking that this is probably part of the of the explanation

1168
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:21,960
so we'll have the result of that trial probably in 2025 because um i told you earlier that trial

1169
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:29,160
is going to be 8 000 patients when i saw that i thought well this is not enough i mean they

1170
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:35,720
they need to do a big trial and this is it's it's it's kind of risky to do a trial in only 8 000

1171
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:43,160
patients but the way i understand it it's that is that they're going to use the full four years of

1172
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:49,000
their uh of their treatment period so even though you have less patients and for instance

1173
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:56,680
foyer or odyssey outcomes that have 16 15 000 yeah exactly so they're recruiting half for the

1174
02:18:56,680 --> 02:19:02,920
roughly the same population so but they're they're gonna they're gonna study it for a longer period

1175
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:09,880
so that might also explain why it's not going to be published uh anytime soon and we need we need

1176
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:14,760
to be patients and i'm really looking forward to seeing the the results of that trial because they

1177
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:21,480
hold the the fate of the entire field in their in their hands so really looking forward and also

1178
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:26,680
especially for the for the for the patients really looking forward to seeing the results of that

1179
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:32,120
trial and i hope that there will be other companies i know there are there's three companies

1180
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:39,960
that have antisense oligonucleotides against lpa so you have ionis which is partnering with

1181
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:48,760
novartis for the for the the the trial amgen has one and there's also another sirny company called

1182
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:56,520
silence therapeutics that have that have an lpa inhibitor i don't think they have released

1183
02:19:56,520 --> 02:20:03,640
their phase one study yet but i think we'll see more and more of of these companies because

1184
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:10,600
there's still there's still money to make i think in that in that area of of residual cardiovascular

1185
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:19,640
risk because we can target ldl as as low as we want and there's still a an underappreciated

1186
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:27,000
amount of residual risk that's associated with with with different things with triglycerides

1187
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:32,840
inflammation but the first thing that comes to mind to me is is the risk associated with high lpa

1188
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:39,400
it's an amazing decade we're in if in fact this study is published in in 2015 uh pardon me in

1189
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:45,320
2025 you'll have exactly a decade between the approval of pcsk9 inhibitors and potentially

1190
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:51,400
the approval of this antisense oligonucleotide for lp little a and you could argue that those

1191
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:56,520
two things will have an outsized effect on on human health so benoit i want to thank you very

1192
02:20:56,520 --> 02:21:01,400
much for spending all this time with me today and by extension with all of our listeners this is

1193
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:06,360
such an important topic that i think of this almost as a a public service announcement uh if

1194
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:11,880
you're listening to this podcast there's a at least a 10 and maybe a 20 chance that your lp

1195
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:18,920
little a is elevated you really need to demand that your physician checks this level we think

1196
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:24,840
that the milligram per deciliter mass uh measurement is probably sufficient and if you're

1197
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:30,040
elevated on that level at least at this moment in time the best thing that we can do is keep apo

1198
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:34,600
b as low as possible and manage all of the other manageable risk factors hypertension smoking

1199
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:39,960
insulin resistance etc that that traffic with atherosclerotic uh cardiovascular disease the

1200
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:43,240
other thing i think we can at least i would be comfortable recommending i know you're not a

1201
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:47,880
physician so you probably wouldn't be comfortable making a recommendation i would also insist that

1202
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:55,880
you at least once have an echocardiogram to look for even the earliest signs of aortic stenosis

1203
02:21:56,920 --> 02:22:01,320
as it is imminently more treatable and the outcomes are better if it is addressed earlier

1204
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:07,640
well thank you peter for having me and thank you for raising awareness on on on health da was a real
