Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
at the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,400
today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. Paul Offit. Paul's a pediatrician specializing in

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,400
infectious diseases, and he's an expert on vaccines, immunology, and virology. He's the

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,120
director of the Vaccine Education Center and a professor of pediatrics in the division of

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,120
infectious diseases at CHOP, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's also a professor

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,160
of vaccinology at the Pearlman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. And he's on

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,400
the FDA committee for biologics evaluation and research vaccines and related biological

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,920
products advisory committee. In other words, he's on the FDA committee that is overseeing the

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,360
basically unprecedented scale with which vaccines are being put into a pipeline to be evaluated for

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,160
COVID. He's also the co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine as if all of the above were not enough.

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,040
I've wanted to talk with Paul for a couple of months, but I wanted to wait until the time was

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,320
right. And I kind of defined that as a moment when we had enough certainty in terms of what was going

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,240
on with COVID vaccines, that we could speak about it in less abstractions and more straightforward

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,520
terms with respect to likely releases and approvals of various vaccines. And so I'm really glad that

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,200
actually we waited until this time, because I do think we're at that point where we have a pretty

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:16,280
clear line of sight into the pipeline of a number of companies and also a number of strategies that

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,080
are being employed. And that's basically what we go into. I mean, we certainly talk about Paul's

25
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,560
background, which is fascinating and why he's sort of the perfect guy to have this discussion. But the

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,640
meat of this discussion really focuses on delineating the four strategies with which one

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,600
can pursue a vaccination against the virus that causes COVID. And then we talk about basically who

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,680
the major companies are in each of those categories, where they are in their life cycle, what that

29
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,320
actually means and what it implies as far as vaccination approval. We talk a lot about what the

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,440
potential risks are in each of the categories and more broadly. And ultimately we talk about what

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,320
2021 could look like and what the unknowns are. So I learned a lot in this episode actually more

32
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,840
than I expected. I was just completely riveted by Paul's insights. And I think we all have a little

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,360
bit of COVID fatigue at this point that's understandable. But I think anybody who's got

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,040
questions about will a vaccine change my life? What should I expect next year? I think and I

35
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,400
hope at least most of your questions are going to be answered here. And I don't suspect this is the

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,840
last time that Paul and I will speak. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with

37
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,680
Paul Offit.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,000
Paul, thank you so much for making time to sit down with me today. I know that you are someone

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,360
who a lot of people want to talk with, especially now that people are really starting to come to

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,960
grips with the fact that a vaccine for the coronavirus is going to be a very important part of the

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,800
story. I guess before we get that, though, I think it's important for people to understand why your

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,760
thoughts on the subject are important. In other words, you're not just someone like me who's been

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,320
thinking about the coronavirus for less than a year. You're someone who has spent essentially a

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,240
lifetime thinking about this type of a problem. There's a story about how you were a very young

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,200
boy, you were hospitalized. And that experience at such a young age kind of shaped the way you

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,440
thought about going into medicine and ultimately even being a pediatrician. Can you share a bit of

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,760
that?

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,320
Sure. So I was born with club feet, which means that my feet turned sort of inward and down.

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,360
Typically, that's treated with casting. So I was casted when the first few hours of life really. And

50
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,960
then so for months I was casted, but it seemed to work. I mean, my feet seemed so straighten out. But

51
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,960
at the age of five, my father decided that he didn't like the way that my heel didn't, oh, my right

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,000
foot didn't hit the ground as well as he would have liked. So he was able to find a surgeon to do a

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,680
surgery, frankly, that was perfected about 40 years later. We should have never done that surgery.

54
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,080
There was no club foot surgery. If he was able to find a guy who was a son of a friend of his who

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,520
just finished his residency in orthopedics and thought, great, I get to do the surgery, which went

56
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,760
badly. My father was a shirt manufacturer. Penison wasn't really his strength, but he didn't like the

57
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,040
way the heel hit. Interesting as a side part of the story is that my great uncle, my grandfather's

58
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,640
brother was a bookie. He was really Baltimore's bookie. He didn't print books. He made book. My

59
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,280
mother initially had trouble getting me into the club foot clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital, but

60
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,840
she just called my great uncle who called the guy who was head of the foot clinic, who was a gambler

61
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,560
apparently. So we got in within a week. And when the guy, this physician, saw me, he said, if you

62
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,920
do nothing, don't operate on this foot. Nonetheless, my father insisted to put the straighter. And so I

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,880
had an operation that was a complete failure. And as a consequence, I ended up in a chronic care

64
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,120
facility called Kernan Children's Hospital. Although I think then it may have been called

65
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,440
Kernan's Hospital for Crippled Children, when you could use words like crippled and feeble-minded.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,360
I was there for about six weeks. And this was the 1950s. The polio was king. And I remember just a

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,640
lot of children in that ward with polio. I probably had 20 kids in the ward, some in our lungs,

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,840
some in traction. And there was one visiting hour a week. That was it. Sundays from two to three,

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,400
my mother had a complication with pregnancy with my brother. So she never came. My father had tried

70
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,760
to sneak in once to see me. Thus was prohibited from seeing me again. So he traveled a lot,

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,520
so he couldn't do the hours that they had wanted him to do. So I just remember sort of seeing those

72
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,840
children as vulnerable and helpless and, in fact, seeing myself the same way. And I remember

73
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,800
looking. My bed was next to a window. This was when you had one visiting hour a week, polio day.

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,440
So people were scared to death of having anybody else come into that hospital. Sundays from two to

75
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,920
three. It wasn't like they had therapy dogs or iPads or televisions or anything. You just pretty

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,160
much laid there. And in my case, looked out the window that was right next to my bed, which looked

77
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,560
out into the front door. And I kept waiting for my parents to come rescue me to walk through that

78
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,680
front door. The hospital never happened. When I was a medical student at the University of Maryland,

79
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,920
we rotated through Kernance Children's Hospital, and that room was still there. It wasn't a polio

80
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,880
ward anymore. It was a group of secretaries, but that window was still there. That facility is

81
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,960
still there, isn't it? Yeah, Kernance Children's Hospital is still there. I did my residency at

82
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Johns Hopkins, and I remember we would sometimes get transfers. I was in surgery, so kids that

83
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,120
would get infections that would need to be transferred to Hopkins for surgical care.

84
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,440
That's funny. I didn't think I'd hear that name again.

85
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,360
So I remember as a student then, walk-outs at Murrell Medical School, but I remember walking up to

86
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,280
that window and looking out of it and seeing that front door. And I cried. So I think that's it. I

87
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,920
think that we are motivated by the scars of our youth. For me, a choice to go into pediatrics,

88
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,240
a choice to go into pediatric infectious diseases, a choice to write a book about polio, specifically

89
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,920
about a sort of a tragic event associated with the making of the polio vaccine, a choice to make

90
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,720
vaccines, I think, enter the world of science and stuff. Probably all is motivated by this,

91
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,640
because pretty much every book I've written, at its heart, child advocacy, at its heart,

92
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,000
sort of standing up for children who are vulnerable, who can't stand up for themselves.

93
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,800
We're going to talk about vaccines today, and I don't think a discussion of vaccines would be

94
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,560
complete without saying something about just the unbelievable disservice that has been done to so

95
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,880
many people, so many vulnerable people, specifically parents who are looking for answers

96
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,800
when maybe there are no answers, by sort of the fraud that was catapulted upon them in the late

97
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,480
90s and in the form of that Lancet article that has been so thoroughly debunked as not just

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,560
incorrect, but outright fraud. Of course, I'm referring to that Wakefield paper of 12 completely

99
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:46,520
fabricated case studies that really on some level is kind of a big part of the anti-vaccine

100
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,960
rhetoric and the vaccines cause gastrointestinal disease, which causes autism story that started

101
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,680
at that time. And frankly, on some levels, there's a solid number of people who continue to believe

102
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,520
this, despite the efforts of people like Brian Deere, yourself, Peter Hotez, people who have

103
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,600
so thoroughly debunked that type of nonsense. How do you process that? Do you process it?

104
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
There are some people who are very angry about the anti-vaccine movement. There are others who,

105
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,840
I think, speak to it more from a place of empathy. How do you manage your own emotions around that,

106
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,240
especially when you see the children themselves are often the victims of parents who are themselves

107
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,080
the victims, et cetera. Yeah, I guess I thought come out on the angry side. I think Andrew Wakefield

108
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,960
was a fraud. I think at some level he was a knowing fraud. I mean, he misrepresented clinical

109
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,360
data. He misrepresented biological data. That paper should have never been published. It was

110
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,760
basically a story of 12 children, eight of whom had autism, presumably within a month of receiving

111
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,000
MMR vaccine, when in fact, at least a couple of the children had developed signs and symptoms

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,640
of autism before ever having received that vaccine, which he knew. He also, he had biopsies

113
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,040
on all those children and presumably measles vaccine virus was supposed to be destroying

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,360
intestinal epithelial cells. He had biopsies on those children. He never did studies looking at,

115
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,120
or at least never reported studies, looking at whether there was measles virus genome or

116
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,160
measles virus vaccine proteins in those cells, which is to say he probably did do those studies

117
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,840
and they didn't come out the way that he wanted them to. Actually, we'll go one step further. I

118
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,880
think Brian Deere has actually done a very good job on covering those biopsies were done and

119
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:33,160
processed and the amount of virus that was found in them was identical to that, which was found in

120
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,520
basically the formal in itself, demonstrating that it was a pure contaminant. So actually,

121
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,320
there was no measles virus whatsoever in any of the colons of, or distal ileums of any of those

122
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,280
children. And I talked to a person who did some of the serology with Andrew Wakefield for a meeting

123
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,600
I had in England. And he refused to be on the paper because he felt that Andrew Wakefield had

124
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,280
basically misrepresented sort of IgM, IgG response immunoglobulin responses to measles. That was

125
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,040
Andrew Wakefield. Brian Deere just wrote a book called The Doctor Who Fooled the World, which

126
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,840
goes through all this. I'll be interviewing Brian, because I think it's such an important discussion.

127
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,080
Clearly, there's no shortage of anger towards Wakefield because I agree with you. And by the way,

128
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,280
fraud and knowingly is a bit of a tautology. By definition, if it's fraud, in my opinion,

129
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,600
he was knowingly acting in bad behavior. And where are we today? Maybe just talk about it through

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,720
the geography that you understand best, which I assume is the United States.

131
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,040
Where are we at MMR vaccination levels? Are we above 95%?

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We were. I mean, I think what happened with the COVID-19 pandemic is that we had a dramatic drop

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,560
in the instance of vaccines in general, including MMR vaccine. But I would say this, I think that

134
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,520
this is going to probably surprise you. I think in some way, Andrew Wakefield was good for science.

135
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,320
Here's why. When he put that out there, he became a darling of the anti-vaccine movement. He was

136
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,640
attractive. He was well spoken. He had a British accent, which we all love. I think we're ready to

137
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,400
give ourselves back to the queen at this point. And he made the rounds in the United States. He

138
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,480
was on everything, morning, evening shows. He was on 60 Minutes with Ed Bradley. He was a darling of

139
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,280
the anti-vaccine movement. He was a physician, a scientist who now said all the right things. And

140
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,560
I think the anti-vaccine folks attached themselves to his star. When it was found out that he was not

141
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,360
only wrong, but fraudulent and wrong, that he not only had misrepresented clinical and biological

142
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,720
data, but in fact had basically laundered money, laundered legal claims through a medical journal.

143
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,040
His star fell. And I think the mainstream media rejected him. His last, I think, appearance on

144
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,400
mainstream media was on Anderson Cooper. Where Cooper just destroyed him. Yeah. Yeah. Great. So

145
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,520
at some level, he helped us marginalize to some extent, the voices that were the anti-vaccine

146
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,240
voices. Barbara L. Fisher, Jeff Schwartz, J.B. Hanley, et cetera, had a much bigger voice,

147
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,720
I think 20 years ago, 15 years ago than they do now, because I think mainstream media anyway,

148
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,680
has chosen to set them aside. Obviously their platform of social media. But

149
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,040
so I think Wakefield in some ways helped us. I mean, we did the studies to answer the question,

150
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,880
whether you were more likely to develop autism if you've got the MMR vaccine or not. That's been

151
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,360
done 18 times in seven different countries on three different continents. The question has been

152
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,320
asked and answered. I do think according to a study done by the Autism Science Foundation, about 85%

153
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,800
of parents who have children with autism no longer believe that vaccines were the cause. So I do think

154
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,120
that that good science did win out to some extent. And I think Andrew Wakefield has lost that. He's

155
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,880
now, it goes on Alex Jones show, where all good conspiracy theorists go. Yeah, it's interesting.

156
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,480
There aren't many things in medicine we can say with a higher degree of certainty actually,

157
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,200
than the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. If you really stop to think about it, Paul,

158
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,480
do statins cause Alzheimer's disease? I think the data is overwhelmingly convincing that it does not.

159
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,480
But I think the data are more convincing than MMR does not cause autism, based on the extent to

160
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,120
which it's been studied. And maybe to some extent, the negative attention that Wakefield has brought

161
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:13,880
to this has actually forced so much scrutiny of those data, not just the 18 studies you refer to,

162
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:21,240
but also going back and really exposing the biological plausibility of the argument itself.

163
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,960
And frankly, exposing another issue that I think is very easy to understand. So I say this with a

164
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:37,400
lot of empathy, but is nevertheless an issue, which is any of us are capable of misremembering facts.

165
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:45,640
And so much of what I think gave Wakefield and his associate bar, the lawyer with whom you

166
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,080
referred to earlier, that he was basically in cahoots siphoning funds through his research

167
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:58,360
organization, the ability to carry on for so long was effectively parents misremembering things.

168
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,880
I actually believe most of those parents were not nefarious. I think there are some that who clearly

169
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:11,080
were. I think there were some who consciously chose to sort of pursue legal action to get money,

170
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,480
knowing that what they were saying was false. But I don't think that that's the majority of them.

171
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,960
Because remember, all of those parents in that case said, little Susie got the vaccine on Tuesday,

172
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,840
had a nosebleed on Wednesday, had a fever on Thursday and started banging their head against

173
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,040
the wall. And the rest is history. I actually think they believed that. Although the medical

174
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,200
records showed no, actually, little Susie stopped talking six months before they ever got the vaccine.

175
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,600
And here are the medical records to demonstrate it. I mean, it was unambiguous what had happened,

176
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,760
but I just think that people, ourselves included, sometimes struggle when we go back to remember

177
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,840
things, especially things that are painful. I think we look for reasons for why things happen.

178
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,560
That gives us some level of control, even though the reason may not be the correct one. At least

179
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,640
now we feel like we have some handle on it. What Andrew Wakefield offered at some level was hope.

180
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,960
If you don't want your next child to get autism, separate the MMR into its three component

181
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,680
vaccines. If you want to treat this child, here's a variety of intestinal treatments that

182
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,600
will work, that will be magical. I mean, he was a charlatan of the first order because he took

183
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,000
advantage of parents' desperate desire to do something for their children. And not to get

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,680
too far into Wakefield's psyche, but I actually believe there was probably a day when he was

185
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,080
honest. I believe there was a day when he, like any scientist, had a hypothesis, set out to test it.

186
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,080
The difference is he crossed a line. The difference between a good scientist and a

187
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,000
bad scientist and a charlatan is that a good scientist can look at the data when they disagree

188
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,680
with hypothesis and modify hypothesis. He had done some early work on sort of vasculitis associated

189
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,720
with inflammatory bowel diseases. He tried to really make the case that measles-containing

190
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,720
vaccine also was a cause of inflammatory bowel disease. He was wrong and he admitted he was wrong.

191
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,400
And then he went on to the next thing where he was wrong, but didn't admit he was wrong.

192
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,520
Yeah, and double down. And that's where really the fraud got out of control.

193
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,960
Let's take a step back to give people a bit of a sense of your work. What were you doing? What was

194
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:20,920
a day in the life of Paul Offit a year ago, basically before SARS-CoV-2 was a known entity?

195
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,120
What were you working on?

196
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,080
I spent 26 years of my life working on creating the strains of virus that became the bovine human

197
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,000
reassort vaccine roto-tech. That was my 26-year effort. Before that was done, about 2000, we

198
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,440
created the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which sort of creates

199
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,640
and distributes educational materials to educate the press, educate the public, educate doctors

200
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,160
about vaccines so we can sort of meet this anti-vaccine movement, or at least the anti-vaccine

201
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,960
sentiment that people have so that we can answer their questions. What we're trying to avoid is,

202
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,680
are those children who suffer needlessly by not getting vaccines that would protect them?

203
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,000
So that's been the passion. I mean, I think the passion for me came because I think I saw how

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,840
hard it was to make a vaccine, how hard it was to prove that a vaccine was safe and effective,

205
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,320
and how easy it was to damn them. That paper was awful, should have never been published,

206
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,040
and yet it created a movement, or at least supported a movement. So I think that was it,

207
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,160
seeing how hard vaccines were to make, how easy it was to damn them got me interested in trying

208
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
to fight with facts.

209
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,680
Let's talk a little bit about rotavirus. Can you tell folks a little bit about what that is and

210
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,160
how often it afflicts children?

211
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,320
Rotavirus is a virus that affects the small intestine. It causes fever, vomiting, and

212
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,800
diarrhea, primarily in children between 6 and 24 months of age. In the United States,

213
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,560
before there was a vaccine, everybody would be infected by age 5. All children would be

214
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,240
infected by age 5. It would cause about 75,000 children to be hospitalized in this country

215
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,720
every year with severe dehydration or water loss. It would also cause about 60 children to die every

216
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,880
year. In the developing world, or in the rest of the world, it was a killer. I mean, it was really

217
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,800
the biggest killer of infants and young children, killing about 500,000 babies a year, typically

218
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,000
children less than two years of age, about as many as 2,000 a day. So there was always a lot of

219
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,920
interest in trying to make a vaccine to prevent it. That's where I came in.

220
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,920
And obviously the difference between why so few kids would die in the United States versus the

221
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,560
rest of the world, presumably had to do with supportive care, and these children in the

222
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,960
developing world were going to die of dehydration and or electrolyte imbalance, whereas in the

223
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,840
United States, despite how many were hospitalized, at least they could receive intravenous fluids

224
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,720
and some form of perhaps even parenteral nutrition if necessary. Is that the fundamental distinction?

225
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,560
The story that I tell is that there was a friend of mine who was a PhD in chemistry. She actually

226
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,840
worked for a pharmaceutical company. Her baby got some roto-arce infection. So she took the baby to

227
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,480
the doctor and the child was severely dehydrated. The doctor said, let me call an ambulance and take

228
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,080
this child to a local hospital. The mother said, no, I can take her. I'll put her in the car and

229
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,960
take her. So she gets her in the car and then she's in a major traffic jam, which is why you

230
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,840
get an ambulance. And so she was stuck and she was much longer to get to the hospital than she

231
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,280
would have others. By the time she got to the hospital, the child was out of it. So they whisked

232
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,680
the child back into the treatment room. They were able to do a cut down essentially in the child's

233
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,320
neck to thread a catheter down because that was the only vein they could find. That child dies in

234
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,560
the developing world because you don't have the kind of equipment to do that cut down because

235
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,440
you're walking 20 miles to get to a clinic or hospital. So the difference between this country

236
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,600
and other countries where children die is not severity of disease. It's as severe here. It's

237
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,160
just that we have the resources here to keep children from dying. So what type of a virus

238
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,840
is a rotavirus? Is it an RNA or a DNA virus? It's double-stranded segmented RNA virus.

239
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,360
Does that pose any challenges for creating a vaccine against it? The good news is when you're

240
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,440
trying to make a vaccine, you want to see clear evidence that natural infection can induce

241
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,480
protection against the least moderate to severe disease. Then you know that you should be able to

242
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,720
mimic that part of the immune responses associated with that protection. Those studies were done in

243
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,360
the 70s actually. Ruth Bishop published a paper showing that if you got a rotavirus infection in

244
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,320
your first year of life, when you were then subsequently challenged with the virus, again,

245
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,880
just naturally, you could get mild infection or you could get asymptomatic infection, but you

246
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,000
wouldn't get moderate to severe infection. The minute that paper was published, we thought, okay,

247
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,840
we can make a vaccine. We just have to mimic that part of the immune responses associated with

248
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,520
protection. Was that protection lifelong, Paul? No. Like many mucosal viruses, rotavirus, influenza

249
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,880
virus, power flow, respiratory syncytial virus, those viruses which have generally short incubation

250
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,720
periods, meaning time from your first infected to when you get sick, which generally don't have

251
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,320
viremia as part of pathogenesis, their natural infection immunization induces a protection that

252
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,360
is short lived and incomplete, meaning decades and meaning protection against moderate to severe

253
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,000
disease without mild disease. These are the mucosal viruses, which I think brings us to SARS-CoV-2.

254
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,720
I think that's going to be the same story here. Did that paper in the 1970s offer an insight into

255
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,520
whether the immunity was provided more by the B cells or the T cells? The thinking was that

256
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,280
it was going to be an antibody response at the intestinal mucosal service. We had to induce

257
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,600
an antibody response that was active at the intestinal mucosal service, which made us think

258
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,000
it was going to have to be an oral vaccine, which stimulated then immunity at the intestinal mucosal

259
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,160
service and not a parental vaccine, which would stimulate systemic immunity. So what was the

260
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,360
approach you took then to do that? In the spirit of that, at the time, what were the options

261
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,840
available? I mean, beginning with, say, a live attenuated virus, is that generally the first

262
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,040
thought an individual has when pursuing a vaccine or how did you guys problem solve around the

263
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,240
different ways in which you could induce immunity? The way we saw it was that rotaviruses are

264
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,760
ubiquitous. Every mammal that walks the face of this earth has its own unique strain of the

265
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,600
rotavirus. And species barriers are pretty high, meaning that a cow rotavirus or calf rotavirus

266
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,320
would cause disease in calves but not people, and vice versa. Human rotaviruses would cause disease

267
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,280
in babies but not calves. So we basically took advantage of that. It was a generic approach,

268
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,160
if you will, an Edward Jenner-like approach. I mean, Edward Jenner basically used the cow virus

269
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,680
to protect against human smallpox virus. So cow smallpox, essentially cowpox, would protect

270
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,000
against human smallpox because they were antigenically related enough that immunization

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,840
with one could protect you from a disease caused by another. That was our approach. So that was our

272
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,480
initial approach was just to take a cow virus, a calf virus, that had caused diarrhea, adapted to

273
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,240
growth in cell culture, and then use that as our vaccine. And it did work, but it was inconsistent.

274
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,800
So then we had to modify that calf virus so that it included the genes that coded for the proteins

275
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,640
that evoke what we found were neutralizing antibodies. There were two surface proteins of

276
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,200
the virus, and we thought both independently evoke neutralizing antibodies. That's what we proved.

277
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,880
So then it was a matter of just constructing these combination virus, so-called reassertant

278
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,200
viruses, between calf and animal strains that became the vaccine, thus summarizing 10 years'

279
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,760
worth of work in about 35 seconds. It's a little depressing that you can do that,

280
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,240
but that's what we did. What were the risks associated with the vaccine?

281
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,600
You don't know. Whenever you're dealing with something that's unknown, it's the

282
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,880
calf viruses. Will they behave differently in people? Will they cause something that's

283
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,400
untoward that you hadn't thought about? What we learned from other researchers was that surprisingly,

284
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,480
actually, there was a vaccine that was introduced in the late 1990s. It was made by National

285
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,520
Institutes of Health in collaboration with Wyeth called Rotashield, which was a simian

286
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,040
rotavirus that was also a recombinant virus, simian human reassertant rotavirus, that was found to be

287
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,520
a rare cause of inter-susception, which is intestinal blockage. It occurred, depending

288
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,680
on who you read, between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 30,000 recipients. It wasn't picked up pre-licensure

289
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,200
because the studies wouldn't have been big enough to pick it up pre-licensure. It was only picked

290
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,920
up months after licensure, and then it was off the market within 10 months. So that was a sobering

291
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,080
experience. Just to relate it to today, if you don't mind, that rotavirus had been studied for

292
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,040
50 years by that time. I mean, it was known to be an animal pathogen in the 40s.

293
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,120
Veterinarian study, we knew it was a human pathogen by the 70s. When that vaccine came

294
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,240
out in the late 1990s, we had 50 years worth of study. Nonetheless, it caused a side effect,

295
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,280
inter-susception, that would have never been predicted by all those studies.

296
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,320
Mad Fientist Yeah. Let me tell people what that is. So an inter-susception is when usually a lymph

297
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,360
node in the small intestine acts as a foci and allows the small bowel to telescope on itself.

298
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,440
So it gets tugged probably through some sort of peristalsis action, and that can cause an

299
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,720
obstruction. So if the piece of the bowel telescopes into another and comes back out, easy peasy. But

300
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,920
if it telescopes and gets stuck, you now have a bowel obstruction. And I took care of many kids,

301
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,120
as I'm sure you have, who had inter-susception from lymphoid hyperplasia or various other things.

302
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,120
But obviously, in this case, it was a side effect of a vaccine and an understandable side effect,

303
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,920
meaning there's a biological plausibility of why giving a vaccine that has a GI mucosal effect

304
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,200
could lead to lymphoid hyperplasia that could act as the tugging point. But you're right,

305
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,840
you would never in a million years say, I think inter-susception could be a side effect here.

306
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,000
And if it only occurs, one in 10,000 cases, you're going to easily miss that in phase one,

307
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,680
two, and phase three. Again, it speaks to aftermarket surveillance and the absolute imperative

308
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,160
of it. And it also speaks to the fact that as we start to talk about coronavirus, which we're going

309
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,480
to get to very shortly, one has to be thoughtful about risk versus reward trade-off with small n,

310
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,080
right? Yeah, I think the surprise was that vaccine, which was sort of a seeming rotavirus-based vaccine,

311
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,800
that virus reproduced itself far less efficiently at the intestinal mucosal surface than did

312
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,800
wild-type virus, natural virus. There was no evidence that natural rotavirus caused

313
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,640
an interception. So why would this be true? And the reason is, is that interception really

314
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,680
appeared to be a year-round phenomenon. It wasn't a winter phenomenon in the United States,

315
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,360
which was what rotavirus was. You would expect to see a bump in the winter, which you never saw.

316
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,120
So why would a vaccine do something that natural infection didn't do? I think what we know now is

317
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,720
that natural infection probably was a very rare cause of interception, as was this vaccine. And

318
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,080
I guess the COVID analogy is that here's a virus, COVID, for which we had at least the gene structure

319
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,440
in early January of this year, which has already had a number of sort of clinical and pathological

320
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,760
surprises, which we are now about to counter with a series of vaccine strategies with which we have

321
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,000
no commercial experience. I think it's fair to say there's going to be a learning curve here. So there

322
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,400
has to be real humility, I think, as we move forward. Let's help folks understand a little bit

323
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,680
about these different phases, because you can't turn on the news without hearing company X is in

324
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:35,400
phase one or two or three. And I just want people to understand what those mean specific to vaccines,

325
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,680
because they have slightly different meanings than, say, in drugs that treat blood pressure.

326
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:47,880
So can you explain to people what a phase one vaccine trial aims to accomplish and what a typical

327
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,440
size of that trial might look like? If you're trying to make a vaccine, you start in so-called

328
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,080
preclinical studies, meaning studies done before you get to humans. And hopefully you'll have an

329
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,080
animal model to study the disease. In the case of rotavirus, it was mice. If we inoculated babies,

330
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,480
mice with rotavirus, they got sick. Okay, great. So now we have a way to study this infection.

331
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,560
Then you have your idea for how you want to make your vaccine. You give your vaccine, you then

332
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,920
challenge the animal with the virus, and hopefully you can protect the animal from disease. And more

333
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,920
importantly, you can frankly literally dissect out that part of the immune responses associated

334
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,600
with protection against challenge. So those preclinical studies are called proof of concept

335
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
studies. So now you have your way of making a vaccine. Then you go to phase one, which are

336
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,080
usually about 20 to 100 people. Now you have your idea for how you want to make it, but you don't

337
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,440
really know the dose. So you give a variety of different doses to these 20 to 100 people to see

338
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,520
whether or not you can safely induce an immune response that you think is going to be protective

339
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,680
based on your animal model work. Now you have a dose and a strategy. What's the typical length of

340
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:54,280
time to go from that preclinical where you've now filed an IND and you now would be applying to

341
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,920
institutional review board to do a phase one in the normal world that takes how long usually?

342
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,680
I think probably it's fair to say 10 years, 15 years.

343
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay. Well, make sure everybody keeps that in mind when we pivot to coronavirus. The other thing I

344
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,200
want to highlight that you just said there is 20 to 40 people ish. Yeah, 20 to 100.

345
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,840
We're not talking about 10,000 people. No, no. And these are often done with a little bit of a

346
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,760
dose escalation built in. So maybe the first 10 people are going to get a really, really small dose.

347
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,400
We make sure nothing catastrophic happens. We then escalate the next 10, et cetera, right?

348
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,360
There are dose ranging trials. Exactly right. You go slow and you work your way up to see what seems

349
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,600
to consistently induce an immune response that is safe. The third thing I want to highlight there is

350
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:46,120
we're not actually able to assess whether or not the people have legitimate immunity. We're using

351
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,680
a proxy, presumably, which is some form of serology. In other words, we're not actually

352
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,400
testing their ability to resist an infection. We're measuring an antibody. Is that correct?

353
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,960
That's right. You have a prediction based on your animal model studies that one aspect of the immune

354
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,480
response is going to be associated with protection against trials, as it was true in your animal

355
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,520
models. You won't know that till you get to phase three. So now let's go to phase two. You've

356
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,200
established a dose, potentially a frequency. What do you do in phase two and roughly how many people

357
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,600
do you do this with? So phase two is typically hundreds of people. Now you've got your vaccine,

358
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,120
you've got your dose, and you just want to make sure that it's consistently induced an immune

359
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,440
response that you think is protective and that it's at least safe and that it doesn't cause a

360
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:33,960
relatively common serious side effect. That's phase two. And again, the two points worth making

361
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,800
sure people understand, still a relatively small clinical trial, hundreds of people,

362
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,480
and you're still using surrogate markers. We don't actually know if this vaccine is providing

363
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,400
immunity in the real world. It's efficacy. We don't know if it's effective. And we don't really

364
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,960
have any way of knowing what very minor or I shouldn't say minor, infrequent negative

365
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,400
consequences could look like because we're still dealing with a very small sample size.

366
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,960
That's exactly right. So now we go to phase three. And what does that look like?

367
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,920
This is the definitive trial. This is the trial that you're going to use to submit

368
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,600
information to the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, hopefully for licensure.

369
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:21,000
These are tens of thousands of people. In the case of our rotavirus vaccine, it was 70,000 babies,

370
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,240
35,000 got the vaccine, 35,000 got placebo, which is just essentially the vaccine except

371
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,280
no active ingredient, just the frankly sugar solution in which the vaccine virus was suspended.

372
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,840
And then you just send people out into the real world. I mean, rotavirus is a common infection.

373
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,920
It's the rare child who gets stage five without being infected. And then you just see whether or

374
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,240
not children who got the vaccine were less likely to get rotavirus or if they got it that they were

375
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,280
less likely to get it severely. And hopefully you'll have, we had sera on all those children,

376
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,680
meaning we looked at the antibodies on all those children. Hopefully that would provide a clear

377
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,000
immunological correlated protection, which it didn't. We knew that the vaccine worked. We knew

378
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,920
that it was safe. And so we could submit it for licensure to the FDA. But as you go along,

379
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,480
things are much more expensive. You go from sort of millions to tens of millions to hundreds and

380
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,640
hundreds of millions. And then you mass produce the vaccine after you found out that it works.

381
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,080
And as a general rule, the process we just described going from a preclinical model in

382
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,400
animals to the completion of a phase three trial with the FDA approval of an agent. Here's the

383
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,040
rule of thumb I use. Please correct me on the vaccine side. I generally say that's 20 years

384
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,240
and $1 billion. And that's usually on the drug side. Is it about the same on the vaccine side?

385
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,520
Yes. It's 15 to 20 years with at least a billion dollars. That's right.

386
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:46,760
So let's now talk about coronavirus and just understand that in January of 2020,

387
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:55,080
when the sequence of the RNA identifying this as a novel pathogen, a coronavirus named now SARS-CoV-2

388
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,560
shows up. And by March, I guess it becomes pretty clear this is not going to be contained,

389
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,240
which means any strategy towards containment is going to fail. It became readily apparent that a

390
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,120
vaccine was going to be a very important piece of the strategy. Basically, at that point, it was

391
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,360
going to be herd immunity without vaccine or herd immunity aided by vaccine. If you're staring down

392
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,280
the barrel of it's going to take 20 years and a billion dollars, that's not a very appealing

393
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,760
strategy because it basically says it has to be herd immunity without a vaccine, meaning this

394
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,240
virus has to sort of rip through a population without it. If I could ask you to put yourself

395
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,880
back in your mindset in February or March of last year, what would you have said if I asked you at

396
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,680
the time, Paul, how likely is it that a vaccine will be developed to at least thwart in some way

397
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,040
this virus? And two, how long will it take? What would you have said then?

398
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,560
I would have said it was 10 years. You do have to give credit to the administration for one thing,

399
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,400
operation warp speed. What they did was they basically took the risk out of it for pharmaceutical

400
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,720
companies. What the government said is both VARDA, which is part of Health and Human Services,

401
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,760
the Wealth Health Organization, the Gates Foundation and others, but in this country,

402
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,880
the government said, here's what we'll do. We'll pay for phase three trials. We'll pay for mass

403
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,600
production at risk, meaning we'll mass produce this vaccine. We'll make millions of doses of vaccine

404
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,200
without knowing whether the vaccine works, without knowing whether it's safe and showing

405
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,600
a willingness to if it neither works or isn't safe, we'll throw out those tens of millions of doses.

406
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,080
No pharmaceutical company would ever do that. So now you basically had phase one trials,

407
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,720
you pretty much went right to phase three trials, which a company would never do. Went right to mass

408
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,280
producing, which a company would never do. And that's what meant having a vaccine in hand in

409
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,480
January. It is in all likelihood that we will have a vaccine that is rolling off the assembly line

410
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,800
into the arms of Americans by early next year. I mean, so a year and a quarter to make a vaccine

411
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,240
with only having the virus in hand in January, that's remarkably fast. It's unimaginably fast,

412
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,960
but it's the government that did that. So give credit to them.

413
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,240
Let's talk a little bit about some of the different ways in which vaccines are made. Again,

414
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,720
there's so many different ways to skin this, but one way is you actually deliver the RNA of the

415
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:18,200
coronavirus in a vehicle that then gets taken up by our DNA and it creates enough of an immune

416
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,880
response that we create an immune response to it. How do you think of that overall strategy?

417
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,520
So if there's any good news about this virus, it's that we know the part of the virus, the protein

418
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,480
in the virus that attaches the virus to cells. If you can prevent the virus from attaching to cells,

419
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,000
in theory, you should be able to prevent the virus from infecting cells or set it another way,

420
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,560
infecting you. That protein is the spike protein. It's the protein that emanates from the surface

421
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,200
of the virus and gives it its crown-like appearance, hence coronavirus. You also know

422
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,440
the gene that codes for that protein. It's an mRNA virus, meaning messenger RNA virus,

423
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,360
single-stranded messenger RNA virus like Rubella or German measles. So the initial strategies to

424
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,520
make this vaccine are all based on that knowledge. We know the gene that codes for that protein.

425
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,320
Take the mRNA strategy, which is the most naked and obvious, which is that you basically take

426
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,160
the messenger RNA, which codes for that protein, you inject it into people, it's taken up by the

427
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,600
cell in the cell cytoplasm outside the nucleus, it enters the so-called ribosomal system, and it's

428
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,520
translated to a protein, which is excreted. So that's as though your body makes the protein,

429
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,840
the spike, the coronavirus spike protein, then your body makes antibodies to the spike protein.

430
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,520
This very similar strategy is the so-called DNA vaccines, and then these so-called replication

431
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,280
defective, simian or human adenovirus vaccines, or replication competent of vectored vaccines,

432
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,400
all have the same strategy in mind, which is introduce the gene, the codes for the coronavirus

433
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,520
spike protein, induce your body to make that spike protein, and then your body will make

434
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,720
antibodies. These are so-called genetic plug and play vaccines. The reason that they're the first

435
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,000
ones to come out is because they're the easiest to construct and the easiest to mass produce.

436
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,760
It doesn't mean they're going to be the last best vaccines, but that's why they're going to be the

437
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,880
first vaccines. One question I have for you on that, Paul, is given the instability of RNA,

438
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,480
I've always been kind of surprised that they work. I can understand why DNA could work, but

439
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:25,240
given how unstable RNA could be, when you take a single strand of messenger RNA and deliver it,

440
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,000
what allows it, I mean, this might sound like a silly sort of technical question,

441
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,400
what allows it to make its way into our cells, into the cytoplasm, head over to the ribosome,

442
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,960
and then get translated ultimately into protein? Anybody who works with messenger RNA in a

443
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,400
laboratory stores messenger RNA at minus 70 degrees centigrade or in liquid nitrogen,

444
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,040
because as you say, it's an incredibly labile molecule. It breaks down within moments, frankly.

445
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,200
I've burned myself on the said vats of liquid nitrogen many a time in the lab.

446
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,560
To get around that problem, these vaccines, the messenger RNA vaccines have to be encapsulated

447
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,240
in a complex lipid delivering system, which stabilizes them to some extent. The Moderna has

448
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,240
been able to figure out a way to both store and ship and store at minus 20 degrees, which is just

449
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,720
freezer temperature. But Pfizer, no, they're going to ship and store at minus 70, minus 80. This sort

450
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,960
of ultra cold chain, which we've never done in this country, which I think will be a challenge.

451
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,040
So you have to constantly maintain that product on dry ice. Once you thaw it out and put it in the

452
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,960
refrigerator, it can't be there for more than a day before you give it. You're right. I think

453
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,160
the lability of messenger RNA will be a challenge. And just one sort of nerdy virologist thing that

454
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,920
I'd like to say as a nerdy virologist is that when you're infected with this virus, you'll shed

455
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,240
infectious virus for a week, roughly. You'll shed infectious virus a week. You'll be PCR positive,

456
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,560
polymerase chain react positive. You can be PCR positive for three months. What you're

457
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,040
detecting in the back of the throat is not infectious virus, it's messenger RNA. That's

458
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,760
what you're detecting, which means because it's so quickly degraded, why would it be around so much

459
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,120
longer? And the answer is the virus is continuing to make messenger RNA, but not making whole virus

460
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,080
particles. Why would it do that? I mean, this virus continues to surprise, I think.

461
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,200
Let me make sure I understand what you just said, because I never actually thought about it that way.

462
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,760
You're saying that, let's say I take the Moderna vaccine, I'm getting a bolus of mRNA.

463
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,120
My body is going to just take that and incorporate it and start kicking off protein. But it does two

464
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,720
things. It doesn't just take it like one single transcribed piece of mRNA and translate it into

465
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,760
protein and be done with it. It actually incorporates it back into the DNA. And that cell of mine

466
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,560
continues to transcribe and translate it. Is that what you're saying? For months?

467
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,920
The mRNA will amplify itself in the cell. True.

468
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,280
Which cell? Epithelial cells? Which of my cells?

469
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,200
Muscle cells. It will be inoculated in your arm. It will be the muscle cells. And then to some

470
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,920
extent also antigen presenting cells like macrophases, dendritic cells.

471
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,960
Okay, that's kind of interesting to think about because why would it show up in a throat swap?

472
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,680
How is it making it all the way to the epithelial cells in my throat or in my nose or wherever?

473
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,000
I guess I'm saying two different things. When you're naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2,

474
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,120
that virus then reproduces itself over and over again. Pardon the back of your throat.

475
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,640
And it makes infectious virus particles. It enters your cells, it's transcribed, it's translated,

476
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,120
and then it makes new virus particles. But what happens is it's only making new virus particles

477
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,360
for about a week. And then it stops making infectious particles any more. But you still

478
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,600
have messenger RNA in the back of your throat. You can for months, which means the virus is still

479
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,680
there. It's still in the cell. It's still making messenger RNA, but it's not making a whole virus

480
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,800
particle anymore. That's weird. I don't know of any virus that does that. I'm not sure it says

481
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,120
anything about the messenger RNA approach. I mean, messenger RNA does amplify itself in your body,

482
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,000
but then it's quickly broken down as it's all messenger RNA in your body. It'll be curious

483
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,320
to see what happens with this. I mean, we're going to learn a lot with this strategy. We'll see whether

484
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,320
it applies to other vaccines possibilities and we'll see whether or not we run into a problem.

485
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,960
Moderna that you mentioned is obviously one of the front runners in this. And I think that's in no

486
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,280
small part to the fact that one of their partners is NIH. That's National Institutes of Health here

487
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,960
in the United States has bankrolled to the tune of about a billion dollars, as you said. Has NIH

488
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,000
partnered with anyone else besides Moderna? No, just Moderna. It's their construct that Moderna

489
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,280
uses. The nucleoside analogs that are used in that vaccine, that was all developed by a couple

490
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,640
researchers at the National Institutes of Health. Actually, National Institutes of Health, as far as

491
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,000
I know, holds the patent on that vaccine. And they basically entered phase three this summer,

492
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,400
correct? I mean, I think they're fully enrolled, aren't they? They entered the end of July. As far

493
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,040
as I know, they're fully enrolled. It's hard to know. I mean, it's always trying to read the

494
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,680
tea leaves on this, stay strong. Okay. Well, anyone else on the mRNA strategy that you think is,

495
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,280
I mean, Moderna is probably the leader, correct? Moderna and Pfizer, both. Let's talk a little

496
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,200
bit about the Pfizer platform. How does it differ? Whereas Moderna gives 100 micrograms per dose in

497
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,400
a two-dose series, Pfizer gives 30 micrograms. So it's not the same nucleoside analogs. And I'm

498
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,200
curious to know, I'd love to hear a scientific presentation on why Pfizer needs to ship and

499
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,360
store at minus 70, which is going to be a challenge as compared to Moderna's shipping and storing at

500
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,280
just minus 20. They are different constructs, so they're given at different amounts. And we'll see

501
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,880
to what extent any of them work or are safe. Now, Pfizer is doing a phase two, phase three

502
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,200
combined. Is that correct? They sort of all are. I mean, you sort of went right,

503
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,560
sort of skipped through phase two, right to phase three, really. They all did that. Do you think

504
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,000
that that distinction, Paul, from a logistic standpoint is going to matter? In other words,

505
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,080
when we start to think, let's just assume for a moment that the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer

506
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:04,440
vaccine have equal efficacy in the real world. So in a phase three trial, we see, call it a 70%

507
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,040
reduction, severity of infection in those receiving the vaccine over the placebo. Would

508
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:17,160
we agree that that's a win? Yes. Okay. All other things being equal is the need to transport

509
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,120
tens of millions of doses of something basically in liquid nitrogen going to pose a challenge.

510
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,600
So it won't be in liquid nitrogen, but it will be on dry ice. Is that going to pose a challenge?

511
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Yes. I think what worries me in this a little bit is that when you do the studies, which Pfizer is

512
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,040
doing and Moderna is doing, you can be comfortable that the companies are very good at overseeing

513
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,360
the shipment and storage of that product. And they're making sure that the investigators,

514
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,840
they've got the special package in which this vaccine is stored. They're constantly maintaining

515
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,920
dry ice. That doesn't worry me. And when it's thought out and put in the refrigerator, it can

516
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,480
only be there for a day. When the vaccine then gets distributed to the world under natural

517
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,800
conditions or the United States under natural conditions, how is it going to be distributed?

518
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,760
Probably at least in part in like large chain pharmacies. Are the pharmacists going to be as

519
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,160
good at doing what was done during the trial? Because certainly, as you said at the beginning,

520
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,840
I mean, these are mRNA is labile. And if it degrades and it certainly has the capacity to degrade,

521
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,040
will we get less efficacy, effectiveness of the vaccine in a real world situation than we did in

522
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:29,560
a experimental situation? Yeah. I guess TBD, your best guess of how those companies are signaling

523
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:35,720
when we're going to see data. I mean, it depends in large part on how active the third wave of this

524
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,240
is because this is one of those things where the more people that get exposed, the more quickly

525
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:48,120
we see the difference between the placebo and the vaccine. The company technically doesn't know

526
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:53,000
what's going on in the trial. I mean, technically the company, meaning the CEO, for example,

527
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,920
doesn't know who's gotten vaccine, who's gotten placebo, doesn't know who's gotten sick and who

528
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,240
hasn't gotten sick, doesn't know how many cases of disease of a current placebo group or vaccine

529
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,040
group, doesn't know that. The Data Safety Monitoring Board knows that, which is composed of a group of

530
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,720
academics and researchers who are not affiliated with the company and not affiliated with the

531
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,240
government. These are being run through large CROs, I assume. Yes, depends on who's doing it,

532
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,320
but yes. For listener, clinical research organizations, when large companies or even

533
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,840
academics do clinical trials, they usually contract out with companies that are exceptional

534
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,400
at all the stuff that Paul's talking about, which is the logistics of how do you actually ship this

535
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,960
thing from A to B and make sure it goes perfectly? How do you get the blood draw on this person and

536
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,760
measure this and all these things? That's not an expertise that a company wants to build in house.

537
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,800
They typically outsource that. It's those companies that are, it's a part of that is the monitoring,

538
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,360
but presumably there's a power analysis that's gone into this that said, look, we're going to

539
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,960
enroll 30,000 people. We know half of them are going to get a placebo. Half of them are going

540
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,480
to get an active agent. We've stratified on some level by age. The inclusion criteria probably

541
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,400
says we want people between ages X and Y of a certain, this many of them to be of this health,

542
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,880
this many of them to not be of that health. We think the exposure risk at this stage of the virus

543
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,360
is meaning at this life cycle, the virus, we think there's this many more people that can be

544
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:20,520
exposed. The R not is something. Do you think that they can at least get back into an answer which

545
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,280
says, hey, by February, we should know this good or bad? Or is that simply something that just can't

546
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,640
be known a priority? My hope is that these companies do what was recommended actually by

547
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,080
the NIH active group that was put together by Francis Collins, which is it depends on whether

548
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,480
it's a one to one or two to one trial, meaning two vaccines, recipients for every one placebo

549
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:48,920
recipient or one to one. But if that's true, you need at least around between 147 and 160 people

550
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,680
to get sick in the trial. In order to be able to say you can so-called reject the null hypothesis,

551
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,560
the null hypothesis is this vaccine doesn't work. To reject the null hypothesis is to say I have

552
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:05,400
statistically significant, robust evidence that says it does. You need 90% confidence interval to

553
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,040
be able to say that you need about 150 people. Now, they say to the mining board, they're looking

554
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,960
all the time in real time. So they know when they feel you've met a safety or efficacy standard,

555
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,920
and then they call the company and they say, okay, now you can submit this vaccine. What would be

556
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,640
for a typical vaccine, which is not this vaccine, you can submit it for licensure with a biological

557
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,080
license application. That's not these vaccines. These vaccines are all going to be permitted for

558
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:36,200
use under emergency use authorization. It's different. And that I think is what scares people

559
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,400
at some level because they saw what happened with, for example, hydroxychloroquine, which didn't work,

560
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,200
now has been shown clearly not to work to treat or prevent disease, yet it was approved under a UA,

561
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,240
or convalescent plasma, which is to say antibodies taken from people who survive the infection,

562
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,520
which again was heartily approved by the FDA through this emergency use authorization also

563
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,760
with no evidence that it worked. What's weird about this is that people are doing the same

564
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,320
kinds of trials they would do for any vaccine, large placebo controlled trials, yet it's still

565
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,160
not going to go through a biological license application mechanism. It's going through a UA.

566
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,320
Just because of time? I think it's because the FDA would not typically license a product that

567
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,480
was studied for this short a period of time. So yeah, because of time. Can you just explain to

568
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,120
people what the UA is? I guess by now most people have heard the term emergency use authorization.

569
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,600
It's been granted to not just medications, but frankly to even testing modalities. Oh,

570
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,880
this serology test just got a UA. This PCR test just got a UA. What does it actually mean?

571
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,720
It's a permission to use something, which is to say that even though there aren't clear data

572
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,800
showing that something is safer effective or that it's a diagnostic, it clearly works well.

573
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,000
We're going to allow it under this condition because we're under duress with this COVID-19

574
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,360
pandemic. So we're going to put it out there with the hopes that it works. I actually wrote an

575
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,200
op-ed piece that I submitted to the Philadelphia Inquirer yesterday that I just heard before this

576
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,760
show that it is going to be published, I think, on Sunday on the Philadelphia Inquirer. But the

577
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,600
point I'm trying to make in that piece is that how big of a risk are we taking? If we're going to be

578
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,920
studying these vaccines for four months, five months, six months, and we're going to be putting

579
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,760
them out there into millions and arguably tens of millions and hundreds of millions of people,

580
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,320
are we taking a risk? And I think in terms of effectiveness, you're only going to know that a

581
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,160
vaccine is effective for a few months. You don't know whether it's effective for nine months or a

582
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,920
year or two years. You don't know that. I don't think that's a huge risk. I think it's likely that

583
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,480
it's effective in the short term. It's probably effective in the somewhat longer term. I don't

584
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,400
think it's going to be effective for decades, but I think it's likely to be effective at least for a

585
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,040
year or two or three. I think. I mean, we'll see. And worst case scenario, you could give a booster

586
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,800
dose. That would be the worst case scenario. But then safety, which is what everybody worries

587
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,040
about. I mean, have you really studied it enough to say whether it's a, I'm on the FDA's Vaccine

588
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,080
Advisory Committee. We had our meeting on October 22nd and that dominated the meeting. That nine

589
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,920
hour meeting was dominated by the FDA is basically asking us, are you comfortable as a committee

590
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:00,520
allowing use through EUA knowing we're not going to have a certain amount of data? What you'll have

591
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,640
basically is you'll have two months follow up after the last dose for safety issues. Is that enough

592
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,920
time? Personally, I think the answer is yes, I do. I mean, if you look at the serious side effects

593
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,440
that vaccines occasionally cause like polio caused by the oral polio vaccine, which occurred in one

594
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,040
in 2.4 million doses, or narcolepsy, a disorder of wakefulness that was caused by the squalene

595
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,120
adjuvantid flu vaccine that was given in Europe, not in the United States, which occurred in roughly

596
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:31,480
one in 55,000 doses. Thrombocytopenia, lowering the platelet count that occurs with measles

597
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,680
containing vaccine, which occurs in one in 25,000 doses or something called viscerotropic disease,

598
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,160
which is basically a sort of multi-system disease caused by the yellow fever vaccine. It's basically

599
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,480
yellow fever caused by the yellow fever vaccine, which occurs in about one in a million doses or

600
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,840
Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is this ascending paralysis, which can affect your ability to breathe,

601
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,280
that occurs in about one in a million doses of the influenza vaccine. How soon did you know that? I

602
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,560
mean, how soon did you know about those serious problems? Did you know about them within two

603
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,480
months? And the answer is yes. I was on a CDC conference call yesterday with a group of

604
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,320
folks that are associated with the advisory committee for immunization practices, and we

605
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,720
collectively could not think of a serious side effect that was not picked up after two months.

606
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:18,200
So I'm optimistic that that would happen here as well. When you think of all of the different types

607
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,080
of vaccines, we just talked about the mRNA vaccine, we'll get to sort of the viral vectors,

608
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,640
the inactivated or attenuated variants, and then obviously just the proteins that are delivered.

609
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,640
I want to go through these in some detail and use it as an example to talk about the companies.

610
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:37,560
Are there any of those classes you worry about more than others from a risk standpoint? For example,

611
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,640
some of the live attenuated viruses have been the ones that go on to cause,

612
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,120
it isn't polio's live attenuated, correct? Your polio vaccine was a live attenuated viral vaccine,

613
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:51,080
yes. Right. And so that's presumably why you had, even though it was a minuscule risk, you still

614
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:56,680
had some risk of getting polio. So do you look at those four categories of vaccines equally

615
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:02,360
from a safety question? I'm not sure we know enough about mRNA, DNA replication-effective

616
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:08,280
human or semi-adenoviruses to say. Here are the things that I worry about though. I worry that

617
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,080
you've had three clinical holds for these vaccines. You have one clinical hold with Johnson & Johnson's

618
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,480
product, which is a replication-defective adenovirus-26. So adenovirus is a human virus that causes

619
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,120
a variety of clinical diseases. Type 26 just means it's one of the many types of adenovirus,

620
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,960
human adenovirus is the cause disease. Replication-defective means that the virus has been

621
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,600
genetically engineered so it can't reproduce itself. But it has also been genetically engineered

622
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,440
so it contains the gene that codes for the coronavirus spike protein. So that when you're

623
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:42,120
inoculated with that vaccine, the cell takes up that particle, which does not amplify itself.

624
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,520
It enters the nucleus, it then is transcribed, it's transcribed to messenger RNA, the messenger

625
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,720
RNA is translated to a protein, and that protein is executed. So it's good news, bad news. The good

626
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,440
news is it's replication-defective. Therefore it can't cause disease because the virus is reproducing

627
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,320
itself. The bad news is it's replication-defective, meaning you have to give a lot of virus to get

628
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,760
enough of those virus particles into the cell to make the protein you're interested in, about 10

629
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,600
billion virus particles per dose. That's a lot of virus. That's why it is that side-effect profile

630
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,240
can be a little rough, meaning fever, including high fever, and then symptoms associated with

631
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,800
fever, chills, headache, muscle ache. And that was seen fairly commonly, especially after the second

632
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,200
dose with these vaccines. Which is also part of the issue with some of the genetic engineering

633
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,280
stuff. This is a little off topic, but the use of adenoviruses for genetic engineering even 20

634
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,360
years ago at CHOP, right? I mean, that's a big part of what kind of got into some of the trouble

635
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,880
there, isn't it? Yes, that's it. I mean, I'm at Penn, so we're all thinking the same thing,

636
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,600
which is Jesse Gelsinger. Gelsinger, yeah, God, I still remember that story like it was yesterday.

637
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:50,120
It's got to be at least 20 years. He was inoculated with a replication-defective, adenovirus type 5,

638
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:55,000
that included a gene that coded for one of the liver enzymes that he was missing. He was missing

639
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,880
a gene that allowed him to take the ammonia that is a consequence of protein metabolism

640
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,480
and excrete it from his body. So the ammonia would build up in his body, and then he would get very

641
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:10,120
sick and go into a coma occasionally. But he died. I mean, he died because he had a massive,

642
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,640
so-called cytokine response with something called interleukin 6 at a time before we had antibodies

643
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,560
directed against interleukin 6 that would have saved his life. And we all lived through that,

644
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,760
and it really set gene therapy back. If it's any consolation, the amount of replication-defective

645
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,160
adenovirus he got was logarithmically greater, exponentially greater than the amount that we're

646
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,800
currently giving here, even though 10 billion sounds like a lot. It's still about 1,300th of what he

647
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,200
got. But again, you're going into an upper-ed population with, when you put something into

648
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,320
millions of people, you may find something out that's untoward. So yeah, that worries me.

649
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,720
The clinical holds worried me a little bit. The two clinical holds that were for the replication-defective

650
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:54,040
simian adenovirus, which was the UK AstraZeneca vaccine, were both because of neurological issues.

651
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:00,280
The first was so-called undiagnosed multiple sclerosis. The second was transverse myelitis,

652
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,320
which is an inflammation of a segment of the spinal cord. The mechanism by which both of those

653
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,720
diseases happen is the same, which is that you make an immune response really to the sheathing

654
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,280
of your nerves, and particularly one protein under sheathing of your nerves, myelin-basic protein.

655
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,760
Multiple sclerosis is relatively common, but transverse myelitis is, that occurs maybe 1

656
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,120
in 200,000 in the general population. That trial was about 18,000 people big at the time,

657
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:30,200
which is to say 9,000 people got vaccine, and they saw that case. It was adjudicated to be likely to

658
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,240
be coincidental and not causal, but it does worry you a little bit because it certainly was a

659
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,720
statistical bizarreity. You'd like to know what the problem was with Johnson & Johnson's vaccine,

660
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,520
which you don't. This is the problem with these things. They're both in the same class, right?

661
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
They're both replications that affect the adenovirus.

662
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:53,400
Yeah, exactly. While we're on that topic, aren't these the same classes that were actually approved

663
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,120
in Russia and China? Doesn't Russia and China each have something that they've approved for

664
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:04,920
limited use already in this category? Yeah, so China had a replication effective ad5, adenovirus

665
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,280
type 5, which they actually had approved for use in the military. I'm not sure to what extent

666
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,560
they've done it because it seems they've gone in the other direction now and are looking just at a

667
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,080
inactivated viral vaccine. That seems to be their focus now.

668
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,760
Yeah, I was going to say, do we have any data? I mean, not that we would have any data from China

669
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,960
necessarily, but we don't know how many people received that outside of an actual clinical use

670
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,440
and if there's been any other safety defects noted. I mean, I have heard they've given it to tens of

671
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,120
thousands of people, but what I haven't heard is the results of the phase three trial. So I'd like

672
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,480
to see whether or not it actually works would be nice to see. And then the Russia, the Gamalea

673
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,760
research institute in Moscow has also replication effective adenovirus vaccines and also is a two

674
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,240
dose vaccine. But the first dose is replication effective ad5. The second dose is replication

675
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:52,280
effective ad26. That's their vaccine. Vladimir Putin came out at the end of August and said,

676
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,160
we are going to now start giving this to our public, the Russian public. We have checked all

677
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,440
the boxes, which nearest I could tell at the time was doing a small phase one trial. They hadn't

678
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,360
even started doing phase three trials yet. So I'm not sure what's going on in Russia. It's hard to

679
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,920
know what's going on. I know that I got a call from a Venezuelan reporter who said that that

680
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Russian vaccine had been shipped to Venezuela for use. So I don't know what's going on out there,

681
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,160
but you really would like to wait for phase three trials to at least prove safety and efficacy at

682
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,720
some level before you start giving it to the general population. The other big player here

683
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,440
is Merck, although they're a step behind, right? They're mostly phase one at this point. They have

684
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,800
a candidate that has made it through phase one yet. I've heard of two candidates. One is the

685
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,120
replication competent fascicular stomatitis virus, which although reproduces itself in your body,

686
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,280
doesn't really cause disease. That's what they use for their Ebola vaccine. That was Merck's Ebola

687
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,400
vaccine. But they also apparently are interested in using their measles vaccine virus as a vector

688
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,000
for this as well. So I haven't seen any data yet. But again, just summarizing where we are, we've

689
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,680
got Moderna and Pfizer as the big guns on the mRNA front. We've got Johnson and Johnson,

690
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,680
and then AstraZeneca with Oxford as the big guns on the adenovirus slash viral vector front. Is

691
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:10,120
that fair? Yes. As the leaders. Okay. So then the next category is let's just give you the

692
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:16,520
protein off the virus itself. Let's just rip off a spike protein, give you a whole bunch of them.

693
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,840
And when your body sees those, it's not going to be threatened by them. I mean, it's going to be

694
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,200
threatened appropriately to make an immune response, but obviously the protein by itself

695
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,920
can't hurt you because it has no genetic material with which to take over your cells. As a general

696
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,320
rule, how does that strategy work when you think of other non coronavirus applications?

697
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,240
Right. So it's a strategy we use to make the hepatitis B vaccine with which we have had

698
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,200
experience since the 90s, early 90s. It's the strategy we use to make the human papillomavirus

699
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,480
vaccine, which has been on the market since mid 2000s, around 2006. It's a strategy we use to make

700
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,200
one of the influenza vaccines, so called flu block, which has also been around for years. You have the

701
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,840
comfort at least of having a lot of commercial experience with that strategy. They're made using

702
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,800
recombinant DNA technology. So in the case, for example, of the hepatitis B vaccine or the human

703
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,400
papillomavirus vaccine, you take a yeast plasmid, which is just a small circular piece of DNA.

704
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,400
You clone into that the gene you're interested in, which as we've said now a million times on the

705
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,720
show, the coronavirus gene that codes for the coronavirus spike protein, you then sort of

706
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,200
transfect that into yeast cells, actually just common baker's yeast. And as the baker's yeast

707
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,520
reproduces itself, it also makes that protein, which you purify. In the case of flu block,

708
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,200
which looks like it's closer to the strategy that's being used by Sanofi GSK collaboration.

709
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,400
There what you do is you take basically an insect virus, so-called baculovirus. You clone into it

710
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,840
again the gene that you're interested in, the coronavirus spike protein gene, and then you

711
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,520
infect insect cells, and then that protein actually forms rosettes as it's excreted from the cell.

712
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,240
That's where you make flu block, which I actually got this year as my influenza vaccine. And I'm

713
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,640
still alive. That's quadrivalent? It's quadrivalent. So you mentioned obviously Sanofi GSK, that's

714
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,760
one of the big guns. They're not in phase three yet, are they? They're going to start that next

715
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:07,160
month? Novavax is the other one that does purified protein and carboxylic. And Novavax is in phase

716
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:14,600
three? That's what I heard. Yeah, but GSK Sanofi is next month for phase three. Novavax was enrolling

717
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,320
in November. They've started, and Sanofi was starting to roll in December, so it should be

718
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:25,720
soon. Is there anything about this approach that tends to go really wrong? Me not being a virologist

719
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:32,120
and not knowing much about vaccines, of the three approaches we've discussed so far, I guess the

720
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,440
four, because we've already alluded to what the fourth strategy is, which is a live attenuated

721
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,640
virus, the protein-based delivery seems the most benign. Is that necessarily true? I think that's

722
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,280
fair. It's just a purified protein. Certainly we have a lot of history, decades worth of history,

723
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,880
doing that approach successfully. If you look at Shingrix, which is again, a purified protein,

724
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,080
it's just one of the proteins from varicella zoster virus, that vaccine actually works better

725
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:04,840
than the live attenuated viral vaccine, zostavax, and essentially it's replaced zostavax. We basically

726
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,760
two years ago said, we're done. It's 100% switched to Shingrivax now. Shingrix rather, yeah. Which is

727
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,600
amazing. Typically historically, live attenuated viral vaccines always work better than a single

728
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,880
protein. The difference was the adjuvant. Shingrix has two powerful adjuvant. Which we separate,

729
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,080
I think, by six months or something? No, no, they're all part of that vaccine. One is monophosphorylobid A,

730
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:31,560
the other is the so-called QS21. That's all part of the varicella zoster virus,

731
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:37,720
glycoprotein E has these two adjuvants that are all part of the vaccine. Oh, I see. But we give

732
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,680
Shingrix in two, is the second one just a booster? You give two dose, right? It's the same thing. It's

733
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,640
contained the same. Understood. Okay. The adjuvant that's being used in a NovaVax product is actually

734
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,560
similar to the adjuvant in the Shingrix product. So you wonder if you had to take a guess, maybe

735
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,640
this would be the vaccine that would be best for older people because that vaccine works remarkably

736
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,440
well in older Shingrix. So this brings us to our fourth category then, which again, we've talked

737
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:06,600
about, which is these attenuated or live attenuated vaccines or inactivated vaccines. Now, this is

738
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,880
something where I think China has a number of products in the pipeline. I don't believe that

739
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,240
there is there a European or American counterpart in this space? Not that I know. It looks like all

740
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,240
the inactivated vaccines are coming out of China and they've done a lot with it. You could argue

741
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,920
that could be the first vaccine that is commercially available, if you will. The first one to have a

742
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,760
clear phase three trial, at least you should, for my understanding for how much many people have been

743
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:39,080
immunized in China already. So let's talk a little bit about some of the other things that

744
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:46,360
are going on here. I have to be honest, I'm very surprised. I think in March of this year,

745
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:52,280
I did not think it was plausible that there would be a vaccine on the market within a year. In fact,

746
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:58,040
I probably would have used the words impossible if you said to me in March, can there be a vaccine

747
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,640
in a year? And by the way, that wasn't just based on the financial thing. I mean, when I asked you

748
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:09,560
that question earlier, Paul, you alluded to how the government financially completely de-risked

749
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:15,000
the operation. And I won't diminish that in any way, shape or form. I just didn't think it was

750
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,960
going to be from a manufacturing standpoint possible enough to make enough GMP stuff at

751
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:27,960
volume and actually put it into clinical trials. I was like, there's no way, like there's no way

752
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,440
in 12 months we can get there. Well, it turns out I was wrong. We're probably going to have vaccines

753
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:38,840
on the market by January. So let's start with a question about genetic drift. What do we know

754
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,640
about how much the genome of this thing is moving? So it's a single strain in RNA virus.

755
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,800
And like all single strain in RNA viruses, its replication isn't terribly faithful or said

756
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,760
another way. It probably mutates to some extent every time it reproduces itself. The critical

757
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,960
question is, does it mutate in a manner that causes a functional change? And by functional change, I

758
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,760
mean more or less contagious or more or less virulent, or from the standpoint of the vaccine,

759
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,720
does it mutate away from the vaccine so that immunization or natural infection one year

760
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,880
doesn't protect you the following year, which is the influenza story. Influenza is also a single

761
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,640
stranded RNA virus segmented RNA virus. But meals is a single stranded RNA virus too, so is mumps.

762
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,360
And they have different genotypes, meaning that there is drift, as you say, to cause there to be

763
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,280
different strains. But never has measles really changed its serotype. So the vaccine that worked

764
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,800
in 1963 still works today. And so the question is, which of those is it going to be, this virus is

765
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,520
going to be influenza-like, or is it going to be measles-like? I'm going to predict. I'm happy to

766
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:45,880
make a series of predictions as long as you don't hold me to them. I would say that I'd be surprised

767
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,680
although the virus continues to surprise. It is going to be more than a single serotype disease.

768
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,840
In other words, that a vaccine that works now could well work next year and the year after that.

769
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,520
Let's just make sure everyone understands what you said, because you said a lot of interesting

770
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:05,560
and important stuff there. Single stranded RNA is, to put it mildly, a little sloppy. That means

771
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:11,480
every time this guy reproduces itself, it makes a little bit of a mistake. Sometimes those mistakes

772
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,080
don't mean anything. Sometimes they do. It's yet to be determined. There's two things at least that

773
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:22,840
matter with respect to the fidelity with which it can reproduce. One is, does it change the properties

774
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:29,160
of how the virus responds, either making it less toxic to us as humans or more toxic or pathogenic

775
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,800
to us as humans? I think it's definitely too early to say if that's happening one way or the other.

776
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,240
But the second property about its ability or inability to replicate itself perfectly is,

777
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:46,680
if it makes so many changes in its replication cycle, it might look so different year after year

778
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:54,360
after year that our immune system, even if able to maintain robust immune cells that recognize

779
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:00,520
the virus, may functionally be duped by it because it looks so different each year. That's why we get

780
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:06,360
flu shots every year and we get MMR once, even though they're both single stranded mRNA viruses.

781
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:12,600
You're basically saying if you had to guess, this is going to be between them. So it's not going to

782
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:18,040
be changing so dramatically every year that we would need to go through this exercise annually.

783
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,960
Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I'm going to predict actually it's going to be more measles-like,

784
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,920
that it's not going to drift in a manner that means that the vaccine no longer works.

785
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,720
That'll be my prediction, but I have been wrong about this virus before. The good news is, I mean,

786
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:37,400
I think we're getting to about a year on this thing. And I think the virus we're seeing today

787
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,480
does not look meaningfully different from that, which was identified in January. So hopefully

788
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:48,040
that speaks in your favor. Do we have a sense of how these vaccines are working at the real

789
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:54,680
molecular level? Obviously, we love to look at immunoglobulins as a proxy for immune response.

790
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:00,600
So, hey, this generated IgG and IgM. But there's been a lot of talk about the solubility of those

791
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,960
things. And are those immunoglobulins actually active? Just because they're present, do they

792
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:11,560
actually have the binding capacity to the virus to actually eradicate it? Of course, there's been a

793
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:19,000
lot of talk about T cells and how some people might be getting a less aggressive version of

794
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,400
COVID because perhaps they had some T cells that recognized a separate virus, a separate coronavirus

795
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,680
that they may have had six months sooner. What's your thinking or what's the latest thinking on

796
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,920
those hypotheses and ideas? This virus, SARS-CoV-2, is essentially a bat coronavirus that just reared

797
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:43,880
its head in Wuhan in the middle of November of last year, and now has swept across the world and

798
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,400
made its debut in the human population. We are infected with human coronaviruses all the time.

799
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,680
I mean, there are four strains of human coronaviruses that circulate. They were first

800
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:58,120
identified in the early 1960s, they're no doubt circulating well before that. They cause respiratory

801
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,160
infections, meaning congestion, cough, runny nose, occasionally more severe disease, pneumonia.

802
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,640
They account for probably about 15 to 20 percent of the diseases that we see in our emergency

803
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:13,240
department or in our hospital every year, and that's pretty much invariant. The question is,

804
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,360
because the human coronaviruses do share some similarity to this bat coronavirus, which is

805
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,760
recognized by so-called helper T cells, does your previous experience with human coronavirus,

806
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:27,480
which we pretty much all had, mean something to us in terms of protecting us against this virus?

807
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:32,840
I don't think so, is my sense of it. In terms of what works, I mean, I guess I'm very simplistic

808
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,400
on this based on my experiences with rotavirus. I think the trick is keeping the virus from binding

809
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,800
to cells. It's really the way the measles vaccine works, the mumps vaccine works, the bella vaccine

810
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,200
works, the varicella, the chickenpox vaccine works. If you can prevent the virus from binding to cells,

811
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:50,600
you can prevent the virus from entering cells. When you make antibodies, are those antibodies

812
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,960
directed against the so-called part of the spike protein, the receptor binding domain of the spike

813
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,120
protein that is neutralizing the virus? We want to neutralize the virus. You don't want to just

814
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:06,040
bind to the virus. You want to neutralize it so it can't attach to cells. That's the business end

815
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:11,400
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is that so-called receptor binding domain. That's the question.

816
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,840
The other question I think that people are worried about is that antibodies can fade

817
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,560
over time, even after natural infection. What does that mean for a vaccine if antibodies fade?

818
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,000
This is a little complicated, but when you're inoculated with a vaccine or when you're

819
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,320
naturally infected with a virus, it's not just that you make antibodies. You induce immunological

820
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:33,000
memory. You have memory B cells, the kind of cells that make antibodies or memory T cells.

821
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,760
They're sort of like the base of the iceberg with the antibodies being the tip of the iceberg.

822
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:42,840
Do they matter? They do matter, especially for longer incubation period diseases. For

823
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:46,840
really short incubation period diseases like rotavirus, meaning the time from when you're

824
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,840
infected to when you get sick, rotavirus, influenza, respiratory, sensitive virus,

825
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,840
those have short incubation periods. This is sort of a medium length incubation period,

826
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,920
around six, seven days. Measles is much longer, sort of 10 to 14 days. For longer incubation period

827
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:07,160
diseases, there's enough time then for activation and differentiation of memory cells to become in

828
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:11,800
the case of B cells, antibody secreting cells. It still would work. I think that's where we're

829
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,120
going to be. I think memory is important. When people talk to me about how nervous they are that

830
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:20,280
antibodies are fading, I'm not sure you should be nervous about it yet. Let's wait to see what

831
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,840
happens as we move forward with these vaccines. Yeah, I think that's a great point, Paul. I think

832
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,320
there's really two points you made there that speak to that. The first is it's not antibodies

833
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,560
that probably matter. It's neutralizing antibodies. Frankly, we don't have commercial tests for that.

834
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:40,520
I don't know how much it matters that your serology test that's measuring IgG and IgM levels over time

835
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:46,920
is changing when that's not actually or certainly not necessarily the thing that we care about. We

836
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:52,760
care about neutralizing antibodies, not antibodies. Your second point is just spot on, which is

837
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:57,000
unless somebody is sampling bone marrow, looking for B cells that have memory,

838
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:04,920
again, maybe this doesn't matter. If there's one upside to having the long incubation period,

839
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,320
which has allowed this silly virus to replicate like crazy and spread around the world,

840
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:15,400
at least it's that the immune system gets some chance to rev up against it. I guess I always

841
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,800
think of it that way. Biology usually takes something and gives something. It's like

842
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:25,800
if this thing had no time between when you were infected and when you got sick, you probably get

843
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,560
sicker because you wouldn't have any of that memory response, but at least it would have been

844
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:34,520
contained or have the opposite problem. That's a glass half full way to look at this, I suppose.

845
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,200
Let me offer one thing just as hopeful because as you get older, you get sort of grimmer,

846
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,440
but I'm going to try and offer some hopeful thing. It appears that especially in men,

847
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,440
there were two papers in Science that showed that when you're infected with this virus, SARS-CoV-2,

848
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,480
that you can actually make antibodies directed against interferon, which is a protein that your

849
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,280
body's immune system makes to help fight viruses. That's where the name comes from. It interferes

850
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,680
with the ability of virus to infect cells. The thinking is that that may be one reason why men

851
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:06,120
are more likely to suffer and die from this disease than others. This offers hope for the fact that a

852
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,600
vaccine may be better than natural infection because it's unlikely that the vaccine would do

853
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,520
that. There certainly are examples of vaccines that are better than natural infection. This may

854
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,240
be one of them. There's some reasons for hope here. Do you see any differences in male versus

855
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,720
female and vaccine or do you think no? I mean, there's nothing that has been published to date

856
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:28,920
that has suggested a gender disparity between this. No, as a general, men tend to die and

857
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:35,640
boys tend to die at a greater frequency than girls for most infectious disease. We are the weaker

858
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:41,080
sex. Or as Murphy Brown used to say, that silly little Y chromosome. Do you think that's a response

859
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:47,000
to a greater cytokine response or what do you think accounts for that difference? I'm not sure.

860
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,400
Even when we age match and we match for morbidity, we don't know why. We're the weaker sex. Let's

861
01:12:53,400 --> 01:13:00,600
admit it. Bit off topic, blood type. There was a lot of talk earlier about anti-A antibodies

862
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,280
potentially being a little bit protective. Do we have more data on that? I hadn't seen it.

863
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,760
Having type O blood would be some level protective because you can make antibodies to A or B types.

864
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,880
I think I would still put that in the hypothesis unproven category.

865
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:23,800
Do we have any data on the robustness of the immunologic response, at least based on phase

866
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:30,680
two metrics in different demographics, starting with young versus old, obese versus non-obese,

867
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:35,560
or some other metric where it's going to matter? Because at some level, there's going to need to

868
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:41,720
be some rationing of this. It's not like vaccine gets approved on Wednesday and on Thursday,

869
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:47,160
300 million copies of the vaccine show up to everybody's doctor. Whether we like it or not,

870
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,200
there's a slow roll and a partition to how this happens. What do we know about it in that sense,

871
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,880
in terms of how people are responding to it and who's most vulnerable and who should be getting it?

872
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,480
Both the National Academy of Medicine and the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices at

873
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:04,600
the CDC have come up with their first-year group, but it's huge. The first-year group includes

874
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:09,320
healthcare workers. It also includes other essential personnel like people who work in

875
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,200
mass transportation or grocery stores or pharmacies or work in law enforcement or

876
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,480
water purification. That includes people over 65 who, when they get infected, are more likely to die.

877
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,240
And it includes people with certain high-risk medical conditions like obesity, which is probably

878
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:31,400
30% of the American population, and diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, et cetera.

879
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:37,400
If you add that all up, it adds up to about 150 million adults, which is half the adult population

880
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,640
in the United States, which who are going to require a two-dose vaccine, which is already

881
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:47,160
300 million doses, and that's not going to happen immediately. So how do you partition that? I don't

882
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:52,120
know. I mean, I'm on this Commonwealth of Pennsylvania group that tries to make decisions

883
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:56,520
like that. I'm on our hospital group to try and make decisions like that. I think it's going to be

884
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,480
a real learning curve that's associated with how this rolls out.

885
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:04,120
What are we prepared to do about that? Is this going to produce social unrest? It sounds crazy,

886
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,920
but have we ever experienced something like this from a healthcare delivery standpoint?

887
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,560
No. I mean, this is a virus that's killed 230,000 people. So this may be sort of like the end of the

888
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,040
movie Contagion, where people are like breaking down doors trying to get a vaccine. We're vaccines.

889
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:23,720
We're the hero of that story. I think there is going to have to at some level be a rationing

890
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:28,280
in terms of who gets what and how it's going to be done. And I don't know.

891
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:34,760
It's really complicated, right? So Moderna is basically the NIH, Pfizer, J&J, AstraZeneca,

892
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:41,240
and Oxford. I mean, these companies have presumably never been in a situation to have to say,

893
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:46,680
here's where this shipment goes to this pharmacy versus that pharmacy or this city versus that

894
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:52,200
city. I mean, not to dwell too long on a seemingly strange question, but we're not that far from when

895
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,360
this is going to happen. We're only a couple months away from that potentially.

896
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,600
So it's the Department of Defense that's going to take the lead at Operation Warp Speed for

897
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,400
determining where these vaccines get distributed, but they'll be distributed to the states.

898
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,320
And then the states, I think, will decide how to sort of apportion that. It's my sense of it.

899
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,720
The CDC initially had sort of four states in one city, which was Philadelphia, actually,

900
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:19,080
to try and do kind of this test program for how it would be distributed. Now, Pfizer is not an

901
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:24,760
Operation Warp Speed vaccine. So they may have a different distribution strategy. But I think

902
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,240
you're right. It's going to be a real challenge plus it's a two dose vaccine. Plus, it means you

903
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,040
have to get people back for the second dose. And it's going to, some of these vaccines are going

904
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:36,760
to be stored at minus 70. It's going to be really a challenge to see how we get it out there. I mean,

905
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,160
we had one issue in our hospital, which was easily resolved, which was should we mandate the vaccine

906
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:45,480
for hospital workers? No. One, for the practical reason, that we probably won't have a lot of

907
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:50,360
vaccine. And two, I think that with the novel vaccine strategy, like messenger RNA or these

908
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,440
replication-effective viruses, I don't think you really can fairly mandate that. I think you really

909
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,720
should wait till it's out there a little more. There's going to be plenty of people who are going

910
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:01,880
to be perfectly willing to take these vaccines. And then we'll have a few million doses out there

911
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,480
and we'll have a better sense of things. Maurice Hillman, who I consider the father of modern

912
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:10,520
vaccines, having either done the primary research or development on nine of the 14 that we use,

913
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,000
said it best. He said, quote, I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first three million

914
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,400
doses are out there. So we'll see. Personal question. Would you take the vaccine right now?

915
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:26,360
Not until I see the data. Good news, I'm on the FDA vaccine advisory board. So I will see the data.

916
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,640
And if I feel confident that the safety issues look good, issues look good for people my age. I

917
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:37,640
mean, I'm over 65. I want to feel I'm adequately represented in these trials. At a sample size of

918
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:45,720
30,000 of which, let's say a third of them are over 65, with 10,000 people over 65 having no

919
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:51,160
adverse effects in three months make you feel comfortable enough to take it? I think it would,

920
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,640
okay. And I'm going to point something else out to the listener who can't see you.

921
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:02,440
You at least look to my eye as a very healthy 65 year old. You look like you're about 55. You're

922
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:08,040
not overweight. I assume you don't have diabetes. You look like a model of health. So are you really

923
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:14,040
that high risk aside from your age? And if so, why are you taking it? Just my age. Okay. So do you

924
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:21,640
still believe that age by itself is enough of a predictor of morbidity beyond the obvious

925
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,600
comorbidities that tend to track with age that presumably at least, let's just assume you don't

926
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,200
have them yet. Not that I'm asking you to disclose any medical things, but you're about as healthy as

927
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,280
65 year old as there's going to be out there. I would take it not because I necessarily think

928
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:39,720
I'm going to die from this virus. It's because I think that way I feel between taking a vaccine

929
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,520
and wearing a mask and social distancing, I dramatically decrease having to suffer this

930
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,760
virus. I mean the virus, yes, it's a killer and yes, it can cause pneumonia, which can kill you.

931
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,480
What scares me the most about this virus is that it can cause vasculitis. I mean,

932
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:58,120
who would have predicted that? It causes this multi system inflammatory disease of children

933
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,000
and it can affect, it cause heart attacks and cause strokes. It can cause liver or kidney disease

934
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,720
because it causes vasculitis. So why does it cause vasculitis? It doesn't really enter the bloodstream

935
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,760
and fewer than 1% of people infected with this virus have so-called viremia. So it induces your

936
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,080
immune response to damage endothelial cells that line blood vessels. And because every organ in

937
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,480
your body has a blood supply, every organ can be affected. I mean, the so-called long haulers,

938
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:26,280
at least in part, are probably determined by a vasculitis, maybe even at low level.

939
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,520
That's what scares me about this. This is not a virus that just gets in, kills you and gets out,

940
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,520
or gets in, makes you sick and gets out. There are longer term effects with this virus and it

941
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,680
should be taken seriously. I mean, I think when the administration occasionally says things like

942
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:43,880
you need to embrace this virus or live with this kind of notion that the virus would eliminate

943
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:49,000
itself by population-induced immunity, which has never happened for a virus before, I think they

944
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,840
sort of ignore the fact about the long-term issues of this particular virus. This isn't flu.

945
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:59,000
I think of all the sort of lingering tail events of this virus, the one that probably concerns me

946
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,880
the most is some of the cardiomyopathy that we're seeing persist in, especially in young people,

947
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:09,800
on a personal level. I've just had to strike a balance between living my life, but still trying

948
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:15,800
not to be reckless. And to me, that's a really bad outcome, right? Is the probability that I'm

949
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:22,920
going to die from this low? Yeah, it's staggeringly low, but there's some risk that I can't quantify

950
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:29,160
of cardiomyopathy or some lingering respiratory thing that never fully resolves that impairs

951
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:36,440
quality of life. I guess the real question is just the trade-off between how efficacious in the real

952
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:40,600
world, and therefore, I guess effective is the better word, do I think this vaccine is relative

953
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:46,680
to what other risks? I think what I'm hearing from you that I actually find heartening is at least

954
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:53,320
using history as a guide within a few months of this vaccine coming out and entering the real

955
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:58,360
world, which we can think of as phase four. We'll think of that as post-market surveillance phase

956
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:05,000
four. We're going to have a pretty good sense of it. And most of us listening to this podcast are

957
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,640
not going to be the guys getting it on day one, just due to the simple logistics of it. Like,

958
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,680
I'm not going to be in the first million doses of this vaccine. You aren't going to be in the first

959
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,560
million doses of this vaccine. There are people, frankly, who are at much higher risk that deserve

960
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:24,280
to be there, and I guess we'll have a better sense of it. But I think that this discussion,

961
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,920
for me, Paul, is also interesting because it really frames the four different types of

962
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:34,600
strategies that one can go about doing this, who the players are and what the risks are potentially

963
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:40,440
in each of them, and why maybe a Sanofi product ultimately might end up being safer than, say,

964
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:44,120
a J&J product. The devil's in the details. The only thing that's going to matter is,

965
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,480
hey, how do these things look six months after they've been on the market?

966
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,560
The other thing I wanted to ask you about is, is there ever going to be a time when we're

967
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:58,440
going to be immunizing children against this virus? What do we know today about kids getting

968
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,720
infected by this? We know the children are less likely to be infected, and when they're infected,

969
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:08,680
are less severely infected. People less than 21 years of age in the United States

970
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:15,960
make up about 26% of the population, yet they account for 0.08% of the deaths. That said,

971
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,760
about 120, at least the last morbidity mortality weekly report, showed that about 120 children had

972
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,080
died from COVID-19. That's not very different than the number of children that died from

973
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,840
influenza last year, which was around 140. That's what it usually is, around anywhere, 140, 150,

974
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:39,240
160 in that area. It's no more or less fatal than influenza for children. Two, it can cause long-term

975
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,440
problems in children with the so-called MISC disease of children. I think there isn't a compelling

976
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:50,360
desire to make a vaccine for children. How to do that? Now, all the trials initially were done,

977
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:54,760
and people over 18. We weren't studying children initially. Now, recently Pfizer dropped the age to

978
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,280
16, and then they dropped the age to 12, so they're starting to look at younger people.

979
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,720
The question is then, what happens, and this applies broadly, what happens if a vaccine is

980
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,880
approved through EUA? Pfizer has already said if that happens for them, they're going to start to

981
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,760
immunize their control group, which means now you lose information about safety and efficacy

982
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,480
moving forward. Why is that, Paul? Is that basically as a thank you to the control group,

983
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,640
and basically a crossover? Look at what that does. From a scientific standpoint,

984
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:26,680
you just lost your test case, but what is the rationale for doing that? I think it's a thank

985
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:30,040
you for being, and that may have been part of the deal when they signed up for the trial. I don't

986
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,760
know. Yeah, got it. Okay. To get to the children, this could be done in one of two ways. It could

987
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:39,720
be done as a placebo-controlled trial. It's the same way we do adults. Where it could be done is

988
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,400
immunobridging studies, meaning that you actually find out there is an immunological correlative

989
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:47,720
protection in adults, that it is a certain level of neutralizing antibodies that's evoked,

990
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:52,120
and that if you give to children a certain dose, that you find that you get that level of neutralizing

991
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,200
antibodies, and so then you just move forward. Then you look retrospectively, because not all

992
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:00,360
children will be inoculated at the moment that you start inoculating children. You can see whether

993
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,920
or not it's... It's basically the same way that it worked with the Ebola vaccine. That wasn't a

994
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:09,080
prospective placebo-controlled trial in West Africa. People just started getting vaccine,

995
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,360
and because not everybody got it at once, you could get a sense of effectiveness

996
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:16,920
by knowing who got the vaccine and who didn't. That may be it. When we had the FDA vaccine

997
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,320
advisory committee meeting on October 22nd, the FDA was very clear about this, that when you

998
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,560
approve something under emergency use authorization, which is the same sort of permission you would

999
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,040
give to an investigation of new drug, you were really under no ethical obligation to vaccinate

1000
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:35,400
a placebo group. You aren't. Nor are you under an ethical obligation to no longer do placebo-controlled

1001
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,800
trials. Now, I'm not sure how that's going to play out. You can see, for example, if somebody is

1002
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:44,440
70 years old, they see that this vaccine works, and they were in the placebo group, they can say,

1003
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:50,440
I want this vaccine. What the FDA has argued for is why not just make it an expanded access issue,

1004
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,800
or extended access, which used to be called compassionate use access, but do it that way.

1005
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,800
I think that may be the way this plays out. I don't think I'm making a bold prediction by

1006
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,960
saying I think the first vaccines may not be the last best vaccines, but you have to know that you

1007
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,560
have the last best vaccines. You have to know that down the line there may be a vaccine that's 90%

1008
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,520
effective. And you can't know that unless you do it as a placebo trial. And again, if you're going

1009
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:17,160
to do it with the other vaccine as a trial, the thing that would require a huge trial, I mean,

1010
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:23,720
really, you'd be hard to prove it. You actually wrote an interesting paper this summer about the

1011
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:32,120
role of fever in fighting infection in children. I was really surprised at the results. And I got

1012
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:37,480
to tell you, it's kind of changing the way I think about how much Tylenol I kick around the house.

1013
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,640
You want to talk a little bit about what that paper showed while we're on the topic of kids?

1014
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,480
Right. You actually wrote a book called Overkill When Modern Medicine Goes Too Far. And that's the

1015
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:50,760
first chapter in defensive fever. That treating fever can prolong or worsen illnesses. And the

1016
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,800
reason is, is that pretty much everything that walks, crawls, flies, or swims on the planet

1017
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,240
can make fever. Why do we do that? We do it because our immune system actually works better

1018
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,320
at a higher temperature. It's not because viruses or bacteria die more quickly at a higher

1019
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:10,120
temperature. It's because your immune system works better. B cells make antibodies more efficiently.

1020
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,840
Nutri-fills or white blood cells that form pus can travel to areas where bacteria are and kill

1021
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,000
bacteria more efficiently. So if that's true, if your immune system works better at a higher

1022
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,200
temperature, then are there studies done showing that people who are given anti-fevir medicines

1023
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:30,600
like Tylenol or ibuprofen, do they do worse? And the answer is redundantly yes. And in the world of

1024
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,960
vaccines, when people choose to treat fever with anti-fevir medicines when they've gotten a vaccine,

1025
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,360
you have a lesser immune response. I mean, over and over again, this has been shown,

1026
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,280
yet we just can't help ourselves because we want people to feel better or we want ourselves to feel

1027
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:49,240
better. But know this, that you are hurting one part of your immune system when you do that.

1028
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:54,600
Is there a danger at some point, Paul, of kids having fevers when the temperatures get too high?

1029
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,640
I mean, I always feel like that's the one thing that scared the hell out of medical students or

1030
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:04,280
residents was you'd see those kids with febrile seizures. And so you have that image in the back

1031
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:09,240
of your mind of that kid in the ER that's seizing. And then God forbid they go on to have some

1032
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,240
neurologic consequence. And so you're sort of hardwired to think, well, God forbid I'm ever going to

1033
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:18,040
let a child have a fever again. What's the risk of that? And at what temperature is that something

1034
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:23,000
that a parent needs to be aware of? So so-called febrile seizures are benign. I mean, my daughter

1035
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,760
actually had a febrile seizure. They're generally short-lived. They don't have long list of sequelae.

1036
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,600
And it's not the height of the temperature. It's the rapid rise in temperature that causes that.

1037
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,080
So it's not the height. For the most part, I'm saying most of it, I think physiological fevers

1038
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,240
don't cause harm. Your body is not interested in hurting you in that way. Now, environmental

1039
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:44,040
fevers can. Heat stroke. I mean, the laborer or the athlete or the soldier who's out there in heavy

1040
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:49,720
gear and on a hot day and is not able to dissipate heat through sweating, they can suffer strokes. I

1041
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,920
mean, it's, you know, you can die from heat strokes. In fact, about 600 people die from

1042
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,640
heat strokes every year. So environmental fevers can do that, but not physiological fevers. So again,

1043
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:02,280
I think you jump with the net, it's just very hard to watch this. A case accident in a hospital,

1044
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:08,040
the boy, the soccer player was hit on the hip. He had a clot in a vein, so-called thrombosis,

1045
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:12,600
and then had that got infected, so-called thrombophlebitis with staph, the MRSA, the

1046
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,840
sort of hard to treat staph, traveled to his brain and cause absces, traveled to his lungs and

1047
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,920
cause absces, and grabbed his bone and joint and cause absces. We were treating with an antibiotic,

1048
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:25,480
bank of mice that should have treated that, but he was continually positive, had blood cultures

1049
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:30,200
that continued to so he was shedding bacteria. And every day, every two hours, we were rotating,

1050
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,640
you know, either Tylenol or Ibuprofen. Finally, I met with the boy, I met with the parents,

1051
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:39,080
I met with the nurses, I said, stop treating his fever. Just give his body a chance to have every

1052
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,240
part of his immune system working for him. And then within really about a day and a half,

1053
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:46,840
there's no longer shedding bacteria. That may have been completely coincident, so it's not a

1054
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:50,600
proof in any sense. But you couldn't convince the parents of that. They thought we were geniuses

1055
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:55,000
by doing it that way. Give his immune system a chance to work as good as it can. Why cripple

1056
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,640
his neutrophils ability to ingest and kill bacteria by giving him anti-fever medicines?

1057
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,640
We think we're helping. Is there any scenario then, Paul, in which, I mean, that's a pretty

1058
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,800
compelling case. Is there any scenario under which you would recommend taking something like Tylenol?

1059
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:12,680
I think if somebody cannot handle the metabolic strain of increase of, I mean, because you increase

1060
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:17,800
your basal metabolic rate at a certain percentage for every degree centigrade increase in your fever.

1061
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:23,000
It's like 12% increase in BMI for every degree centigrade. So if you have chronic lung disease,

1062
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,240
chronic heart disease, metabolic disease that makes you unable to handle that rise of temperature,

1063
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:32,920
sure, I think that's the reason. But otherwise, no. Wow. So suffer it out, huh?

1064
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,560
Yeah, that's that boy. I love this boy. He was a teenager, a young teenager, and he was just

1065
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,360
brave. He was, okay, fine. Everybody was in. We were going to do this thing. And nurses were in,

1066
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,400
we were going to ride it out. And then he did it better.

1067
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:50,280
All right. Last thing I want to say on vaccines, just to close the loop on this, are there viruses

1068
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:57,080
besides the obvious like HIV, and even hep C, I guess, where just vaccinating them is either

1069
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:02,040
impossible or outright dangerous? I mean, there was something about RSV, which we've talked a

1070
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:07,560
little bit about that. I mean, RSV is really common, but there's no vaccine to RSV. Is that

1071
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,280
just that it's not cost effective? Or was there sort of a more technical issue with it or a risk

1072
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,640
associated with creating vaccine towards it? The more technical issue of creating a vaccine,

1073
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:22,520
there were two events that occurred in the 1960s. One was with RSV, where Bob Chanek,

1074
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:27,320
head of the laboratory of infectious diseases at NIH, wanted to make an RSV vaccine. This is a

1075
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,400
virus that causes pneumonia. It causes about 5,000 deaths every year in the United States,

1076
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:36,840
primarily in young children, especially premature children, babies. So let's make an RSV vaccine.

1077
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,000
He took the virus, grew it up, and activated it with formaldehyde, the same way that Jonas Salk

1078
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,680
made his polio vaccine, and then gave it to babies. And what he found was that children

1079
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,760
who got that vaccine did worse. They were more likely, when they were then exposed to the natural

1080
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,920
virus, they were more likely to develop pneumonia, more likely to be hospitalized, in the case of two

1081
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,160
children, more likely to die than children who never got that vaccine. Same thing happened with

1082
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:02,840
the measles vaccine in 1963. Take the virus, grow it up, purify it, kill it with formaldehyde.

1083
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:08,840
That too caused children to have an aberrant immune response directed against that measles

1084
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,280
virus that causes atypical pneumonia. So they were more likely to get pneumonia than children

1085
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:16,200
who were never vaccinated. That was ultimately taken off the market. The reason that may be

1086
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:21,640
relevant to today, to SARS-CoV-2 today, is that both of those viruses, respiratory,

1087
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,560
syncytial virus, and measles have a fusion protein. That's how it attaches to cells,

1088
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,960
it fuses to cells. So does SARS-CoV-2. It has a fusion protein. So people are always a little

1089
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,360
nervous about an inactivated vaccine. And it's because you sort of change the confirmation of

1090
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:38,920
that protein, that SARS-CoV-2 protein, so it didn't really look like it looked on the natural

1091
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,080
virus. So that's always in the back of people's minds with fusion proteins. So you asked me

1092
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,080
earlier what sort of safety things I'm worried about. That actually is one of the safety things.

1093
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:52,680
And that would be more of a concern, I'm guessing, with the live attenuated virus as opposed to the

1094
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:59,080
other three classes, or would you still worry about that in the mRNA and the viral vector viruses?

1095
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,720
I worry about it with all of them. You worry that the confirmation as made under these conditions,

1096
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:09,720
mRNA or DNA or replication defective virus, or whole-kill virus, or recombinant DNA generated

1097
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,400
proteins, that it's different, it's critically different than the way it sits on the virus

1098
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:19,960
surface. Paul, this is an unbelievably fascinating discussion. I'm glad I waited on this. You and I

1099
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,920
were going to speak a couple of months ago. Obviously, for so long, I've wanted to have a

1100
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,320
deep dive on the vaccine stuff. But I feel like this was the right time to do it, at least to be

1101
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,640
able to speak about it with more clarity and to really be able to say, look, by the time someone's

1102
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:38,360
hearing this, we're really on the cusp of these vaccines being out there in early 21.

1103
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:43,800
But it's not a switch. It's not a binary thing. It's not like we're going from no vaccines to

1104
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:49,560
everybody gets vaccines, and there's perfect information, and there's no risk. This is analog

1105
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:56,520
in delivery, analog in risk. I mean, it's analog in pretty much everything other than approval.

1106
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,120
Yeah, I think we're going to learn a lot. Thanks for asking me. I enjoy this, really. I don't think

1107
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,440
I've ever done a podcast this long, but it was definitely fun. And the fact that I thought when

1108
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,520
you said two hours, I thought, oh my God, two hours, I'm going to live through this. It really flew.

1109
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:14,440
Just surprising. Well, I appreciate your time and your willingness to sit down for so long, Paul.

1110
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:18,680
My pleasure. Thanks for your time. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.

1111
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:23,080
If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership

1112
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:28,360
program that allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads.

1113
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,000
It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription. Now,

1114
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,280
to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive

1115
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:44,120
podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word

1116
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:50,440
on the street is, nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes,

1117
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:55,480
hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to

1118
01:33:55,480 --> 01:34:00,840
hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super

1119
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,320
short podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions,

1120
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:10,440
topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

1121
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,360
