00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,360
Hey, everyone.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,320
Welcome to this week's edition of The Drive.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,320
Our guest this week is Sam Harris, someone I consider a friend, a mentor, a teacher.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,200
I met Sam about four years ago, and I suspect many of you already know about Sam or are

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,600
familiar with his work, but in case you're not, let me say a few words on that.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Sam trained in neuroscience.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,440
He has a PhD in neuroscience, but in many ways I consider him a philosopher and frankly,

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,000
just one of the greatest minds that I know.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,040
He's an author of some extraordinary books, The End of Faith Being His First, The Moral

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,280
Landscape, Lying, Free Will, and probably my favorite, which you've also probably heard

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,180
me talk about, is Waking Up, a book that I've read, I think, three times now, and I'm almost

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,680
at the point where I understand half of it.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,360
Sam is also the host of arguably, I would say, the most important podcast to me, The

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,200
Waking Up podcast, and he is also the creator of an app for meditation called, appropriately,

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Waking Up.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,120
I had the privilege of beta testing it for about nine months before it went live, and

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,280
it is now officially live, and for anyone who meditates, I would consider this an essential

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,160
part of your meditation app routine.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,400
You've probably heard me talk a lot about this in the past few months, the importance

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,240
of distress tolerance, mindfulness, the ability to understand what's going on inside our own

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,320
heads as a tool to be less unhappy.

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,880
That might sound kind of blah, but the reality of it is I've never spent more time thinking

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,680
about this than I have in probably the last 12 to 18 months, and Sam has been such an

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,640
important part of helping me think about that.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
This podcast is pretty long.

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,200
It's almost three hours.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
In that time, we go into a lot of this stuff.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm pretty open about how much Sam has helped me.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,920
Though I think at times it turns into more of a discussion than an interview, I think

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,280
we always veer back to the place where you as the listener are going to get something

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
out of this.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,920
If you're not familiar with Sam, I can't encourage you enough to listen to this podcast.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,160
If it piques your curiosity, dig a little bit deeper into this.

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,960
A couple of housekeeping items, obviously we're going to release this today instead

47
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,200
of the day before Christmas, so this is coming out a bit early.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,560
Over the next week or so, we haven't quite figured out the schedule yet, but don't worry,

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,400
we'll be back to our regular schedule in January.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,640
If you haven't already done so and you're interested, please sign up for our weekly

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,480
email that's on the site, www.peteratiamd.com.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,960
Somewhere on there, there'll be a little place to prompt you to sign up for that.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,160
If you don't like it, just unsubscribe.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,960
We also have great show notes, which everybody keeps raving about, and I'm really proud of

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,560
our team for the work they do.

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,120
To be clear, don't do any of that work, but I like that people are spending time on them,

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,400
especially when it comes to following up on all of the nuances and details that we go

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
to.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Finally, if you're enjoying this podcast, please go to Apple Podcast Reviews and leave

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,360
the favorable review.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,000
If you are not enjoying it and you feel so inclined to leave a review, please do so,

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,600
but try to be as constructive as possible because it's a lot easier to course correct

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,680
if it's constructive than if you just tell me it sucks.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Without anything further to say, here's my guest, Sam Harris.

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,040
Well, Sam, thanks so much for making time today.

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
It's a pleasure.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm coming to someone else's studio to record.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Yeah, well, you're getting the game long enough.

70
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
This is the way it happens.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,040
Well, I really appreciate it.

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,680
There's so much I want to talk about today, but I also want to be thoughtful about pulling

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,440
out threads that I think are most valuable to people I take care of.

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,200
In many ways, that's sort of an undercurrent of what I like to talk about on podcasts,

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,080
is things that I can then share with my patients and things like that.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,760
I don't know if you remember this, but almost a year ago, I emailed you and said,

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,120
hey, man, do you have time to talk?

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,880
And you said, yeah.

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,440
And it was like, actually, I know when it was, it was right after Christmas.

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
It was like the day after Christmas.

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,640
Yeah, it was the 26th of December.

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,480
And I said, I want to talk with you about mindfulness meditation.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,200
And you said, great.

84
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,680
And we hopped on.

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
I called, do you remember this discussion?

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,720
Yeah, I think I remember the one you're referencing.

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,880
So I had had a very profound experience.

88
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,640
And prior to that, I had been somewhat familiar, I think,

89
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,520
would be the most generous way of saying it, but somewhat familiar with meditation,

90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,520
primarily focusing on concentration-based meditations, like mantra-based practice.

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
But I'd just come back from basically a rehab facility where you were sort of out

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
in the middle of nowhere.

93
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
You had no electronics.

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,760
You weren't even allowed to have books or anything like that.

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,560
And you were really sort of stripped down into, I guess, what could only be viewed

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,400
as sort of your most fundamental basic elements of self.

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,120
And I had an epiphany about 10 days into that, which was I realized at the time

98
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,920
what must be the first moment in my life that I was present.

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,800
And it's weird to be almost 45 at the time and to think, wow, here I am,

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,480
10 days of having every stimulus removed from my life,

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,680
plus going through this very rigorous sort of therapeutic stuff.

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
And I remember exactly where I was sitting.

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,560
I was sitting in the common room of this place at the edge of a couch.

104
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,240
And in a moment, the only thing that mattered was exactly what I was perceiving

105
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,240
around me, so the light coming in through the window and the way in which it made

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,160
the room sort of light up, the faint scent of something that was being cooked

107
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,400
in the kitchen, a few yards away or whatever.

108
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,120
And I don't know why.

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,600
I just felt like, wow, this is the first time I actually really think I'm not

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,200
thinking about something that has happened or worrying about something that

111
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,520
is going to happen.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,600
And the other thing that was odd that entire time I was there was they allowed

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
us to exercise, which was a big deal.

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,480
I was really pleased that I was still permitted to exercise.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
But you couldn't have music.

116
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,840
You didn't have a phone or anything.

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,680
So it was also the first time in my life I exercised only being able to listen

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,040
to the sound of my breath.

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,040
So every morning I would run in the woods and you just heard the sound of the

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,320
wind blowing by you and you heard your breath.

121
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,240
And when I was doing pushups or whatever, it was the same sort of thing.

122
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,200
And of course, I'd already read so much of your work.

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,840
But the reason I wanted to speak with you that day is I wanted to understand, hey,

124
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,640
am I getting a glimpse of what one might get if they move to a mindfulness-based

125
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
practice?

126
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,800
And what you said was, well, there's good news and bad news.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,160
The good news is I've got this app that's going to be coming out soon and it's

128
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,760
going to help you with this.

129
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,480
The bad news is it's only in beta yet, but you can start right away.

130
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,360
There's only, you know, I think at the time there may be a dozen meditations.

131
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,440
And the very bad news is going to take years for me to produce this thing.

132
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm completely incompetent.

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,440
No, but come on.

134
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,680
The thing actually is out now.

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah.

136
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,600
I know it was a little longer than you wanted, but yeah.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,760
And I very quickly put as many of my patients who were interested on the beta

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,800
version, you guys were so gracious and let all of my my my folks on this thing.

139
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,840
And in many ways, I view that as one of the most important transitions of my life.

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,000
I think of, you know, life is a handful of direction changes that, you know, some

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,640
of them that you look back at the past and say, wow, that was sort of a meaningful

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
insight that came to me.

143
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,640
So you've talked about this idea of noticing what is arising versus not

144
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
noticing at all.

145
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,760
Can you elaborate on this?

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah.

147
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,360
Well, so I guess I should define mindfulness, which is really the the target

148
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,320
state that one is trying to cultivate in at least this probably what's the most

149
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,960
popular type of meditation now.

150
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,560
I mean, they're different as you alluded to, they're different types.

151
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,040
They're two basic types of meditation where the distinction is between being

152
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,160
lost in thought and being clearly aware of whatever the object of meditation is.

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
So that's true for all types of meditation.

154
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,320
Thought really is the the obstacle one is overcoming when one is learning to

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,000
meditate because our natural, our default mode is to just be lost in thought.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,720
We're telling ourselves a story all day long and we're not aware of it.

157
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,000
So once one begins to meditate, one is trying to pay attention to something.

158
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
And this is where the two different types diverge.

159
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
The first that you alluded to the like a mantra based or a concentration based

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:03,360
object of focus is the attempt to pay attention to one thing to the exclusion

161
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,080
of everything else.

162
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,280
Right.

163
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,360
You want your attention to be absorbed in that object.

164
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,280
And in many of those practices, the explicit goal is to do that so well that

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,000
thoughts no longer arise.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,280
Right.

167
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,880
So you're really trying to get rid of thought in some basic sense.

168
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,320
So the arising of thought in that context is a sign that you're not meditating hard

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,800
enough or one pointedly enough.

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,000
Those types of practices can produce extraordinarily positive states of mind

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,240
that you can feel bliss and rapture.

172
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,080
And you can actually use as an object of meditation specific states of mind, like

173
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,560
loving kindness, which is called Metta in the Buddhist tradition or sympathetic joy

174
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,120
or compassion or equanimity.

175
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,160
You can cultivate specific attitudes, which if you can focus on them to the exclusion of

176
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,040
anything else, you're inhabiting that state to a degree that most people would find

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
unrecognizable.

178
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,080
But the second type of meditation, which is the type I have spent much more time doing

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:16,560
and is almost universally considered the more fundamental or the deeper practice, is often

180
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,800
described as mindfulness because that's the state you're using in the Buddhist tradition

181
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,080
to cultivate it.

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,560
Mindfulness comes from a practice called Vipassana, which is insight meditation.

183
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
And there you are.

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,640
You're not trying to selectively notice one thing or another.

185
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,320
You are trying to break the spell of being distracted by thought.

186
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,800
So you're trying to be aware of everything without perceiving things through this

187
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,840
discursivity or this conceptual lens in each moment.

188
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,600
But your attention can be much more choiceless.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,840
I mean, you can just notice whatever, in fact, you notice.

190
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,440
You're noticing things all the time, sounds and sensations and moods and thoughts, but you're not

191
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,320
noticing them clearly because you are you are thinking every moment of the day.

192
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,680
Mindfulness begins for most people as a training on one object like the breath.

193
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,680
But very quickly, it becomes something that you apply to the full range of your experience.

194
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,400
And what's nice about it, apart from all the the benefits of doing it and all the things that can

195
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:36,720
be realized by doing it, this type of meditation is clearly coincident with any experience you can

196
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,480
have. I mean, there's nothing that is excluded in principle from the meditation.

197
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,520
You can be working out or watching a movie.

198
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,920
I mean, there's no there's no thing that in principle does not admit of mindfulness.

199
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,000
And that's not true of other types of practice.

200
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Yeah, just sharing one example, because the other thing that I remember you said at the time, I said,

201
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,760
you know, Sam, I want to really shift this practice and sort of I want to figure out a way to

202
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
experience that more and more.

203
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,240
And you actually said, look, there are a bunch of apps that are already out there that are all

204
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,760
pretty good. I mean, obviously, you're producing yours because you think it's going to offer

205
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,680
something additional. And I'll just make my plug for it here.

206
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,360
I've used every one of the apps out there and I do find yours the best.

207
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,320
But I also realize that there's no one thing that's the best.

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,800
It's the way you explain things just resonates with me and it might not resonate with the next

209
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,640
person. But the other app that I really liked that you recommended was 10 percent happier, which is

210
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,160
Dan Harris's app. No, no, no relation, of course.

211
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,960
And even within Dan's app, there are many teachers, but there are a couple that I really like, Jeff

212
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,560
Warren and Joseph.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Joseph Goldstein.

214
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,640
Joseph Goldstein, yeah.

215
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,280
And Jeff Warren has, I believe, a series of walking meditations that he refers to as sort of

216
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,480
informal meditations.

217
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,800
And I remember the first time I did this, maybe it wasn't the first time, but it might have been the

218
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,320
second time. It was pretty early.

219
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,120
I realized for the first time that when you walk, if you're paying attention to it, you can feel the

220
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,000
wind going past your finger.

221
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,920
So if you're walking with your hands in a position such that your thumbs are facing forward and your

222
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,800
arms are swinging lightly in a normal gait, you can actually feel the air moving past the leading edge

223
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,400
of your hand.

224
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,080
Yeah.

225
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,520
I remember thinking, how have I been walking for 45 years and I've never once felt this sensation?

226
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,560
And now when I pay attention to it, it's so noticeable.

227
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,960
I don't know how it hasn't been distracting me for the last 45 years.

228
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,240
Yeah.

229
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,800
Yeah.

230
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,720
And one might wonder why one would want to notice such a thing.

231
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,800
But what you discover when you begin practicing meditation, especially intensively on retreat, is

232
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,600
that there's no such thing as a boring object of attention.

233
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,120
What boredom is, is simply a lack of attention.

234
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,200
We get into these situations where we are convinced that we are bored because we haven't found

235
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,080
something compelling enough in our experience to capture our attention.

236
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:13,000
But our attention is so blunt an instrument normally that we need something that's thrilling or

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,160
terrifying or something to fully get us to commit.

238
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,240
But what you discover when you learn to meditate is that what pleases us most in those

239
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,640
moments when we are fully captured by experience is the state of complete attention to the

240
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,080
present.

241
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,280
And if you can muster that on your own, if you can actually guide attention irrespective of the

242
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,000
object you're attending to, then anything, any arbitrary object, the feeling of wind on your

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,640
hand as you walk can be an exquisitely pleasurable thing to notice.

244
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,400
This is why in that first type of meditation practice, concentration practice, it doesn't

245
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,720
matter what you pay attention to.

246
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,040
You can pick an arbitrary object.

247
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,280
It can be a random sound.

248
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,120
It can be a mantra.

249
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,240
And it doesn't matter what the mantra is.

250
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,640
It can be a candle flame.

251
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,880
It can be a color on a piece of paper.

252
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,280
It can be a random sound in the environment.

253
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,920
And it can be the sensation of a fly walking across the back of your hand.

254
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,160
Right?

255
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,920
So anything that you can pay attention to, to the exclusion of anything else, can suddenly

256
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,080
disclose what it's like to have a very concentrated mind.

257
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
And concentration is intrinsically pleasurable.

258
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,600
And this is why meditation can have the character of a kind of drug experience.

259
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,480
And this is kind of a superficial character.

260
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,360
I mean, you can get kind of addicted to the changes in state you experience in

261
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
meditation, and you can be misled by these experiences.

262
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,560
You can think that it's about these changes rather than something more fundamental.

263
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,640
Because anything you experience by way of newfound pleasure that is based on having a

264
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,720
very concentrated mind, you will lose because it's an impermanent state of your

265
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,360
physiology and attention.

266
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,680
And it's not the deepest practice, but yeah, it's amazing that concentration itself,

267
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,480
regardless of the object, is incredibly pleasant.

268
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,840
You know, sort of going back to the why, which you've started to allude to.

269
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,960
And I can't I can't remember if I'm I know you've said this.

270
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,240
I think many have said this.

271
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,080
So I don't you know, I think many have come to this observation, which is virtually all

272
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,520
negatively valence to motions are not rooted in the present.

273
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,600
And that sort of becomes the the corollary of being present, therefore being able to

274
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,360
concentrate on something in the moment can be quite pleasurable.

275
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,240
And I guess that was sort of what I recognized that first moment I experienced it, which

276
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,520
was, wow, when you're when you're fully, fully, you know, engaged in or enveloped within

277
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,360
this present sensation, what you're seeing, what you're hearing, what you're feeling, it

278
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,080
becomes very difficult to be anxious or depressed or angry or any of these other things.

279
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,600
And for me, that was the most interesting part of this, which was, you know, taking a very

280
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,520
big step back, I'm trying to devote my life to figuring out this problem of how to live

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,760
longer. But if you asked me, how did I think about that problem five years ago versus how

282
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
do I think about it today?

283
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,240
There have been two fundamentally significant differences.

284
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,520
There are two things today that I that occupy much more of my energy with respect to

285
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,000
longevity than they did, you know, four or five years ago.

286
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,280
And the first of those two is this notion of being happy, which again, I think five years

287
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,720
ago, I would have dismissed that as sort of an afterthought, like it is what it is.

288
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,080
And as long as all those other things happen, you'll be happy.

289
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,280
You know, if you can figure out how to not die and how to be stronger and have better

290
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
cognitive powers, you'll be happy as a result of that.

291
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,320
But of course, that seems to be not the case.

292
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,680
The second, though, we're not going to get into it is a much greater appreciation for the

293
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,320
type of physical body that is necessary to age well and how radically that differs from

294
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,440
necessarily the physical body that we want to perform well when we're in our 30s or 40s or

295
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,880
even our 50s. But going back to the former, which to me is in many ways, your work and the

296
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
work of people like you has had such a great influence on me.

297
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
Is this realization like none of this stuff matters if you're miserable?

298
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,440
It doesn't matter if you can live to 100.

299
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,520
It doesn't matter if you can delay the onset of heart disease and stroke and cancer and

300
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
Alzheimer's disease.

301
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,680
If you're too miserable to appreciate it or if you're constantly in some sort of tormented

302
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,760
state, you might as well be dead.

303
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,080
I mean, that sounds extreme, but that's that's really how I started to feel about this.

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,240
Yeah. And I think we also have inaccurate associations with terms like happiness.

305
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,360
And we haven't distinguished terms that are different, like pain and suffering.

306
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,640
There's nothing about meditation that gets rid of physical pain.

307
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,280
Pain is just something that you're going to experience and you can actually experience

308
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,120
surprising degrees of pain while meditating.

309
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,240
If you just resolve not to move your body, it doesn't matter how comfortable your chair is.

310
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,200
Eventually, pain is going to arise.

311
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,080
And you have a guided meditation that takes us through that exercise that is I feel like

312
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,960
within two minutes, it's unbearable.

313
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,200
There are people who sit for hours and hours and 12 hours.

314
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,640
It's unbelievable.

315
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,200
It's excruciating.

316
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,800
And yet when you get up, you haven't hurt yourself.

317
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,720
It's not synonymous with injury.

318
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,800
Right now, obviously, there are ways you could injure yourself if you don't move.

319
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,480
But there can be a strange magnification of pain if you resolve to sit still for a very

320
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,480
long time. But one thing you discover there, which is useful to discover, is that there

321
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
is a difference between pain and suffering.

322
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,440
You can feel intensely negative sensory experience.

323
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,040
And you can you can feel intensely negative emotions even.

324
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,640
You can feel anger and depression and sadness.

325
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:12,680
And if you can be content to simply be aware of those sensations or those moods or emotions,

326
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,040
if you can recognize that consciousness is the prior condition in which all of those things

327
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,280
are appearing and you are simply that which is aware of these changing phenomena.

328
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,920
If you can become interested in the character of a mood like sadness or a pain in the knee,

329
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,880
it's actually possible to experience these states with total equanimity.

330
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:48,320
And one of the features is, as you said, not being focused at all by thought on the past or

331
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,280
the future. So I mean, one thing with physical pain we all experience is this sense that

332
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,600
some sensation is intolerable.

333
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,520
But there's this paradox because in that moment you've already tolerated it.

334
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,240
Right. I mean, it's fully arrived.

335
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,680
Right. It's merely an anticipation of what's to follow.

336
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,960
You're worried about the future.

337
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,000
You're worried about how long this is going to go on.

338
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,720
And it's certainly good to practice finding a place of equanimity with pain.

339
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm not saying, you know, obviously there are pains that that are conceivable that even

340
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,560
the best meditator might find it difficult to find equanimity with.

341
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:35,960
But there really is an immense amount of growth one can have in this area where you just you can

342
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,120
notice this difference between reacting to pain, contracting around it, resisting it, trying to

343
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,440
make it go away, wishing it away, worrying about how long it'll be there.

344
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
And all of this happens.

345
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,280
This cascade is just it happens so quickly that it's as you don't even notice the mechanics of it.

346
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,920
It's just you. Right. It's just you suffering.

347
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,280
But the moment you can pick apart the mechanics of it because you can pay attention to what is

348
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,440
arising, the feeling of resistance, the fear about what what's going to happen in the next moment and

349
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,200
keep dropping back into a position of merely witnessing all of these things arise and pass away.

350
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,280
There are experiences I've had and many have had in meditation where an excruciating sensation

351
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,160
becomes so intense that you actually don't know whether or not you're experiencing agony or ecstasy.

352
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,680
Like like the valence of the intense mental state is it just gets kind of wiped out.

353
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,920
It's just sheer intensity.

354
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,440
And there is a fundamental cancellation of suffering in those moments.

355
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,040
And this goes back to what we were just saying about the pleasures of concentration.

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,160
Nothing concentrates your mind more easily than pain.

357
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,080
Right. So if you're willing, if you can get past your fear and just go into it, you can experience a

358
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,760
lot of mental pleasure.

359
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,560
I mean, this is you know, I mean, I'm not I don't think I've ever met somebody who who claimed to be

360
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,840
a masochist, but I can imagine that if masochism is possible, there's some reason why this is the case.

361
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,240
This this would be this would be a reason why this would this would be the case, that there is I can only

362
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:26,360
imagine they're experiencing intense concentration in various states that most people would find physically

363
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:34,840
intolerable. But back to the idea of happiness and and other states that are commonly associated with it.

364
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:43,320
I think we all have this sense that happiness is a matter of being joyful all the time.

365
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,400
And this is a very common idea.

366
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Sort of the misconception that many of us think that, well, that's not desirable, because if I were joyful every

367
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,600
minute of every day, I wouldn't have the drive to do X, Y and Z.

368
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Or I wouldn't be, quote unquote, real in some way.

369
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Or if it is a matter of securing some durable source of joy, then it can't absorb any of the other things in life for which joy would be

370
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,600
inappropriate. You know, people die and there's just there are there ups and downs in life.

371
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,000
And I don't talk about or think about happiness very much.

372
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,320
I think about well-being and flourishing more.

373
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:34,520
And those concepts for me can embrace all of the vicissitudes of life where you if you experience some serious loss in your life, there is a

374
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:45,040
resiliency and a way of embracing that, which is which brings out the the wisest and most compassionate and most expansive parts of yourself.

375
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,280
That is another that is another component of well-being.

376
00:24:49,240 --> 00:25:00,520
The narrow conception of happiness that most of us have by default is something that we that we are always trying to defend and shore up against all of the other

377
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,200
things in life that are threatening to undermine it.

378
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,520
And the one obvious point is that it's just not it's not a safe play.

379
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,560
It is perpetually under threat.

380
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:20,600
And any joy you can feel by virtue of it having arisen based on some causes and conditions is going to pass away.

381
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:27,920
You know, you just can't keep any emotion going for days or even hours at a time.

382
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:35,400
And one thing you discover when you learn to meditate is that negative emotion in particular has a very short half life.

383
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,040
You know, many of us imagine that we can stay angry or sad for some people would imagine days.

384
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,560
I think almost everyone thinks hours at a time.

385
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:53,320
It's actually impossible if you are no longer lost in thought about all the reasons why you should be angry or sad.

386
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:02,640
So this was one of the earlier I can't remember if this was one of the lessons in your meditation app early on or was just a discussion you and I had.

387
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,440
But I got to put it to the test shortly after I was in New York and obviously in New York, it's everything's a hustle, right?

388
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,080
It's you're you're running around.

389
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,920
People are rude.

390
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,080
You're going to get bumped into.

391
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:25,400
And one of my pet peeves in New York is when you see somebody walking towards you and they're for a moment lost in whatever they're doing, they're usually down looking at their phone or something like that.

392
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,440
I always think it's a reasonable courtesy to just not walk into them, even if they're in your line of sight.

393
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,800
You still sort of go out of your way to not bump into them.

394
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,120
But for whatever reason, there's just a subset of people who love that opportunity to almost knock you off your feet.

395
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:50,240
So sure enough, one day I am about to turn a corner and this guy is walking and it was clear that he could see me and I had looked down.

396
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,040
So my bad.

397
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,200
But this guy plows right into me.

398
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,760
And I had just had either had this discussion with you or just heard, you know, this lesson about how long can you actually stay angry?

399
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,960
And so this happens and I immediately sort of observed this emotion, this rise of anger in me, right?

400
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,680
Which was like the desire to turn around and walk up to the guy and say something serves no purpose, of course.

401
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,240
But instead I decided, well, just watch this.

402
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,160
Watch this emotion.

403
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,560
How long does it last?

404
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,040
You know, I remember I was walking somewhere that I was going to be in 10 minutes and I was like,

405
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,080
do you think this will last 10 more minutes?

406
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,720
Could you be angry for the next 10 minutes if you just observe this feeling?

407
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,600
And the answer is no.

408
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,160
I mean, it was gone.

409
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,480
Actually, I felt like within seconds.

410
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:35,880
Yeah.

411
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:50,960
And to me, that was like a really big aha moment for especially for someone like me who's so easily prone to anger to think that by simply being observant of that emotional state, I could have some control over it, which has always felt like the opposite.

412
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,160
Right.

413
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,560
It's always felt like that emotional state has control over me.

414
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,000
Right.

415
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,280
And it does.

416
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:06,800
I mean, the important point to never forget is that it has complete control over you as long as you're identified with the next angry thought that's arising in consciousness.

417
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,480
If you have no perspective on the fact that you are thinking, right?

418
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:22,480
Well, then you simply become that thought for the period that it's captivating and you are pushed in whatever direction it's aimed.

419
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,760
Right.

420
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:32,680
So if it is getting you to say the angry thing or physically assault the person, you need some level of metacognition in order to pull the brakes.

421
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,440
Otherwise, you're just it's exactly like being asleep and dreaming and not knowing that you're dreaming.

422
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,840
This happens to us, all of us every night.

423
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:51,160
We get into bed and then suddenly a movie starts playing that we're totally identified with.

424
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,600
We're one of the characters in it and we're completely unaware of this change.

425
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:56,840
Right.

426
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,720
And we're and the most surprising thing about dreams is that we're not surprised when they arise.

427
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:01,920
Right.

428
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,760
Like there's no, you know, we didn't have the expectation that we would stay in our beds.

429
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,440
Apparently, we're not surprised at the laws of physics are being violated for our amusement.

430
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:24,600
And we're suddenly in these situations where we are fully captive to a completely illusory, seemingly sensory experience.

431
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:34,800
But all of this is some kind of hallucination and identification with thought in the waking state has that character to some degrees.

432
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,680
It's thought to be totally normal psychologically.

433
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:37,840
Right.

434
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,720
Because it is our default state.

435
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:50,680
But once you learn the alternative, which is to be mindful, you then have a very different sense of what optimal mental health would be.

436
00:29:50,680 --> 00:30:07,640
And so when I find myself lost in thought and just, you know, suddenly angry or anxious or frustrated or whatever it is and I wake up from that experience, it is a little bit like waking up

437
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,360
from a dream or a hallucination or it's hard to shake the sense that it's pathological.

438
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,840
I was stuck in something about which I had no awareness.

439
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,480
Right.

440
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:32,640
And it was forcing me to say and do and think and feel things that were given my now current awareness were completely unnecessary.

441
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,080
Is he to me what's so interesting about this?

442
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:44,040
David Foster Wallace in his commencement speech in 2005 at Kenyon College, the this is water, which is one of my favorite things to listen to.

443
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,680
I burned a copy off YouTube and now it sits on my phone and I try to listen to it at least once a month, if not more.

444
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,720
And it like even though I almost know it off by heart, it doesn't matter.

445
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,920
Like I still get some benefit every time I hear it.

446
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,400
And when he talks about this, he speaks specifically about.

447
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,320
The problem with this is that it is our default and that's the part that makes this so challenging.

448
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,080
So do we have evidence of other species like are we the only ones that are.

449
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Blessed slash cursed with this ability for rumination and constant thought.

450
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:28,240
I mean, do we do we have any evidence that a dog is spending any percentage of his or her time thinking about what happened the day before or the next meal?

451
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,520
Where do we as humans stack up in this space?

452
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:47,480
Well, it's important to acknowledge that we're blessed and cursed by this because this capacity for linguistic, abstract, complex thought is what has given us everything that is recognizably human.

453
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,840
It has given us culture, it has given us civilization.

454
00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:06,720
It's allowed us to place all of the learning of our ancestors in a strata that is accessible to all of us and to every present generation so that we don't have to relearn everything from the ground up.

455
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,440
I mean, just imagine what the alternative would be if there was no acquisition of progress in civilization.

456
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,760
Yeah.

457
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,600
And then for the longest time, that was true of humanity as well.

458
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:27,280
You go back 50,000 years and then you decide to go back 60,000 years that the differences are impressively non-existent in terms of the toolkit anyone was working with.

459
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,080
So that's interesting, Sam.

460
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:40,120
So if we go back to, I know there's some debate about when language was really codified, but to pick a point in time when we're pretty sure there was no language, we could say 200,000 years ago.

461
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,320
Right.

462
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,960
I think most neuroscientists would agree, no language 200,000 years ago.

463
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:50,240
Was the arrival of language the arrival of this capacity or where did this show up?

464
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,480
Yeah, I think language is the main variable there.

465
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:04,800
I mean, it's the main variable with respect to being able to abstract, to being able to represent anything that's not currently present or not currently happening.

466
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:20,880
It's the basis for communicating anything of substance to anyone else and storing a kind of cultural memory of anything, whether it's just by virtue of an oral tradition or once writing came along.

467
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,040
So language is necessary for all that.

468
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:34,760
I mean, just to be able to articulate the concept of time, the concept of a past where the causes of the present are stored and a future, which is yet to arise.

469
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,240
That needs to be planned for, or that can be better or worse.

470
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:50,400
It's something that I think other species probably have in a very primitive form that is not associated with conscious thought.

471
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,200
I think that a dog, for instance, learns various associations with stimuli.

472
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,360
Right.

473
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,600
The Pavlovian response is that these animals can experience.

474
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:00,960
Yeah.

475
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,760
And they recognize people, obviously.

476
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,600
I mean, they recognize people arguably better than any other species other than the human.

477
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:17,720
So they can have real relationships and there's no question they have emotions and they have preferences and all of that.

478
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:31,560
But in terms of forming a notion of the future or a notion of the way in which the world might be different, it's one thing to recognize your friend.

479
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:38,680
In the case of a dog, recognize your owner and prefer that person to somebody else.

480
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:46,000
It's another thing to have any concept of having had a past with that person.

481
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,160
Now, the fact that you recognize them indicates a past.

482
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,720
Right.

483
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,960
But all of that could be preconscious to a dog.

484
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,440
It's just there's just this kind of binary difference between recognition and not.

485
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,880
So let's use an even more obvious example.

486
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:14,320
And I'll tell you where I'm going with this, because then I want to understand this, which is as I observe my three children, there is a distinction in what I see in the younger ones that they seem to always be present.

487
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,400
So which isn't to say that they don't get upset.

488
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,080
I mean, you only have to look at a toddler for 10 seconds to watch what they can get upset.

489
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,360
Yeah.

490
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,800
But I doubt that they're upset about anything other than what they're experiencing in the moment.

491
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,040
Right.

492
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,520
They're hungry.

493
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,960
They're diapers, dirty, whatever.

494
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,480
They fell.

495
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,200
They hurt themselves.

496
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,040
Something like that.

497
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:44,080
But if you look at, you know, a teenager or a 10 year old, a preteen, they are now starting to suffer from this quote unquote disease of too much thinking, too much distraction.

498
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:52,920
So somewhere from the moment you're born until let's just make it easy and say until you're 13, you acquire this capacity.

499
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,880
But yet an infant like the dog recognizes the parent.

500
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,840
There is some sense of a history with an individual.

501
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,440
Yeah.

502
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:13,240
Again, I don't know even what the relevance is of this other than to say the inability to recognize how distracted we are seems to be one of the greatest drivers of misery.

503
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,520
You know, there are three quotes I love and I love them because they're basically all saying the same thing across 1700 years.

504
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,080
So in the first century, Seneca said we suffer more in imagination than in reality.

505
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,280
In the 16th century, Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

506
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,160
I have that on a T-shirt that I love to remind myself.

507
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:43,440
And then, of course, in the 17th century, Pascal said distraction is the only thing that consoles us from miseries, yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.

508
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,600
Descartes says something very similar.

509
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,720
I mean, this is something that's been acknowledged for so long.

510
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,120
Yeah.

511
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:03,440
And yet it's so ingrained in us that it just strikes me as like, is there some evolutionary basis for this or is it just that evolution wasn't even trying to optimize for this equanimity?

512
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:16,680
And instead, the benefits, as you've pointed out, of being able to do these things, the progress we've been able to make as a society, our ability to leapfrog ahead of other species has more than made up for this difficulty.

513
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:23,240
Or is it simply that, look, evolution wouldn't outselect this because it's not interfering with your reproductive fitness?

514
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,720
Yeah.

515
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah.

516
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,800
I just don't understand why we suffer so much.

517
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,840
I guess it's one question.

518
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,920
The crucial point there is that evolution doesn't care about your well-being.

519
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,000
As long as you reproduce, what does it care?

520
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,480
Yeah.

521
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:46,640
And so if there's some path by which we survive and reproduce in a state of misery, evolution is perfectly happy.

522
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:57,000
If that were a more reliable algorithm for reproduction and survival, then we would be getting more and more miserable.

523
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,400
So we want to slip the logic of evolution because it simply doesn't care about us.

524
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:15,680
And virtually everything we want as a species now, at some level, is a matter of breaking the connection to many of our evolved tendencies.

525
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,640
And we have a very strong evolutionary capacity for tribal violence.

526
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:20,920
Right?

527
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,360
But tribal violence is obviously something we want to outgrow as quickly as possible.

528
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,520
And there are many other examples of this.

529
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:38,840
I think that language is, you could see it when you're raising your kids, when you have a two and a half year old and a three year old where they, they're talking to you.

530
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,080
But then they're talking to themselves as though they're talking to you.

531
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:51,520
Speech becomes something where you're, you're narrating your experience as though you're talking to a parent.

532
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:02,400
And this seems to get internalized so that the conversation, you just, you know enough to keep your mouth shut, but you are really talking to someone who isn't there all the time.

533
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:10,160
I think that's probably the origin of it for every individual that we, language is so useful.

534
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:26,320
It's so essential to everything we do that we just have this superfluous level of discursivity that from, again, from a survival advantage, there's no reason to ever turn it off.

535
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:37,160
But from a wellbeing point of view, it's the character of it is almost universally unpleasant most of the time for most people.

536
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:45,920
I mean, there's some people who are very lucky and they have an intrinsic level of happiness that is just kind of off the charts where they're just, they're basically happy all the time.

537
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,400
They recover very, very quickly from disappointments and losses and they just don't really see a problem.

538
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,880
And many of these people are not very reflective about, you know, the human condition, right?

539
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:07,000
They're not living necessarily examined lives because they, there's not much of a reason to, but they're just, you know, they get up in the morning and they're just stoked to be alive.

540
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:20,080
And you can, you know, if you get enough of the conditions for ordinary levels of happiness together and you're lucky enough to be able to maintain them fairly effortlessly, right?

541
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,440
You're wealthy and you're healthy and you're surrounded by happy, creative people who want the best for you.

542
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:36,040
And you're just by dint of good luck, people close to you haven't died and you haven't suffered any collision with reality.

543
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:44,080
Then yet you can, you can be conventionally very happy and still be talking to yourself all the time and not notice it.

544
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:58,960
But there's significant limitation even to that when you do develop this more refined way of noticing what it's like to be you, which is what we're calling meditation.

545
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:11,160
It's not that learning this, having insight into the mechanics of your own suffering and the mediocrity of kind of ordinary transient states of pleasure.

546
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:20,360
It's not that that is at bottom incompatible with living an ordinary fulfilled pleasure seeking life.

547
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:32,880
I mean, you can enjoy dinner just as much having learned to meditate as anyone who's gluttonously attached to sensory experience without any kind of metacognition about what's going on.

548
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:40,320
But the difference comes in how you respond to problems that arise.

549
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,760
I think it's actually both, right?

550
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,760
I mean, I think that mindfulness clearly makes it easier to endure unpleasant things.

551
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,440
So, you know, I was late to come over here today because the to get to your place, which should have been an hour, took two hours.

552
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:04,480
And that is normally something that would drive me batshit crazy just by way of process.

553
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,000
Like, why is it so inefficient?

554
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,800
Like, why are there so many cars on the road?

555
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:17,560
Blah, blah. Like, I would get into a woe is me narrative about this, which is, of course, ironic because like, why am I more special than every other car on this road?

556
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,600
Like, everyone is equally in the same situation of it's taking two hours to get somewhere that it should take one hour.

557
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:34,360
And actually, I have used traffic because when you live in Southern California and split your time in New York, you get plenty of exposure to traffic.

558
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,880
I've actually used this as an amazing tool for mindfulness and I no longer let it really get to me instead.

559
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,320
I just sort of observe.

560
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,440
Oh, look, you're feeling a little bit self-important today.

561
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,320
Like, you're feeling like your time is more valuable than everybody else's time.

562
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,280
Let's examine that. Is that really true?

563
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,920
Not really. OK, what is happening in this exact moment?

564
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,160
The sun is shining this way or, you know, all these other things.

565
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,640
So so in many ways, if nothing else, it's simply a hack to allow me to be less miserable.

566
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,560
But on the flip side, I actually do think there is a way to enjoy certain moments more.

568
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,720
And I've certainly noticed this the most with my kids.

569
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:24,320
I think that, you know, I have a our middle son who's four, you know, he's just that's what for like a four year old boy is just going to be more prone to chewing up the air in the room when it comes to doing bad stuff.

570
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,840
And I find that and to be clear, they're not all days that I can do this.

571
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,440
There are some days when he's acting crazy that it just drives me nuts.

572
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,440
But more often than not, I'm sort of able to actually reflect on it pleasantly and think about like what's happening in this moment.

573
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,840
Right. OK, he's he's yelling, he's screaming, he's throwing a temper tantrum.

574
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,040
He's hit his brother. He's done this. He's done that.

575
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,920
But in this moment, is there anything that's really that bad about any of these things?

576
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,760
I mean, like it's not like he's going to be doing this when he goes to college.

577
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,600
Like what am I really worried about here?

578
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:03,240
Yeah. And in fact, I can turn that into a positive thing, which is one day he will be in college and he won't be a cute little four year old who loves me so much.

579
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,360
Yeah, you'll miss this moment.

580
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,200
Yeah, I'll miss this moment.

581
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,520
So so I have found that again, I use the word hack because I it's such an inelegant way to describe it.

582
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,280
But it's basically a tool to make me a little bit more aware of where I am in a given moment.

583
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,240
And whether that produces happiness or not, I mean, I sort of agree with you.

584
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,360
The semantics of happiness are too cumbersome for me to explain.

585
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,600
You know, people have talked about the happiness is simply the difference between reality and expectation.

586
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,160
I mean, that's a bit vague for me.

587
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,280
I'm not smart enough to fully understand what that means, though.

588
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,640
I understand the concept.

589
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:46,000
But clearly there's some component of expecting the world to be a certain way and it not being that way, producing an emotional state or a valence that is negative one way or the other.

590
00:44:46,000 --> 00:45:03,760
And and so I think, well, as as as wonderful as mindfulness is to offset that, there is this moment at times of taking a bite of food and rather than thinking about the next bite or what you're going to eat later, like actually thinking, you know, or observing the sensations as they're

591
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,760
occurring in that moment, kind of slowing things down in a way.

592
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,720
Because I don't know why I just tend to always live in a fast forward mode.

594
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,720
That is my default is to be full fast forward.

595
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,560
Well, it's most people's default.

596
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:32,480
I always say it's everyone's default who's not being mindful because you're you're constantly even when you're getting what you want, even when you're in the very act of gratifying a desire, you're still subtly inclining toward the next moment.

597
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,280
You're not actually landing on each moment of experience with full attention.

598
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:51,760
And paradoxically, you can discover that many of the things you think you want, you don't want all that much if you pay attention to what is actually like to gratify those desires.

599
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,720
Maybe with food, this is very clear.

600
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,480
So you can be eating something.

601
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,600
You can think you want dessert.

602
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,280
You can have a real sweet tooth.

603
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:08,160
And if you pay very close attention to what it's like to eat that sweet thing, you're finally gorging on.

604
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,360
More often than not, you discover it's just a little too sweet.

605
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,440
There's something about it that is unpleasant.

606
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,880
And your pleasure in that moment is predicated on your being able to take a drink of water in the next.

607
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,160
Right. Like if you have to be bite a candy bar or something, this candy that's made for kids delivers this insight to me.

608
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:39,280
Very clearly, it's like the moment I I think I want something at the movies, whatever it is, you know, M&Ms or something that is hasn't changed its formula for the last 40 years.

609
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:49,160
And I'm eating it and I begin to notice that I'm eating more of it as a way of just getting rid of getting rid of the sense in your palate.

610
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,240
Yeah. The last moment of taste that is just too chemical laden, too sweet.

611
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,000
And, you know, if I didn't have a drink of water, you know, this would this would actually be an unpleasant experience.

612
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,520
And it's not what it seems when you're not paying attention.

613
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,840
And this is not to say that there's nothing that's truly pleasurable.

614
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,040
I mean, there's all kinds of pleasure.

615
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:15,480
And again, being able to really connect with the present moment delivers its own intrinsic pleasure.

616
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:26,640
But your sense of what matters can definitely change the moment you begin to pay closer attention to what experience is actually like.

617
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,600
I think it was in one of your lessons, but it might have been in a podcast where you talk about.

618
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:43,640
Imagine you're playing a video game and it's the same video game every time and you always get killed by the same monster at the same part of the maze or whatever it is.

619
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:53,840
And I think about that a lot every time I falter at predictably, you know, known, understood things that get under my skin.

620
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,680
And it's very discouraging, right?

621
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,360
It's sort of like there are like a dozen things that I just know if they happen.

622
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:10,480
So, I mean, one of them is there are certain types of questions that if I'm asked really irk me, you know, when people ask questions that are to which the answer is very complicated.

623
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,920
But they ask through the lens of just give me the one word answer that just irks me like I don't know why it just bugs the shit out of me.

624
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,520
And I know that.

625
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,240
And yet over and over again, I find myself getting upset when that happens.

626
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,520
And I feel like the guy that you're describing a video game, you're losing the boss fight at the same place every time.

627
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Every single time I know where the boogeyman is.

628
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,040
I know what weapon he's going to use to kill me.

629
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,440
And I just walk over there and out comes the machete and I'm dead.

630
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,960
And then I'm back to the starting block again.

631
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,000
And I've won one of fewer lives in the game.

632
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,360
Right.

633
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,320
What?

634
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,080
What?

635
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,800
But you can recover faster each time you lose.

636
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,040
Getting angry is not the measure of having lost.

637
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,200
Right.

638
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:01,400
Now you obviously you can aspire to a time where you never get angry again or you never get angry in certain circumstances again.

639
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,720
But the real practice is to notice as early as possible what's happening and to let go of it.

640
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,800
The difference between being angry for 10 minutes and 10 seconds and one second.

641
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,800
Those factors of 10 are enormous.

642
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,120
Right.

643
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:28,480
And I have the same thing going on where it's anger is something that I very frequently feel.

644
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,440
And I also noticed that it totally contaminates the experience of people around me.

645
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,080
So I have my wife and my daughters and my anger for them is clearly toxic.

646
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,360
And I have this commitment to letting go of it the moment I can let go of it.

647
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,280
And it's not that anger is never warranted.

648
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,560
The energy of anger can be useful.

649
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,360
Someone's attacking you on the sidewalk, you know, and you're in a self defense situation.

650
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,000
That's not the moment where I would say get rid of all your anger as quickly as possible.

651
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,160
Right.

652
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,480
I mean, there are situations where you want to use that energy.

653
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:15,400
But for the most part, you want to let go of it very, very quickly and then be in a position to decide what's what and whether or not it's appropriate to take some kind of, you know, confrontational path, whatever it is.

654
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,400
By email or say the thing that would convey your displeasure or whatever.

655
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,760
But now I have my wife and my daughters as a kind of feedback mechanism for me because they know my commitment.

656
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:37,360
They know I can let go of anger on demand and they know I want to and they don't like my anger.

657
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:37,680
Right.

658
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,480
And they detect it in the subtlest way.

659
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:48,640
So like, I mean, it's not it's not even anger where a normal person would classically think he was angry.

660
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,560
They don't have to wait till you raise your voice.

661
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,760
They can see the mannerisms in the way you might move or the way your answers become shorter.

662
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,720
Yeah.

663
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

664
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,080
Or it may just so like, you know, even mild frustration gets scored as, you know, a kind of crazy level of anger.

665
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,320
Right.

666
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,800
So like if I, you know, if I say, wait a minute, I thought the plumber was coming today.

667
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,640
That's like, you know, that, you know, that's a four alarm fire.

668
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:14,840
Right.

669
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,520
So one of my daughters will say, Ooh, daddy's getting angry.

670
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:18,680
Right.

671
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:26,800
And they'll say that so early now and it's fantastic because it's, I just let go of it way earlier than I used to.

672
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,040
But if you can't be mindful, you actually have no choice.

673
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,880
You know, you just, you will be angry as long as you're angry and the people around you who don't like it.

674
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,040
Just have to figure out somehow to put up with you.

675
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,880
It's not that there's no other hacks.

676
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,640
There are many other hacks and sometimes, sometimes there, it's important to have

677
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,800
a hack that is more global than being simply being relentlessly mindful of everything that's coming up for you.

678
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:04,720
Like a different understanding of a situation can offer some kind of firmware update to the whole operating system.

679
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,240
And then you, you just simply don't go there anymore.

680
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,000
So for instance, I mean, so you're driving in traffic.

681
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,040
There are many hacks for that, but one hack is just you discover that you've got 400 hours of podcasts.

682
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,200
You want to listen to and you're listening to a great one and you, you're just, you're just happy to be listening.

683
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:30,760
And the fact that you're delayed an extra half hour or whatever is fine, you know, and that's a totally useful hack, right?

684
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,160
It modulates your state.

685
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,520
You're, you're just, you're just discovering the silver lining to something that's, that would otherwise be negative.

686
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,240
I'll, I'll share with you another one because I agree with that completely.

687
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,880
That's a great one.

688
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:47,960
The other one that I've taken on in the past year that has had surprising efficacy is any customer service experience you

689
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,080
have that is profoundly negative.

690
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,920
And if you fly as much as I do, you're pretty much guaranteed one of those a week.

691
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:04,160
My friend Jay Walker, who knows a lot about the aviation industry said one out of six experiences with us aviation is a customer service failure.

692
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,160
Right.

693
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,480
So anyone who flies would agree with that.

694
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:17,600
But so the next time like the flight attendants rude to you or the TSA person is sweating you or being obnoxious or whatever, if you instead take a view

695
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,600
of empathy, which is God, this is a really hard job.

696
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,480
You know, I mean, I have the privilege of getting to be, you know, intellectually engaged and doing all of these things and boom, boom, boom.

697
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,240
But this is a really hard job.

698
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,960
I mean, most of the people that they're encountering are on some level dissatisfied.

699
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,240
Yeah.

700
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,760
He's showing up to to their world happy.

701
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,480
And so like simply taking that posture completely changes the way you interact with that system.

702
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:44,880
Yeah.

703
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,840
It's interesting because it doesn't even really require a huge mindfulness insight.

704
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,080
It's just sort of a but it's a condition you want to walk in the situation with.

705
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,280
Right.

706
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,360
You want to be able to walk in with that in your mind.

707
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:56,720
Yeah.

708
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,800
It's a framing effect.

709
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,240
Yeah.

710
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:58,760
Yeah.

711
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,720
And it doesn't entail mindfulness at all.

712
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,720
You could get the benefit of that new framing without ever having heard of mindfulness.

713
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,600
So you if you do get angry, you'll be as angry as as you ever were.

714
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,120
But right.

715
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,800
So the combination of these thinking about it.

716
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:12,960
Yeah.

717
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,360
The combination of these is powerful.

718
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:14,840
Yeah.

719
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:23,960
When I think about one of the most difficult things to there are two things in my life that I have learned that I think were very difficult and took a lot of time.

720
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:30,040
The first was in the year 2000 when I was finishing medical school, I had a really bad back injury.

721
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:39,600
And it's a long story, but it basically for a year of my life, I was not able to move properly.

722
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,720
And for three months, I was not able to move at all.

723
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,040
Wow.

724
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,720
How'd that happen?

725
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:51,160
It's not clear how it happened, but what happened was a pretty bad outcome.

726
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,880
And I ended up having surgery, but the surgeon operated on the wrong side.

727
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,280
So it went from a very bad situation to a worse situation.

728
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,720
And a whole series of cascading events led to it being what it was.

729
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:14,840
I look back at that as I've described as before as the best, worst experience of my life, because having been in so much pain for so long, I had to learn how to do everything.

730
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,960
I had to learn how to do everything from scratch.

731
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,600
So I had to learn how to be able to brush my teeth without putting stress on my back, which most people wouldn't even think about.

732
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,360
You wouldn't think that there's a right and a wrong way to brush your teeth.

733
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,680
You wouldn't think that there's a right and a wrong way to get out of your bed, put your shoes on or get out of your car.

734
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:38,240
It turns out there is, but you can only learn it when you are in such a fragile state that you've lost every ounce of strength in your back.

735
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:45,680
And because I experienced that for so long, a year, it allowed me to make this transition, which I want to, of course, apply to meditation.

736
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:55,760
The transition is going from being unconsciously incompetent to then being consciously incompetent to then consciously competent.

737
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,920
And of course, the goal is to one day get to a point where you are unconsciously competent.

738
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,160
I don't think I'm unconsciously competent at a single thing I do, including movement.

739
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,680
But I'm now consciously competent at moving around and not hurting my back.

740
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,320
But I couldn't have got there if I didn't have that feedback loop that allowed me to go through it.

741
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
The other thing was learning how to swim as an adult.

742
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,400
You know, you throw an adult in the water who's never swum before.

743
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,400
They are so incompetent, but they don't even really understand what it is.

744
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:34,120
And so the first act of learning how to swim is learning to feel what's making you sink, figuring out what it is that is actually dropping you to the bottom.

745
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:41,160
And then, of course, you want to be able to correct that and with great effort over short periods of time, exercise some capacity to fix that.

746
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:49,160
I would say those two experiences have been by far the most difficult, but they pale in comparison to mindfulness.

747
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Now, I don't know if that just makes me a hard case, but and maybe it's, you know, the other thing I was thinking about when I was reflecting on this is having a back injury.

748
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,160
You don't get a time.

749
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,160
You don't get a time out from it.

750
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:08,160
You know, it's every minute of every day you're immersed in that exposure, that stimulus and that feedback loop.

751
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Similarly, once I dedicated myself to swimming, I swam four hours a day.

752
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,160
And I think maybe the issue is because I don't meditate for four hours a day, it's just going to take a lot longer to do it.

753
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:28,160
And I know you and I have spoken about this and your belief is that something really happens when you go on a silent retreat.

754
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,160
And I remember once asking you, I said, hey, Sam, I see this retreat.

755
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,160
It's four days. Do you think I should go?

756
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,160
And you actually said, no, I wouldn't go for a four day retreat.

757
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,160
I'd wait till you can do 10 or 14 days.

758
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,160
Yeah, I guess I would modify that slightly.

759
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:48,160
I think a week to 10 days is the shortest I can recommend without caveat.

760
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,160
I think the first three days or so of a retreat are more or less the hardest for a retreat of any length.

761
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:05,160
So if you do if you do a three day retreat or a four day retreat, you're almost guaranteed to have a lot of restlessness and just resistance to the whole project.

762
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,160
And you may not touch anything on the other side of that.

763
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,160
You can just be kind of unhappy the whole time and then just relieved to be getting off retreat.

764
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,160
Whereas if you have 10 days, just seems like an eternity.

765
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Once you put yourself on retreat and you're you've just shut down your connection to everything, there's no talking, there's no writing, there's no reading.

766
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,160
It's just you and your attention in each moment.

767
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Ten days seems like an eternity.

768
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:48,160
And so as you move through those first few days of resistance at day three, you're still so far away from the day that you're going home that it's much more common to just surrender at that point.

769
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,160
And really get into it.

770
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:57,160
Just decide that you'll just pick up your life as you left it when you get off retreat.

771
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,160
And that for this period, there's just nothing worth thinking about.

772
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,160
You just need to pay attention to whatever is appearing.

773
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:12,160
Your breath sounds, the movement of air on your hand as you walk.

774
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Your first experience in this was sort of comical the way you describe it, right?

775
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,160
When you were 16, I believe.

776
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
Oh, no.

777
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:28,160
That was my first experience of solitude that I guess it would have been a retreat, but I was on outward bound and the outward bound, I assume they still have it.

778
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:38,160
But back then they had something called the solo, which was a 23-day period of camping and hiking and outdoorsmanship.

779
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:48,160
But maybe day 18 or so, they put you in isolation for three full days where you would fast and do nothing.

780
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,160
So you couldn't go hiking and do anything that would distract you.

781
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,160
And I think that the reason for that was not based on any meditative agenda that they had.

782
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:05,160
It was just they don't want a bunch of not fully trained people wandering around the wilderness while fasted.

783
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,160
So they just park you in someplace.

784
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:19,160
We were by this lake at maybe 9,000 feet, and you just camp with a water bottle, and that's all you got.

785
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,160
You just have your sleeping bag, your water bottle, and you have a journal.

786
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
You have a journal.

787
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Yeah, you can write in your journal.

788
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,160
And I found the experience just intolerable.

789
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,160
It was just...

790
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,160
You were 16?

791
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
Yeah, I was 16.

792
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:50,160
So I opened my book, Waking Up with this story, because it was the first moment in my life that I realized that I was on the wrong side of some understanding about the nature of my own mind and the possibility of finding a durable source of happiness in this life.

793
01:00:51,160 --> 01:01:18,160
So I was alone in an absolutely beautiful spot, and totally miserable based on the fact that I didn't have any of the usual distractions, and if you could have just swapped places with me and inhabited my consciousness, I was spending all my time fantasizing about the things I was going to do when I got off, when I got out of those goddamn mountains and got back to my life in the world.

794
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:29,160
And the friends I would see, and the foods I would eat, and it was just a continuous advertisement for everything that I missed.

795
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:36,160
It was like a meditation on loneliness and boredom and grief, ultimately.

796
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:44,160
It was just to be separated from everyone I cared about, and every fun thing I could do, and every tasty thing I could eat.

797
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,160
It was just a source of perfect misery for me.

798
01:01:47,160 --> 01:02:00,160
So when I came off the solo and met all of the other people who had also been on their solos, I was astonished to discover that many of them had had profoundly happy experiences.

799
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Were you one of the youngest people on this review?

800
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,160
Yeah. I think I was the youngest.

801
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:14,160
I think the cutoff, I don't know if this is still the case, but the cutoff for Outward Bound was 16 and a half, and I was just 16 and a half.

802
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,160
So there were lots of people who were 10 years older.

803
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:24,160
And so they were in different places in their lives, and many of them just had a kind of breakthrough experience.

804
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,160
I mean, it was just some of the best time they'd ever spent alive.

805
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,160
And so they were kind of radiantly happy.

806
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:42,160
Because we had just done 18 or so days of brutal hiking, just 14-hour days of hiking with 60-pound packs.

807
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:55,160
And we had this full ordeal of learning how to function in the backcountry, and then it all stops, and you're just alone by this alpine lake.

808
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:03,160
So many of them had come out of that feeling that they had touched something profound, and I had no idea what they were talking about.

809
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,160
It was like being told, I just got run over by a car, and it was the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

810
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,160
I had come out of there having had a harrowing experience.

811
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,160
So what happened when you went back home after that?

812
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:30,160
Did you look back and reflect on that, or does that basically just become a footnote into a broader story that really didn't factor into your ultimate search for, call it enlightenment, call it what you want?

813
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,160
It took a little time.

814
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:43,160
It was probably a year and a half before I then had an experience with psychedelics that put all of this in perspective for me.

815
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:47,160
And was your first experience with psilocybin or LSD?

816
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:58,160
Strangely, I had taken psilocybin as a teenager before I had what really was the kind of breakthrough experience for me on MDMA when I was 18.

817
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
Yeah, you wrote about that as well.

818
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,160
Yeah, yeah, that's in waking up.

819
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:27,160
I had taken psilocybin, I had smoked marijuana, and I had taken mushrooms a few times as a teenager, and they never signaled anything profound to me about the nature of the mind, or they never indicated a path forward apart from just this sense that these drugs produced interesting experiences.

820
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,160
I had no framing for what I experienced on these drugs.

821
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:38,160
In other words, you experienced the altered state, but there was no altered trait to borrow from the title of the same book.

822
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:44,160
Yeah, and also just no sense that there could be altered traits.

823
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:49,160
There was no project associated with changing your experience in that way.

824
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
It was just, you know, it was kind of fun.

825
01:04:51,160 --> 01:05:02,160
I guess some of the experiences had also been unpleasant on psilocybin, but it's just these were drug experiences, you know, and it was like getting drunk.

826
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:20,160
Like, if you get drunk, you don't come away from that experience thinking, I wonder if this indicates that it's possible to feel, kind of natively feel like I've had six beers and, you know, I can just be more that sort of person by some other method that has nothing to do with drinking beer all the time.

827
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:39,160
But with MDMA, you know, my first experience on ecstasy, I had this epiphany that this is what consciousness was like when it was no longer encumbered by my self concern, by my egocentricity, by my...

828
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:49,160
And because you were 18, I mean, was it so much about, like, I'm trying to reflect on what it was like to be an 18-year-old boy, but I think if I recall, you wrote about...

829
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Just sort of the empathy that you had for your friend, because it was you and another friend, right?

830
01:05:54,160 --> 01:06:18,160
And was that the part that was so stunning to you, which was, oh my God, like, I've spent the last 18 years sort of not thinking about it through somebody else's eyes, or what was it that you experienced, if you can recall, that at least showed you, or perhaps was the thin end of the wedge, that said, there is now an altered state of consciousness that could exist outside of this state that I'm in that might be desirable.

831
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:35,160
It was a recognition that what was changing for me while I was coming on to the drug was that I was losing my concern about myself, right?

832
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:44,160
So that I... So I'm talking to my best friend, somebody who I already love and connected to and have, you know, positive feelings for.

833
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:56,160
But what was happening is that I started to punch through to this level of connection with him that I had never felt before, despite the fact that we were great friends.

834
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:09,160
And it had a kind of structure to it, or it was dissecting a structure within my mind that I had never had any cause to notice, which was...

835
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:22,160
My default state was normally that if I'm talking to him, some amount of my attention is bound up in a concern about what he thinks about me, right?

836
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:35,160
So if I see some change in expression on his face based on what I just said, I'm reading into those changes some message about me, some message about how I'm doing.

837
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:54,160
And there are many other features to this. I mean, there's also a sense of a kind of zero sum aspect to my own stature in the world and my feeling of wellbeing in light of other people's success and happiness.

838
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,160
And this is something you can discover in yourself.

839
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:03,160
Imagine those times where you have a friend who has some massive success, right?

840
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,160
You know, you're struggling in your life to be as successful as you want to be.

841
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,160
If you're like most people, you haven't arrived yet.

842
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,160
And then you have a friend who's winning some version of the lottery.

843
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,160
And when this is being communicated to you, you're asked to celebrate with them, essentially.

844
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:33,160
And you can discover in yourself a kind of begrudging feeling, whether it's envy or there's a limitation on your capacity to experience what's called sympathetic joy in Buddhism for that person.

845
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,160
And that's an ugly characteristic of the mind.

846
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:41,160
I mean, here's someone who you sensibly really care about. This is someone you really love.

847
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
This is someone who you think...

848
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,160
And their windfall did not come at your expense.

849
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
Right, exactly.

850
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:59,160
And yet there's something in you that can't actually celebrate for them fully because you're so bound up with who you are and what you want for yourself and how you think they may think about you.

851
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:10,160
And I mean, this horror show of self-reference and this miserly spirit with respect to the circumstance you're in with everyone.

852
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:19,160
So what happened in this first MDMA trip is that I just punched through all of that. All of that was just gone.

853
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:25,160
And there was no associated inebriation. I mean, it was just my experience wasn't just bad.

854
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:33,160
That's the thing with MDMA that makes it sort of quite distinct and special from some of these other agents, right, is there is no sense of altered consciousness.

855
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:39,160
Yeah. It can be kind of speedy. And it also depends on whether you're getting...

856
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,160
If you're talking pure MDMA versus yeah, yeah, of course when they cut it with stimulants, it's a different story.

857
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,160
But really pure MDMA doesn't seem to really alter your consciousness in any way.

858
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,160
Yeah.

859
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,160
In the way that LSD would, for example.

860
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:57,160
Right. Yeah. I mean, it's not considered really a psychedelic. It doesn't have any of those visionary or hallucinatory qualities.

861
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,160
Yeah, it's referred to more as an empathogen versus an entheogen, correct?

862
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:08,160
Yeah. Yeah. So having lost all that, I just recognize that one, just how much I loved him and...

863
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:17,160
how that was synonymous with wanting him to be happy. And in some basic sense, his happiness would be my own, right?

864
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:27,160
So the capacity for envy would just completely went out the window. There's just no way to feel a zero sum contest with somebody who you love in that way.

865
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:37,160
But then I recognized that if a stranger had walked into the room at that moment, literally the mailman shows up, I would have felt the same way about him.

866
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:48,160
It was not contingent upon having had a history with this person. I was in a state where I wanted all beings to have their dreams realized.

867
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:53,160
I wish nothing but happiness on every conscious system, right? Effortlessly.

868
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:59,160
Can we pause for a moment so you can explain the neurobiology of that? I've experienced that as well with MDMA.

869
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:10,160
And I find it to be the most joyous state I've ever experienced, to have such...

870
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:22,160
I don't possess... I don't... Unlike you, I don't have the vocabulary to even describe what it feels like, other than to just say, you love everybody in obviously a very non-sexual way.

871
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:31,160
It's just a male, female are all the same. It sort of becomes this... You just want the best for everyone.

872
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:38,160
So what is it about the neurobiology or neurochemistry that can produce that state?

873
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:47,160
And I'll tell you what the follow-up question is going to be. Is there anything we can do outside of taking that drug to even get part of that?

874
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:58,160
Well, unfortunately, I don't know the answer to the neurobiology. I'm not sure it is known. I think most of these drugs are serotonergic, but...

875
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:07,160
But the subtlety of which subset of the receptors they're hitting is... We don't exactly understand the causal relationship between the receptor being...

876
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,160
Frankly, I'm not up on the literature on MDMA, so there may be some clues that I'm not aware of.

877
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:24,160
And I would also add the caveat that some of these drugs, I think there's a reason to be concerned about in terms of the physical effects of taking them too often.

878
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:37,160
MDMA is something that was profoundly useful for me. I remain somewhat concerned that it is potentially neurotoxic. I wouldn't want to take too much of it. I haven't taken it for years.

879
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:47,160
And I have much less of a concern for other psychedelics. I think LSD is... There's no evidence that it's neurotoxic, for instance.

880
01:12:48,160 --> 01:13:01,160
Having spoken with people, psychiatrists who have taken care of patients who have probably taken too much MDMA, the two things that I have learned from them which echo what you're saying is...

881
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:07,160
Yeah, it's generally safe, but it's very important like any drug. I mean, these aren't regulated compounds, right?

882
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:16,160
So you're always running a risk when you take these things of other things that the drug is cut with. And there's toxicity that can be amplified as a result of that.

883
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:32,160
And the second thing that I've been told is anything over a frequency of about every three months and you start to run a risk of these serotonergic toxicities down the line.

884
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:43,160
So you can take that for what it's worth. I mean, I'm certainly not providing guidance on that other than to echo your point that I think one has to be very careful with these agents.

885
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:53,160
But I think now at the same time, I'm not following the work of MAPS that closely. So I'm not sure what doses or frequencies they're using with the vets that they're studying.

886
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,160
Yeah. And I think...

887
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,160
So presumably they've worked out some of these kinks as well.

888
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:05,160
Yeah. But frankly, it would be worth it even if it were neurotoxic to some degree in the right conditions for the right person.

889
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:12,160
So you've had debilitating PTSD, maybe a little bit of long-term consequence or short-term toxicity is worth it to cure that. But...

890
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,160
Yeah.

891
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:31,160
So then back to the second question, which is when you think about that profound empathy in that moment that you had at the age of 18, has your meditative practice, which has obviously evolved greatly since then, allowed you to either transiently or otherwise experience or re-experience that phenomenon?

892
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:36,160
Yeah. Well, there is a practice that targets that mental status. Actually, I referred to it earlier.

893
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,160
You referred to earlier.

894
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:48,160
Yeah. Mehta practice. Mehta is the Pali word for loving kindness. And yeah, there are people who do that practice almost exclusively or almost exclusively.

895
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,160
So describe it a little bit for the listener.

896
01:14:50,160 --> 01:15:03,160
Unlike mindfulness, where you are letting go of any agenda you have for what your experience should be, and you're just reconciling yourself to noticing however it is.

897
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:17,160
And if you do that, your experience does change in reliable ways, many of which are quite pleasant. They can be amazingly pleasant, but it's not about securing those changes or amplifying those changes.

898
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:25,160
Because insofar as that creeps in, you're not being mindful. You're doing something other than merely witnessing what's happening.

899
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:32,160
And doing that is an expression of your own desire and attachment. And you're trying to change your experience.

900
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:38,160
And that's different than simply being mindful of it.

901
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:49,160
But with a practice like Mehta, you do have a goal. You're trying to feel this feeling of loving kindness as intensely as you can feel it, as durably as you can feel it.

902
01:15:49,160 --> 01:16:07,160
And you're trying to acquire a state change, but you're also trying to acquire a trait change in that your default attitude toward other human beings or even any other conscious system would be just well-wishing and good vibes.

903
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:26,160
And there's no question you can train that attitude. And it comes from both a framing effect and from an immersion in this change of state that you can kindle in meditation and then keep humming along based on concentration.

904
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:44,160
So the same faculty of mind that could become one-pointedly focused on a mantra or a sight like a candle flame can become one-pointedly immersed in the feeling of love for all humanity.

905
01:16:45,160 --> 01:17:05,160
And it's initiated by thinking thoughts about other people. So you'll just imagine someone who you love, and it's important that this not be contaminated with your notion of romantic love because so much of what we think of as love in a romantic context is desire and attachment.

906
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,160
And it's not the same-

907
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Is a child an appropriate object of that type of attention?

908
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:25,160
Yeah, a child, a friend, a parent, whoever in your life you can have just as uncomplicated an experience of wishing this person well, wishing them to be free of suffering, wishing them happiness.

909
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:36,160
And the usual progression is to start with someone like that who you know, who's someone who's close to you, and then transition to a neutral person.

910
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:46,160
Someone who you have no just kind of a randomly picked person from the crowd or some public figure who you have no strong association with, but who you can visualize.

911
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,160
And then you're wishing that person happiness, wishing that they be free of suffering.

912
01:17:51,160 --> 01:18:02,160
You're actually thinking these thoughts in your mind as a kind of, almost as a kind of mantra, but you're not, it's not the sound of the utterances, it's the import of them that you're trying to connect with.

913
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
So you're thinking, may you be happy?

914
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
May you be free from suffering?

915
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:22,160
You're reiterating this, you could have, you know, three or four ways of saying it, and you're saying it over and over again, but then connecting with the actual kind of energetics of the wish that you really do wish that this person who you love be free from suffering.

916
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:33,160
And it can become this very deep feeling of basking in this well of good intentions for everybody, right?

917
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:42,160
Because then you can include not only a neutral person, but someone for whom you have a so-called enemy, someone for whom you have a real negative association.

918
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,160
And then you begin to see the importance of framing around all these things.

919
01:18:46,160 --> 01:19:02,160
So just like you said for the customer service situation, it just takes a second to realize, wait a minute, here's a person who's been standing at this desk since six o'clock in the morning, meeting one disgruntled person after the next, and now she or he has just met me.

920
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,160
Their experience is completely different from mine.

921
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:16,160
Which by the way is a beautiful cut to the sort of issue that David Foster Wallace talks about so much, is every experience we have is only through our lens, right?

922
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,160
Yeah.

923
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:27,160
It's that insight alone, which now you're giving a very tangible example of, is so powerful just to be able to hit pause on that for a moment and say what you just said, right?

924
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:33,160
This person's been standing here for seven hours, seeing one pissed off face after another.

925
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,160
What they're seeing now is totally different from what I'm seeing.

926
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,160
Yeah. Yeah.

927
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,160
And your impatience isn't helping.

928
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,160
And you are so glad that you're not in their shoes, right?

929
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,160
Like you don't want their job.

930
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,160
You actually feel compassion for their experience, right?

931
01:19:51,160 --> 01:20:02,160
And there are many hacks of this kind where you're driving in traffic and someone cuts you off and your default experience is what an asshole.

932
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:08,160
But it just takes a second to realize, wait a minute, you have no idea what's going on with this person.

933
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,160
You don't know if this person is in a rush because they have some real emergency.

934
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:16,160
You don't know if they're 90 years old.

935
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,160
Now you just honked at some 90 year old man or woman, right?

936
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,160
And who's the asshole now?

937
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:31,160
There's so many changes of frame applied to the exact same experience, which just fundamentally change your interpretation of it.

938
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:47,160
A loving kindness practice is based on a fundamental frame change for more or less everything you can encounter in human affairs, which is everyone is suffering.

939
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:53,160
Everyone was once a child condemned to now be the adult they now are, right?

940
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,160
So like there is no evil person who invented himself, right?

941
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:03,160
There's no like, this is something I've talked about with respect to Saddam Hussein in the past.

942
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:12,160
I usually talk about this in the context of talking about free will, but I mean, just look at someone like the prototypical evil person, you know, Saddam Hussein is about as good as it gets, right?

943
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,160
So you look at him as a 40 year old man.

944
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:22,160
He's just a terrifyingly evil sociopath who, if you're in favor of the death penalty, it definitely applies to him.

945
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:28,160
But you roll back his his lifeline by a few decades.

946
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:35,160
And at a certain point, you see, OK, here's a 12 year old boy who could have well been a scary 12 year old boy.

947
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:51,160
But, you know, when he's four years old, he's a four year old and he's a four year old who has every strike against him in the sense that he's guaranteed, it seems to be a morally damaged human being.

948
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,160
He's living in a society riven by sectarian conflict.

949
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:07,160
The norms to which he's being pushed, the aspirations he can form in this context are barbaric by any standard, you know, ethical standard that we would form today.

950
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:15,160
Right. And the kind of person who can thrive in that context is someone who's morally damaged by our lights.

951
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,160
And he didn't pick his parents, he didn't pick his genes.

952
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,160
He's not the author of himself.

953
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:28,160
And yet he's going to become this evil person who, you know, half the world or more will think is deserving of death at the end of it.

954
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,160
It's possible to feel compassion even for someone like Saddam Hussein.

955
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,160
That's a reframing that may be hard for some people to get there.

956
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:41,160
But for someone who's practicing a state like Mehta, that's the frame.

957
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:53,160
And if you can get there, you can recognize that there is this capacity for love and well-wishing that really extends without limit to every conscious system.

958
01:22:53,160 --> 01:23:08,160
And you want everyone to be relieved of all their problems on some basic level, because the most badly behaved people in the world are, for the most part, expressing their problems.

959
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:18,160
Even when you have a truly sadistic person who seems to be deriving pleasure from causing other people suffering, and such people exist,

960
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:26,160
what you're witnessing there is someone for whom all these other sources of pleasure and well-being are basically unavailable.

961
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,160
This person on some level can't know what he's missing.

962
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:42,160
You know, this is a person who's never going to have good relationships of the sort that you and I would demand for ourselves and everyone we love as the necessary ingredients of a life well-lived.

963
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:47,160
It's not to say you wouldn't want to put this person in jail because there is no cure for this problem.

964
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:53,160
I'm not recommending that we not protect ourselves from a level in people, but you don't actually have to hate them.

965
01:23:54,160 --> 01:24:02,160
I mean, feeling compassion for these people isn't incompatible with taking the steps we need to take to keep society orderly and safe.

966
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:10,160
You know, one thing I would recommend to anybody who's interested in pulling a little more on this thread is to do a prison visit.

967
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,160
Yeah, I've never done that, but I heard you and Tim did that, right?

968
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:24,160
Tim and I did it, and I did a podcast with a guy named Corey McCarthy, who himself was incarcerated for seven years for attempted murder and a bunch of other stuff.

969
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:33,160
There's a group of three or four or five of us that actually went and spent a couple of days at a maximum security prison, and we played this game there.

970
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:39,160
It's called Step to the Line, which I'm sure you've heard of, and it's a game that's played in many reasons,

971
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,160
but the purpose is always to basically highlight our similarities and our differences.

972
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,160
So on the one side of the line were all of these inmates.

973
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:52,160
Now, we're in a maximum security prison in California, so everybody in that room, I don't remember the exact numbers.

974
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,160
I believe 70% of those men were serving life sentences.

975
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:05,160
Some staggering number of these guys were in there because of, you know, homicide or, you know, something more than like they were trafficking some marijuana, right?

976
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:21,160
And on the other side are all of us as volunteers, and then the game begins of Step to the Line if, and some of the differences are so humbling that you can't be a reasonable human being and be in that situation and not be moved by it.

977
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:32,160
You know, Step to the Line if you had two parents in your household, and amongst the volunteers, you know, maybe 60% step forward, and amongst the inmates, I think one step forward.

978
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:44,160
You know, Step to the Line if someone close to you died before you were 10, you know, or died a violent death before you were 10, you know, these sorts of things.

979
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:55,160
And, you know, Step to the Line if you grew up in a home that had more than five books, and those of us as volunteers, most of us step forward of the inmates, you know, five step forward out of 50, that kind of thing.

980
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,160
And it's to your point, right?

981
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:17,160
It's like we're not going to excuse the mistakes that took place, and there's, you know, society has said there's going to be a price that one has to pay for one mistakes, but boy, you realize pretty quickly the randomness that allows you or me to be standing on one side of that line and not the other.

982
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:27,160
Yeah, no, if you were in precisely that other person's situation, genetically, environmentally, you would be that other person, right?

983
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:32,160
There's just there is no daylight between all of those causes and conditions and the outcome.

984
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:39,160
And even if even adding randomness, I mean, you know, quantum mechanics doesn't get you out of the situation.

985
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:46,160
And I think of all the times I've been lucky, like when I was in eighth grade, there was a kid that was a year ahead who was like my hero.

986
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,160
You know, he was the absolute toughest kid in the school.

987
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,160
I mean, he was the bad, the badass.

988
01:26:51,160 --> 01:27:00,160
And he took me under his wing, you know, so I was like really lucky to be the eighth grader who this super tough badass kid really liked.

989
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,160
And two years later, he wound up in jail for armed robbery.

990
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:14,160
And I've often thought to myself, I was so impressionable that if I had been with him on that night and he said, look, we're going to go hold up a liquor store.

991
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:22,160
I'm not sure I would have had the common sense, the intestinal fortitude, the whatever, the courage to say, dude, that's a bad idea.

992
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,160
I'm not going to go.

993
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,160
It's so easy that I could have gone along for that.

994
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:38,160
And as I learned later on, once you get in that system, like, you know, once you're 16 years old and you're pegged for armed robbery, like, it's very hard to recover to Stanford.

995
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,160
Yeah.

996
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,160
So, but that's a moment's decision.

997
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,160
And the luck is like, were you there or not there?

998
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,160
Right.

999
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:51,160
And I have way more cards that are favorable in my deck than virtually all of these guys I met.

1000
01:27:51,160 --> 01:28:05,160
And yet I still could have easily slipped over that, you know, into that abyss of that endless vicious cycle of one knock after another until before you know it, like you're 40 years old and you're in prison for life.

1001
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,160
Yeah.

1002
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:12,160
So the philosophical insight here goes by the name of moral luck.

1003
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:19,160
And I think it originates with an essay that the philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote probably 30 years ago.

1004
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:32,160
We rarely recognize how morally significant differences in luck are and just how lucky you need to be to live a good moral life.

1005
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,160
Any one of those things could have been marginally different.

1006
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,160
And you'd be the guy who was an accessory to armed robbery.

1007
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,160
Right.

1008
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:50,160
I mean, just think of how many times most of us have driven drunk or not 100 percent and nothing bad happened.

1009
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:57,160
The difference between nothing bad happening and killing somebody in a crosswalk is enormous and just life deranging.

1010
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:07,160
Stranger still, because it's now it's not even classed for most people as a significant risk they're running texting while driving.

1011
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:15,160
I mean, I would say most of the people listening to this podcast have not totally shut down their texting while driving.

1012
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:21,160
They're not they're not even thinking of it as a grotesquely irresponsible thing to be doing.

1013
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,160
Right.

1014
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:31,160
It's it's too tempting. You're at a red light. But being at a red light migrates into the first hundred feet of your now responding to a green light.

1015
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,160
And then there is the moment on the freeway.

1016
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:45,160
And then and every day there's some totally normal, responsible, upstanding person like you or me who kill somebody's kid in a crosswalk because they were texting.

1017
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:49,160
The significance of that difference in luck.

1018
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:54,160
It's extraordinary. And these are these are unrecoverable errors most of the time.

1019
01:29:54,160 --> 01:30:06,160
So the two sides of that one, it can get you to to take more care in all the spots where more care massively increases your odds of living a happy, fulfilling life.

1020
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:13,160
But it also can give you this different framing that allows you to feel compassion for even the worst people on Earth.

1021
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:19,160
Right. You recognize that if you change enough of the variables, you would be playing the same game they're playing.

1022
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,160
And this is so important, Sam.

1023
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:29,160
I don't think I understood how important this was until I read something you wrote, which I'm paraphrasing.

1024
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:40,160
So I'll be bastardizing it. But the gist of it was it's really the the caliber quality of our thoughts that determine the quality of our life.

1025
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,160
And so let's take a most extreme example.

1026
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:48,160
I had a friend who was killed by a motorist who was texting. So he was on his bike.

1027
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,160
He couldn't have been in a safer spot, actually.

1028
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:58,160
And a woman, you know, got distracted for a moment and killed him.

1029
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:06,160
And I was angry in a way that sort of felt like it was never going to go away.

1030
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,160
And truthfully, a big part of it was selfish. It was I don't want this to happen to me now.

1031
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:17,160
You know, I'm at the time I was a cyclist, I was like, I'm sick and tired of seeing cyclists get hit.

1032
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:20,160
And some of the times they're getting killed, but they're getting hit all the time.

1033
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:25,160
Right. And it's it always seems to be these not always, but 90 percent of the time it's these distracted drivers.

1034
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:33,160
Sometimes the cyclist just does something stupid. But for the most part, if you get hit, if a road, if a cyclist in the road gets hit, the driver's usually at fault.

1035
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:37,160
Interestingly, unless alcohol is involved, those drivers are never prosecuted.

1036
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:46,160
Right. And I spent so much time being so pissed off. And part of it was just my own grandiosity, like my life is too valuable.

1037
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:52,160
I'm not going to die on the side of a road because some driver's too stupid to turn off their phone or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1038
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:59,160
But then I had, you know, after kind of reading something you wrote, I reflected on it years later and thought,

1039
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:04,160
I've never once asked myself what that person is going through who killed Nick. Yeah. Yeah.

1040
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:13,160
What is her life like today? Because there's no way she forgot that. There's no way she doesn't go to bed at night and think about the fact that she.

1041
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:20,160
It's such a tragic story. Not only did she kill a guy who's just a beautiful soul who had, you know, a bunch of children.

1042
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:28,160
He was killed two days before his life insurance policy kicked in. He was killed on, I believe it was May 30th.

1043
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:34,160
No, it was May 31st and he had a policy that didn't start till June 1st. I mean, it's like you couldn't make this story up.

1044
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:42,160
It's so tragic. But it's too easy to not reflect on her pain. Yeah. You could say, well, Peter, that's ridiculous.

1045
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:55,160
She doesn't deserve any empathy. Put all of that empathy towards Nick's family. But in the end, if I'm really optimizing for my own quality of life,

1046
01:32:55,160 --> 01:33:02,160
there's no upside to just being upset about this. Like there's some benefit to accepting the fact that everybody here loses.

1047
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:09,160
And if that makes me less angry and makes me hate that person less, isn't that a good way to think about things?

1048
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:21,160
Well, yeah, but I would even put it more strongly because I can't. She, the driver was profoundly unlucky because she was she was guilty of doing something that all of us have done.

1049
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:36,160
Everyone listening to this podcast has done and didn't pay that price. Worse still, she's guilty of doing something that most of the people listening to this podcast will continue to do even after hearing this podcast.

1050
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:43,160
This is a reset that I'm convinced most people are not quite ready for. At a certain point, self-driving cars will come to the rescue.

1051
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:55,160
But the difference between being someone who was texting and didn't even notice the danger because nothing bad happened and being someone who killed your friend is just luck.

1052
01:33:55,160 --> 01:34:17,160
And so, yeah, and you can only imagine how awful it has been to be the person who was irresponsibly texting and who killed somebody in the prime of their life just to hear the details and to have been the person who initiated that tsunami of suffering.

1053
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:27,160
Just imagine a website where you present the texts that were the proximate cause of death.

1054
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,160
How irrelevant they must have been.

1055
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:38,160
The juxtaposition between what people felt couldn't wait another 30 seconds or 30 minutes and the tragedy.

1056
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,160
And what all resulted in the loss of life.

1057
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,160
Yeah, it would be astonishing. I mean, we can all predict what it would be, but...

1058
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:45,160
That's a sick idea, but it's a pretty damn good idea.

1059
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:53,160
Yeah, again, it's just if you imagine what that woman went through, you would not want to trade places with her.

1060
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:59,160
So I want to shift gears for a moment and go back to the discussion I had a week ago with one of my friends who's a patient.

1061
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:03,160
He's been really struggling the last few months.

1062
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:08,160
He's a father. He's a wonderful guy. He's got two kids, three dogs.

1063
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:15,160
And he's a guy with a really big heart. So he's one of these guys who just...

1064
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,160
I don't know. You get the sense he could never be upset at anybody.

1065
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:22,160
He could never not want to take care of somebody around him.

1066
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:33,160
But one of the dogs, which was the first dog he ever had, died, had cancer, and they went through a bunch of treatments, and the dog ultimately died.

1067
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:39,160
And I think for him, losing that dog was certainly on the spectrum of losing a child.

1068
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:43,160
I don't think it's the same, but I think for him it was very difficult.

1069
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:49,160
He's been unable to sort of get back in the saddle, so to speak.

1070
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:54,160
And it's reflected in, frankly, his cortisol levels. I've never seen cortisol levels so high.

1071
01:35:54,160 --> 01:36:01,160
So his degree of hypercorticillemia is, if you didn't know better, you'd think he had a cortisol-secreting tumor, actually.

1072
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:15,160
It's so profound. And we were talking about it, and he confessed that he couldn't stop dreading the death of his other two dogs, who were aged six and seven or something like that.

1073
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:21,160
So these aren't dogs that are going to die tomorrow. In fact, these aren't even dogs that are sick in any way, shape, or form.

1074
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:37,160
But as he's three months out from the death of this dog that was probably 14 or 15, he's spending every moment now dreading the loss of these dogs that are going to die in five years or something like that.

1075
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:48,160
And it was very hard for me to try to console him because I didn't want to be dismissive of the pain, but I also wanted to remind him that that's the antithesis of being present.

1076
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:54,160
But your children and your two dogs are right here with you right now, and they're perfect.

1077
01:36:54,160 --> 01:37:04,160
And all the worrying you can do about when these two dogs die doesn't change the fact that they're going to die, but you don't know when and you don't know how, when you don't know any of these things.

1078
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:23,160
How would you explain to someone like that in not necessarily the most technical sense, but maybe in sort of an appeal to their emotion, why this effort isn't going to pan out and why there needs to be a new strategy for getting over this loss?

1079
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:31,160
Well, it depends on whether or not the person is living an examined life of the sort that we've been discussing.

1080
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:38,160
So this is a person who has no meditation practice and is not interested in that mode.

1081
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:52,160
He is. So I've given him your books. He has been going through the meditation course that you have, but is still having a real hard time, like all of us, I think, in taking the time to be present.

1082
01:37:53,160 --> 01:38:07,160
And I think that's the transition. I think the theory makes sense to him, but it's now, how does one actually bridge that gap?

1083
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:14,160
So for the purpose of the discussion, let's say he accepts conceptually the value of this.

1084
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:23,160
Yeah. Well, so then to become sensitive to the actual mechanics of suffering, I mean, the only way to suffer this dog's absence is to think about it and not know that you're thinking about it.

1085
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:32,160
Right. So it is to be subsumed by this process of ideation and to have no perspective on it.

1086
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,160
And I think that's a good thing.

1087
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:56,160
It is to be subsumed by this process of ideation and to have no perspective on it. And framing can help here. So you can you can say, well, there were many experiences he had with this dog alive where the dog wasn't physically present.

1088
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:10,160
Right. The dog leaves the room. There's no greater absence from a room than simply leaving it. Right. Now it's an additional operation to think, well, there's a big difference because I'll never see him again. Right.

1089
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:17,160
But everyone you love in the world, animals, you're the only person I love who's in this room. Exactly. Right. They're all out of this room.

1090
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:43,160
Out of this room. So in principle, you know what it's like to be content in moments where in the physical absence of everyone you love in this world, it's possible. And the only way to make it intolerable to be in a room without everyone you love is to meditate on how intolerable it is that they're not in the room with you right now.

1091
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:57,160
Right now. And this is why meditation is such an amazing skill because it has a point of contact with your prison story. This is a point I make several places. I think I make it in my book, Waking Up.

1092
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:08,160
The amazing thing about meditation is that once you actually know how to meditate, it's possible to be alone in a room for weeks and months and even years.

1093
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:32,160
Several teachers I've studied with had spent literally years alone in caves where in most people's lives, solitary confinement is considered a punishment even in a circumstance where to be outside of that room is to be surrounded by murderers and rapists who you might have to fight. Right.

1094
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:57,160
So like even in prison, people don't want to be in solitary confinement because it's so intolerable to be left alone with your thoughts. There's an evolutionary rationale for this. I mean, we are clearly evolved to be social primates and a circumstance where you find yourself alone more or less forever is not an optimum in evolutionary terms.

1095
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:12,160
But it's just simply a fact of the human mind that it's possible to discover a form of well-being that not only survives contact with solitude, but it's just totally undiminished by solitude.

1096
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:41,160
And if you can discover that even for moments at a time, you can then enjoy the company of everyone you love without this feeling that your well-being is at its core predicated on being able to have them at any moment you want or that is predicated on the totally forlorn hope that this circumstance is going to endure forever, that no one will die.

1097
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:56,160
That no one will leave you. We know that's not in the cards. And we need to find whatever form of well-being is possible given the fact that things are continually changing.

1098
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:14,160
Your thought experiment, or not, I mean, it wasn't really a thought experiment, but it made me think of something was, think of all the people who are thrust into solitary confinement. I mean, tragically in this country, it's an absolute epidemic in the US prison system.

1099
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:29,160
And for all of the realities of how inhumane that is, especially for the lengths of time people find themselves in there, do you think there's a subset of people who inadvertently stumble into mindfulness without being formally taught?

1100
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:44,160
The analogy would be like if I threw 16-year-old Sam into a weight room, but I'd never shown him, or forget a weight room, into a basketball court. You'd never seen basketball before. There is a basketball. There is a net.

1101
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:56,160
And I said, you know, you're confined to this room for a year. Like, at some point, will you figure out picking up the ball, bouncing it? I wonder how hard it is to put that ball through that hoop over there, shooting at all of those things.

1102
01:42:56,160 --> 01:43:04,160
I mean, it seems unlikely, right? It seems like on some level you would have to at least be shown what to do. And then even if you're left alone, if you could come back to that lesson.

1103
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:24,160
And so similarly, you take a guy and let's say you put him in solitary confinement for a year. He's had no exposure to mindfulness. Is there a chance he's going to spontaneously figure out, oh my God, this is far less painful if I'm actually present in, you know, the sensations of my body versus the ruminations and thoughts that are going to torment me?

1104
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:38,160
Or is that something that is just so counterintuitive to the ethos of who we are that no way, like, you know, you're going to have to have had some exposure to this to at least be able to be thrust in that environment.

1105
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:48,160
It's definitely possible because it is just the way consciousness is if you're paying attention. So it's there to be recognized in each moment.

1106
01:43:48,160 --> 01:44:00,160
But the odds are against anyone doing it. I mean, there are people who have spontaneously awakened to this. I mean, they're kind of famous, you know, adepts in certainly in the Eastern tradition.

1107
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:17,160
There are also the Western philosophers who have had intimations of this where Jean-Jacques Rousseau has a story about riding in a boat on a lake, I think, and spontaneously falling into kind of some very open and non-ego-centric state of consciousness that, you know,

1108
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:28,160
we would recognize. But the difference between having clear information and a clear map and not or having an erroneous one is just enormous.

1109
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:39,160
So I know I wouldn't have been able to have done it. Like when I think about how counterintuitive, how difficult it is to practice mindfulness, to go through the practice.

1110
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:40,160


1111
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:46,160
Like I think if you'd put me in solitary confinement for a hundred years, I would have never stumbled into that.

1112
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,160
Yeah.

1113
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:50,160
Fortunately, I would have been confined to, you know, just been tortured.

1114
01:44:51,160 --> 01:45:15,160
Well, also, worse still, it's possible to be practicing mindfulness and to be on retreat and not recognize many of the things that you really do want to recognize about the nature of the mind, because the way the mindfulness has been taught to you is, however, subtly encouraging of a kind of goal-seeking practice.

1115
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:28,160
And this is something I write about in my book and talk about in my app. It's possible to be practicing mindfulness in a way that is dualistic.

1116
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,160
It's kind of ramifying of the subject-object perception.

1117
01:45:32,160 --> 01:46:01,160
And therefore, the goal of recognizing the selflessness of consciousness and being relieved of this sense of ego at the center of it, the sense that there's a meditator or a thinker of thoughts or an experiencer of experience, that that can be posited as the ultimate goal of some incredibly laborious spiritual path that just has to be traversed by increments over years.

1118
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:14,160
And that's an error. That's a mistake. I mean, that's just not true. It's already true of consciousness, that the ego is an illusion. And that can be realized directly.

1119
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:22,160
And the expectation that it can't be is, in some basic sense, self-fulfilling for most people.

1120
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:43,160
So, yeah, you can be in the most auspicious circumstance, having devoted a massive part of your life to just practicing mindfulness, and still be in a kind of crucible of unnecessary seeking and suffering, because you just you have an erroneous understanding of what the path actually is.

1121
01:46:43,160 --> 01:47:00,160
I want there a couple of sort of semantics I want to you've already alluded to a little bit that the relationship between Vipassana and mindfulness, where does Dzogchen fit into this? And like, if you were to try to draw a Venn diagram of these different concepts, how would they overlap?

1122
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:16,160
So, Vipassana is the name of the practice in Theravada Buddhism, the oldest tradition of Buddhism. And this is the Buddhism of Thailand and Burma and Sri Lanka.

1123
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:36,160
And Vipassana, as I said, means insight. And you're having insight into what are thought of as the fundamental characteristics of all phenomenon. And these are impermanence and selflessness and unsatisfactoriness.

1124
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:50,160
It is often misleadingly translated as suffering rather than unsatisfactoriness. So many people believe that the Buddha taught that life is suffering or that all experience contains some intrinsic suffering.

1125
01:47:50,160 --> 01:48:11,160
That's not quite the message. It's that life is a circumstance where there is no unchanging fully satisfactory basis for one's happiness, because everything is changing. It's by virtue of impermanence that the boat is always leaking.

1126
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:27,160
We're always baling water. We're always responding to some slow emergency, really, where our health is always put in question. There's always some new pain arising in the body because we're simply not moving. You always have to respond to something.

1127
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:45,160
And our pleasures, however hard one, are fleeting. They're vanishing even in the act of acquiring them. So there's no place to land that is secure. And that's largely by virtue of the impermanence of sensory experience.

1128
01:48:45,160 --> 01:49:06,160
But the selflessness component is separable from those two other characteristics. And I should say, that's Vipassana. Vipassana is a practice whereby you have insight into those three characteristics. And mindfulness is the tool you use to have those insights.

1129
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:30,160
The training in mindfulness is a training in a kind of awareness of experience which is non-judgmental, non-reactive. You're not seeking to maximize pleasure. You're not trying to make pains go away. You're just becoming interested in a very open and focused way on just what the character of every experience is.

1130
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:45,160
So if you're feeling restless, rather than try not to feel restless, you're becoming interested in and increasingly aware of the actual characteristics moment to moment of restlessness. How is it that you know you're restless? Where is it? What is it?

1131
01:49:45,160 --> 01:50:03,160
We're talking about a pattern of energy in the body that you can suddenly recognize is arising totally on its own and changing based on its own dynamics. And you are merely the witness of that change in state. And so it is with any pleasant emotion or experience.

1132
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:23,160
And you keep dropping back into merely witnessing. And that is mindfulness when you can do it. When you're actually not trying to change anything, you're not judging anything, and you're not staying at the conceptual level. You're not thinking about experience. You're just experiencing experience more and more closely.

1133
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:44,160
And so if it's a matter of paying attention to sensations in the body, you're not staying at the level where you feel like, oh, my hands are sweaty. No, you're actually feeling the temperature and the tingling and the pressure so closely that the concept of hands and sweat disappear.

1134
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:57,160
So you're just feeling the raw data of experience. And these changes can be pleasant. I mean, your sense of even having a body can disappear while you're meditating. And it just resolves into a cloud of sensation.

1135
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:26,160
So Zogchen is a Tibetan practice tradition, which is explicitly non-dualistic. And what that means in this context is it goes after the selflessness of the mind very directly. So most of us start meditating where we are in our normal states of cognition with the sense that there's a subject.

1136
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:42,160
In the middle of experience, there's a mind in the head. And it is by definition separate from everything that it knows. Right. So there's the subject that can be aware of sights and sounds and sensations.

1137
01:51:42,160 --> 01:52:03,160
And this subject is also a thinker. It's producing, in some sense, the author of thoughts. And it's me. And I feel like I'm over here in my head behind my face, almost wearing my face as a kind of mask. Right. I'm not identical to my face. I'm behind my face. And you're looking across space at me.

1138
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:28,160
And your gaze has an implication for me, because if I follow where you're looking, I'm over here and not identical to my body. Right. I'm in my body. I'm a kind of passenger in my body. I mean, you and I can say, well, my hand is... I've got an injury to my hand. And you and I can both look at my hand as a kind of object in space. My hand is part of the world. Yeah.

1139
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:49,160
Yeah. And, you know, obviously I care more about my hand than you do because it's my hand. But if something's wrong with my hand, I'm still over here up in my head behind my eyes, some distance from the hand. And I can imagine being without the hand. Right. It could be, you know, if I lost my hand in an accident, well, then I would have one last hand. But I'd still be me up here in my head behind my eyes. Right.

1140
01:52:50,160 --> 01:53:13,160
That locus of knowing that sense of being located in the head as a self, as an ego is the starting point for everyone in meditation. And you can do Vipassana from that starting point. You can be taught the method of mindfulness meditation. And you just begin to pay more and more attention to what it's like to be you.

1141
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:35,160
And you can notice these three characteristics of impermanence and selflessness and unsatisfactoriness. The Pali is Anicha, Dukkha, and Anatta, or Anicha, Anatta, and Dukkha in that order. And you can start from wherever you are. And who knows how long it will take you to have this insight, a fundamental insight into the illusoriness of that starting point of being a subject in the head.

1142
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:54,160
Now with Zogchen, you can't start until you've had that insight. And so the path of Zogchen entails becoming available to that insight in various ways. It's usually a matter of actually forming a connection with what's called the Zogchen master in the Tibetan tradition.

1143
01:53:55,160 --> 01:54:02,160
As someone who can actually point this out to you in conversation. And for most people...

1144
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:13,160
Meaning they can point out to you when you are falling to the illusion of ego? Meaning they can point out when you are defaulting back into that mode?

1145
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:30,160
Well, no, they can point out the intrinsic egolessness of consciousness in a way that you can recognize it and then practice that. Right? Because most people, they start meditating. They still feel like they're up in their heads paying attention.

1146
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:44,160
Now I'm paying attention to the breath. Now I'm noticing the difference between being lost in thought and being mindful. But it doesn't fundamentally cut through the sense that there is one who can be mindful. Right?

1147
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:56,160
And you can have experiences where the distance, the apparent distance between subject and object can collapse. But they can come in a haphazard way.

1148
01:54:56,160 --> 01:55:01,160
Where you don't know how you had them and you don't know how you'll have them again. Right?

1149
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:18,160
You can come by virtue of paying closer and closer attention to sounds and sensations and things that are arising. And you can suddenly feel like in that moment of hearing that bird, there was no me and there was no bird. There was just hearing.

1150
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:37,160
That can collapse again and again. And it did for me when I was spending time on retreat practicing vipassana. But I always associated it with the intense concentration of retreat. And it seemed unavailable to me in ordinary moments of consciousness.

1151
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:48,160
You know, off retreat, you know, I'm driving in traffic or, you know, working at my computer or whatever. Like there's no way I'm going to touch that level of concentration. You know, I haven't been spending 14 hours a day meditating.

1152
01:55:48,160 --> 01:56:04,160
So this is a kind of a peak experience that isn't available now. Well, with zouchen you discover that the reverse is true. All the peak experiences are no more empty of self than ordinary waking consciousness is.

1153
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:15,160
And you can recognize this about consciousness in any moment. And it doesn't actually require previous moments of building momentum.

1154
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:32,160
Framing really counts for a lot here. So I spent a lot of time practicing with this one Burmese meditation master Upandita Sayedow. And the analogy he would often use is that progress in vipassana is like rubbing two sticks together to get fire.

1155
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:46,160
The moment you stop, the heat dissipates and you're back to zero. Right? So it's like you'd have the sense of you'd be on retreat with him practicing for, you know, up to 20 hours a day and trying to make your mindfulness absolutely continuous.

1156
01:56:46,160 --> 01:57:01,160
So that's the difference between sitting and walking meditation and every other moment. I mean, you're doing a ton of sitting and walking meditation. It's like 16 hours a day of that. But every other moment when like you're going to meals or anything else, you wake up and get out of bed in the morning.

1157
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:26,160
Every transitional moment, getting a cup of tea. You're trying to link every instant of conscious awareness together with mindfulness. And whenever you would get distracted, part of you would begin scoring that as a failure to build up enough momentum to get to the goal of the fundamental breakthrough that was on offer by that path.

1158
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:38,160
So this framing, this idea that you're rubbing two sticks together, the moment you stop, they're cooling off and you've made no progress. Right? That's the opposite framing for zogchen.

1159
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:54,160
The framing you need for zogchen is there's this something already true of consciousness. You're not trying to produce this thing. You're not trying to get rid of the ego. You're not trying to change anything about what is.

1160
01:57:54,160 --> 01:58:08,160
You're trying to recognize a feature of consciousness that is already the case. And it's actually nearer to you than you think. It's not a matter of going deep within and having some kind of breakthrough.

1161
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:18,160
It's actually right on the surface of the most ordinary form of consciousness. It doesn't require any pyrotechnic change in the contents of consciousness.

1162
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:34,160
You're not actually closer to it if you take acid and all the colors begin to change. You feel a change in your energy such that you feel this kind of buzz of connectedness to all things.

1163
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:46,160
As anyone who's taken acid can verify that's on offer. But all of that's interesting. All of that's, I'm not discounting the power of those experiences.

1164
01:58:47,160 --> 01:59:04,160
Those experiences are no less empty of self than every state of consciousness. It's precisely the state of consciousness that's compatible with reaching for a glass of water and drinking it without anything novel intruding.

1165
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:18,160
There's no bliss. There's no rapture. There's no profound or spiritual change in state. It's possible to recognize in that moment that there's no center to consciousness.

1166
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:29,160
What Zogchen is, is the path of discovering that there's no center and then taking that insight as your only object of mindfulness.

1167
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:36,160
So that what you're mindful of thereafter is that there's no center to consciousness.

1168
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:45,160
So whatever is appearing, sights, sounds, sensations, you are continually dropping the implied center.

1169
01:59:45,160 --> 02:00:07,160
It's kind of a steep path because it's hard to start. You can't really start. I mean, everything you're doing before you have that insight and can notice it again on demand, everything you're doing is by definition a preliminary practice to that because you need enough mindfulness to notice what is to be noticed and to follow the instructions to start that path.

1170
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:18,160
But you certainly don't have to have spent years on retreat to start that path. And so having good information is certainly better than having misleading information there.

1171
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:36,160
This practice, as I said, is challenging. There's no two ways around it. I think for some people it's probably as difficult as saying to someone who's 40 years old, who's never exercised deliberately a day in their life,

1172
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:43,160
okay, it's time to start spending an hour a day in the gym and you're going to be doing these new movements and they're going to be very uncomfortable.

1173
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:51,160
And for many people, a few weeks or months into that exercise routine, they're still not finding any great source of pleasure.

1174
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:59,160
And there are some of us who love exercising. Like we just get a, again, going back to the lingo of states versus traits.

1175
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:21,160
I worked out this morning before I saw you and I mean, I was in a new gym for the first time and sometimes that is a little, you're sort of like, I don't know where all the equipment is or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but regardless, it's just the actual state of exercise to me is so pleasurable, even if it didn't offer any traits that were advantageous outside of it.

1176
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:35,160
Of course, the real reason we exercise is not for the hour that we're in the gym moving around these artificial pieces of iron. It's because of the benefit that gives us both metabolically and structurally beyond the time we're exercising.

1177
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:48,160
Is it safe to say that for most people, the experience of meditation doesn't produce a state that is necessarily as pleasurable as say the MDMA state was that you could describe?

1178
02:01:48,160 --> 02:02:00,160
And that really the reason this ought to be considered by someone who is not meditating is more the traits that come outside of the act of the practice?

1179
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:18,160
Yes, well, so it's possible to have extremely pleasant states arise in meditation, both ones that have a kind of ethical implication like loving kindness and ones that just are sort of the equivalent of you being on heroin, right?

1180
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:26,160
So it's not necessarily pointed in any auspicious or pro social direction. It's just you experiencing more pleasure than you've ever experienced.

1181
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:40,160
But none of those experiences really can be the point because they're transitory. When they're gone, they really are gone. I mean, the demeaning analogy to drugs is not inaccurate.

1182
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:50,160
Like, what's the point if it's just a matter of getting high and you're no better person in the world as a result of having had that experience?

1183
02:02:50,160 --> 02:03:05,160
So it really is about having a fundamentally different relationship to experience in general. All of the counterproductive ways in which you grasp at the pleasant and push the unpleasant away.

1184
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:17,160
I just said, like, that is the fairly Buddhist framing of it. But I think it's appropriate. Basically, it's about not suffering unnecessarily in the end, right?

1185
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:33,160
And then not broadcasting your suffering to the rest of humanity. So it can't be about having an experience that's extremely pleasant and become becoming more and more attached to that experience.

1186
02:03:34,160 --> 02:04:00,160
And so that's one of the things that's misleading and a potential downside of getting very good at so-called concentration practices or absorption practices is that they don't have the power to give you a perspective that is a fundamental antidote to egocentricity and selfishness and even starkly unethical instincts in other areas of your life.

1187
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:11,160
And they really can be fundamentally no more interesting from a larger examined life perspective than a drug experience.

1188
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:29,160
I mean, to take some clear examples here, there have been gurus who have behaved shockingly, unethically in their lives and had their reputations ruined and just leave a wake of unhappy and even destroyed people behind them who...

1189
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:45,160
There was no doubt were meditative athletes and in many cases focused on concentration practices. So if you had asked, well, what was it like to be these gurus when they were meditating? Certainly not all of them were frauds.

1190
02:04:45,160 --> 02:05:13,160
Many of them were truly talented meditators, but they were meditating in a way that was not... It was a separate game they were playing. And again, it was a game that was probably produced immense pleasure while they were doing it, but it didn't fully undercut everything else about them that was going to be fairly monstrous in relationship to other human beings.

1191
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:28,160
This is where framing or the overall concept of what one is doing is pretty important because there are pathological states of pleasure. There are even pathological states of spiritual pleasure.

1192
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:45,160
I think the suicide bomber before he detonates his bomb, they're in states of a kind of ecstasy. I mean, they have a religious expectation for what's about to happen, which entails going to paradise and experiencing more pleasure than anyone can imagine.

1193
02:05:45,160 --> 02:06:04,160
And in almost every case that's sincere and deeply felt and these people are about to get whatever they want and they know the creator of the universe is happy that they're going to get it. So that there's nothing about ecstasy per se that is good or even benign because it can be pointed in the wrong direction.

1194
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:08,160
It's a missile that doesn't necessarily come with a guidance system.

1195
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:29,160
Yeah. And I think what we're looking for to lead truly better lives across the board is something that is anchored to an ethics, for lack of a better word, where our spiritual or contemplative tools are actually making us better people across the board.

1196
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:49,160
And again, there's some bright lines here that I think are useful to draw. I mean, so for instance, not lying is a major variable for me ethically. It's just like having formed a commitment to being honest in basically every situation that wasn't like a self-defense situation.

1197
02:06:49,160 --> 02:07:10,160
I don't think you have to be honest to the person who's attacking you or seems likely to attack you. But to put dishonesty somewhere on the continuum of violence and only resort to it where things have broken down so much that you're just not dealing with another person as though they're a rational interlocutor, that is massively simplifying of a person's life.

1198
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:14,160
Now, very few people have made that commitment, but having made it...

1199
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:19,160
When did you make that commitment? I know you've spoken about this, but how old were you when you decided that...

1200
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:28,160
I was 18. It was freshman year in college. I took a course taught by this great professor, Ron Howard.

1201
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:30,160
Not to be confused with that, Ron Howard.

1202
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:38,160
Yeah, no, not the former actor now, director. This course was just an examination of whether it was ever ethical to lie.

1203
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:45,160
Virtually everyone goes into that course, more or less not even knowing what their relationship to lying is.

1204
02:07:45,160 --> 02:08:02,160
They haven't been sensitized to it as a significant variable in their lives in terms of maintaining their relationships or their reputations or, yeah, I lie sometimes and either white lies and sometimes it's just too awkward to tell the truth.

1205
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:08,160
And you don't know how often you do it, but you know everybody does it and the world could be no other way.

1206
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:16,160
And this course was just a machine for exposing the dysfunction of that.

1207
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:24,160
And more or less it became... It was like a seminar where everyone was just kind of coming up with scenarios where it must be all right to lie.

1208
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:30,160
Surely this is a white lie that is better told and the professor would shoot that down.

1209
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:41,160
And most people left the course more or less certain that lying was virtually always the wrong move for purely selfish reasons.

1210
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:44,160
It was just like it was not creating the life you want.

1211
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:56,160
And by being committed to not lying, you were closing the door to all kinds of complexity and risk, you know, both interpersonally and reputationally,

1212
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:00,160
that you absolutely want to close the door to.

1213
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:03,160
I mean, it's almost analogous to texting while driving.

1214
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:08,160
Just decide not to text while driving. You will not care about all those texts.

1215
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:17,160
You don't have to worry about, well, I'll only text at intersections or if I'm stuck in traffic, but we're not going that fast or whatever.

1216
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:26,160
Yeah, I can assure you that you will never really regret the texts you'd sent later when you finally arrived at your destination.

1217
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:29,160
So how old were you when you met your wife, your now wife?

1218
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:31,160
Thirty-one.

1219
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:36,160
Okay, so you've had 13 years of this practice of not lying.

1220
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:43,160
And now you meet the woman you're ultimately going to marry who presumably hasn't taken this course or made this commitment.

1221
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:51,160
At some point, does that become a discussion, which is, by the way, I'm going to be a little different than most guys that you've met in that, you know,

1222
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:57,160
if you ask me if you look good in that dress and I don't think you do, I'm just going to say you don't.

1223
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:02,160
Please don't interpret that as I'm an insensitive prick. I just don't want to go down that.

1224
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:08,160
Like, did you ever have that discussion that sort of prefaced or maybe your wife's the wrong example.

1225
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:13,160
As you're explaining this, I'm thinking about all of the lies I tell.

1226
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:17,160
No, it was sort of you kind of stumble into it.

1227
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:22,160
You wind up training the people around you to know what they're going to get from you.

1228
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:34,160
And it's not necessarily explicit. It's just in that case, yeah, it became very clear very quickly just what sort of importance I put on honesty.

1229
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:43,160
And, you know, there are a few hiccups in many relationships, but the gain that people notice very, very quickly,

1230
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:48,160
which I don't think they would want to forfeit to smooth over any other possible awkwardness,

1231
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:52,160
is they know you're never going to lie to them, right?

1232
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:55,160
They know that you're being truthful.

1233
02:10:55,160 --> 02:11:04,160
And so like when you have said, you know, that you didn't like something in a spot where most other people would have just told some kind of white lie,

1234
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:11,160
so as not to have to communicate that, then your praise means that much more.

1235
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:17,160
You know, if you're a creative person who's often needs to get feedback from people, you immediately discover this.

1236
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:25,160
When I give a piece of writing to somebody and ask for feedback, who do I value more?

1237
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:30,160
The person who is just going to praise me because they think that's what I want to hear

1238
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:37,160
and because they find it too awkward to deliver some bad news because they know I've spent a lot of time writing this thing.

1239
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:46,160
Or do I want to hear from the person who is actually finding flaws in this thing I've written and will now, because I'm going to them early,

1240
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:52,160
will now, now has a chance to spare me the public embarrassment of broadcasting these flaws to all humanity.

1241
02:11:52,160 --> 02:12:03,160
Clearly I value the other reader more and once you see the alternative, you realize you want the people who will be straight with you.

1242
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:07,160
And then you meet people who think they want feedback but they don't want feedback.

1243
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:13,160
You can have a more or less grown up relationship to the opinions of others.

1244
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:23,160
The people who don't want feedback who just want to be told that what they did was fantastic, well, if they're surrounded by honest people, they very quickly feel the cramp of that, right?

1245
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:28,160
They just want to be surrounded by liars and they'll curate their connections as a result.

1246
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:39,160
You won't ask that same person again if you're the sort of person who didn't want an honest opinion and pretended to ask for one.

1247
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:47,160
Is it possible for someone to, let's pick an extreme example, but could one go into public office and take that oath that I will never lie?

1248
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:51,160
I mean, is that compatible with politics, for example?

1249
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:55,160
It is widely assumed that it's a deal breaker, right?

1250
02:12:56,160 --> 02:13:09,160
I think everything, virtually everything that's wrong with our politics is the result of the mismatch between interpersonal ethics of this sort and what works and what wouldn't work in the public sphere.

1251
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:11,160
I think it should be compatible with politics.

1252
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:39,160
I think dishonesty should exact a massive reputational cost in politics, but now we're in this strange, you know, mirror universe where the most dishonest person anyone has ever witnessed is the president of the country and suffering absolutely no reputational cost among those who love him for his dishonesty.

1253
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:42,160
It's like it's not a bug, it's a feature.

1254
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:46,160
In my view, that is the most dysfunctional thing about the Trump phenomenon.

1255
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:56,160
It's what it's done to the value of honesty in our public conversation about politics, at least a half of the electorate.

1256
02:13:56,160 --> 02:14:03,160
Pointing out that he's lied yet again is completely ineffectual with the people who don't care that he's lied.

1257
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:05,160
I mean, they just assume he's going to lie.

1258
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:07,160
It's a very strange performance.

1259
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:10,160
It's not even about representing reality anymore.

1260
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:15,160
It's not that the people who love Trump are reliably duped by him.

1261
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:21,160
You know, it's that they're not holding him to a standard of honesty at all.

1262
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:22,160
Right.

1263
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:27,160
And his dishonesty, however obvious, is a different kind of performance.

1264
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:33,160
It's almost like there's been an analogy often drawn to professional wrestling.

1265
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:36,160
It's a fake sport with fake violence.

1266
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:42,160
And the fact that it's fake is actually understood by basically everyone who enjoys it.

1267
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:45,160
It's not like they're taken in.

1268
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:46,160
Right.

1269
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:50,160
Unless you're five years old, at the time you're a teenager or whatever, you sort of get that this is an act.

1270
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:52,160
They're still very athletic.

1271
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:55,160
Nothing takes away from the skill required to do it.

1272
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:56,160
Oh, yeah.

1273
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:59,160
I mean, ironically, what they're doing is more dangerous than MMA, for the most part.

1274
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:01,160
And they're getting horrific injuries sometimes.

1275
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:07,160
But there's no illusion that these guys are just as tough as the people in the octagon.

1276
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:08,160
Right.

1277
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:12,160
So it's like they're people who watch both or are certainly aware of both.

1278
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:17,160
And they clearly understand what reality is.

1279
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:20,160
Reality is what's going on in mixed martial arts.

1280
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,160
Right.

1281
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:24,160
There's things that are honest at the level of the language of violence.

1282
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:27,160
And there are things that are pure fabrications.

1283
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:29,160
There are lies.

1284
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:34,160
And something has happened in our conversation about facts in the political domain.

1285
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:37,160
And it's happened to some degree on the left for different reasons.

1286
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:46,160
But, yeah, to come back to your question, I think we're paying a massive price for not being able to tell when people are lying definitively.

1287
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:51,160
Like to not have a lie detector that forensically can be relied upon.

1288
02:15:51,160 --> 02:16:00,160
And, you know, analogous to DNA evidence, you know, where you just know that someone's representing their state of knowledge erroneously.

1289
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:07,160
And we're paying a massive price for the fact that so many millions of people don't actually care that they're being lied to.

1290
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:08,160
That's the bigger issue. Right.

1291
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:10,160
I mean, I think politicians have always lied.

1292
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:12,160
I don't think that's what's new.

1293
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:17,160
It's almost like a threshold has been crossed where it's.

1294
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:21,160
So you go back to sort of Clinton's impeachment, right?

1295
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:26,160
I mean, in the end, I think the legal issue was less about whether he'd had an affair with Monica Lewinsky.

1296
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:28,160
The bigger issue was that he lie under oath. Right.

1297
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:31,160
And in many ways, that's what his impeachment came down to. Yeah.

1298
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:34,160
It's quite clear he probably did. Right.

1299
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:40,160
I mean, we could get into the semantics of sexual relations, but the I mean, it's pretty clear he lied under oath.

1300
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:44,160
But the point you're making is that now it's almost a feature.

1301
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:47,160
Like now it's almost.

1302
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:49,160
I think it's gone beyond that it's accepted.

1303
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
And now it's almost like part of the theater.

1304
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:54,160
But I think that is a uniquely Trumpian phenomenon.

1305
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:59,160
I don't know that anyone else will be able to play it quite that way.

1306
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:04,160
I mean, it is a it's a feature of politics that has been true in other countries forever.

1307
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:08,160
I mean, it is a feature of authoritarian politics.

1308
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:12,160
Wait, you mean Kim Jong Un didn't really do that well in golf. Right.

1309
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:15,160
Yeah. Several holes in one.

1310
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:20,160
Several holes in one. He doesn't defecate. I heard as well. Yeah. Yeah.

1311
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:27,160
Yeah. In a democracy, it should be harder to get away with with having one's lies exposed.

1312
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:34,160
And it's got when you when you look at what used to matter, you know, when you look at the fact that someone like Gary Hart,

1313
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:45,160
his campaign where he he said that he was faithful to his wife and encouraged journalists to keep a sharp eye on him and then was caught having an affair.

1314
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,160
Like that was the end. Right. Right.

1315
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:50,160
There is nothing like that that's conceivable for Trump.

1316
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:58,160
It doesn't matter how discordant his behavior is with his next utterance.

1317
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:00,160
His opponents are keeping score relentlessly.

1318
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:04,160
Like his lies are being documented every day. There are now thousands of them.

1319
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:10,160
People are keeping score. It doesn't matter with at least 40 percent of America.

1320
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:15,160
So it might matter for another person for those 40 percent.

1321
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:25,160
It really is a kind of personality cult phenomenon where it's just free for Trump, for whatever reason, how he showed up, what he represents.

1322
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:30,160
He can get away with stuff that no one else can get away with.

1323
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:35,160
And that is what is so dysfunctional about having him in that role from my point of view.

1324
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:39,160
So you have two daughters, right?

1325
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:51,160
So we think so much about how do we prepare our kids for the world that's out there that we can only say one thing for certain about,

1326
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:52,160
which is we don't know what it's going to look like.

1327
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:57,160
I mean, I had this discussion with my daughter last night, actually, or two nights ago, which was,

1328
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:06,160
Olivia, you're 10 years old today. The only thing I can assure you of in eight years, I have no idea what the world will look like.

1329
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:07,160
Yeah.

1330
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:14,160
But there are a handful of traits that I think will help you in life.

1331
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:20,160
And they might seem somewhat arbitrary and they might seem somewhat ridiculous or even unpleasant.

1332
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:31,160
But the sooner you can figure out a way to put these traits in place, the more well-equipped you will be with whatever the future holds.

1333
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:39,160
So when I was 10, no one could have predicted that the Internet was going to exist and that somehow that was going to have all of these implications.

1334
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:47,160
With respect to all the stuff we've been talking about today, specifically with respect to choosing to live an examined life,

1335
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:53,160
choosing to live a life where we are not constantly being lived by our thoughts.

1336
02:19:53,160 --> 02:20:01,160
How do you teach your daughters about what the future holds?

1337
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:06,160
And I don't mean that in like a broad sense, but I mean, aside from encouraging them to meditate,

1338
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:15,160
and I'm sure at some age kids can learn mindfulness meditation, but how else do you try to influence your kids with respect to the lessons you've learned?

1339
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:21,160
I mean, they may never choose to go off on, you know, you've spent such a significant period of your life on retreats.

1340
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:25,160
You've really devoted your entire life to this study.

1341
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:31,160
If they choose not to do that, you know, they want to do something boring like go into medicine or whatever.

1342
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:33,160
How will you still impart some of these lessons on them?

1343
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:37,160
Or will it be much more by osmosis than anything deliberate?

1344
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:40,160
First, kids can be taught to meditate.

1345
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:43,160
And actually, my wife has done that work a lot.

1346
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:46,160
At what age does she start?

1347
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:49,160
Like five, six. It's amazing.

1348
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:51,160
I mean, you can go very quickly.

1349
02:20:51,160 --> 02:21:01,160
You can go from just, you know, the first class, which is just chaos, to a room full of six-year-olds sitting in silence for 15 minutes.

1350
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:02,160
So it's amazing.

1351
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,160
It seems unfathomable.

1352
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:07,160
Yeah. And they get real benefit from it.

1353
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:15,160
I mean, it's not quite the same as adults connecting with the practice, but it can be pretty similar.

1354
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:21,160
I mean, they're becoming aware of their emotional lives in a way that kids often aren't.

1355
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:25,160
Do girls develop easier than boys at that age?

1356
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:28,160
Generally speaking, I consider them separate species.

1357
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:36,160
Yeah, because my son is like, yeah, I don't know how I could ever communicate any of that.

1358
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:42,160
Yeah. And I think boys have a harder time sitting still certainly earlier on.

1359
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:46,160
So it's amazing to see kids connect with the practice because they definitely do.

1360
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:53,160
And they just become aware of the linkage between emotion and behavior, or thought and emotion, emotion and thought.

1361
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:58,160
But on some level, it just comes down to suffering and the end of suffering.

1362
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,160
It's just like, how much do you want to suffer?

1363
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:06,160
People are suffering in reliable ways based on...

1364
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:09,160
So did you spend time then explaining the nature of the suffering?

1365
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:10,160
Yeah.

1366
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:13,160
Because I would agree completely, nobody wants to suffer.

1367
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:21,160
I just think it takes many of us decades to even come to the realization of how much of our suffering is self-imposed.

1368
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:22,160
Yeah.

1369
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:25,160
So is part of it just getting them to realize that sooner?

1370
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:34,160
Yeah. And again, to point out many of the things we've discussed here, where it's like the power of framing and the power of expectation.

1371
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:43,160
So I'll often point out to my daughters, even the youngest who's just turning five, but for the most part, the oldest who's just turning 10,

1372
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:50,160
that the mismatch between her expectation of how something was going to be and how it was.

1373
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,160
And it's usually a negative expectation.

1374
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:58,160
She was worried about something happening, I'll say it, about a doctor's visit or getting blood drawn or getting a shot.

1375
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:07,160
And the actual experience that was far less traumatic than she was worried that it was going to be.

1376
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:15,160
And to point out that all of the time spent suffering in anticipation of this negative thing was wasted.

1377
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:17,160
There's a lesson to be learned here.

1378
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:26,160
The thing she thought she was sure was going to be awful turned out not to be so awful, or in some cases, not awful at all.

1379
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:34,160
Or even net positive, because she had the experience of overcoming a fear.

1380
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:37,160
She felt stronger as a result of that thing that just happened.

1381
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:47,160
It's like the expectation is so often not only a bad guide, it's just no guide at all to what is going to happen.

1382
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:54,160
And yet people suffer in advance over this thing that they're expecting to be negative.

1383
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:59,160
Even if it's going to be negative, you can decide to suffer once or twice.

1384
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,160
Yeah, exactly.

1385
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:02,160
Kids can get lessons like that.

1386
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:07,160
I think it's good to give them as early as they can get them.

1387
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:12,160
A lot of it has to do with framing and just how one thinks about one's life.

1388
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:22,160
But mindfulness for a kid can be, at the first pass, just more awareness over what they're feeling and thinking.

1389
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:28,160
Young kids can be sad and they don't know that they're sad or angry and they don't know that they're angry.

1390
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:34,160
And just that level of awareness can be a major gain for a kid.

1391
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:37,160
And then that's something to build on.

1392
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:50,160
And then as they get older, I think certainly once they're young teenagers can have a more or less grown-up relationship to observing what's going on in their minds.

1393
02:24:51,160 --> 02:25:16,160
When I think about how much effort I put into worrying about whether my daughter is learning well enough, the sort of standard metrics that we care about, math and science and English and sports and all those things, I feel like probably I'm not paying enough attention to those things as well, especially for someone who has spent so much time suffering inside his own mind.

1394
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:18,160
I ought to know better, right?

1395
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:22,160
There is no prison like the one between your ears.

1396
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:32,160
And when you frame it that way, boy, it makes me think I really need to start investing a little bit more time in that prep.

1397
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:38,160
I want to be mindful of your time, so I know we both have to get somewhere this evening.

1398
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:42,160
Are you writing a book at the moment? Are you working on anything?

1399
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:46,160
I'm the worst author a publisher can have at this point. I keep pushing back my deadline.

1400
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:50,160
I'm supposed to be writing a book, but I'm so busy podcasting and doing other things that...

1401
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:51,160
What is the book about?

1402
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:54,160
Well, I actually have two books that I'm supposed to be writing.

1403
02:25:54,160 --> 02:26:00,160
One is just a digest of podcast conversations, because now I have...

1404
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:02,160
So sort of like what Tim did with Tools of Science.

1405
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:06,160
Yeah, I'm not quite sure what the format will be, but something based on the podcast.

1406
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:12,160
It's probably going to be more like just updated transcripts of significant parts of the conversation.

1407
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:19,160
And then I have a book with a working title, Making Sense, which is just...

1408
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:27,160
It was going to be a kind of manifesto about intellectual honesty and how we have hard conversations about all manner of topics,

1409
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:35,160
whether it's race or gender or the opposition between science and religion or many of the topics I touch on my podcast.

1410
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:46,160
We're paying a price for not being able to talk about the most consequential and taboo and dangerous and divisive things

1411
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:53,160
in a way that is conserving of good intentions and honesty and allows for compromise

1412
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:56,160
and allows for breakthroughs and changes of opinion.

1413
02:26:56,160 --> 02:27:00,160
All the norms around talking about these things are askew.

1414
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:05,160
You just can't have a conversation about the differences between men and women, say.

1415
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:08,160
Are men and women exactly the same? No, they're not.

1416
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:13,160
But to go down that path generates ire like you can't imagine.

1417
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:17,160
And careers are lost over slight misstatements, right?

1418
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:24,160
And there are people who say things that were ill-considered that they then subsequently apologize for,

1419
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:27,160
they recognize that they're ill-considered.

1420
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:37,160
And yet the apology, however heartfelt, however abject, isn't sufficient to stop their career from being destroyed.

1421
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:41,160
You had an example of this recently on your podcast where you talked about the...

1422
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:44,160
She was a dean at Clare McKenna College?

1423
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:46,160
Yeah, Clare McKenna.

1424
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:47,160
Clare McKenna College, yeah.

1425
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:51,160
Well, actually, it's a more recent example, which is even more amazing in its own way.

1426
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:56,160
So like Megyn Kelly is firing over her Halloween blackface comments, right?

1427
02:27:56,160 --> 02:28:03,160
She obviously couldn't hear how the phrase blackface would land with many people.

1428
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:10,160
It's easy to see that the way she spoke about it was a constituted a mistake.

1429
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:17,160
It's pretty obvious it was not an expression of racism on her part, right?

1430
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:22,160
She's not saying African Americans haven't suffered a massive inequality in the past,

1431
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:27,160
or she was just saying, you know, if you're going to dress up like Diana Ross, why can't you put brown makeup on your face?

1432
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:31,160
Essentially, those weren't her words, but that was the sentiment.

1433
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:34,160
That's absolutely something we should be able to talk about.

1434
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:44,160
Yet she said the wrong thing and then clearly received a ton of pressure to apologize for it.

1435
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:47,160
Her apology, I don't know if you saw her apology, but her apology was...

1436
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:49,160
I mean, someone was joking on Twitter.

1437
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:54,160
She was just like, I saw something on Twitter that said it was the closest thing you've ever seen to a hostage video, minus the newspaper.

1438
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:58,160
Right, yes. Like just you've got to hold up the newspaper as proof of life.

1439
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:00,160
But I didn't actually hear what she said or anything.

1440
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:07,160
Okay, but it was by all signs, it was as full an apology as a person can muster.

1441
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:08,160
It was complete.

1442
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:17,160
If it didn't strike the right note for you, well then you have superhuman expectations for what someone should be able to muster in a context like that.

1443
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:20,160
It did not seem insincere at all, right? At least to my eye.

1444
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:26,160
And yet still, this was a career wrecking event, it seems.

1445
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:42,160
And so now we're in a situation where people are calling for the destruction of other people and celebrating the effects of that when these people actually do lose their shows or suffer some massive penalty.

1446
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:56,160
And yet, I think it's true to say that most people who were calling for her to be fired would recognize that one, her initial statement was not actually conveying her own racism.

1447
02:29:56,160 --> 02:30:10,160
It was conveying her obliviousness to the significance of this phrase for other people, but it was not conveying that she was somebody who wants to live in a society where there's a lack of political equality, right?

1448
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:17,160
I mean, there was zero evidence of that. I don't think anyone even alleges that that's her view of the world.

1449
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:25,160
But worse than that, once she recognizes the mistake she's made, no apology is sufficient, right?

1450
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:36,160
So do we really want to live in a world where you misspeak on a fraught topic and it is impossible to adequately apologize, right?

1451
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:40,160
You recognize that, you know, you use the word retard, say, right?

1452
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:43,160
And then you get feedback that, wow, people really find that offensive.

1453
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:52,160
There are kids with mental disabilities, you know, and like if you knew what it was like to be a parent of a kid who was suffering this, you would recognize how offensive that term is.

1454
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:56,160
And they're like, why would you ever use that term on a podcast, right?

1455
02:30:56,160 --> 02:31:01,160
Imagine it being impossible to apologize for that. It's over for you, right?

1456
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:07,160
What's so interesting, bringing it back to the prison stuff, I remember when I spoke with Kat Hoke about this.

1457
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:16,160
So Katherine Hoke is the woman that used to run this organization called Defy Ventures, and now she's spinning up something that's going to be even better, actually, to which I've suggested to her.

1458
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:23,160
And I don't think I'm unique in this. A lot of people have suggested that this idea ought not just be something that's sort of a nonprofit.

1459
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:30,160
Like there is such a benefit to the volunteers to going into this experience that it almost needs to be sort of a corporate development program.

1460
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:34,160
Like people need to be paying to go and have this experience. It's so profound.

1461
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:35,160
Right.

1462
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:40,160
But it gets to this question of like, can you be forgiven? Is there something for which you cannot be forgiven?

1463
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:48,160
What is the crime? What is the sin? What is the moral defect for which there is no forgiveness?

1464
02:31:49,160 --> 02:32:01,160
And I don't know if you're familiar with any of the stuff she's spoken about, but at some point she had to make a decision about whether or not people who were sexual predators would be permitted into the program.

1465
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:10,160
So if you'd raped somebody, if you'd molested a child and you're now serving whatever term in prison, could you be a part of this rehabilitative program?

1466
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:19,160
And in the end she said, yes. I mean, basically it really comes down to the degree of which a person shows remorse and their willingness to change.

1467
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:33,160
Because the idea is like whether you choose to never forgive somebody and whether it's Megan Kelly or this rapist, it doesn't change the fact that something was said or something was done that is in some cases probably not really that ridiculous.

1468
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:41,160
And in some cases is really tragic. But it's you have two choices as a society, how you move forward from that.

1469
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:54,160
And it seems we're definitely caught in the place of an inability to reconcile the good that can come from moving on, which means acknowledging mistakes that were made, acknowledging remorse, looking for ways to get better.

1470
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:59,160
I mean, we really don't seem to like that. That seems a bit too soft for people.

1471
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:04,160
I don't know if soft is the right word, but there's something about that process that people don't like.

1472
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:10,160
Yeah. Yeah. And in extreme cases, they're forced to accept it.

1473
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:27,160
I mean, when societies have just become completely riven by sectarian violence or political dysfunction of one kind or another, then you need things like truth and reconciliation commissions in places like South Africa or Rwanda,

1474
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:37,160
where it's then people who are guilty of objectively horrible things can get a pass essentially just by coming forward and telling the truth and apologizing.

1475
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:42,160
Yeah, I think I actually I brought this up on my podcast not long ago.

1476
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:48,160
I was thinking about this, this very problem in terms of like an ethical event horizon.

1477
02:33:48,160 --> 02:34:02,160
I mean, is there something so bad that you could do or say that no apology would be sufficient to pull your reputation back out of that that singularity?

1478
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:06,160
It is a kind of unrecoverable moral error. And I don't think so.

1479
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:17,160
I think the the physics of an of an appropriate acceptable apology are that it be sincere and believable.

1480
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:26,160
And the measure of it being believable is that it has to be clear how you could have changed enough for it to be sincere.

1481
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:38,160
So for an apology to be accepted, you have to stand in relationship to that thing you did in the same place where the other people who are horrified by what you did stand.

1482
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:46,160
And they have to be able to see how it is that you have come to stand where they are now in order to accept your apology.

1483
02:34:47,160 --> 02:35:04,160
So if that transformation isn't believable for some reason, if there's no path by which you could have had this epiphany that contextualizes your prior bad behavior, puts it in a box, which you disavow, well, then it will seem it will seem insincere or opportunistic.

1484
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:18,160
Your sociopath is just trying to get out of prison and game the program. And those people exist. There's no question that an insincere apology for calculated reasons is, you know, that's as old as we've been speaking to one another.

1485
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:28,160
And that will continue for as long as people can get away with it. So there's a genuine concern if you're talking about how to to operationalize these kinds of insights.

1486
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:48,160
But I mean, you just it just again, the path out of that darkness has to be intelligible to people. And I think this will stumble on this once we have breakthroughs in psychology and neuroscience that admit of real changes in people's emotional and ethical lives.

1487
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:56,160
I mean, so just take the narrow case. If we ever understood psychopathy clearly enough that we could cure it.

1488
02:35:56,160 --> 02:36:08,160
Right. So you have someone who's from a very early age, just torturing animals and showing zero empathy for other people. And they they grow up into the scary adult that one would predict.

1489
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:18,160
And if we ever get to a place where there's a cure for that, well, then psychopathy would be will be viewed as a neurological condition. It won't be a moral problem.

1490
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:32,160
These are these are malfunctioning robots that need the new module. And just imagine if we had that cure, we'd be no more judgmental in how we applied it than we are when we cure any other disease.

1491
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:42,160
I mean, you're not thinking about when you're giving diabetics insulin. You're not thinking, well, you you're lucky I'm giving you this insulin because you probably don't deserve it.

1492
02:36:42,160 --> 02:37:08,160
You with your malfunctioning pancreas, you're lucky that I'm so tolerant that I'm willing to give you this insulin. There's zero culpability in having a bad pancreas. If we actually understood the neurochemical neuro anatomical basis of even the worst behavior, if it was discrete enough that it admitted of a of a cure, we would say, oh, we just got to we got to fix that problem.

1493
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:19,160
And it would be and then hold out hope for that same or is that sci fi? I mean, you're a neuroscientist, so you can you can speak to this with much more clarity or authority than than I could ever speak of it.

1494
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:35,160
I hold that hope for it in certain specific cases. Yeah, I mean, we know it's true. I mean, we've already stumbled upon it in cases where you're talking about a brain tumor that is causing a problem, but causing a problem which shows up as a

1495
02:37:35,160 --> 02:38:03,160
uncontrollable rage or pedophilia or I mean, there are cases where it's like the classic case is Charles Whitman, who in 1964 killed 14 people at the University of Texas. And he just had a glioblastoma pushing on his amygdala. And the amazing thing is that you might know the story. I've talked about it. But I mean, he suspected that he had something wrong with his brain and he he knew his brain and he knew his brain.

1496
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:21,160
And he knew he was gonna be killed by the police and he's recommended that they perform an autopsy to find out what was going on in his head. And yeah, he had a he had a tumor which was arguably totally sculpted or it was just in precisely the place that you would think, okay, this he's got.

1497
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:32,160
He can't control his impulses and he's feeling, you know, uncontrollable rage. And this tumor explains it, I think there's virtually no one who hears the whole story.

1498
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:47,160
Who thinks Charles Whitman was evil. He just seems profoundly unlucky. And on some level, a complete understanding of evil would reduce it to that same species of unluck.

1499
02:38:47,160 --> 02:39:00,160
That is an amazing thought. It's hard for me to imagine because obviously the mass effects are the obvious ones, right? These lesions versus much more diffuse neurochemical processes.

1500
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:19,160
We're gonna have dinner tonight. So I know what we're gonna keep talking about, man. We got so much to keep going on. For folks who are listening to this on my podcast, who might not know you as well as they ought to, is Sam Harris.org basically where they can find everything, your podcast, your blog, your books, all sorts of things.

1501
02:39:19,160 --> 02:39:24,160
Yeah. And as far as my meditation app, it's just wakingup.com. But yeah, both websites.

1502
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:29,160
And some of us like me are lucky enough to have got it for free because we were supporters of the podcast before it came out.

1503
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:30,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1504
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:38,160
But is it available for purchase now on both the, on Apple and on Android? I think it's Android's not quite out yet.

1505
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,160
No, it's out as of yesterday.

1506
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:47,160
Okay. Fantastic. Because I know I had a patient who went to search for it on Android a few weeks ago and it was coming soon.

1507
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:50,160
No, no, we're, we're born on both platforms. So.

1508
02:39:50,160 --> 02:40:11,160
Okay. Well, congratulations, Sam. It is. I mean, I just want to say, I want to thank you personally for, for the effect and the impact that your work has had on me. I find myself, like I said, spending so much time thinking about how to help people delay the onset of diseases that kill them.

1509
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:24,160
And in many ways you're doing the same thing, but in a, in some ways a higher stakes arena, which is how to prevent people from suffering so much, which in some ways is just harder to measure.

1510
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:32,160
We don't have the same stats on that, right? I can rattle off all the stats on what the probability is that you're going to get cancer by the time you're 70.

1511
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:40,160
And what's the likelihood you're going to make it to 90 without a heart attack and ball. I can rattle off all those things, but we don't keep the same stats for how much we suffer.

1512
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:54,160
And I, I think of your work as among the most important things that have helped me. And now by extension, some of my patients who are willing to go down this path with me to reduce that burden of suffering.

1513
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:56,160
Nice. Nice. Well, glad to hear it.

1514
02:40:56,160 --> 02:41:00,160
Well, thank you. Thank you for making, making so much time this afternoon.

1515
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:09,160
Yeah. Yeah. It's a pleasure. And congratulations on the podcast. You are one of these few examples of somebody who goes from the conversation of, you know, I think maybe I want to.

1516
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:21,160
Start a podcast. Should I, should I start a podcast? And then I turn around and three weeks later you have this amazing podcast that is more professionally produced than mine and people love.

1517
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:22,160
So congratulations on that.

1518
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:28,160
You and your team deserve a lot of credit for that. I know I've said this before, but, but it's always worth repeating.

1519
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:35,160
I mean, I think that you and Tim were probably among the two most vocal along with probably Patrick O'Shaughnessy.

1520
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:41,160
But I think you and Tim the most really, because I honestly, I was just so intimidated by the work I saw you and Tim doing.

1521
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:46,160
I was like, well, there's no goddamn way I can do that. Like that's, that's just above my pay grade.

1522
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:52,160
So I still think my podcast pales in comparison to yours and Tim's, but I am happy to be in the arena.

1523
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:57,160
And it, it has turned out to be much more enjoyable than I would have ever predicted.

1524
02:41:57,160 --> 02:42:04,160
Yeah. And so I do regret having not done it two years sooner when you were harping on me and Tim was harping on me, but better late than never.

1525
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:12,160
And it's an honor to have you as a guest on my little budding podcast. Well, keep it up. Thanks, man.
