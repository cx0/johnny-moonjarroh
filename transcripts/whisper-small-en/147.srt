00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
at the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,800
today's episode. My guest this week is Dr. Hussein Yazin. Hussein is an associate professor in the

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,360
Department of Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at USC. His lab has focused for almost a

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,400
decade now on lipid metabolism and nutrition and the effect these have on cognition and the risk

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,720
of developing Alzheimer's disease, paying specific attention to the ApoE4 allele. Many of you listening

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,480
to this podcast will no doubt be familiar with ApoE4 genotypes. We've spoken about this at great

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:26,680
length in a number of podcasts. This is really the deep dive into E4, what the implications are.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,360
I actually wanted to speak with Hussein after we were part of a journal club where he presented a

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,880
couple of papers that he authored that were simply beyond fascinating. It was definitely one of the

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,640
deepest dives I'd ever seen into the inner workings of EPA and DHA's role in the brain. Now,

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,760
we do get to that near the end of the podcast, but I realize that it's important for people to really

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,560
understand a lot about the brain. I would consider this a fundamental core coursework on

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,080
brain biology. We really explain the architecture of the brain, the energy systems of the brain,

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,480
and what goes wrong, what are the various things that go wrong, because it's not just one thing

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:12,840
as a person develops Alzheimer's disease. Then we get into what ApoE is and then why we might have

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,000
these three different variants or isoforms of it, E2, E3, and E4, and what turns out to be different

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,440
depending on which of those you have. The obvious thing, of course, is your risk for Alzheimer's

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,240
disease, but why? We have a little side tangent that goes into the role of EPA in cardiovascular

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,640
disease with or without DHA, and then bring it back to this discussion around the role of DHA

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,480
in Alzheimer's disease and also what some of the specific things that we understand to date

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,320
with respect to patients that have E4 and what they can do to reduce risk. I'm going to give you

29
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,480
a warning upfront. Unfortunately, if you're anything like me, you're going to come away from

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,560
this episode. I think frustrated that our state of knowledge is still so pedestrian, but nevertheless,

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,600
this is a very important discussion and I certainly learned a lot in it and it will actually have an

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,160
impact on how I think about taking care of my patients. So without further delay, please enjoy

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:16,120
my conversation with Hussein Yazim. Hussein, thanks so much for making time to sit down today.

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm really looking forward to this. Obviously, I had the pleasure of doing Journal Club with you

35
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,600
a few weeks ago, which is what made me realize we needed to do this for a much broader audience.

36
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,560
Let's go back to the beginning a little bit though. I'm curious as to what got you interested

37
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,240
in this space. I know you grew up in Lebanon. Did you do medical school there as well as college?

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,120
Yeah. Thank you, Peter, for the invitation. I'm happy to be part of your show. Yes, I grew up in

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,400
Beirut, Lebanon. That's my medical school. And then shortly after moved to the US to

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,040
do some residency training and followed by a fellowship. And then I got to where I am right

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,960
now. Tell me a little bit about that path. Your fellowship was in what? I trained in endocrinology.

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,240
I come from a family with strong heart disease and diabetes. So I decided to sub-specialize in

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,960
lipid disorders. And I studied lipids for a good of two to three years before

44
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,160
I had the opportunity to study brain lipids and I switched from blood lipids to the brain.

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,840
Well, this is a topic that I think a lot of people are interested in because I remember 10 years ago

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,240
when you would check an APOE genotype on somebody, it was a very unusual thing to do.

47
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,760
Today, it's not as unusual. It's probably still not incredibly common that people are walking

48
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,280
around knowing their APOE genotype, but it's certainly, I mean, it seems a log order more

49
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,240
common than it was a decade ago. And I suspect a decade from now, that might be one of the genes

50
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,000
that kind of everybody knows about themselves. So where do you think is a good place to start?

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,960
I think this topic is complicated enough that it probably warrants at least some discussion of

52
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,640
what makes up the brain. Like we talk about neuronal cells, we talk about glial cells. Can

53
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,000
you maybe help explain the architecture of the brain so that as we get into the different types

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,680
of cells, what a blood brain barrier means, where CSF resides, these things will become

55
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,600
important in this discussion. And I think we should assume that most people listening don't

56
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:36,040
necessarily understand those things. Sure. So you first asked about the APOE genotype and

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,520
I have seen in my practice calls, I would say even monthly from people who did 23andMe and found out

58
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:53,320
that they are E4 carriers and they wanted to know more. So I not uncommonly get calls to figure out

59
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,880
what is it that I have APOE4, what does that mean for my brain? You typically see in the report

60
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,560
some discussion that they are at an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and people are

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,680
interested to figure out if there's anything they can do. So yes, APOE4 will be something important

62
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,480
to deal with. Now regarding the brain itself, the brain is a unique compartment that is mostly a

63
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:27,800
lipid organ. So by weight, the brain contains a large amount of lipids from cholesterol, which is

64
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:36,600
a sterol, to different forms of fatty acids. And the brain is largely composed of three types of

65
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,040
cells, although it's much more than that. But the main cells are the neurons, which are responsible

66
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,960
for firing and forming synapses, which regulate how the brain functions. The neurons cannot do

67
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,000
their own function had it not been for helper cells. And these include in general glial cells.

68
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,080
Glial cells could be astrocytes and these are cells which are tightly associated with neurons

69
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,760
and they regulate the energy, storage, production, and so forth that the neuron would need to keep

70
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,680
firing. Astrocytes have a lot of functions but they're mostly viewed as taking up glucose or

71
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:28,920
fat and providing substrates that the neuron could use to be able to generate ATP and keep firing.

72
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,240
And then you've got the glial cells, the micro glial cells, which have gained a lot of traction

73
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,520
in the last decade or so because they have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as

74
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,200
Alzheimer's disease. And glial cells are immune cells responsible for cleaning up, whether it's

75
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:56,280
going to be a beta or an infection. These immune cells have the responsibility of making sure that

76
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,880
the house is in order. There's also the oligodendrocytes and other kinds of cells

77
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,680
but those three cells are the main type of cells that we study in the brain.

78
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:15,240
The brain is surrounded by a blood-brain barrier and this is an important concept because the

79
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,640
brain is protected from the outside of the brain and for a good reason. The brain needs to have a

80
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,640
stable environment to be able to function. The blood-brain barrier regulates what gets in and out

81
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:35,160
of the brain and stands as a barrier to prevent toxic proteins, infectious organisms, and other

82
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:42,360
things from getting free access. The blood-brain barrier separates the blood vessels and the blood

83
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,320
inside the blood vessels from the brain and it's composed of capillary cells. These are endothelial

84
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:59,000
cells which have a lining of tight junctions. These are very tight in the sense that they would

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
act as a barrier, followed by pericytes which surround those endothelial cells and these are

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,560
supporting cells for the endothelium to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and around

87
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,960
those you have the neural cells or wall cells which make up the matrix surrounding those two

88
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,280
cell types and maintains the integrity as well of the blood-brain barrier. So you've got this

89
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:34,200
elaborate system that is designed to protect the brain and to maintain a stable environment.

90
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,320
Now finally cerebrospinal fluid is in a simplistic way the sewage system of the brain.

91
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,200
When the brain receives its metabolites, its nutrients from the circulation,

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,520
it crosses the blood-brain barrier through the junction of the endothelial cells into brain cells

93
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,720
that is a fluid surrounding brain cells that we call the interstitial fluid.

94
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,640
Brain cells will take up whatever they need, whether it's an astrocyte, a microglia, or a neuron,

95
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,200
and produce some byproducts. One of the commonly studied byproducts are A-beta proteins which are

96
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,040
accumulating in diseases like Alzheimer's. Those byproducts will then get cleared into the CSF.

97
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,720
The CSF or cerebrospinal fluid, as I mentioned before, is a form of a system that allows drainage

98
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:37,800
from the brain cells from the interstitial fluid. It's run by a pump. That pump is in a system known

99
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:46,040
as the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus will be pumping clear water-like fluid into the CSF,

100
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,480
and this motion of movement of the fluid throughout the brain washes the brain off. At some point,

101
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,400
the choroid plexus interferes with the blood circulation to clear off these metabolites

102
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:09,960
from the CSF back into the blood for excretion. So if we take A-beta amyloid peptides, for example,

103
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,880
they're produced by the neuron as the neuron is firing. These are peptides which come off the

104
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:23,000
membrane of a neuron, and then they leak into the CSF, and then from the CSF they get into the blood,

105
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,800
and the blood clears those A-beta peptides through the liver or other organs.

106
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:39,160
This constant CSF activity is critical for maintaining the sewage system of the brain in

107
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,080
order. So I hope I have addressed some of the questions that you were asking.

108
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,840
Yeah, absolutely. We can even talk about some illnesses that occur that get in the way of this.

109
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,600
For example, sometimes children are born with abnormalities that make it very difficult for

110
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:05,080
them to clear CSF, or children can be born with malformations that obstruct the flow of CSF,

111
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,520
and they develop conditions where some of these compartments within the brain

112
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,200
expand and enlarge, and it's a very intricate system. In situations like that, for example,

113
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,680
you have to come up with other ways to drain the system, and some of these children require shunts,

114
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,120
where you have to place an exogenous tube into their brain and drain it into their abdomen or

115
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,120
something like that. It's all such an amazing organ. I remember I had one rotation in general

116
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,800
surgery where we did a month of neurosurgery, and it is quite remarkable when you're operating on

117
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,480
the brain and you remove the Dura, the brain is a bloodless organ. So it looks unlike any other

118
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,320
organ, like when you're operating on the kidney and you get right down to the kidney, you still

119
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,760
see the sort of pulp-like redness of the kidney, or the lung, or the liver, any of these other

120
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,280
organs, but the brain is quite distinct in that it doesn't have that, and once that Dura is peeled

121
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,200
back and you see it bathing in this CSF, it looks unusually sterile, which is not to say, of course,

122
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,240
as you cut into the parenchyma, you wouldn't get blood, but at that level, it's not. You mentioned

123
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,200
something earlier, and I want to just make sure we put it in context, which is that by weight,

124
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,520
the brain is disproportionately lipid-laden relative to other organs. So let's make sure

125
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,560
people understand what that means. Every cell in our body has a bilayer of cholesterol that makes

126
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,120
up its cell membrane. That's what allows it to have fluidity. That's what allows it to hold

127
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:41,400
transporters across its cell membrane, etc. How does, say, a cardiac myocyte, the muscle cell of a

128
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:49,880
heart, differ in terms of its lipid content from either the neuron or the astrocyte or the microglia?

129
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:58,520
What is it about these cells in the brain that structurally requires such an abundance of lipid

130
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,240
and cholesterol? That's a fundamentally important question, and it actually begs to ask perhaps a

131
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,240
slightly different question. How is the brain functionally different than a myocyte? And

132
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,800
one way to look at this question is to understand that the brain operates by firing. So you're

133
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,600
looking at perhaps an electric system where you have wires connected to each other, and these

134
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,200
wires have to fire constantly. And by firing, you need electricity to move from one piece of the

135
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:42,520
wire to the other. This requires specific cables. In our modern-day language, you need a form of

136
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,880
fiber optics or high-speed wiring that allows this firing to happen in instantaneous

137
00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:00,680
manners, and it's carefully regulated and separated by location, by speed, and by changes in a micro

138
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:09,800
environment. To be able to achieve this delicate and elaborate map of wires attached to each other,

139
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,320
you need lipids. Specifically, for example, if we're talking about a neuron, we're talking about

140
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,280
myelin. If we're talking about synapse, we're talking about a synaptosome. That's a synapse

141
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:32,280
body. The synaptosome by itself, to be able to conduct and depolarize, meaning to change the

142
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,720
electric potential across the cell membrane, it requires a certain environment of lipids

143
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,240
that allows it to do the signaling, allows the glutamate or glutamine to go inside the cell,

144
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,040
and then release certain mediators to open certain channels, for example, calcium channels.

145
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,560
So this particular environment necessitates that you have an elaborate system of lipids

146
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:08,120
that facilitate this process. This is a very taxing system, meaning that to be able to

147
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,080
constantly talk to me through this podcast, you would need an immense amount of ATP.

148
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,640
The extraction of glucose and the utilization of lipids is adapted to be able to answer this

149
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:27,400
this particular environment. In contrast, a cardiac myocyte, outside of its being regulated by

150
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,840
the foci that regulates heartbeats in the atria and so forth, the AV node and other areas,

151
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:42,840
the cardiac myocyte is simply a mechanical cell that has to pump all the time to be able to maintain

152
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,320
a certain pressure and blood flow. So that environment by itself requires strong

153
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,680
cytoskeletal elements such as actin or myosin that are efficiently packaged for pumping

154
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,320
and may require less lipids than the wiring that we discussed in the brain.

155
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,600
Yeah, so I think that's a very elegant way to explain that basically every cell in the body,

156
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,680
whether it be, as you said, a myocyte in the heart, or a cell in the kidney, or a cell in

157
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,200
the liver, or a cell in the lung, or a cell of skeletal muscle, all of those things have a

158
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:31,000
function that is contractile, gas exchange, filtration, something like that. The brain's

159
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,120
entire function is electron potentials and electricity. So it would make sense, as you said,

160
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,840
that every facet of the brain has to be optimized for signal transduction.

161
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,040
And that includes not just the myelination of the sheaths in the neurons, but even all of the other

162
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:59,160
cells that would facilitate for rapid potential and recurrence of normal electron gradients.

163
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,120
The brain, I mean, I think there's a statistic that we all learn in medical school, right, it weighs

164
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,440
about 2% of our body weight, and yet is probably responsible for something on the order of 20% of

165
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,800
our energy consumption. Again, you've provided a very elegant explanation for why that's the case.

166
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:25,640
Why is it that this tiny, tiny organ is so energy demanding? How does the brain utilize energy?

167
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,640
So what, let's talk a little bit about how substrate makes its way to the brain. And let's

168
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,760
contrast it just very quickly with, you know, pick a myocyte in your leg, right? It can take glucose

169
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,320
out of circulation. It can either with or without insulin bring that glucose molecule through a

170
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,400
Glut4 transmitter directly into the cytoplasm. It can, depending on the speed at which it requires ATP,

171
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,760
it can very rapidly take that to pyruvate and ultimately to lactate, or it can more slowly

172
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,120
take the pyruvate into the mitochondria and generate more ATP there. It can do the same

173
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,560
thing with fatty acids. Of course, with fatty acids, it's going to go from an acetyl CoA pathway

174
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:17,000
into the mitochondria and take these two carbon units into ATP. So the muscles have lots of options

175
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
for fuel. Even in a case of starvation, they can use ketones, but basically glucose, fatty acids,

176
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,920
lactate, all of these things are fuels. And they go directly to the cell. And then within the cell,

177
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,920
you have aerobic and anaerobic pathways, if you're talking about glycolysis, you sort of alluded to

178
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,760
it already, but the brain already has one thing that makes it an extra step, which is there's a

179
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,760
blood brain barrier. So it's not even like the glucose goes directly there through the capillary.

180
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,760
So how does the brain extract energy from circulation? And how does it differ from the

181
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,400
rest of the body in its fuel partitioning? I would say that I am not an expert in this field,

182
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,720
but I'll give you my two cents. This is a complex question. And I would beg to help the listeners

183
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,880
understand that this is a complex topic that even as we speak, there's a huge gap in knowledge.

184
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,560
But my understanding is that the brain prefers glucose as the predominant source of energy.

185
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:29,000
And that by itself is regulated differently than the rest of the body. The rest of the body

186
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,720
have a system by which insulin regulates specific transporters known as glute fours, as you mentioned.

187
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:45,400
And glute four allows an insulin dependent mechanism to enter glucose into pumping muscles

188
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:54,680
or adipocytes. And that responds to the outside environment, meaning you can induce glute four

189
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:02,440
expression by exercising. You can induce glute four expression by changes in body weight.

190
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,880
At the blood brain barrier, glute four plays a minor to no role in glucose uptake. The blood

191
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:18,040
brain barrier, in contrast, has a predominance of glute ones. Glute one expression is not controlled

192
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:25,640
by what you eat. It's not controlled by how you exercise to a large extent. And it's not controlled

193
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,040
by the same mechanisms that govern insulin regulated glucose signaling, partly because

194
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:40,600
your brain cannot be moody in its choices. It has to have a constant supply of glucose.

195
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,160
Now, glute one expression can be regulated and it's largely regulated to protect the brain.

196
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:55,720
Meaning if you are faced with a situation that is systemic hyperglycemia such as type 2 diabetes,

197
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,560
the brain protects itself by reducing glute one expression at the blood brain barrier.

198
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,640
The opposite holds true. If you are, for some reason, going through a prolonged fasting period

199
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,320
where you're dipping into glycogen stores and you're hypoglycemic, the brain up regulates

200
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,280
glute one at the blood brain barrier to extract as much as possible all the glucose in your

201
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:32,680
circulation to maintain a relatively constant amount of glucose in the brain. Now, during

202
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:39,400
physiological states, the glucose in the brain is relatively not, does not fluctuate that much,

203
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,400
although it does fluctuate, but it doesn't fluctuate as much as that in plasma.

204
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,120
During diseased states, such as Alzheimer's, for example, leakage or destruction of the

205
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:56,120
blood brain barrier associates with destruction in the glute one transporters and the brain now

206
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:03,000
struggles in capturing glucose from the system, which leads to a whole new cascade that we might

207
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,320
argue is a diseased cascade. It's compensatory, but it's responding to a glucose shortage.

208
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,640
So in that regards, glucose regulation in the brain differs from the circulation.

209
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:23,800
Now, another fundamental aspect to understand is that the brain is not efficient in utilizing fat

210
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:30,040
as a source of ATP. One thing that you notice after you dissect the brain is that you don't find,

211
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:37,800
you don't find fat depots that you find in your adipose tissue. Yes, it's a fatty organ,

212
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:45,400
but there aren't really storage sites of fat. It does not store fat. To a large extent,

213
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,760
there are lipid droplets in the brain, but they are more dynamic than the adipose tissue that we

214
00:23:50,760 --> 00:24:00,600
have outside. And it prefers not to use fat as a source of ATP. It prefers to use fat to integrate

215
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,680
into the myelin sheath or the synoptosome to regulate membrane fluidity to help with depolarization.

216
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,200
Nevertheless, when the brain goes through crises and they can't use glucose, they have a mechanism

217
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,920
to extract ATP from fat. But the result is a price tag. The result is oxidative stress.

218
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,840
The brain has a complicated system, as we mentioned before, that consists of astrocytes and neurons

219
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:33,000
and glial cells and all sorts of stuff. And they have partitioned their roles. A neuron

220
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:41,240
is like your athlete who needs to run a marathon at a certain speed. Now, for that athlete to

221
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:49,560
succeed, he needs to have water bottles staged at every juncture or a mile. He used to have helpers

222
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,600
with towels, helpers with whatever it is for the athlete to be able to do the whole 23 mile if it's

223
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:05,880
a marathon. Astrocytes, the helper cells of neurons, would take up the glucose and process it to make

224
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,720
lactate and then shuttle the lactate into the neuron because the neuron says, I can digest

225
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,000
lactate more efficiently than the glucose and I can produce ATP with less damage. So the neuronal

226
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,440
favorite food is lactate and not glucose. But glucose gets into the astrocyte where it is

227
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:34,760
shuttled and changed into lactate. When glucose is no longer there, and we're talking about

228
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,960
prolonged fasting and glycogen depletion, the brain becomes very efficient in extracting ketone

229
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,800
bodies through the blood-brain barrier to maintain its firing and to avoid someone from getting into

230
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:57,000
a coma-like state. So, in a nutshell, to summarize what I just said, the brain does its best to

231
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,720
regulate its glucose content that is not dependent on insulin signaling. Number two, the brain

232
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,720
prefers glucose and not fat as a source of energy. And number three, when glucose is not available,

233
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,120
it extracts all the ketone bodies that are produced from fatty acid oxidation outside the brain to

234
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,040
maintain itself going. So a couple of other things to follow up on that. So actually, I didn't realize

235
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,960
that Glute-1 was basically regulated by peripheral glucose concentration. That's actually super

236
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:38,360
interesting. And I also didn't realize that the neurons were getting their lactate from the

237
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:48,120
astrocytes. So I assume the implication of that is as the astrocytes take glucose to make pyruvate,

238
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,040
to make lactate, the astrocytes are keeping the ATP from that process rendered to themselves

239
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,480
while transporting or donating the lactate to the neuron. Is that what's happening?

240
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,240
Yeah. And then what about the microglial cells? Are they using glucose or are they using the

241
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,280
residual lactate? I don't know what the source of energy for microglial cells. I am not sure

242
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,680
how they use that energy production. And do you have a sense just broadly what the distribution

243
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:25,160
is of ATP consumption between the glial cells and the neurons? I mean, I know that the glial

244
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,600
cells grossly outnumber the neurons in terms of the numbers of cells, but do you have a sense,

245
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,840
is it like a 50-50 division of energy consumption? I don't know. I don't want to provide an inaccurate

246
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,000
response, so I don't know. Okay. So we have a pretty good handle on what's going on here now.

247
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,600
You've done a great job, I think, giving us a primer on both the structure of the brain

248
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:56,040
and now energy. So let's get into this idea of what is ApoE? And let's talk about it not as a

249
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,920
gene right now, but let's talk about it as an ApoLipa protein, and then we can talk about the

250
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,120
genetics of it later. But what is this thing called ApoE? Your interest is also in cardiovascular

251
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,880
disease. This is a podcast in which we talk a lot about it, so we can even contrast for the listener

252
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,440
what ApoB is. Most people listening to this are very familiar with what ApoB is, this ApoLipa

253
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,320
protein that wraps lipoproteins and defines a subclass of them that morphologically distinct

254
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,440
that lineage of the VLDL to the IDL to the LDL. But what's ApoE? What is that ApoLipa protein?

255
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,440
That's a fascinating question, and that has been the focus of my own research for the past

256
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:45,240
six or seven years. So ApoE is, I like to give analogies, if you don't mind. Do you like music?

257
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Sure. Before COVID, how often do you go listen to an orchestra playing the

258
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,920
mat or any of the fancy places? And New York has beautiful music too. Well, I'm not a fancy music

259
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,840
guy, but I like to go to concerts prior to COVID, but I don't know if that'll fit in with the

260
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,440
analogy. Well, the analogy I was trying to make is that for an orchestra to play efficiently,

261
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:18,280
it needs conductors. My father asked me a few months ago, and he's by no means a musician or

262
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,040
any of you have never played a music instrument, but he was telling me, what is that conductor

263
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,800
doing? I mean, can't they play without the conductor? So if I were to ask you, and if you

264
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,480
allow me a minute to sit in your shoes, what is the conductor doing? That's a great question.

265
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,680
First of all, I would assume he is vital. And secondly, I would assume that he is somehow

266
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,640
managing the timing of all of the different sections within the orchestra. And not just

267
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,360
the timing, but if one is crescendoing and the other is decrescendoing. So I suspect there's just

268
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,360
many more moving pieces that say a rock band where you have one guitar, one bass, one drum,

269
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,200
maybe a keyboard and a singer. Absolutely. And in the lipoprotein orchestra,

270
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,680
A-Pole B would be one of the principal players. Let's assume it's your violinist. A-Pole A would

271
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,120
be your piano player. And you need both. Sometimes you need the violinist to run the show,

272
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:27,880
and you need piano for certain pieces. But what puts the orchestra together in the peripheral

273
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:35,240
circulation, largely two conductors in this case, A-Pole and A-Pole C-3. What A-Pole E and A-Pole C-3

274
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,360
do is that they regulate the speed of which things are happening. They're different than A-Pole B,

275
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,920
because you can argue they're promiscuous. A-Pole B is matted to LDL particles,

276
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:56,040
maybe to some extent, VLDL, LDL, and this whole pipeline. A-Pole A1, to a large extent,

277
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:03,400
is matted to the HDL family of particles. Now A-Pole E and A-Pole C-3, also known as exchangeable

278
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:11,400
lipoproteins, are not. They can jump from different populations of lipoproteins. And by taking

279
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,920
different roles, they can decide whether a lipoprotein is going to stay in the circulation,

280
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,720
and that would be your A-Pole C-3, or get cleared, and that would be your A-Pole. So this is a

281
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,400
simplified version, because I think in real life it's way more complex. But the reason why A-Pole

282
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,280
has been elusive and difficult to study is because of its multiple roles, and it appears on HDL,

283
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,600
it can appear on LDL, it can appear on IDL, it can appear on VLDL, it changes whether you're

284
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,320
fasting or postprandial, and it determines to some extent the fate of your lipoprotein.

285
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,840
So if we take a second to imagine, you know, what happens after we drink a milkshake.

286
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,000
So when you drink a milkshake, you're absorbing all the fat from the milk, and you're packaging

287
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,840
it into chylomicrons, which are known to carry A-Pole B48. A-Pole B48 will then have to circulate

288
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:16,280
and eventually get cleared by forming remnants. As A-Pole B48, the chylomicron,

289
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,840
containing particles circulating, it starts changing its A-Pole lipoprotein composition.

290
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:31,800
In the beginning, it would have a larger amount of A-Pole C-3, which would maintain it from getting

291
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:39,320
lipolized. And at some point, when it gets to a certain size, HDL will donate the A-Pole

292
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,920
and allow that remnant to get taken up by an A-Pole receptor into the liver.

293
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,600
Typical A-Pole receptors include LRP1. That also happens with VLDL particles.

294
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,640
When they are produced, when they are large, they acquire an A-Pole C-3 that blocks lipoprotein

295
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:09,400
lipase. And as they shrink in size, A-Pole C-3 will fall off, A-Pole would get reassembled,

296
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:17,560
and that will assist this VLDL particle of getting cleared. One of the fundamental aspects of

297
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:24,280
metabolic syndrome is an inefficient process where these particles are the A-Pole's and

298
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,160
the A-Pole C-3s are not as mobile, and you end up having an A-Pole C-3 enriched small dense LDL

299
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:39,240
particle that is not cleared. So we're talking now about A-Pole in the blood. So that A-Pole

300
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,840
in the blood has maybe a different role than the A-Pole in the brain.

301
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,880
By the way, before we go to the brain, Hussein, I'm very familiar with A-Pole C-3 in the scenarios

302
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,800
you've described it, and frankly, I'm quite hopeful that in the near future, we'll have A-Pole

303
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:05,480
C-3 assays in the periphery as an increase in our armamentarium as we try to use biomarkers

304
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,840
to better understand cardiovascular disease risk. And can A-Pole C-3 levels be a part of residual

305
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,880
risk? Once you've minimized A-Pole B, will A-Pole C-3 tell us something above and beyond it? And as

306
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,800
you said, it tracks so closely with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. I'm less

307
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,240
familiar with A-Pole in the periphery and wasn't actually aware of just how promiscuous it was.

308
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,080
It seems to have affinity for a number of receptors at the liver. Doesn't it also have

309
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,920
affinity for the LDL receptor itself? It does have an affinity for the LDL receptor, but its

310
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:45,800
affinity is higher for LRP1, which is one of the LDL receptor family members. Yeah, A-Pole

311
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,040
is a bit more complicated than the rest of the lipoproteins because it can take many shapes and

312
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,520
forms, and the affinities can change based on lipid binding. It has two arms, an N-terminus,

313
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,120
a C-terminus. Typically, the N-terminus binds to the receptor, and the C-terminus is buried

314
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:11,880
inside the lipid core of a lipoprotein particle. It can dislodge and become lipid-free, or it can

315
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,760
lipidate. These interactions are critical to our understanding of how A-Pole functions.

316
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:26,600
The reason why we've had an investment in science in A-Pole largely is due to A-Pole4, because that

317
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,040
mutation that substitutes the arginine, the cysteine with the arginine, changes how A-Pole

318
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:41,560
folds and unfolds and starts to carry in weapons. Now, we can measure the concentration of A-Pole

319
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,800
B in the circulation. We can measure the concentration of A-Pole A in circulation.

320
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:57,240
And in fact, as you said, A-Pole B is so predictably linked to LpA, VLDL, IDL, and LDL

321
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,400
that we effectively use A-Pole concentration as a surrogate for LDL concentration, and we

322
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:11,080
effectively use A-Pole1 concentration as a surrogate for HDL concentration. What does A-Pole

323
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,520
concentration mean? I mean, to my knowledge, there is no commercial assay to measure A-Pole

324
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:22,760
concentration in the periphery, but should you measure it in the lab, what would it tell you?

325
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,120
It's like asking me, what instrument does the conductor play? Does he?

326
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,800
Not at the time he's conducting. He plays them all, I suppose, but indirectly.

327
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,280
Right. So the A-Pole concentration is elusive because it doesn't matter what the concentration

328
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,080
is. That doesn't tell you the same amount of information that A-Pole B or A-Pole A1 does.

329
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,520
There is a one-to-one correlation ratio between every A-Pole B particle and every LDL particle.

330
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:05,000
So you're really closely estimating how much LDL particles there is by measuring A-Pole B.

331
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,320
A-Pole A is a little bit more complex. It's not one-to-one, it could be one-to-four,

332
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:18,760
but you can estimate with every four A-Pole A1, A-Pole lipoproteins, one HDL particle.

333
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:28,600
Now, when we talk about A-Pole, what are we talking about? A-Pole HDL, A-Pole free, A-Pole VLDL,

334
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,640
A-Pole ideal, A-Pole LDL. So if you have at one given concentration tons of A-Pole on HDL,

335
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,320
you have a completely different phenotype than if you have it on VLDL. Because as we mentioned with

336
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,560
the conductor is trying to now make all the orchestra work, they have to stretch themselves

337
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,160
and they have to make the violinist play harder, or they have to make the piano pick up at certain

338
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,480
point. You can't make an assessment of the function of A-Pole by just measuring its concentrations.

339
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:07,000
And to some extent that holds true for A-Pole C3, although A-Pole C3 at extremes of measurements

340
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,920
is more predictable and could be useful toward understanding residual risk in metabolic diseases,

341
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:21,880
but A-Pole is more elusive. So what is A-Pole, again, the A-Pole lipoprotein? We'll wait until

342
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,360
we understand this a bit better before we get down to the genetic isoforms. What is A-Pole

343
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,440
doing in the brain? How does the conductor regulate things in the brain? Oh, so that conductor

344
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:40,280
analogy may not hold because we don't have our traditional LDL, VLDL in the brain. We only have

345
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:49,480
A-Pole lipoprotein particles that you may argue are completely different than what you're finding

346
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:56,760
in plasma. Some group of scientists believe that A-Pole lipoproteins in the brain are HDL,

347
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,080
but that by itself also is not accurate. They could have the size of HDL, but the composition

348
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:11,720
might be very different. So A-Pole in the brain is not facilitating clearance of lipids or the rate

349
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:20,280
by which lipolysis is happening. Its role in the brain is largely supporting the astrocytes. So

350
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:29,400
astrocytes are supporting neurons, but for astrocytes to support neurons, they need a mechanism that can

351
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,520
efficiently cross-talk different cell types, and A-Pole happens to be able to do many different

352
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:46,360
things. For example, an A-Pole in a glial cell can regulate through the exchange of lipids how

353
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:53,480
inflammatory the glial cell is going to be. An A-Pole in an astrocyte can take out cholesterol

354
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,280
from the astrocyte and give it through an LRP1-mediated uptake in the neuron to the neuron itself.

355
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,640
ApoE's are notorious for being robust. One of the earliest studies I have done, maybe seven,

356
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:14,440
eight years ago, was cutting the nerve of a rat model, and at that point we did a mass spec

357
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,720
experiment and found out one of the largest changes in hundreds, if not thousands, of proteins after

358
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:28,280
you just take a neuron and cut it, are drastic changes in A-Pole. A-Pole exponentially goes up

359
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:36,200
after damage. Whether it's a stroke, whether it's an artificial severing of a nerve, A-Pole will be

360
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:44,200
released at very high rates to make sure repair is going to happen. A-Pole uses its flexibility,

361
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,000
structural flexibility to transport lipids, uses its structural flexibility to regulate what

362
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,480
receptors and transporters the cell can actually express. One fundamental difference between A-Pole

363
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:08,200
B and A-Pole is that A-Pole B, once it's taken up by a liver cell, typically goes and gets a lysosomal

364
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:16,360
degradation pathway, and that biology by Goldstein and others have led to therapies including

365
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,480
statins and later PCSK9 inhibitors because A-Pole B can get degraded in the lysosome.

366
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,400
And if you can figure out how A-Pole B is degraded, you can make a medication. Now one fundamental

367
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,920
difference about A-Pole B from A-Pole E is that A-Pole E to a large extent escapes degradation,

368
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,000
and once it's taken up by a liver cell or an astrocyte or a neuron, it recycles back.

369
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,200
So it's a notorious A-Pole lipoprotein that can get inside the cell and then outside the cell,

370
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:53,160
recycling most of the time. And by recycling, maybe the conducted analogy or the thermostat

371
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,560
analogy works. It controls or fine-tunes how much lipids there is in the cell, and it fine-tunes

372
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,640
a lot of different pathways which are tied to lipid metabolism,

373
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,840
most importantly the inflammatory pathway. Now I assume the blood-brain barrier prevents

374
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:18,920
peripheral A-Pole from entering the brain and vice versa? The dogma says yes, but our research,

375
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,320
recent research suggests that A-Pole E4 but not A-Pole E3 might be able to slip.

376
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,000
Slip through all of those tight junctions? No, not through the tight junctions. The affinity

377
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,200
of A-Pole E4 to the LRP1 is quite higher than A-Pole E3 and A-Pole E2, and LRP1 is expressed

378
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,080
at the blood-brain barrier. So it could hack the system and get through the endothelial LRP1

379
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:46,040
into the brain. And do we have a sense of what the half-life is of A-Pole? I mean A-Pole,

380
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,240
as you said, is a relatively short half-life. I mean it's even without medication, it's life,

381
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,040
it's residence time and circulation is probably less than a week before it's going to get

382
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,200
recycled vis-a-vis the liver. How long is A-Pole hanging around?

383
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,440
That's a complicated question. The answer to that is which particle are we talking about?

384
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,520
Well, I'm actually saying the A-Pole itself in any form, whether it be free or bound to something

385
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,640
else, the actual A-Pole can, it sounds like what you're saying is it can be around for a very long

386
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,720
period of time and take multiple forms. Yeah, so if it's a lipid-free form, A-Pole can be rapidly

387
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,760
excreted or disappeared from the circulation. If it's bound to HDL, it tends to hang longer.

388
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:36,120
If it's bound to VLDL, it tends to hang out less because VLDL clearance rates are faster than

389
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:45,320
that of HDL. And this is a manage, so A-Pole is converting those properties to the lipoprotein

390
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:52,200
that's actually going to. All right, let's now talk a bit about the genetics that regulate

391
00:43:52,200 --> 00:44:00,920
these different isoforms because A-Pole is a protein that exists in different forms and

392
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,320
that's not true of all of our genes. Now, thousands and thousands of years ago, say hundreds of

393
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,960
thousands of years ago, there was really only one isoform to the best of our knowledge, correct?

394
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:18,840
And that's the one that today we give the moniker E4 to, is that correct? That's right.

395
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:25,320
So just for the sake of argument, a couple hundred thousand years ago, all of our ancestors had one

396
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,440
version of this gene, so you had two copies of the E4 because you have two copies of every gene.

397
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:39,480
And what do we believe was the reason for that? I mean, presumably evolution has strong pressure.

398
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,960
Do we have a sense of what an A-Pole E4, well, actually before we do that, Hussein, let's ask

399
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,200
maybe the more relevant question, which is when did that change and what was the next isoform to

400
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,720
show up and do we have a sense of why? So I'm not an evolutionary biologist to give you

401
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,160
accurate responses, but I can probably ask the first question better than the second question.

402
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,120
And I think fundamentally I was alluding to in a few minutes ago to an important inflammatory

403
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:20,040
function for A-Pole E. A-Pole E is capable of turning a cell into an acute inflammatory state,

404
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:26,440
especially glial cells or immune cells, such as the macrophage. When the cell expresses A-Pole E,

405
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:36,280
it changes quite substantially its lipid content and it might be better equipped to become an

406
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:46,120
inflamed cell or the opposite. When the cell exchanges A-Pole E, it's also better equipped

407
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:53,240
to be a less inflamed cell. I know these are contradicting statements, but you have to realize

408
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:59,640
that A-Pole E can regulate things. You know, you can turn your thermostat on and off. It's not

409
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,840
one thing or the other. It could be in different forms depending on the situation,

410
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:12,120
on the interaction, on the time. It can flip because of its structural flexibility. Now A-Pole E4,

411
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:20,920
which is our ancestral variant, has a greater capacity to aggregate than A-Pole E3 and A-Pole E2.

412
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:29,160
This aggregation means that they're not suspended in solution favors a strong inflammatory response.

413
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:39,480
So when A-Pole E4 starts aggregating inside a microglia, it makes an acute inflammatory response

414
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:48,760
much more efficient and much more directed toward what the microglia is fighting. So let's step back

415
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,080
and imagine that we are 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. And then out of every 10, 20 births,

416
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:02,600
few are surviving and the others are dying. From peripheral sepsis, from other forms of infection,

417
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:13,480
we know now that A-Pole E4 women had a better chance of giving child births and protection from

418
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:21,240
peripheral sepsis compared to non-E4 women in the slums of Brazil or in certain areas in Africa.

419
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:33,240
We know that based on studies that E4 confers some form of an advantage. We also know that those who

420
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:41,240
have had E4 may have had better luck surviving not only parasitic infections. So in certain

421
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:49,480
countries in Nigeria, people who have had the E4 and is anophilia tend to be much healthier

422
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:59,480
than E4 carriers without is anophilia. And more importantly, non-E4 carriers with is anophilia.

423
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:07,000
So if you are living in a place where parasites are common and they're constantly testing your

424
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,400
immune system, you are much better off carrying the A-Pole E4 allele than not.

425
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,000
Locally, the macrophage is much better equipped to deal with the parasite. And importantly,

426
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,600
your brain is much better equipped to deal with whether it's TB, meningitis, and the mother would

427
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:34,360
be better equipped to fight a septic event during childbirth. So from that perspective,

428
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:42,120
ApoE4 is our ancestral gene. Now what happened over the last few hundred thousand years,

429
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:49,720
perhaps maybe over the last few hundred years, and let's not go far, we turned from a septic

430
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:57,320
environment to gradually an aseptic environment. And the second change that happened is that we've

431
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,760
prolonged our lifespan. And I know that you have a deal interest in aging. So we have now,

432
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,920
it's surprising to me reading from history books that just a hundred years ago, we're not talking

433
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:14,360
a hundred thousand years ago, a hundred years ago, the mean age was something of the 47. Am I

434
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,760
making things up? Does that make sense to you? It depends on where you look, but it was a little

435
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,640
more than 47, a hundred years ago in the developed world. But you're right. I mean, I think about,

436
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:30,760
you could say about a hundred to 150 years ago was really when we saw a big uptick in lifespan.

437
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,000
Right. So if that's the case, and let's assume we're not talking about the the kings and queens

438
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,840
in England, and let's talk about those people living in Nigeria or in Africa, anywhere you

439
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:49,800
or in Brazil. And let's imagine that these people have several milestones that they have to go

440
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,960
through to be able to survive to their next decade. And you would notice two things. One,

441
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:04,280
that APU-E4 carriers are surviving better. Two, that you're not seeing a disadvantage of APU-E4,

442
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:12,120
because these people are not living to 80. Some of them would probably die at 50 or 60 or 70,

443
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:21,240
but certainly they may not have the resources to make it to 96. So what happens to E4 carriers

444
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:27,400
when they're dying at 60 or 65? I mean, what I'm trying to say is, what doesn't happen to APU-E4

445
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:34,680
carriers when they're dying at 65? They don't get Alzheimer's. In that regards, it might provide

446
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:43,320
a plausible explanation of why this ancestral gene worked for us in the past, but may not work for us

447
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,840
in this modern aging population. It's always been confusing to me why there was any evolutionary

448
00:50:50,840 --> 00:51:00,040
pressure to create variants of E3 and E2, because the best of my reading is that the E3 showed up

449
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:07,960
about 50,000 years ago, and E2 showed up about 10,000 years ago. And again, from a functional

450
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:14,200
standpoint, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 are basically the same. Nobody was really living

451
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:21,400
long enough to recoup the benefit of Alzheimer's disease risk reduction going from 300,000 years

452
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,440
ago to 50,000 to 10,000. No, I would look at that from a different perspective. I would,

453
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,080
again, no anthropologist, and my knowledge is really as mediocre as any of your readers or listeners.

454
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,840
I would look at it as mass movement and change in environment. From 200,000 years to 100,000 years

455
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,280
ago, there was mass movement from the African continents all the way to Europe, and that was

456
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:52,840
associated with a drastic change in diet. My understanding is that there was a heavily

457
00:51:52,840 --> 00:52:00,280
favored meat consumption, including fish, in the rift valleys in Africa and in the savannas. And

458
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:06,040
when they moved to a plant-based diet in Northern Europe and where they started farming, I think

459
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:14,120
that put pressure on APOE4 and allowed APOE3 and APOE2 to be more successful. And this is a

460
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:21,720
slightly different twist because APOE4, as much as it's very strong against inflammation, it thrives

461
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:30,840
on a specific dietary lipid-providing environment. And remember that APOE4, one of the fundamental

462
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:37,480
aspects that we learned from Alzheimer's is that APOE4 makes Glute 1 less successful at the

463
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:46,280
blood-brain barrier. So what APOE4 does, it somehow tells the brain, you know, I don't want you to be

464
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:54,360
eating sugar all the time. You have to be more resilient and rely on fat. And again, this is a

465
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:02,840
hypothesis. This is not based on true hard science, but the idea is that our ancestral APOE4

466
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:12,200
diets matched APOE4. And then when they moved to a plant-based diet, the effect of APOE4 on Glute 1

467
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:18,120
was now counterintuitive. Now there's more carbohydrates and you want something that

468
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,960
will help Glute 1 and not oppose it. And APOE3 and APOE2 would actually favor a more robust

469
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,640
Glute 1 expression of the blood-brain barrier, which means they favor a more glucose utilization

470
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:38,440
of the brain. So when did it first become apparent, either to epidemiologists or neurologists or

471
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:46,680
anybody else studying it for that matter, that these three isoforms predicted a very different

472
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:54,920
risk of Alzheimer's disease in modern humans? The story is we're in the late 80s and this is a time

473
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:02,200
where genetics is gaining traction. You know, I recently watched a very nice series, I think,

474
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:10,040
on PBS Masterpieces discussing how a revolution in genetic fingerprinting changed how we do policing,

475
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,720
figured out who is guilty and who's not. And that happened. What's interesting is that this

476
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:24,680
science was happening between 81 and 84. So around 1988-89, a researcher at Duke by the name of

477
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:31,880
Alan Rosas was running an Alzheimer's group and had access to a very robust, at that time robust

478
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,360
enough, obviously now it's not robust at all, but he had the ability to genetically profile a large

479
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:46,040
number of common variants of people dying with and without Alzheimer's. At that point in time,

480
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:53,960
he publishes a case series, a few hundreds, with and without Alzheimer's and identifies that

481
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,920
patients with Alzheimer's had substantially higher ApoE4 compared to non-Alzheimer's. And,

482
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:07,240
you know, remember that we have known ApoE4 since the 60s. So this is not a new discovery,

483
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:12,520
but we didn't know anything about ApoE4 and Alzheimer's disease until that time.

484
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:19,320
So he meets a lot of backlash because the prevailing hypothesis at that time is that Alzheimer's

485
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:25,480
is amyloid accumulating and leading to the amyloid cascade hypothesis where you form

486
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:31,400
amyloid plaques and then you get taut angles. And the field at that point was heavily vested in this

487
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:40,040
amyloid hypothesis. So Alan Rosas later on, a few years later, publishes a larger study,

488
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:47,720
which contains now longitudinal follow-up people, you know, progressing to disease and confirms the

489
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:54,600
observation that if you are an ApoE4 carrier, chances of getting Alzheimer's are substantially

490
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:00,440
higher than if you are a non-ApoE4 carrier. And we're talking about late onset Alzheimer's disease,

491
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:07,880
the most common form, which happens after the age of 60. So at that time, Alan Rosas cemented

492
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:16,360
his name as among those who identified the association of ApoE4 with AD. Do you have a

493
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,360
rough sense at the time, and I think it's probably quite different today, but do you have a broad

494
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:32,600
sense at the time of what the hazard ratios were of E44 versus 34 versus 33? I don't think the

495
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:39,240
hazard ratios would change substantially in a matter of two to three decades. So what we know

496
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:46,520
now is that if you have two copies of ApoE4, your chance of getting Alzheimer's increases 12 fold.

497
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,960
If you have one copy of ApoE4, your chance of having Alzheimer's increases anywhere from two to

498
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:01,800
four fold. And what does that matter, by the way, if it's a four, two, or a four, three? Yeah, so four,

499
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,640
three means you have one copy of ApoE4. And the question becomes a little difficult when you have

500
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:14,360
two, four, because two is supposed to be protective. Those who have ApoE2 are protected

501
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:20,280
from getting Alzheimer's disease. So the two, four carriers sometimes behave as four, sometimes

502
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:26,200
behave as two, and this might have to do with how well these proteins are getting expressed inside

503
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:35,080
the cells. And potentially other genes as well, like Tom40 or FGF and things like that that seem

504
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,360
to also play a role here, but or frankly, things that we haven't understood, like you see families

505
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:48,120
with a very involved family history, and they might only have one copy of the E4, but it's,

506
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,360
it's a, it behaves in a very virulent way. I mean, you see the same thing in cardiovascular disease

507
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:59,160
where some families have LP little a, and the level is not particularly high, but it still behaves

508
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:06,040
very aggressively. And you'll see other families where LP little a is, I mean, astronomically high,

509
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:12,920
and yet they seem largely spared of premature atherosclerosis. Correct. So I think one way to

510
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:20,840
rephrase the question is, how do we explain that not all ApoE4 carriers have the same risk of

511
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:27,720
Alzheimer's disease? And that's largely seen by ethnicity. So people who live in Nigeria,

512
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:33,640
for example, the risk of having Alzheimer's disease is substantially less than people who

513
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:42,440
live in the US or in Japan. The Hispanic Latino Latinx population carrying an E4 does not produce

514
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:50,920
the same risk of AD compared to white people or Japanese people carrying the ApoE4. So how do we

515
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,720
explain that? And that's a fundamentally important question. And as you just alluded to or noted,

516
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:05,160
ApoE4 is part of a gene locus that in other words, it's part of a haplotype.

517
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:13,480
That's a section of a chromosome where a bunch of gene variants are getting co-inherited.

518
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:22,200
They are within the same locus. So ApoE4 is found on chromosome 19. Around ApoE4 is approximately

519
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:29,960
20 to 30 different gene variants that happen to be co-inherited with ApoE4. And the description

520
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,680
between these gene variants are described by what we call linkage disequilibrium. If the

521
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:43,800
linkage disequilibrium is closer to one, it means every time you have ApoE4, let's assume now we're

522
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:50,280
talking about the long version of Tom40, you can have the long version of Tom40 expressed with it.

523
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:57,480
Now that linkage disequilibrium is what differs between ethnicities and can largely also explain

524
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:05,640
why certain ethnicities develop disease and certain don't. So as humans or generations are

525
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:13,400
getting interbred and crossed, the fidelity of this linkage disequilibrium can start getting

526
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,640
breached. Meaning now you can start introducing the short version of Tom40 next to ApoE4.

527
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:27,720
Or you can start introducing another version of ApoC1 or ApoC2 or ApoC3. All these are in the

528
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:36,840
same location as the ApoE, together with again another 20 to 30 other genes. So that doesn't

529
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:42,600
diminish the importance of ApoE4, but tells us that ApoE4 by itself may not be sufficient to

530
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,200
provide disease. It has to be in an environment that promotes its pathogenicity.

531
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:56,840
And all things equal, from a clinical perspective, we are more worried when someone of Asian or

532
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:05,800
Caucasian ethnicity has it versus someone of Latin or African descent. Is that a fair assessment?

533
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Again, it's an oversimplification, but just based on the epidemiology and also based on frankly,

534
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:18,280
potentially what you said earlier, which is the origin of the gene. This is a gene that

535
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:26,120
takes its roots very early in our ancestry and offered an important protection.

536
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,200
And potentially by the time we migrated to a more northern climate, some of that protection

537
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:38,840
was less necessary. Again, that's a teleologic sort of hand waving rationalization. But is that

538
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:46,760
a safe assessment that everything you're saying risk is just going to be higher in Caucasians and Asians?

539
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,800
I wouldn't go with a blank statement. Maybe in general, yes, but maybe there are what we call

540
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,320
either gene-gene interactions or gene environment interactions that have to take into account.

541
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:06,520
Let me give you a simple example. In a Colombian study, they show that ApoE4 by itself may not

542
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:13,000
substantially increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but since diabetes is prevalent in a

543
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,560
certain city in Colombia, diabetics who were ApoE4 carriers had substantial increase in AD risk

544
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:26,360
compared to diabetics alone or ApoE4 carriers alone. And this is an example of a gene by

545
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:34,440
environment interaction. So just to be sure we got that right, E4 with diabetes was higher risk

546
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:41,960
than E4 without diabetes and higher risk than diabetes without E4. Yes. By way of comparison,

547
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:48,760
do you recall what the risk was of E4 without diabetes to diabetes without E4, which was second?

548
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,160
I don't recall the numbers, but I can tell you they were not striking at all. So when I actually

549
01:02:53,160 --> 01:03:01,480
looked at the data, the E4 risk by itself seemed barely above non-E4 carriers. So if you looked at

550
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:08,040
it and you'd say, this is a healthy Colombian who's farming all day long, lean, and they have

551
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:14,440
absolutely no metabolic diseases, the E4 is doing nothing. Yeah. You mentioned something earlier

552
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,200
that I thought was super fascinating. I want to come back to it, which is some of the diet

553
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,000
interactions. So let's go back to where you left it, which was when talking about it through the

554
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,480
lens of the E4 carrier. The first thing you mentioned is, look, E4 makes GLUT1 less successful

555
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:34,760
at the blood-brain barrier. And you've already established for us that GLUT1 is basically

556
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:40,520
regulated by peripheral glucose concentration. Its purpose is to make sure that when glucose is

557
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:46,440
in low abundance, the brain gets first dibs on it, and that when glucose is in overly high

558
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,960
abundance, the brain is protected from it. So now you have an E4, you have a person who's an E4

559
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,840
variant, they're less sensitive to that mechanism. Presumably that means in an environment richer in

560
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:05,800
glucose, they're less able to appropriately partition fuel. Is that a safe assessment?

561
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:12,360
Yes. You can argue that in an environment that is rich of glucose, or maybe in a different term,

562
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:20,680
an insulin resistant environment, E4 carriers are less capable of regulating by many mechanisms in

563
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:26,520
gluting GLUT1, the fluctuations in glucose, and they're more susceptible to disease. But by no

564
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:33,160
means this is a restricted relationship of APOE4 to GLUT1, because we also know from studies that

565
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:39,320
we have done in others, that APOE4 also affect the transporters that transport omega-3 fatty

566
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,440
acids into the brain. Now we're going to come to that in a moment, because that of course is,

567
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:50,840
I mean, in many ways, one of the most interesting things to now talk about. But before we go there,

568
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:59,560
I do want to come back to this idea of, do we have an understanding of type 2 diabetes, which is

569
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:04,600
simply a very extreme version of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation, does it

570
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:13,640
disproportionately then, I hate to use the word, but punish carriers of APOE4 versus E3 versus E2?

571
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,440
Is that clearly established in the epidemiology? I don't think so.

572
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:28,200
I wouldn't look at it as type 2 diabetes is a distinct disease that punishes APOE4, because type

573
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:34,280
2 diabetes to me is a syndrome, not a disease. So what are we talking about? And it's frankly a

574
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:39,160
pretty significant spectrum for that matter. Correct. So are we talking about an individual

575
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:44,760
who is consuming a large amount of carbohydrates who gets type 2 diabetes? Are we talking about

576
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:52,840
APOE4 itself? Because as you probably may know, APOE4 by itself creates a system with aging that

577
01:05:52,840 --> 01:06:01,720
makes an individual insulin resistant. So in one regards, APOE4 could be a factor for why a certain

578
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:09,080
person may get type 2 diabetes. So in that regards, APOE4 is not conspiring with type 2 diabetes

579
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:16,760
it might be behind type 2 diabetes. So you have to look at type 2 diabetes from a more individualized

580
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:24,360
causal, what's causing type 2 diabetes here? Is it the diet? Is it genetics? And how is APOE4

581
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:32,280
interacting with this phenotype is probably more complicated than an A1c and the genotype

582
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:38,280
in the large population. Because when you look deep enough into these studies, you find quite

583
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:45,240
a bit of discordant results that makes it hard to explain. You sort of alluded to it earlier that

584
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:53,960
the E4 carriers as they migrated, ancestrally say out of Africa or even out of South America,

585
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:59,720
were primarily consuming a diet lower in carbohydrates, presumably higher in protein

586
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:09,000
and fat. Do we have any reason to believe today that there is a rationale for matching diet to

587
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:18,440
genotype? So right now in major studies that looked at APOE4 dietary patterns in the Western world,

588
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,440
they don't differ by genotype. So if you're looking at the US or Europe, an APOE4 carrier

589
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,880
may well likely be eating a similar diet, a non-carrier. Now would that lead to the same

590
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,400
detrimental effect? Yeah, sorry. My question is less about the existing dietary pattern and more

591
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:42,360
of the prospective ask of is there a reason to change dietary pattern to produce a better outcome?

592
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:50,440
Yes, of course. So this is part of what we're studying is how does APOE4 interact with the

593
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:58,360
diet and how that interaction can change disease processes. And what we know is that the first

594
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:04,360
concept that your listeners should be aware of is that APOE4 is a disease of aging.

595
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,240
Do you mean Alzheimer's disease is a disease of aging?

596
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:13,320
Or? Alzheimer's disease is a disease of aging, but APOE4 risk of developing Alzheimer's and aging

597
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:22,040
related diseases is fundamentally based on the aged model. Younger 35 year olds, APOE4 carriers,

598
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:30,520
to my knowledge, do not have frank presentations of a disease. A younger APOE4 carrier who could

599
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:36,840
be myself or you or anybody else could be fully functional. It's only when you hit a certain age

600
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:45,160
that APOE4 carriers start to have problems and not all of them. So the majority of APOE4 carriers,

601
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:51,720
you may argue, are surviving, they're striving, they're doing okay. So there's only a subset of

602
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:57,560
APOE4 carriers who are aging and getting disease. So then the question is, who are these people?

603
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,000
How do we explain them? Is it only generics or is there a dietary genetic interaction?

604
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:10,520
And I think the answer to this question has to do with what is happening with these people as they

605
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:19,000
age. Are they developing other diseases? Are they, for example, we know that an APOE4 carriers who

606
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,520
happen to be the victim of a traumatic brain injury has much worse outcomes than that without

607
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:31,400
traumatic brain injury. We know that an APOE4 carrier possibly with type 2 diabetes may have

608
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:37,880
worse outcomes than an APOE4 carrier without. But again, as I mentioned to you, this is a little bit

609
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,200
more complicated because not all type 2 diabetes is the same. We know that an APOE4 carrier who

610
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:50,120
may have a second head could be a genetic second head. They're inheriting another protein that

611
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:56,440
increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Now their path toward disease is much more accelerated.

612
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:03,640
So what we also know is that as we age, our ability, ourselves,

613
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:12,920
lose the ability to regenerate and to sustain a certain status. And that is associated with

614
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:21,720
lapses in energy production. That is associated with several complications, which include at the

615
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:31,000
blood-brain barrier, a reduced ability to express those Glut1 transporters, Omega-3 transporters,

616
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,240
and even ketone body transporters. So the aging APOE4 individual who has second and third heads

617
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:47,000
is now straining the brain and leading to an environment where in this situation

618
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:55,000
the diet may make a difference. Another angle to look at this question is there are certain diets

619
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,480
and you know coming from the cardiovascular background, we both agree that there are certain

620
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:08,680
diets that can accelerate aging or create a form of stress that can be the second head that APOE4

621
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:16,120
carriers are exposed to accelerate toward an aging brain that is diseased. I know the answers

622
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:26,920
may not be crystal clear, but the diet interaction with APOE4 is contingent upon aging and a second

623
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:35,480
or a third head. But what seems interesting and what you just said to me is a big part of the

624
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:43,800
manner in which APOE4 transmits its risk to the individual is through an energy crisis.

625
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:51,400
Much of what you said had to do with substrate. It had to do with reducing

626
01:11:52,280 --> 01:12:00,520
the utilization of and or access to substrate. Is that a fair assessment? That is one hypothesis.

627
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:07,800
It's a prevailing energy hypothesis that links APOE4 with disease and aging. There are other

628
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:16,040
hypotheses which do not have to be exclusive of this hypothesis, meaning that you could also have

629
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:24,440
an energy slash inflammation differences that predispose APOE4 to neuroinflammation

630
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:33,400
and that by itself could lead to an accelerated disease pathway. You could also have an APOE4

631
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,000
backslash. It could be a vascular component here as well. Yeah, a vascular or leakage component.

632
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,720
There's a group at USC where I work that has shown that there is leakage in the

633
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:49,320
blood-brain barrier allowing toxins to get into the brain and shrink cells. That is by itself

634
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:57,240
non-exclusively related to the dietary or the inflammation. We do not want to say,

635
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,320
this is it and that's only it. It is plausible that there are multiple heads,

636
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,040
but you could look at it from different angles. Well, not only that, I mean those hits are

637
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,880
synergistic and in the wrong direction. If you have leaky blood-brain barrier and you're more

638
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:18,520
predisposed to inflammation, which again, as you pointed out, was very helpful 300,000 years ago

639
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,880
when we were fraught with parasites, you now have two hits within the same hit, which is you're more

640
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,840
likely to get toxins across the blood-brain barrier, which is bad in and of itself. Then secondly,

641
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,400
you're more likely to have an overreactive immune response to it. If you couple that

642
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:39,240
with say a third hit of neuronal energy starvation, these things begin to circle.

643
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:48,680
Let's pivot for a moment now to another enormous area of focus for you, which is the role of omega

644
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,200
3 fatty acids. This is such an interesting topic. There's nobody listening to this who hasn't heard

645
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,760
of omega 3 fatty acids. Even if they haven't heard of them in exactly those terms, people have

646
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:05,640
certainly heard the terms EPA and DHA. There's no shortage of confusion about these things.

647
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,200
I guess for the odd person who maybe just doesn't know exactly what we're talking about, can you

648
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:17,000
give just a brief overview of what EPA and DHA are and why we spend so much time and energy

649
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,360
trying to study and understand their role in human health? There isn't really a short answer

650
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:28,520
to a complicated question like this one, but in a nutshell, when you break down the components of

651
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:37,080
the brain, you find that a significant portion, in some studies 50 or 40 percent of the brain is

652
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:47,800
composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DHA, EPA, and arachidonic acid AA. The EPA, DHA,

653
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:55,880
and add to that alpha linoleic acid ALA are known as omega 3s. In contrast, arachidonic acid is in

654
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:04,440
omega 6. So the brain is highly enriched in both omega 3s and omega 6s, and you contemplate why.

655
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:10,680
Why do we have so much of these fatty acids in the brain? And the fundamental answer has to do

656
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:18,920
with membrane fluidity. Having polyunsaturated fatty acids in neuronal membrane facilitates

657
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:25,080
to a large extent the neuronal firing that we just talked about in the beginning. So this

658
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:32,600
composition of fat allows the brain or the neurons to conduct their work very efficiently.

659
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:40,680
So DHA is the predominant building block, the most commonly found omega 3 in the brain.

660
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:48,920
EPA is not that common. DHA or docosa hexanoic acid is given that name because of the number

661
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:57,240
of fatty acids and the number of double bonds. It's six. EPA has five of, and we're talking about

662
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:05,800
the location of the double bonds in the structure of DHA or EPA. EPA is not very abundant

663
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:13,160
in the brain, but that doesn't mean it's not very important. EPA is less abundant but has

664
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:21,640
perhaps stronger anti-inflammatory effects than DHA. There is limited interconversion between DHA

665
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:30,680
and EPA, but DHA can become EPA. And also EPA can become DHA, but that process is also limited.

666
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:37,240
The reason people talk about omega 3s and they make a big deal out of it is because the human

667
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:43,400
body doesn't have an efficient system to make them from scratch. In fact, you can't make them

668
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:49,800
from scratch. If you want to make them, you need a precursor known as alpha-alinoic acids or ALA

669
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:58,360
by a group of desaturases. ALA can get transformed into DHA and EPA. However, it is widely believed

670
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:08,280
that only 0.5% of DHA and EPA are made from conversion of ALA. That number though, you have

671
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,120
to take it with a grain of salt because there might be evidence that in diets vegetarians or

672
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:19,720
vegans who do not eat fish, that conversion rate may actually be much higher. But despite that,

673
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:27,560
that conversion rate has not been documented to exceed 5%. So at the most, 5% of DHA and EPA

674
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:35,880
can come from ALA, although most people argue that it's only 0.5%. So what does that mean for us?

675
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:43,960
If we can't make DHA and EPA and we rely on diet to get them, what does it mean that we are not

676
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:51,560
getting them? So what I've just alluded to is the US diet. And you probably know as much as I do

677
01:17:51,560 --> 01:18:01,320
even more that the US diet is not enriched in DHA or EPA. The consumption of DHA and EPA in the US,

678
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:08,280
I can give you an example, DHA is averaging 100 milligrams per day, is low. That consumption

679
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:17,880
may not provide enough omega-3s to the brain. And the question is, does that result in disease?

680
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:28,600
And the answer is likely, yes. Now what we don't know is the supplementing people with omega-3s

681
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:35,960
make a difference. And the answer to that question is, at this point we don't know that that makes a

682
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:44,120
difference. Simply because research on supplements have not panned out. It's very conflicted. There

683
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:50,360
are positive studies, there are negative studies, and the supplements themselves are quite distinct

684
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:56,520
and different in production and concentrations and quantities and qualities. So I know I have

685
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:02,280
alluded to a lot of different aspects of this field, but the answer to your question is that

686
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:09,320
these omega-3 fatty acids are important for the brain. We can't make them efficiently and we're

687
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:16,440
not consuming enough of them. And as you also alluded to, when we supplement them, they can come

688
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:23,800
in various forms, right? We can get them from microalgae, which tend to be triglyceride based.

689
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:31,800
We can refine them from fish oils directly, which are ethyl esters, or they can come from

690
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:38,200
krill oils, which are phospholipid based. Does that sound about right? Yes, yes. You can get

691
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:44,440
omega-3s from all these sources. It basically has to be marine. I mean, that's sort of the bottom

692
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:52,040
line is it has to have some sort of tie to algae or microalgae either being consumed by other

693
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:57,640
things like fish. And it's funny, I sort of remember many years ago reading something very

694
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:04,680
interesting that explained why EPA and DHA had to have some sort of a marine origin predominantly,

695
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:10,920
and it had to do with the formation of the third carbon double bond. And I can't remember any more

696
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,280
than that. Does that ring a bell, anything about this? I can tell you that the complexity of the

697
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:23,000
structural distribution of these double bonds requires a certain machinery to make them that

698
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:31,480
is present in algae. Now, why wouldn't other species make it? I don't know. Yeah, it had to do exactly

699
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:39,560
with the very, very complex carbon fixation that only algae could do. Let's start with what we know.

700
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,840
You have a pretty good sense that people who have higher levels of EPA and DHA from consumption of

701
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:55,080
fish have better outcomes than people who don't. Do we know that pretty well? I don't know. I honestly

702
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:03,960
don't know if this is very clear. What my knowledge is, is that the opposite might be closer to truth,

703
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:14,280
meaning that people who don't eat at all fish or seafood or omega-3 rich diets might be at a higher

704
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:20,360
increased risk of disease as opposed to the other statement, which means people who eat a lot of them

705
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:26,360
have less disease. So what I'm trying to point out is that there could be a deficiency state that

706
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:32,200
predisposes somebody to disease, but once you meet that threshold, you may or may not get much more

707
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:39,000
benefit. Yeah. So in other words, you can get scurvy from insufficient vitamin C, but there's

708
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,680
probably little evidence to suggest that supplementing vitamin C offers health protection and benefit

709
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:49,000
beyond the RDA. Yes. By the way, for what it's worth, I believe that's true with vitamin C. I

710
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,120
think there's no evidence to suggest it's helpful in massive doses. Nevertheless, there's been no

711
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:02,840
shortage of attempts to study this question, and there have been some significant studies that have

712
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:08,680
gone to great lengths to do this. Now, although we're talking about the brain, you are no stranger

713
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:15,720
to the heart. So can we pivot for a moment to talk about a very interesting study published

714
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:23,240
probably about 18 months ago that looked at a very high dose of EPA, four grams, in individuals

715
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:28,920
with elevated triglycerides and a number of other risks. And I have to be honest with you, to my

716
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:35,240
surprise, produced kind of an amazing outcome. It was not what I expected. Of course, I'm speaking

717
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:40,040
about the REDUCE-IT study. Do you want to give people just a quick overview of that study and

718
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:46,200
what it found and what your thoughts are on that study? So the background is some Japanese studies

719
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:55,800
over a decade ago has suggested that a certain EPA to arachidonic acid ratio was associated with

720
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:03,880
substantially less cardiovascular disease in certain regions in Japan. And there were some trials

721
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:12,120
in Japan at that point that have attempted supplementing EPA, and the results were positive,

722
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,200
but they were not conclusive. So they were using something around two grams of EPA,

723
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,840
and they found out some trends which were very exciting, but again, they were not strong enough

724
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:33,480
to make an official recommendation. So somehow this led to a concerted effort in the US to try

725
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:42,840
to answer this question. Can we give high doses of EPA to mimic this ratio that they found in Japan

726
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:51,560
of EPA consumption and translate into less cardiovascular events? So it became an interesting

727
01:23:51,560 --> 01:24:00,280
question to pursue, and the REDUCE-IT investigators decided to go ahead and run a large

728
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:08,600
multi-center trial where they gave four grams of pure EPA, and they selected people who they

729
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:13,640
thought would benefit the most from this intervention, and those included people with

730
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:20,360
diabetes, high triglycerides, because EPA is known to lower triglycerides, and they monitored them for

731
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:27,320
cardiovascular events over a period of a few years. And they found out that compared to their placebo

732
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:35,000
arm, those who were given four grams of EPA per day did substantially better. The study had one

733
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:45,160
flaw, and I don't know if it's a fatal flaw or not, I think that needs to be figured out. The placebo

734
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:53,000
in that arm was not your typical placebo. So typically when you do omega-3 or fatty acid

735
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,720
intervention trials, the most common placebo is corn oil, soybean oil, and in this case,

736
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:06,920
so they used mineral oil, and they were criticized at the time of publication whether EPA indeed

737
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:13,880
reduced cardiovascular events or did mineral oil increase cardiovascular events. Before we leave

738
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:21,720
that, let's understand that a bit more. So corn oil, safflower, canola, those are more E6 than E3.

739
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:26,520
They have a little bit of ALA in them, and they still have some monounsaturated fats in them, but

740
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,200
is it safe to say that they're probably more than 50% omega-6? Yes, but the concentrations given in

741
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:39,400
them is not high. The concentration of E6 is really a low amount. These people are not consuming

742
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:45,960
grams of E6. And what's mineral oils breakdown? What's it formed from? I mean, my only interaction

743
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:51,560
with mineral oil is to polish my cutting board, you know, or to make sure my cutting board doesn't

744
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:58,360
get too dry. Yeah, I mean, to be honest with you, I don't know. But all of this came after the fact.

745
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:03,960
We've never considered in our trials mineral oil because it was never an option, and it was very

746
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:10,760
obscure that that mineral oil was chosen in that trial to be the placebo. And I don't think they

747
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:15,400
even thought about this until the study was published. And then people started asking.

748
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,600
I see. Yeah. And I mean, I think mineral oil, frankly, is totally different. I mean,

749
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:26,120
I don't, it's probably more resembles like a petroleum based product or something like that.

750
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,360
I don't think it's like a fatty acid in the sense that corn oil is or anything like that.

751
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,720
Yeah, that is odd that they would use that. But they were given presumably four grams of

752
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:42,760
mineral oil every day as well in a placebo. Right. And I think the decision to make or to

753
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:49,960
create mineral oil as the placebo at that point in time was not thought of from a health perspective,

754
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:58,360
but mostly from maybe what's available or economic or matching the taste of the intervention itself.

755
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:04,760
So there was indeed thinking about what would happen if you added so much mineral oil.

756
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:09,800
In a study like this one. And I think the investigators have regretted that decision,

757
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:15,560
but in hindsight is always 20, 20. Yeah. And it's certainly a plausible explanation,

758
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:23,640
given just how significant the effect was in reduce it. I mean, it was wasn't the absolute

759
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,600
risk reduction, something on the order of 4% or something like that. I mean, it was

760
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,640
an exit. It was certainly on par with what you see in some of the most potent drug trials.

761
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:41,800
Yes. Yes. And this was surprising. And what's important is in science, you always have to be

762
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:49,560
skeptical and you always need to find whether any particular study can be replicated or not before

763
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:57,240
you make strong recommendations and adopt any drastic change in how you are consuming certain

764
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:03,480
things or whether it's a medication or a diet or a supplement. So the company was able to make

765
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:12,360
very strong claims that high doses of EPA are important addition to the standard management of

766
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:17,560
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis at the time of its publication, and even urged

767
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:25,720
the FDA to add that indication, which the FDA appeared to agree to. But at the same time,

768
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:33,560
other studies were going on the pipeline to confirm, although they did not use the same

769
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:41,080
identical ethyl ester EPA, because that is perhaps patented by the company that made

770
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:47,000
that particular drug. And I don't want to mention any particular drug in the show because I'm not

771
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,440
trying to promote anything. So long story short, what we have learned from the American Heart

772
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:58,520
Association a few months ago is that high doses of EPA did not translate into cardiovascular

773
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:07,160
benefit when compared to corn oil or the other standard form of. Now you're referring to the

774
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:15,960
strength trial, correct? Yes. Now, was that a high dose of EPA or was that EPA and DHA combined?

775
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:22,280
It was predominantly a high dose EPA, although I think there was DHA in it. The predominant form

776
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:30,680
that was given was EPA. And what was the dose? That was four grams omega three. Yeah, I think

777
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:35,240
you're right. I think it was probably about three grams and one gram is my recollection.

778
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,600
Yeah, I can look at them. I do not want to give your listeners any inaccurate information. So if

779
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,640
you like, we could just look up, but it was a predominantly EPA supplement. Yeah. And as you

780
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:50,840
said, when compared to a corn oil, that study showed essentially zero difference between them.

781
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:57,720
So again, what's different, right? So it begs the question, is the mineral oil the problem in the

782
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:06,280
first study was the dose not correct through or the ratio of three to one of EPA to DHA?

783
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:12,040
Is it simply irrelevant? To your point earlier, maybe these people didn't have a deficiency

784
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:18,360
and supplementing to excess made no difference. The other thing is these were relatively sick

785
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:23,560
patients, right? These were patients that I can't recall off the top of my head what the

786
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,560
strength patients looked like. But if they were anything like the reduce it patients,

787
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,360
which I remember more, I mean, almost 80% of these patients had type two diabetes,

788
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:38,760
all of them had dyslipidemia. So the other argument is, is four years of treating patients

789
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,960
that are at high, high risk of major adverse cardiac event, enough time to steer the shift.

790
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:50,360
Are you better off treating people in their forties for two decades to try to mitigate that risk?

791
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:54,920
And I think, frankly, that question probably becomes even more interesting from the standpoint

792
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:00,920
of brain health and heart health, right? Where we have fewer options. Let me tell you that how I

793
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:07,480
think about this, and it may or may not make sense to you or to your readers. When we're talking

794
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:13,800
about reduce it or EPA, are we talking about a supplement or are we talking about a drug?

795
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:18,120
In the case of reduce it, it's a drug. I mean, that's a pharmaceutical prescribed drug.

796
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,160
Right. So this distinction is important because if we're talking about a drug,

797
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:29,560
then we are thinking about the cascade. We're thinking of you give a status, you inhibit

798
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:36,120
HMG coa reductase, you decrease the expression of the L or you increase the expression of the LDL

799
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:43,160
receptor in the liver, and then you suck cholesterol circulating by LDL or VLDL particles,

800
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:49,960
and you excrete it. You lower LDL cholesterol. You decrease small dense on atherogenic LDL

801
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:55,960
cholesterol particles that translate into less atherosclerosis. And then this translates into

802
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:02,520
less cardiovascular events. This is the prevailing hypothesis of how we view statins work. Now,

803
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:09,960
if I were to ask you, how does EPA work? How does it reduce cardiovascular events? And if we can

804
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:15,800
come up with a cascade similar to that of statins, I think we can argue that you could use HIDO's EPA

805
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:23,080
as a drug. But if we're stuttering and we can't really map the actual cycle, we might be fishing

806
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:29,560
for results. Yeah. And it's also interesting when, I mean, I don't think this analysis has been done,

807
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:37,880
but it would be a clever study would be like a pairing study where you take the same patients,

808
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:46,360
of course, and you pair one group to phenofibrate to another with HIDO's EPA such that they get

809
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:51,880
equal reduction of triglycerides and you ask the question, does that make a difference? In other

810
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:57,000
words, how much of this benefit, if any, comes from the triglyceride reduction, which all things

811
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,360
equal, is going to lower APO-B concentration as you reduce the lipid carrying capacity of lipoprotein.

812
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:07,640
And is that the mechanism? Now, again, that's more of a thought experiment. I can't imagine

813
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:15,000
anybody would go and do the actual study of trilipix versus vicepa, but you're right. We don't

814
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:23,640
have a very clear mechanistic pathway for why this would make sense. One possibility, although I'm

815
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:29,720
not trying to be against or for EPA, I'm just trying to think out loud, one possibility is that

816
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:37,560
EPA has potent anti-inflammatory effects. And it is plausible that EPA, not by any triglyceride

817
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:44,360
lowering potential, but by a local anti-inflammatory effect on the plaques, has resulted in less plaque

818
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:50,280
rupture and less events. But again, these are all ideas because we don't fully understand what

819
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:56,440
happened and why they did get substantial reduction in the events. Now, this is irrelevant because,

820
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:02,280
you know, to me, I don't study right now cardiovascular disease and I'm not trying to

821
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:11,720
understand exactly an application for EPA on patients at risk of heart disease. But my lab

822
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:18,760
is more interested in figuring out a link between omega-3s and the brain. And the reason why I

823
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:24,040
brought to reduce it, or we brought this example of high dose EPA and cardiovascular disease,

824
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:31,560
is to contrast completely different systems. Unlike cardiovascular disease, where you have a

825
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:36,360
very well described process where you have a plaque that ruptures and you get an event,

826
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:44,760
your typical Alzheimer's dementia is often a chronic low-grade slow process that happens over

827
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:53,800
years and that eventually manifests in loss of function of daily activities, cognitive deficits,

828
01:34:53,800 --> 01:35:03,080
and so forth. The role of DHA in this disease is more closer to the analogy that you used with

829
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:11,400
scurvy. In landmark studies done decades ago at NIH, they showed when you took a mouse model and

830
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:17,720
you deprived the pregnant mice from DHA completely, and then you looked at her

831
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:25,960
offsprings, they found that these baby litters, the offsprings of the mouse, had a condition that

832
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:32,760
we call microcephaly, where the brain failed to form and develop and was very small. When you

833
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:38,280
looked under the microscope, you found out that these neurons formed from a DHA deficient diet

834
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:47,080
were not making enough synapses under the microscope compared to neurons who were exposed

835
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:54,440
to a deficient or a non-deficient or a regular child diet when the mother was nursing or having

836
01:35:54,440 --> 01:36:03,960
the children in utero. So that by itself told us that DHA deficiency is detrimental to the function

837
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:13,800
of the brain. Now we also know from many studies that in humans during development not having

838
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:21,160
enough polyunsaturated fatty acids, whether it's lactating breast milk or in the diet itself,

839
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:27,320
was associated with poorer outcomes in school. And these are large studies published in the 90s,

840
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:36,200
which have led the FDA in 2001 or 2002, I believe, to agree to the recommendation of supplementing

841
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:45,080
infant formula with both DHA and arachidonic acid AA. So any listeners who has bought

842
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:51,080
infant formula or any have used infant formula and if they look at the actual formula, they see the

843
01:36:51,080 --> 01:37:01,080
tag DHA and AA fortified. So the concept that there is something called DHA or EPA or omega-3

844
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:09,560
deficiency exists is probably solid. Now what's less known or more confusing or more difficult

845
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:19,720
to ascertain is that what age range does this deficiency make the largest impact and how does

846
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:24,600
aging affect that deficiency question? So to put this question in a different perspective,

847
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:32,680
the brain develops rapidly from conception to possibly three to five years. And by the age of

848
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:39,400
six, the human brain is almost fully developed. And then you start slowly accreting. Accretion

849
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:46,440
refers to the tension of lipids and material such as protein in the structure of the brain,

850
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:51,720
where it's not exchanging with plasma anymore or blood. So it's kind of stuck in the brain.

851
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:58,440
So the accretion of lipids or omega-3s in the brain slows considerably between the ages of

852
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:05,480
six all the way to 12 and 13. And then beyond that, the pools are relatively stable and expansion of

853
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:12,760
brain size is very slow. And then after certain age cutoffs like 60s and above, you start seeing

854
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:20,040
the opposite where atrophy starts to happen with aging. So we can clearly visualize that figure and

855
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:27,240
grasp the concept that during rapid accretion of lipids, it's really important for babies and

856
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:33,160
kids to get exposed to enough omega-3s to allow the brain to fully develop. And that doesn't have

857
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:39,560
to be supplementation. That could well be a good diet. Now what happens between the ages of six

858
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:47,240
and 60 is quite elusive, meaning that what happens to a population that is 35 that is

859
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:56,200
completely not consuming any omega-3s? Are they in any diseased states? And I can't point out a

860
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:03,960
single large study that can say yes. All what I can point out too is a myriad of small studies

861
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:11,320
which show discrepant results. Some studies suggest that are subtle cognitive impairments.

862
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:17,480
Other studies suggest anxiety disorders, mood disorders, depression. But other studies don't

863
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:26,120
find these associations. So that tells us that the role of omega-3 in the diet between the ages of

864
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:33,560
six and 60 is more difficult to understand. Now that doesn't mean it's not important.

865
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:40,040
Is there any scenario in which having lower consumption of EPA and DHA is beneficial in

866
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:47,080
those small studies? Or is this basically a difference of neutral to negative?

867
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:53,640
I think it's the latter, neutral to negative. But I think the concept that I haven't discussed yet,

868
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:59,320
but might be important to understand, is that the half-life of lipids in the brain

869
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:05,720
is quite different than the half-life of lipids in different compartments in the body. So for

870
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:13,240
example, if you take DHA or EPA and you study after somebody is injected or consumed, labeled

871
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:20,040
DHA or EPA, how long does it take for the DHA or EPA to disappear from blood? You understand that

872
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:25,800
it takes a matter of weeks. Within three to six weeks that dose will disappear and the opposite

873
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:32,600
is true. It takes three to six weeks for the dose to reach plateauing or saturation kinetics after

874
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:40,520
being fed a maximal dose of DHA or EPA. So that has to do with the half-life of these lipids on

875
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:48,920
the transporting proteins such as HDL. So HDL may define the half-life because it's going to be the

876
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:55,080
major carrier of phospholipids. Now when we talk about other compartments such as the brain,

877
01:40:55,080 --> 01:41:01,880
that may not be the case. The amount of time that DHA hangs out in neuronal membranes is

878
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:09,160
substantially longer than the amount of time that DHA hangs out on the surface of a phospholipid on

879
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:15,800
HDL or with an albumin carrier and blood. And you know if we think about this more deeply,

880
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:21,800
that makes sense. We do not want brains that are fluctuating with DHA and AA. We want a stable

881
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:29,400
depot of lipids that does not dramatically fluctuate. So what does that mean? That means

882
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:35,880
if you took somebody in a trial where they're not consuming DHA or EPA and then you gave them

883
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:41,880
high doses of DHA and EPA and you know if you look at these trials they range anywhere from 12 weeks

884
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:47,640
to a year and the majority are three months or six months, it's not surprising that these trials

885
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:53,240
are finding not much. And in fact when they find something, most of the time it's either a gut

886
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:59,000
effect or an inflammatory effect because some of these omega-3s have anti-inflammatory effects.

887
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:06,360
So that presents a distinct challenge to the omega-3 field is that we may not have the resources to do

888
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:14,360
a five or a ten year study. But we are privy to epidemiology studies which can give us a longer

889
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:21,720
vision of what happens to those who consume enough omega-3s versus those who don't consume

890
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:28,040
omega-3s at all. And then I'll just layer in the question to bring it back to our discussion of APOE,

891
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:37,080
do we have a flavor to add to this which is how does everything you say change in the context of

892
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:44,280
APOE type, if at all? It does. So this is what my lab is particularly interested in solving,

893
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:51,080
which is what is the best diet that we can give an APOE for a carrier to actually prevent cognitive

894
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:58,600
decline. So we've been doing studies to examine this from multiple angles and one of the studies

895
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:05,160
that we found is that we took younger 35 year old APOE4 carriers and injected them with labeled DHA

896
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:11,400
into their blood. And we estimated how much DHA is getting into the brain using a PET scan.

897
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:20,040
And what we found is that younger APOE4 carriers had greater uptake of DHA in their brain compared

898
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:28,280
to non-carriers, meaning that a younger cognitively normal APOE4 carrier is sucking all the DHA it can

899
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:37,560
take from blood to maintain a certain form of cognitive profile, to maintain your normal

900
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:46,600
cognitive behavior. And APOE4 carriers love the DHA it's seeing in blood and the brain of an

901
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:53,480
E4 carrier is on fire. It's firing more and it is using the DHA that is sucked from the blood.

902
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:58,760
And that could probably provide us some deep insights about our ancestors and their diets. I

903
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:04,680
mean we know that APOE4 carrier rate is highest in Africa. We know that E4 carriers in Africa were

904
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:12,040
consuming possibly more fish and meat than E4 carriers in Asia or E4 carriers in Europe. So

905
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:18,760
in that regard we looked at epidemiology studies and found you know a relatively large epidemiology

906
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:27,960
study from Finland suggesting that E4 carriers who consumed a good amount of fatty fish combined with

907
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:35,720
red leafy vegetables antioxidants, when you looked at these individuals two decades or more into the

908
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:43,160
future when they were 60, those who were consuming the highest amounts of omega-3s from fish and other

909
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:49,400
sources in the diet had substantially and significantly less disease than those who were not.

910
01:44:50,680 --> 01:45:00,520
So to us that gave us insights that perhaps the younger APOE4 brain loves to consume omega-3s.

911
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:07,240
Now I hope the story ends here and you know that that gives us a nice recommendation but it doesn't

912
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:14,840
because we were continuously studying APOE4 carriers across the age spectrum and what we

913
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:23,000
found is that after a certain age and I would say this goes anywhere from 55 to 70, the ability of

914
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,640
the APOE4 brain to capture APOE4 from blood gets compromised and this happens around the same time.

915
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:35,640
That the GLUT1 receptors are compromised. This happens around the same time that the blood

916
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:40,280
brain barrier itself starts to get compromised because you have to imagine that the blood

917
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:46,760
brain barrier is tightly coupled so when it starts disintegrating your GLUT1s are not working,

918
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:53,560
your omega-3 transporters are not working. So what does that mean? So we were part of a large

919
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:58,680
randomized clinical trial where patients with mild Alzheimer's disease were fed

920
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:05,720
high doses of DHA versus placebo over a period of a year and a half and what that trial found

921
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:13,960
is that in this trial two grams of omega-3s had no effect on everyone, zero effect. The trial was

922
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:21,240
negative, was published in 2010 in JAMA and the lead author was Joe Quinn. When we looked at that

923
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:29,080
trial we tried to understand how the APOE4 affected the response and in that trial APOE4

924
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:34,520
carriers had zero response and non-carriers appeared to improve on the primary outcome,

925
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:41,800
the ADAS-COG and on the secondary outcome which is the MLSE. So in that trial APOE4 carriers were

926
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:48,120
less likely to respond than non-carriers. And again the age of those participants was what?

927
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,680
These people were between 65 and 80.

928
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:54,760
Got it. And was that DHA only or EPA and DHA in that two grams?

929
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:55,960
That was DHA only.

930
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:02,360
And what you said earlier about the young people massively assimilating DHA, was that also shown

931
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,200
with EPA or only DHA?

932
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:10,520
We were only studying DHA. For the main reason is that the DHA is the main omega-3 that makes the

933
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:16,120
building blocks of synapses in the brain and EPA more behaves as a signaling molecule that's

934
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:21,960
anti-inflammatory. So an application for EPA in the brain may be quite different than DHA.

935
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:28,120
So if you're more focused on vascular disease and perhaps the small embolic or thrombotic

936
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:33,800
atherosclerotic strokes then an EPA application may make more sense. But if you're looking at

937
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:39,720
the synapse and what it requires to form neurotransmission we think from a DHA perspective.

938
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:45,000
So what you just described fits with the previous observation which is

939
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,440
there may be a critical window in which DHA is essential and once you're outside of that window

940
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:59,000
you lose the ability to integrate or assimilate DHA at about the same time your blood-brain

941
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:05,800
barrier is failing and your ability to regulate even glucose is beginning to diminish.

942
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:12,360
Absolutely. So you hit it right on. We are actively doing a large trial that we have called

943
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:18,440
Prevent E4 to partially address this question. If we took younger April E4 carriers before they have

944
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:27,000
dementia or before they have clinical symptoms can we show any effect on the brain? And we had this

945
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:33,160
immensely challenging question of should we look at 30 to 40 year olds or should we look at

946
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:42,120
55 to 70 year olds? And in 2017 we made the decision to look at the 55 to 70 year olds because

947
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:47,800
those people do cognitively decline with time. So we have the opportunity within two to three years

948
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:54,920
to figure out if they're dropping. If we did this trial in a 35 year old we may end up with a futile

949
01:48:54,920 --> 01:49:01,160
study because neither arm would change. So we are running a big risk though. It is plausible that

950
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:07,640
between the ages of 55 and 70 you're still too late. So where do you hold this? Where do you go?

951
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:13,720
E4 is unknown but Prevent E4 is ongoing. It started in 2019 and unfortunately now because of

952
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:19,160
Covid we had to hold and Los Angeles had a substantial share of Covid cases. So we have

953
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:25,640
we had to hold recruitment in the last six months but hopefully you know we hope to open recruitment

954
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:31,480
again in the next few months. The study will possibly wrap up in 2023 and get published

955
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:38,520
between 2024 and 2025. So that's an ongoing effort where we're giving two grams high dose DHA

956
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:45,160
based on a pilot study that we have done before showing that you need higher doses of DHA to get

957
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:51,000
into the brain. In APOE 4 carriers who do not have cognitive disease yet they may have mild

958
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,080
disease but definitely not dementia. And to see whether APOE you know high dose DHA supplementation

959
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:02,600
can slow down the progression of disease in this population. So again of course the experiment that

960
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:09,960
can't be done is taking the 35 year old E4 carriers putting them on DHA for the rest of their lives

961
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:16,520
because you're basically giving them DHEA at the time when you know they can assimilate it and

962
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:20,920
following them for long enough to see a hard outcome which is is there a meaningful reduction

963
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:27,400
in the actual disease we care about studying. Since that experiment can't be done and will

964
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,600
never be done we then have to basically think about this through the lens of this is a question

965
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,400
that medicine does not have a tool to solve through the neat package called the clinical trial.

966
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:44,760
Yeah the way to approach this problem would actually be finding surrogate biomarkers that

967
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:52,360
you believe and trust that will hold long and behold. For example we now maybe in the last five

968
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:59,880
years have finally agreed that LDL cholesterol is a good target to lower for cardiovascular disease

969
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:05,320
prevention. Although every now and then you'd get somebody who shows you lower LDL cholesterol may

970
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:11,000
not translate into cardiovascular events but for the most of people in the field agree that lowering

971
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:17,400
an LDL cholesterol by a statin or by azetamide or by any other measurement can associate with

972
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:25,320
less atherosclerosis. Can we find a biomarker in 35-45 year old individuals a brain biomarker

973
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:31,880
where if you change it you would convince most people that this may protect you against dementia

974
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:37,800
or cognitive decline a couple of decades. That's a fundamentally important question that needs to

975
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:44,120
be tackled because without brain biomarkers we may not be able to answer these complicated questions.

976
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:50,440
I mean I'm a bit skeptical that we're going to find anything anytime soon that fits exactly

977
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:56,600
that description and I think it's worth noting that one of the first drugs ever approved to lower

978
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:03,640
LDL did so but did not reduce events. I'm blanking on the name of the drug but it actually

979
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:11,000
was a drug that inhibited the enzyme that converted desmosterol to cholesterol. I think

980
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,640
it's something called delta 60 saturase or something and in doing so it did lower cholesterol

981
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:22,520
and by extension LDL cholesterol although frankly at the time they probably only looked at total

982
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:29,560
cholesterol but events actually went up presumably because desmosterol went up so much and acted as

983
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:35,880
a sterile that had the same oxidizing properties. In the end you know events matter but you're right

984
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:41,880
look most drugs today that lower ApoB also reduce events but in the absence of such a biomarker

985
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,880
or functional study you know it doesn't have to be a biomarker I guess if you had

986
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:50,120
you know an imaging study or a functional study that you know could matter you know

987
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:55,720
hippocampal volume if we believe that that was sensitive enough but absent that it still comes

988
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:02,680
down to a question of what's the asymmetry of risk on each side right so option one is do nothing

989
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:10,760
option two is either through diet or supplement take a given amount of DHA what is the downside

990
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,320
of the latter what is the downside of the former I think those are questions that we have to spend

991
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:20,760
more time thinking about because I don't think that clinical trials can give us answers to some

992
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:27,000
of the most important questions facing disease prevention yeah and so this is exactly where

993
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,240
diseases like Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia or any form of dementia represents a deep

994
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:38,840
painstaking challenge compared to atherosclerosis where you can have an event within a couple of

995
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:46,920
years and still see an effect on plaque reduction lower event rates whether it's MI or amputations

996
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:52,360
or strokes dementia on the other hand is much more subtle much more complicated and requires

997
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:59,960
completely new set of tools and as we speak there's a massive amount of brain imaging studies

998
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:06,360
from functional MRIs to PET scans that are looking at different tracers including amyloid

999
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:11,640
and tau which to date have not really panned out in the AD field but with the premise that we can

1000
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:17,960
find a biomarker that if you can modulate can predict something a decade later so one more

1001
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:22,920
thing that I just want to share with you before we wrap up is that you know my lab has also done

1002
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:27,720
very exciting studies that will be published in the next two to three months showing that the

1003
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:37,560
older apoE4 brain once it gets into the dementia stage starts upregulating enzymes that facilitates

1004
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:45,000
its own auto digestion because of the failure in utilizing glucose as a source of energy

1005
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:52,280
we find that enzymes like phospholipase A2 are upregulated and activated in the apoE4 brain

1006
01:54:53,080 --> 01:55:01,080
to perhaps extract fatty acids from its own myelin sheath to produce ATP and that tells us

1007
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:08,360
about that the recommendations that we should give the younger apoE4 carrier may be completely

1008
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:14,600
different than a recommendation that we give an older apoE4 carrier who is in a state of energy

1009
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:20,520
deprivation and energy failure say a little bit more about that I mean you're talking about someone

1010
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:26,680
who now actually is in the stages of early cognitive decline who presumably I mean when

1011
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:33,560
you say auto digesting I mean you're referring to an enzymatic degradation of the cell

1012
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:41,320
yes so what we did is in the last three years we've looked at enzymes that control omega 3s

1013
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:48,280
and omega 6s in the brain and we found out that a specific enzyme known as phospholipase A2

1014
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:54,680
which is the calcium dependent version of phospholipase A2 is strongly upregulated in

1015
01:55:55,240 --> 01:56:01,560
Alzheimer disease brains who carry the apoE4 genotype compared to

1016
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:10,040
non-alzheimer disease brains who carry the apoE4 genotype so we had access to a large database of

1017
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:15,960
brain tissues from rush rush has one of the largest Alzheimer disease research centers in the country

1018
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:24,600
and we looked at many enzymes and stumbled across CPLA2 and showed that CPLA2 is hyper activated

1019
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:32,200
or phosphorylated in E4AD brains so you've got the apoE4 carriers who developed AD as opposed to

1020
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:39,560
the apoE4 carrier who died without AD and we found that the apoE4 AD brain activates these

1021
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:48,120
enzymes which take away fatty acids from the phospholipid membrane and then perhaps

1022
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:55,320
degrades the fatty acid to be used for many reasons to us the most obvious reason why you

1023
01:56:55,320 --> 01:57:01,560
are extracting fatty acids from phospholipid is possibly to generate ATP now there is a side effect

1024
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,760
to doing that and that would be neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and i assume that this is

1025
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:13,400
something you're not seeing in the non-E4 carrier who is in this in the comparable stage of dementia

1026
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:20,360
we are not seeing the same pattern of activation in a non-E4 carrier who has a comparable state of

1027
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:24,840
dementia that's correct now there's a lot of people out there who are talking about things

1028
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:30,360
like ketone supplementation so not using not necessarily using ketosis in its nutritional

1029
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:36,760
or starvation form but even using exogenous ketones as a supplemental fuel is there any

1030
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:44,040
reason to believe that that or a nutritional approach to ketosis would be a benefit to somebody

1031
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:50,920
with E4 especially when they're in that second wave or is the answer well by anything that's

1032
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:54,840
going to prevent glucose from getting into the brain sufficiently is probably going to prevent

1033
01:57:54,840 --> 01:58:00,520
ketones from getting there too you have you know fantastic insights and questions so i think

1034
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:08,120
people have thought about ketone meals ketone body meals for treatment of dementia and the

1035
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:14,120
largest studies to date have shown that E4 carriers once they have the disease are reluctant

1036
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:19,880
or less likely to benefit from the supplementation compared to non-carriers and exactly to your point

1037
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:25,960
it is possible that the degenerating blood-brain barrier is compromising the transport of ketone

1038
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:33,080
bodies the same way it has compromised glucose and the same way it has compromised omega-3 fatty

1039
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:41,240
acids so that makes us think that the aging Alzheimer's disease brain is a late stage that

1040
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:47,640
is refractory to the unless you are trying to fix the fundamental issue that is related to

1041
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:54,520
nutrient transport by a medication or an intervention dietary interventions at this stage

1042
01:58:54,520 --> 01:59:01,240
may not be very effective and highlights the importance of getting the right intervention

1043
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:07,240
before you get to that stage to prevent it from happening i hate being asked questions like i'm

1044
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:12,760
about to ask you so forgive me but you know that everybody listening to this and by definition

1045
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,320
about 25 percent of these people listening to this are going to be a carrier of at least one

1046
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:23,720
variant of E4 so this is a very relevant question what do you recommend to people let's just limit

1047
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:29,480
this to people who are you know have no stage of disease i mean you've certainly made the case for

1048
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:36,280
dha yeah so i don't recommend omega-3 supplementation for a simple reason we don't have the evidence to

1049
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:44,520
sub to actually support once we publish or others publish high quality evidence supporting going to

1050
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:50,840
to a pharmacy and picking up a supplement until that happens i don't think we have the evidence

1051
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:57,000
to support omega-3 supplements but what i do recommend though is for people to take at least

1052
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,080
one serving of fatty fish per week we know from epidemiology apoE4 carriers who consume

1053
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:10,200
one serving of fatty fish per week may be providing enough omega-3s to their brains

1054
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:16,520
and helping themselves long term is there anything else that you have learned in your travels

1055
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:22,840
vis-a-vis exercise other things within nutrition i know that's not the focus of your research but

1056
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:28,760
do we know anything about the E4 carriers being more benefited if such a term exists

1057
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:33,320
through exercise i mean we know the importance of exercise in Alzheimer's prevention is enormous

1058
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:40,040
but do we know if E4s bend one way or the other in that wind we don't have high quality randomized

1059
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:47,480
clinical trials but we may have some epidemiology studies Morris and his team at WashU have shown

1060
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:54,600
in a PET study this is an imaging study where you scan amyloid load in the brain that apoE4 carriers

1061
02:00:54,600 --> 02:01:02,120
who exercise has have less amyloid plaque buildup compared to apoE4 carriers who do not exercise

1062
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:08,600
now again we would need an intervention to demonstrate that but as we discussed in a minute

1063
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:17,000
it's very difficult to find younger apoE4 carriers put them in a lifestyle intervention and then

1064
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:23,880
look at the outcome three to four to a decade later logistically it's complicated and expensive

1065
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:33,400
we also know from a Swedish group that looked at multiple factors of what determines pathology in

1066
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:39,880
apoE4 carriers and they concluded that a high level of education hypertension control

1067
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:47,960
protected apoE4 carriers from dementia compared to apoE4 carriers who had less education and

1068
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:55,640
worse blood pressure control so to answer your question i think if you knew at birth that you

1069
02:01:55,640 --> 02:02:03,160
had apoE4 if your parents knew and you have the ethnicity the risk the family history the best

1070
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:09,480
advice that we have is to maintain an adequate omega-3 consumption from fatty fish not supplements

1071
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:16,840
to make sure that the blood pressure is controlled and to make sure that there is some at least

1072
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:25,560
minimal amount of exercise carried out throughout the lifespan to provide a modifiable element to

1073
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:32,360
the apoE4 and when we talk about modifying apoE4 risk we often are referring to modifying the

1074
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:39,000
vascular effects of apoE4 so not only will you get cardiovascular benefit but you will also get

1075
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:46,520
brain benefit because the blood vessels in Alzheimer's disease have as much of a role as

1076
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:52,440
the actual neurons and astrocytes and so forth. Hussein this has been very interesting again i

1077
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:56,520
think a lot of people are going to find this to be relevant to themselves or to people that they

1078
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:03,000
care about i won't lie it's a little frustrating that we're still so early in the in the study of

1079
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,680
this something that is so relevant and i believe probably quite preventable if we had a better sense

1080
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:14,120
of what the interventions were and i think you're absolutely right biomarkers and or other functional

1081
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:19,720
imaging studies would really speed things up if we could do clinical trials in two years and get

1082
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:24,200
answers we'd be a lot better often if we had to study people over the course of their lifetime

1083
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:29,560
or rely on epidemiology which is fraught with so many challenges that make it very difficult to

1084
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:35,480
disentangle causal relationships but nevertheless this has been illuminating and i thank you greatly
