Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,360
today's episode. My guests this week are Lauren Miller Rogan and Richard Isaacson. Lauren is an

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,800
actress, screenwriter, director, but also a friend and patient. She's the co-founder of Hilarity for

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Charity or HFC, a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to care for the families facing

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,280
disease of Alzheimer's disease, educate them about living a healthy brain life, and activate the next

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
generation of Alzheimer's advocates. Richard Isaacson should be a familiar name for some of

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,560
you as he was a guest on a previous episode of The Drive in late 2018 when we did a deep dive

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,160
into Alzheimer's disease. Many of you have requested follow-up podcasts on this topic. Among

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,400
them, this is one. Richard serves as the director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,440
Cornell, New York Presbyterian Hospital, and is an assistant dean at the office of the faculty of

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,720
Weill Cornell of Medicine. I've known Lauren for a couple of years. We actually met through Richard,

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,680
and the three of us have been talking about doing this podcast for about a year. In fact,

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,120
we were going to do it last fall, and then we put it off until the spring, and then COVID got in the

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,480
way. So this one's been a long time coming. My intuition was that being able to talk about

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,240
Alzheimer's disease with Richard and Lauren simultaneously would be a beautiful way to

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,360
discuss the human tragedy of the disease, and also to talk about the science of prevention

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,080
and the pathology of the disease. And honestly, by the end of this discussion, I felt we had

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
really achieved that. I think Lauren's story is both heartbreaking and uplifting for reasons that

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
will become clear as you listen to this. In this episode, we talk about her journey with her family

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,340
history, what led her to Richard, and ultimately what really changed the course of her life with

28
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,300
respect to how she treats prevention. We talk a lot about what preventative measures look like

29
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,820
today, and how we look at the evolving body of literature to figure out how to modify risk. So

30
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,580
if you have even a slight interest in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease, I think you're going to

31
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,180
find this episode both touching and enlightening. So without further delay, please enjoy my

32
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:15,220
conversation with Lauren Miller Rogan and Richard Isaacson. Lauren and Richard, what a privilege to

33
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,220
be sort of sitting down with you guys right now. We have been kicking around the idea of doing this

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,020
for about a year now. COVID kind of got in our way. We were going to do this obviously in person

35
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,300
last year. So while it's long overdue, I think this is just such an exciting opportunity both

36
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,860
to kind of hear from you, Lauren, and kind of understand your personal journey, which you've

37
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:48,460
basically taken on as your life's mission. And then obviously Richard to have you back on and kind of,

38
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,820
I don't know, I think bring people up to speed on what's happened in the last couple of years. So

39
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,740
thanks both of you for making time today. Thank you for having us. I feel like long time listener,

40
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:06,860
first time guest. Very excited to be here. Long time listener as well. Yeah, I hang on every word

41
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,260
of most of the podcasts, especially while I had to listen to Tom Dayspring's podcast like 14 times.

42
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,060
I'm still like need to listen to it on repeat. But Lauren, let's start with you. I mean, I want

43
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,820
people to really get an understanding of your story. So I mean, when did you first become aware

44
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:31,380
that there was something going on in your family that was robbing people of this precious thing

45
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:39,180
called their mind? Unfortunately, Alzheimer's has been a part of my life as long as I can have my own

46
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,780
memory. My grandfather, my mom's dad had Alzheimer's. My aunt has told me it seems like he showed

47
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,180
symptoms maybe in his late fifties or early sixties. But he was an interesting home. I think from the

48
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,340
time I was around eight or nine, maybe 10. And he passed away when I was 12. But when you're young,

49
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,140
that age to me, his memory issues were almost funny, right? Like he would take his teeth out

50
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,940
at the table. And I thought that was hysterical. And he would, you know, repeat things. And again,

51
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,020
like when you're little, that's funny. And I didn't have any concept of the fact that the reason he had

52
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,420
to go into a nursing home was because he was wandering and that my grandmother couldn't take

53
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,660
care of him. And then after he passed away, my grandmother started showing signs of dementia. And

54
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,980
you know, she was struggling to take care of herself and was clearly wasn't eating. And,

55
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:36,460
but you know, I was in high school. So again, I wasn't really that aware of the situation and

56
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,180
what was happening. But you know, I was aware when they brought her from her home in South Florida up

57
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,420
to where we were in central Florida to put her in a facility, you know, and how she was curled over

58
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,220
in the seat, sleeping and not aware when I was showing her how I could drive for the first time

59
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:59,620
and how she eventually stopped being able to walk or talk or feed herself. And my senior year,

60
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,020
I would go visit her every Friday after school and you know, a few other days during the week. But,

61
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,340
you know, when she spent the last year of her life curled up in a bed, obviously not talking or being

62
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,860
able to care for herself in any, any way at all. It was a lot at 18. And but it was still I was

63
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,940
younger and it was my grandmother, you know, I think when you're young and you envision your

64
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,780
grandparents is like, well, they're grandparents. They're, you know, this happens to them, even

65
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,140
though, you know, my, I think my grandmother was 76 maybe. So then she passed away. And then at my

66
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:36,580
college graduation, when I was 22, my mom was 52. She repeated a story a few times. And, you know,

67
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:46,060
my mom who was this incredibly smart, vibrant woman who was aggressive about the thing she

68
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,660
wanted in her life. And she didn't take no for an answer type of woman. But throughout her life,

69
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,180
she'd always say, when I get Alzheimer's, when I get Alzheimer's, I always say, stop saying that,

70
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,140
don't say that. Like, and then at my graduation, when she repeated the story a few times, I thought,

71
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,340
oh God, but I didn't say anything, of course. And then, you know, over the next year or two,

72
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,340
it became clear that this repetition was becoming a part of who she was. And she was losing control

73
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:19,060
of, you know, her ability to teach and to, you know, do any number of things that someone who

74
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,980
is fully functioning in a cognitive way could do. Eventually, we encouraged my dad to take her to a

75
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,700
doctor and, you know, over the course of a year and a half or so, we got as, you know, as much as a

76
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,460
diagnosis as one could get at that time.

77
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,340
You're just out of college. And you're being confronted with the idea that your mom is not

78
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,540
even in her mid fifties yet. And she's already in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease,

79
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,940
something that's already prematurely taken her parents. I'm guessing it's now sort of setting

80
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,580
in that there's something going on in your family, right?

81
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:05,940
Yeah. I mean, there was a lot of denial, I would say, a lot of fear, a lot of anger, and of course,

82
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,340
a lot of depression. And I think what was really hard about it at the time was my mom wouldn't let

83
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,500
us talk about it. And, you know, at this point, I can only imagine what her identity felt like as a

84
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:26,340
daughter of Alzheimer's herself, what was driving her at this point. But to me, things were really

85
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,340
starting to become clear in a really scary way at that point. I didn't talk to anyone about it,

86
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,460
because I didn't, I think, you know, when you talk about something, it seems real all of a sudden,

87
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,260
it's really happening.

88
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,540
Even your father?

89
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,860
Oh, God, especially not my dad, because my dad was the most in denial about any of us. You know,

90
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:48,100
my dad, you know, my parents had, you know, an amazing marriage, and they were best friends and

91
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:55,700
partners. And he admired my mom for her brain, and for how smart she was, and how passionate she was

92
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,060
about what she did, and how hard she worked. And so, yeah, he was the last one, I think, to come

93
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,420
around. But eventually, a few months after Seth and I started dating, actually, my parents came

94
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,460
out to visit, this was in 2005, to meet him and came out for my birthday. And when I dropped them

95
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,660
off at the airport, and I came back to Seth's apartment, it was the first time I'd said it

96
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,260
out loud that I was afraid my mom was developing Alzheimer's. And it was the first time I cried

97
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,140
about it. And he was like, no, no, she was fine. No, it's fine. And I'm like, you don't know her.

98
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,820
You don't know how the person you met this weekend is different than who she was. And, you know,

99
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,700
it was, I guess, around two years from that point of going to visit, and she'd be worse. It was

100
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,940
clear, you know, at some point, she shouldn't be driving. Eventually, her school decided she

101
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:49,220
shouldn't be in a traditional classroom anymore. And took her out of that classroom. It was just

102
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,460
who she was, was fading away and changing right in front of her eyes. She couldn't have these long

103
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,180
conversations anymore. She, again, would repeat herself. She would call with the same thing over

104
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,020
and over again. And it was devastating. I was in a very dark place at the time.

105
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,100
Do you have any sense that she was aware of some of these things? For example,

106
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,220
the idea that she could no longer teach her classes and to have that taken away from her

107
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,900
by her peers. Did that register with her? What was happening and why?

108
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,340
Yeah, you know, I never, I didn't have that direct conversation with her about it. I'm sure my dad

109
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,620
did. I think she took that stuff in stride probably to act like a strong independent person

110
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,660
for us. But when she eventually had to retire, I know she wasn't thrilled about it, but she was at

111
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:50,260
a point where cognitively she wasn't at full function anymore. And so it became a bit easier to

112
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,620
change her life in a way where she didn't question it, which is, you know, really sad to think about.

113
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:06,660
But I think it was, I had one conversation with her early, early on it, I read in teen magazine,

114
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,260
if there's ever something difficult, you want to talk to your parents about do it in the car

115
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,820
because the drive will eventually end. And so the awkward conversation will naturally end. So I

116
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,460
remember one time I was home in Florida and I was visiting them. It might've been around the time

117
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,140
she was forced to retire and we were driving to Target. And I asked her if she was scared

118
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,780
about getting Alzheimer's. And she told me that she wasn't scared for her.

119
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,380
She was scared for me and my brother and my dad. Because I think she got that at some point

120
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,700
she may not know what's happening and that the weight would be on us. I think she knew that

121
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,860
because of what happened with her dad and her mom. And I can only imagine how terrifying that

122
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,020
was for her. But I, you know, I can't understand where she was at that point, cognitively or

123
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:00,100
emotionally even, to really know the fear there. So you mentioned that this is around the time

124
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,900
when, I mean, it's now hitting you with the full force. Yeah. And I assume it's much less,

125
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,420
or maybe somewhat, but probably less about what the implications are for you and much more about

126
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,660
the loss of her. Yeah. Which of course, you know, I was in my early twenties, so that was only about

127
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,860
me. I was at a point in my life where I was just starting to become friends with her. She had a

128
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,220
little emotional. She had come out to visit. I moved to LA in January of 2004 and she came

129
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,580
out to visit in March of 2004 during her spring break. And we had such a great time being, you

130
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:43,460
know, I was 22, but, you know, a grownup. And we went to dinner, just the two of us, like as grownups

131
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,500
and like drank wine and like she wasn't a big drinker. She would drink a sea breeze. I remember.

132
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,940
And like, it felt like I was reaching that point where she was my friend, which I think, you know,

133
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,380
now I have so many girlfriends who their moms are their best friends. And I instantly felt

134
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:08,740
like that was being taken away from me and was so angry about it. And so jealous of all my friends

135
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:17,300
who were having those relationships with their moms and felt so hopeless. You know, I would go

136
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,460
online and I would just search like cure for Alzheimer's treatment for Alzheimer's gotta be

137
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,980
there. I know I could find it. Like I'm the kind of person who's like, if I'm going to do so, I'm

138
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,900
going to do it. You know? And like, no, there's something out there. I can find something for her.

139
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:39,620
And there was nothing like there was nothing. And so it was a really scary, hard time where I felt

140
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,380
like I could do nothing and that this train had left the station for my mom. And that was it.

141
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,700
So I want to give you a chance to just sort of catch your breath a bit. And Richard, I want to

142
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,860
sort of ask you a couple of questions right now, not necessarily specifically about Lauren's mom,

143
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,100
because I want to come to that in some detail later when you actually, when we get to the part

144
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,340
of the story where you and Lauren meet. But I want to just ask you a broader question here,

145
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:16,100
which is help a listener understand the context of this type of Alzheimer's disease. And by this

146
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:24,260
type, I mean one that is so clearly familial and also so early and onset. How do you think about

147
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,940
that as a neurologist? What's going through your mind as you think about this type of a case in

148
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,940
terms of genetic predisposition? Let's just, let's just start with the genetics of this.

149
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,940
Sure. So I first have to start with just, I hate this disease. I just like hate it. I hate hearing

150
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:47,380
stories. Now you're going to make me cry, Lauren. I'm on a podcast. Come on. I'm on record.

151
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,740
Well, no one can see us, so it's fine. Okay, good. So I just hate this disease so much because it's

152
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:00,580
so insidious. It's so nasty. It's so just, it just, it robs not just the, I mean, it robs the person

153
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,740
of who they are, but it robs the whole family. I mean, just like you just said, it's like it robbed

154
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,740
you of like the good years, like the friendship years. And that's just, so I hate this disease.

155
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,380
Alzheimer's disease starts in the brain decades before the first symptom of memory loss begins.

156
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,300
And I didn't learn that in medical school. I hate to say it, but most doctors don't know that still,

157
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,140
you know, the new diagnostic criteria have been out now for about a decade.

158
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:36,340
But, you know, when I hear it 52, I say, oh my gosh, what was in our thirties? What was happening in her thirties?

159
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,580
Like, why? Why is this happening? And then I hear the family history and I hear, wow,

160
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,860
her mom and her dad. Why? Why is this happening? And Lauren, we have some small world coincidences,

161
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,420
which we learned about later, but like my brother, he's a neurologist, he's older than me.

162
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,540
He took care of another one of your family members, like on another. So like, why? Why is this? And of

163
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,220
course, the first thing you think about is genetic. And then you think about, well, is this early onset?

164
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,300
What is early onset? I think most people think about Alzheimer's disease and older person's disease

165
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:17,780
greater than 70, 72, 74, what's the average age? But there's a small tiny sliver, a small, small

166
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:23,620
group that I would qualify as having early onset Alzheimer's disease due to a genetic reason where

167
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,420
the person usually gets Alzheimer's in their, you know, forties or fifties. But, you know, Lauren,

168
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,060
your family was different and we'll talk about this later. But when I hear a family history like this,

169
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,980
I say, well, why does certain people in one family get it later? And the other people in the family

170
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,380
get it earlier? This is actually earlier onset Alzheimer's and I maybe made that up. But what is

171
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,220
what is it? This person should have been affected in the later years and something is fast forwarding.

172
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,940
Something is, there's like a one plus one equals three here. There's like a mishmash of things

173
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,140
that just like the first thing I think about is why is this happening? And number one, I say, okay,

174
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,620
genetics is there's got to be some genetic something. And then number two is, okay, then

175
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,100
I think about, well, could it be lifestyle? Could it be an exposure to something? Could it be head

176
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,940
trauma? Could it be uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol? These are all things

177
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,380
that, you know, just synergize together to potentially make a late onset Alzheimer's case

178
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,860
start earlier. So these are the some of the things like, you know, detective work things that I think

179
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,980
about. But no, it's not typical. What genes do you think about, Richard? What are the suite of genes?

180
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,420
I mean, there's the obvious ones, APOE4, but there are other genes that could be implicated in early

181
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,460
cases. Can you say a little bit about those? Sure. So there's the typical early onset genes,

182
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,340
there's really only three, presenilin one, presenilin two, amyloid precursor protein gene

183
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:53,220
mutation. I can count on my two hands, how many patients I've seen with that. I've seen over 1500

184
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,380
patients easily, probably close to 2000 patients over the last, you know, 15 plus years. Literally

185
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,340
two hands. It's all I got. Lauren, you actually introduced me to one, an amazing, amazing person,

186
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:14,900
great individual and someone that I, she may have that gene, but I will not say that she will get

187
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,500
Alzheimer's. So for the first time in my career, I've not only figured out that someone has an

188
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,980
early onset gene, which means you're going to get Alzheimer's, but just wait, our field is making a

189
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,060
lot of progress. So, you know, these three genes are just so rare. That's number one. Most people

190
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:38,420
that have earlier onset Alzheimer's have a milieu of things. So I would call it polygenic risk. So

191
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:47,220
ApoE, ApoE4, the variant ApoE4 is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Now,

192
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,700
the difference between ApoE4, having one variant or two, I'll explain that in a second, means if you

193
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,860
get the E4, it doesn't mean you're going to get Alzheimer's. It just increases your risk. If you

194
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,220
get pre-Cenilin1, pre-Cenilin2 or amyloid precursor protein gene mutation, sorry for the

195
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,060
long words there, if you get those genes, you get Alzheimer's. That's what the book say, except in

196
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,980
that one person that you introduced me to Lauren, we're going to, we got time. She's in her twenties.

197
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,780
We're going to get this up for her. And those Richard really represent far less than 1% of the

198
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,740
total cases are made up of APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, for what it's worth. I've never actually seen one.

199
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,380
For me, those only exist in the literature. The interesting aside, by the way, is there's,

200
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,020
some people speculate that the index case of Alzheimer's disease was actually one of those.

201
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,140
And some of our understanding of this disease may be incorrect as a result of that, but we'll,

202
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:50,580
we'll kick that to another discussion. So when you meet a person like Lauren, you're not necessarily

203
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,700
thinking one of those three genes. You were just thinking some aggressive combination of other

204
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,700
things. Yep. And it's, epigenetics would be the word that I think about. So the term epigenetics

205
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,700
encompasses a person's genetics plus the environmental impact, the milieu of what a person

206
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,420
does in their lifestyle or behavior, or what they were exposed to, for example, whether it was a

207
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,380
virus or if it was a traumatic something, or if it was something that triggered the gene to work in

208
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,220
one way or another. And the term polygenic risk means that there are multiple genes that work

209
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,860
together. Now some genes can increase risk and some people, some genes actually decrease risk. So

210
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,020
the future of Alzheimer's disease, well, I believe the future of Alzheimer's disease is based in

211
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,980
precision medicine, using these types of genetic underpinnings, understanding all the individual

212
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,740
genes that impact a person's risk, figuring out what they are, figuring out what their biological

213
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,500
function is, figuring out why it puts a person down the path towards Alzheimer's, and then telling

214
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:57,060
that person to do A, B, C, X, Y, and Z to get them off the path towards Alzheimer's. That's the future

215
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,740
of Alzheimer's. And I think in a lot of ways, the future is now, but APOE is by far the most well

216
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,260
understood, most well researched, every patient that walks through our doors gets an APOE test,

217
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,980
you know, they're a commercial, like anyone can basically find out what their APOE status is,

218
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,940
just for the listener out there, you get one from mom and one from dad, either an APOE 2,

219
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,700
a 3 or a 4, it's called an allele or a variant. A lot of people call it a mutation, but it's not a

220
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,980
mutation. So you get a 2 or 3 or 4 from mom or dad, and a 4 increases risk a little bit, a 3 is

221
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,980
neutral, and a 2 actually is protective. So if someone comes in as an APOE 3, 3, that's a pretty,

222
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,300
you know, neutral risk, kind of boring, no big deal. APOE 2, 3, okay, maybe they have some

223
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,620
protection. And one 4, APOE 3, 4, for example, increases risk a little bit. And then two 4s,

224
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:55,060
APOE 4, 4s increases risk more so, but again, genes are not our destiny, we can absolutely win

225
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:00,340
the tug of war against our genes. And, you know, four 4s, I have dozens of patients in my practice

226
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,420
that I absolutely think that they are not going to get Alzheimer's disease, they, they're going to

227
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,980
be able to do some things to delay it. They also have other genes to protect them. So without

228
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,940
getting too detailed, APOE 4 is important. We personalize care, you know, if someone has a 4,

229
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,780
we're going to tell them to do certain things. Someone doesn't have a 4, we're going to do other

230
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,460
things for them because there are other things that are preferentially effective. But this

231
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,620
polygenic risk is what I'm thinking. So when I hear about Lauren's mom, like what is it? What

232
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,900
are her E4s? Sure. But what else? There's got to be something else. The devil is in the details there.

233
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,540
Dr. Justin Marchegiani, MD, MPH, CHE, MPH, FA, MD

234
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,260
Richard, I want to go back to Lauren to continue this story before I do. Can you explain for folks

235
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:44,180
that want a bit more of an understanding, what is it about having the E4 variant relative to

236
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:52,500
the E3 variant that increases risk? So the gene codes for protein that differs in what way from the

237
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,620
what we call the wild type or the E3 variant. So I guess how I would answer that is starting

238
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,500
by basic, what is APOE mean? APOE is apolipoprotein. That means something related to cholesterol,

239
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,460
people who get the gene tested in our practice actually get it through a cardiovascular disease

240
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,380
prevention panel. Peter, you and I have used the same labs. You may be focused more on cardiovascular

241
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,540
disease prevention. I focus more on Alzheimer's disease risk reduction and prevention. But

242
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,540
it's really a cardiovascular risk gene just as much as it is an Alzheimer's risk gene.

243
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:33,380
So the way that I think about APOE 4 is it increases vascular risk. It increases the likelihood

244
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,580
of a bad pathologic protein called amyloid. It's a sticky stuff that builds up in the brain of a

245
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,500
person with Alzheimer's. And people with this gene are more likely to have accelerated deposition

246
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,740
or accelerated accumulation of this amyloid protein through a, what I would call just in a

247
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:58,580
basic sense, a cholesterol-like, vascular-like pathway. There's a ton more I can talk about it.

248
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,060
But, you know, once you've seen one person with Alzheimer's, you've seen one person with

249
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,780
Alzheimer's and different people can take different roads to Alzheimer's disease. And

250
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:14,820
the APOE 4 road is actually something I kind of understand. I kind of get it. I feel good about it.

251
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,700
I know that may sound callous or strange, but like I know what I'm up against. Like, okay,

252
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,940
great. We can do lifestyle things. We can manage cholesterol in a certain way. We can do

253
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,180
all these different things. And I know certain things that work. And I know what I'm up against.

254
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,380
It's the person that actually doesn't have the E4 that I'm like, wow, they're either spared

255
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,300
or they have another gene lurking. How do I find it? And what the heck do I do about it? So

256
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,700
E4 doesn't bother me. And I feel relieved sometimes when we find it in the person.

257
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,260
All right. Well, I think we'll talk a little bit more about this, but,

258
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,220
Lauren, I want to kind of hear more from your story. So as you're now kind of coming to grips

259
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,540
with the fact that your mom is slowly slipping away. And you're also realizing that unlike,

260
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,820
oh, if my mom has premature heart disease for which there is no shortage of treatments,

261
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,060
you're realizing actually your ability to access the best in medical care isn't really going to

262
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,940
do much. What's the temporal course of her progression? So as we get, let's say fast

263
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,620
forward to when you and Seth get married, which is 10 years ago. How is she at that point,

264
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,180
which is still probably putting her in her late fifties, right?

265
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,860
She just turned 60. So at that point, she could still walk. She was,

266
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:40,580
there were moments where she knew us. No, she knew us. She knew that we were her family and that

267
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:48,980
we were her loved ones. But she was at that point being fully cared for by my father at that point,

268
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,580
but she could still dress herself and bathe herself and use the restroom. But planning,

269
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,300
I would say planning my wedding was a real emotional turning point for me because it was,

270
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,340
I always was the kind of girl who envisioned my wedding and it was to be this thing. And then my

271
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,620
mom and I would do it together. And that is just not what happened at all to the point where,

272
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,380
I couldn't even have her there when I was getting ready because she would just be wandering. And my

273
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,380
dad had to take her to a separate hair appointment because it would just, would be too disruptive

274
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,980
to get everything together to have her there. But when she walked in, I remember that morning,

275
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,100
I'll back up a bit to say we had a bit of a weekend, our wedding. And Friday night was a small

276
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,020
thing and Saturday and Saturday night, there was a dinner and it was not good. We had taken my mom

277
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:50,180
from her home, which for an Alzheimer's patient, for anyone with dementia is difficult to take

278
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,540
someone out of their space, their routine, where they know everything and they are familiar with

279
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,500
their, their world. So that of course had put her in a place where I think she was probably

280
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,020
feeling very scared because she didn't understand where she was or what was happening. And at our

281
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,300
rehearsal dinner the night before, I remember her telling me she just wanted to go home,

282
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:17,780
which was, you know, really hard to handle. But then miraculously, the day of like she walked in

283
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,500
and she called me the bride and she knew that I was the bride and that I think she knew that I

284
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,340
was her daughter, but she knew she felt proud. She knew she felt love. And I have an amazing

285
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,220
photo of her like looking at me and holding my hand. And it's just, she knows that, you know,

286
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,100
there's a connection there, but it wasn't, you know, it wasn't the moment that I had certainly

287
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,580
dreamed of. And I feel like it was my dad and I that walked her down the aisle instead of him and

288
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,740
her walking me down the aisle. And, you know, normally in Jewish weddings, the family stands up

289
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,820
next to the bride and groom. And we didn't do that. We had them sitting next to us because we

290
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,380
knew my mom couldn't do that. So at that point she was, you know, she hadn't, she wasn't teaching

291
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:04,260
anymore. That was a few years earlier that had ended. So it was, for me, it was a really hard

292
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,100
thing, but luckily she rose to the occasion that day, which, you know, it's interesting throughout

293
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,140
this journey with her. You know, I think people that don't understand the disease, trying to find

294
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,660
some sort of lightness and hope would always be like, but she must have good days sometimes. She

295
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,380
must remember you sometimes. Does she, does she remember you sometimes? And I would always be like,

296
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,340
no, it's gone. Like that's gone. It's not like sometimes you remember like,

297
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,140
oh, I use my legs for walking. Like once that's gone, that's gone. But for whatever reason,

298
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,540
the day of my actual wedding, I will say she was as there as anyone could be in her state. And that

299
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,860
was an amazing thing. But, but overall it was, it was only a few months after that that we encourage

300
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,980
my parents to move out to Los Angeles because, you know, my dad, it was clear that it was killing,

301
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,980
it was going to kill my dad before it killed her. The stress of taking care of her. He always talks

302
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,820
about the plane ride home from our wedding was like the worst five hours of his life.

303
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Because she had had an accident in her seat on the airplane and was acting out and was screaming. And

304
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,140
they had to get help to get off the plane when they landed back in Florida. And it was a, you

305
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,100
know, a pretty horrific time. I mean, these are some of the things that we're going to talk a lot

306
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:18,260
about Hilarity for Charity and why the focus is on the family, which I think is part of why I'm so

307
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,260
excited about it. And you can ask me a hundred times to do something for it. And I'll always

308
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:30,340
say yes. So you always apologize. Don't say that. But, but, but I really, I'm really so fond of

309
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:36,180
organizations that take that step and appreciate what is being done for the family. Too often,

310
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:44,020
people think the only way to make a difference is to fund research. And clearly that's important,

311
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,540
but it's too easy to ignore that while we're waiting for these things to happen,

312
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,820
people need help in caring for this. And I suppose there's no disease where that's more true than

313
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,940
than this one. Absolutely. Richard, can you just spend a minute kind of explaining

314
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:07,940
what it is about the deposition of these plaques, the accumulation of the tau?

315
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:19,300
Why does it lead to this largely predictable set of symptoms that don't just involve almost a folksy

316
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:26,580
funny loss of memory, right? But also at some of this deeper level of this, what I suspect is fear

317
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,500
and confusion on some level, right? Like why would she be upset on the airplane? Well, I'm guessing on

318
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,980
some level there's a sense of fear, right? There's something is wrong. Why is she not able to

319
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,780
control her bowel or bladder? Like how is this disease wreaking so much havoc on the central

320
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:52,180
nervous system, Richard? Yeah. So there's actually a couple who I believe were both pathologists,

321
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,820
Brock and Brock, B R A K. And what they did was they kind of came up with the Brock staging of,

322
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:05,060
of pathology where the, with amyloid protein and then the pathology of Alzheimer's spreads over

323
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,100
different parts of the brain. And, you know, when I was in medical school, I was taught that

324
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:16,660
Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurological disease characterized by changes in short term

325
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:23,380
memory. And then later on that includes changes in some behaviors, neuropsychiatric disease,

326
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,500
changes in sleep. And then the person as the pathology spreads, they can no longer take care

327
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,100
of themselves. What we really now understand about Alzheimer's is it's a much more heterogeneous

328
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:41,060
disease, meaning wherever the pathology goes, those are the symptoms that manifest. So there are

329
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,180
newer forms of Alzheimer's and they're newer because they're now published in the literature,

330
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,780
but we've seen this for decades. There's one newer form that has something called a

331
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:57,460
dis-executive syndrome. Well, what does that mean? Executive function is higher order processing,

332
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,180
judgment, planning. You know, you find a wallet on the floor. What do you do with it?

333
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,620
Right. Peter would take the money out, put the money in his pocket, throw the wallet back on

334
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,620
the floor. You know, you know, Lauren, she's very empathetic and compassionate. She'd look at the

335
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,620
license, you know, she'd say, Oh, I'm going to go find this guy. I'm going to go to the ends of the

336
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,180
earth to find this person's wallet. So that's executive function. Maybe depends on how much is

337
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,460
in there. Exactly. That's one form of Alzheimer's. You know, another form of Alzheimer's is part

338
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:32,660
PART primary age related tauopathy. So we've talked about amyloid, but what about tau? It has

339
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:39,140
another protein and there's tau and amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles. And then there's glucose

340
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:44,340
hypometabolism, meaning the glucose, the sugar in the brain, it's just not being efficiently able

341
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,340
to be used to power the brain cells. So depending on where the problem is, you have different

342
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,660
manifestations, cognitive symptoms, I guess. And PART, for example, is primary age related

343
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:02,100
tauopathy. Again, one more time it's related to age. So it's usually an older people easily 70s,

344
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:07,300
more likely 80s and 90s. And it's specifically short-term memory. And it's specifically because

345
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:13,700
that pathology is localized to the memory centers in the brain, the hippocampus, for example,

346
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,540
but that person can still have good executive function. The frontal lobe, the front part of

347
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,180
the brain is working. So it just depends. It depends, you know, for example, there's

348
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,580
when the pathology, when the bad stuff goes to the back part of the brain, that's where the visual

349
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,220
fibers are. So the eyes are in the front, but they have visual protections that go to the back. You

350
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:38,260
interpret images. Well, when someone can interpret images, they get confused. They act funny. They may

351
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,420
be weird. They may be, you know, confused, but it's not exactly a memory problem. It's a visual

352
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,820
perception problem. So, you know, I don't want to be cheeky, but like, I mean, Richard, no, no,

353
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,540
this is, this is very interesting and I've never really thought of it this way, but as you probably

354
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,740
are aware, we don't really think of cancer as one disease anymore. Right. I mean, I mean, that's,

355
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:05,300
it's been a while that nobody's thought of cancer as one disease. So breast cancer and colon cancer

356
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,780
have very little in common. I mean, about the only thing they have in common is unregulated cell

357
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,220
growth, but thereafter they're very different diseases, not just in the ability to impact a

358
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:20,740
different organ. And it sounds like what you're saying is Alzheimer's is not really one disease.

359
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,980
It's kind of an umbrella term that encompasses many different diseases of the brain that have

360
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,180
some common features in the way that cancers, all cancers have some common features that, you know,

361
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:38,580
cells don't respond to normal signaling. But this notion that someone could have a form of Alzheimer's

362
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:45,060
that largely spares the frontal cortex and therefore preserves some higher order functioning

363
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,820
versus another person that has something that's not, I mean, listening to this story of Lauren's

364
00:34:50,820 --> 00:35:01,140
mom, just hearing what we've heard so far, how would you think about the etiology or the insult?

365
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:08,820
Well, I'll try not to bias my answer because I know a lot about Lauren's mom and Lauren's whole

366
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,540
family. But if I just took for face value, what Lauren said that symptoms began with little

367
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,140
repeating of stories and memory glitches around 52 to 54 to where she had to have then a modified

368
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,420
work schedule to then six years later, she's having trouble caring for herself, maybe not

369
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,020
recognizing her daughter, and then having emotional behavioral psychiatric components.

370
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:40,100
I mean, that sounds like Alzheimer's disease. That sounds like progressive short term memory

371
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:45,780
loss plus behavior changes plus, you know, other things. So it sounds like she started in the mild

372
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,900
cognitive impairment phase with the symptoms. So there's just three phases of Alzheimer's,

373
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,780
three stages, maybe we should take a step back for listeners. The first stage is actually the

374
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,540
preclinical phase, the pre symptomatic phase where Alzheimer's disease has started in the brain,

375
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,180
but there are no symptoms yet, no clinically apparent symptoms. Believe it or not, there are

376
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:13,300
46 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease in their brain right now, but no symptoms.

377
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,700
That's crazy. I've never heard that before. That number, that's wow.

378
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,740
Yeah, I try to keep that close to my vest because-

379
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,500
How do we know that, Richard?

380
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,900
That's what the studies say, you know, I don't know, you're the critical appraiser of studies,

381
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,380
I'll have to send you the study and you can tear it apart, Peter.

382
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,780
You're going to bring this one to Journal Club next month.

383
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,820
What a great idea. I love those Journal Clubs.

384
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,820
That sounds like the nerdiest club of all time.

385
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,060
Oh my. And we've discussed you and we've discussed-

386
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,500
It is nerdy.

387
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,700
It is pretty freaking nerdy. And we record it and then we watch it and we-

388
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,420
Oh my God.

389
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,820
I was captain of my math team at Colmack High School.

390
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,580
Well, there you go. Nevermind. It sounds really cool then.

391
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:01,860
Thank you. Thank you. Also the alma mater of Lauren's mom, high five, go Colmack,

392
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,940
and Lauren's uncle and some others. Anyway, so this preclinical,

393
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:14,020
pre-symptomatic phase is by far the most important phase, I think, well, maybe to focus on because

394
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:20,660
that would be prevention of Alzheimer's. You can call it either treating preclinical Alzheimer's or

395
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,700
secondary prevention of Alzheimer's because you're trying to prevent the dementia from happening.

396
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:31,300
So stage one is preclinical Alzheimer's. Stage two is mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's

397
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,900
where there are enough memory glitches and other changes to where it's noticeable. It's greater

398
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,180
than a standard deviation and a half below the norm, but the person can still take care of

399
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,820
themselves. So I think Lauren, when your mom started having symptoms, she was easily in the

400
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,700
borderline preclinical to MCI stage. And then people have roughly between a 12 and 16%

401
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,060
per year, depending on what study you read, chance of converting from MCI, mild cognitive impairment

402
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,500
due to Alzheimer's to dementia due to Alzheimer's. And the only difference is, is they still have the

403
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,420
symptoms. They're just worse and they can no longer take care of themselves. So, you know, Lauren,

404
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,260
many people would be very pleased and thankful that if symptoms started at 52

405
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,100
and she was able to attend your wedding at 60, I mean, that's parable, but better than it could have

406
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,980
been in the grand scheme. At least she was there, you know, I have friends who, who unfortunately

407
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,780
lost, had weddings without parents there. So because they had lost them already. So, yeah,

408
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:37,460
absolutely. So, so these are the stages. Okay. It's a staggering number. And whether it's 46 million

409
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,180
or 36 million or whatever the number is, you know, it's not surprising in the sense that if

410
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:48,580
when you look at how many people are pre-diabetic and you think about how that is one of the

411
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:55,140
pathways to Alzheimer's disease, sort of the energy dependent pathway, it's very plausible,

412
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,900
especially when you consider the other pathways. Richard, one thing I want to park with you to

413
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,940
come back to is some thinking around how many different variants of the disease there are,

414
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,660
right? Sort of the lipid variant of the disease, the toxin variant, the potentially an infectious

415
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,460
variant, if such, if one such exists. So maybe we'll, I'll let you think about that for a minute.

416
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:22,020
So Lauren, I want to talk about how you made your way to, to Richard, because that's how you and I

417
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,780
met you and I met through Richard, but I want to know how you and Richard met. Sure. So, okay. I'll

418
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,580
try to keep this somewhat brief. I feel like it might be long. This is a hilarious story. I'm

419
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,980
sorry. I remember this like a video in my mind, but anyway, I don't want to interrupt. So in 2011,

420
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,900
it was the year that I got married. It was the year I shot for a Good Time Call. And it was the

421
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,180
first year that we planned the first Hilarity for Charity event, which was January of 2012. So

422
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,860
2011 was a pivotal year for me. Up until that point, like I said, I had been really dark and

423
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,540
depressed and I'd been trying to work and I, you know, I'm a screenwriter and I was writing, but like

424
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:03,220
I just spent a lot of time just being pretty dark and pretty upset. And then a friend came to me and

425
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,940
was like, let's throw an event and raise money for Alzheimer's. And I was like, no. But then he wore

426
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:14,340
me down. Thank God. And we did. And so in January of 2012, we threw our first variety show to raise

427
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:19,780
money for the Alzheimer's association. And that was, you know, an incredible event. We raised a few

428
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:25,380
hundred thousand dollars, but was the most incredible part of that was that we were contacted

429
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:34,340
by young people who felt seen for the first time because they were seeing me in my, you know,

430
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,340
late twenties and my husband in his late twenties talk about Alzheimer's, which, you know, even for

431
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:48,100
me up until that point, every image of Alzheimer's I had seen was of someone who was old and gray and

432
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:58,420
not at all related to me in any way that I could understand. So we felt like we had an opportunity

433
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:05,060
to continue talking and to continue hopefully gathering people and helping them feel like they

434
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,020
too had a place in this disease, which is considered a disease for old people. And so that's when we

435
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,940
kind of decided to form our own little organization, which was a fund within the Alzheimer's

436
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:20,420
association for many years in 2017 became our own 501c3. But during that time, of course,

437
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:29,700
we became Alzheimer's advocates and I met many smart people and doctors and scientists and other

438
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,380
advocates who were doing all sorts of incredible work. We became friendly with Maria Shriver,

439
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,100
who of course has always used her platform to raise awareness about Alzheimer's and is so,

440
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,780
so incredible. And I had really sort of gotten to know the Alzheimer's community a bit.

441
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,180
So then my uncle, who is my mom's brother, who was five years older than her,

442
00:41:52,820 --> 00:42:01,620
was starting to show symptoms. Now, my uncle, who was an athlete his whole life, he was, and in his

443
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,860
later life started when he was, I don't know, I guess maybe in his 40s, riding a bike and was a

444
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,580
obsessive bike rider and he was in great shape and he's a big, strong, muscular guy. And we'll get

445
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,260
into some of the other things why Alzheimer's happened in my mom earlier than it did with him,

446
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,540
but he started showing symptoms. And I wasn't allowed to talk about that publicly at the time.

447
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,220
Unfortunately, he passed away in March this year, only a month after my mom and his family, my aunt

448
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:32,980
and my cousins have fortunately now given permission to tell his story so it can potentially help.

449
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,780
So he was starting to show symptoms and they were on the East coast. So they came to me and said,

450
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,660
what do we do? What do we do at this point? And at this point, by the way, my mom was very advanced

451
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:48,580
at this point that they were out here. This was, I don't know what Richard, it was 2014, 15, 16 even,

452
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:56,020
17. And basically I'd reached out to a doctor that I knew was like, my uncle's on the East coast,

453
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:02,020
I want to get him into the best of the best. Who is it? And this person recommended Richard.

454
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,100
The best of the best looking, I hope.

455
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,140
The best looking Alzheimer's doctor there could, yes, exactly.

456
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,420
Thankfully, this is a podcast.

457
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,180
That's what my uncle was hoping for was the best looking Alzheimer's doctor.

458
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,780
The one with the best phones, I think is what it was really.

459
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,100
Definitely the best phone. Well, I mean, certainly I've listened to that episode where we talk about,

460
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,380
where you guys talked about Richard's phones. Oh God, he's showing one. Everyone's missing it.

461
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,660
There's rhinestones, there's a horse on the back at the top. Are those not rhinestones?

462
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,620
Diamonds, hello.

463
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
Oh, diamonds. Excuse me. Those are diamonds.

464
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,300
It's a diamond pillow. Come on.

465
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:40,180
Anyway, so gave me Richard's name and I went on his website and I found his direct email address.

466
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,740
Because of course, again, I'm not the kind of person who's like, I'm going to be polite and

467
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,420
keep my mouth shut and follow the rules to get to where I need to go. I'm going to do what I got to do.

468
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:54,660
So I found his direct email address and was like, hi, here's who I am. This is what I've done.

469
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,180
My uncle has Alzheimer's and needs your help. And so he wrote me back right away.

470
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,620
And then of course, then we connected that he was from COMAC and that my mom and my uncle had

471
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,780
gone to the same high school as Richard, which is what a small world. He of course,

472
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,100
got my uncle in there right away and they went on the journey that they went on.

473
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,300
So then I was in LA and then once I connected them, I came to New York a few months later or

474
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,220
something and I said, I'm coming to New York. I want to come see the clinic, come meet you.

475
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,140
And then of course, I'm seeing the clinic and talking to him and I was like, I want in.

476
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:34,500
I want to be a patient. I want to prevent Alzheimer's. Let me in. Help my brain.

477
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,780
You literally like, I don't know how to do this, but like, like shot out your arm and said like,

478
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,260
take my blood now. Let's do it. And like literally you walked into the clinic. We like literally

479
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,620
stuck a needle. You signed a consent form and then like, it was the quickest, most rapid Alzheimer's

480
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,100
prevention consult in the history of our program. So lucky for me, lucky for me.

481
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,820
What kind of shape was your uncle in at that point in time? I actually didn't realize this

482
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,980
part of the story that that the initial connection with Richard was actually a consultation for your

483
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,820
uncle. Is that presumably because at that point you felt your mom was just advanced enough that

484
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:19,620
that it. Yeah. No, at that point, my mom was she was fully bedridden. I'm pretty sure at that point

485
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,420
getting everything fed to her fully cared for. There was her train had long left the station.

486
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:31,860
So your mom at that point would have been in her early sixties, I guess. And your uncle is a little

487
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,900
older, did you say? Yeah. So he's five years older than her. And he was, you know, I would say in that,

488
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,100
that MCI and that mild cognitive impairment space, right, Richard, or even almost a little before

489
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:48,980
that it was, he was a very functional guy. I, you know, with both my mom and my uncle, and you know,

490
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,020
and you guys can speak to this more about other people, they could both like rise to the, the

491
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:59,300
occasion in a way. And so, you know, I knew that what my aunt was seeing with my uncle was different

492
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,980
than what I saw, that he could somehow dig deep and put on a show, if you will, and act like he

493
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,460
was still in control. But there were little things, little hints that that wasn't happening. Whereas my

494
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:17,700
mom, we were far past that point. Richard, let's talk a little bit about now the beginning, you

495
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,860
go down this path of kind of being a detective. So you're never going to get to meet the parents,

496
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:28,900
the grandparents in this case, but the parents of your first patient, but you know enough about

497
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:36,740
their story. You're meeting Lauren's uncle. You know about Lauren's mom, though you haven't met her.

498
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:44,340
How are you now starting to piece together this family? First, for the standpoint of trying to

499
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:51,540
understand if anything can be done to help Lauren's uncle, but ultimately to really figure

500
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,980
out what to do to help Lauren and her brother. Yeah, this is detective work. This is a spelunking

501
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,500
mission down the deepest, darkest cave with no light. And, you know, instead of a pickaxe,

502
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:08,980
I don't know, maybe with a plastic fork and knife. Let me take a step back. Lauren, before I met your

503
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:16,500
mom, I saw a video of your mom, which kind of changed things for me. This was a video of a movie,

504
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,500
actually, that you can maybe talk about. He'd worked on and I had actually watched. I don't

505
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,460
know if it was a clip online or maybe it was something you sent me and seeing the video of

506
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:36,420
your mom from the, I don't know, you can tell me eight something years before the present that was

507
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:44,100
so instructive. I mean, I, I don't know how to explain this, but like, I'm not psychic or anything

508
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:50,020
like that, but I trust my gut. And when I see people sometimes, this is going to sound weird,

509
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:56,260
but I think it's true. I see genes. I see, I don't know. My gut just feels something and I can,

510
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,820
I don't know if it's just because I've seen the pattern so many times there's genotype, meaning

511
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,860
the genes and the phenotype, which is the, you know, the physical real world manifestations of

512
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:12,020
genes, but there was something about your mom, her behavior, her mannerisms, her, I don't know,

513
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:16,740
her, her shape or her face. I mean, I don't want to get too like kooky and weird, but like there

514
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:24,020
was something that my gut or my subconscious just saw. And your mom was a little confusing to me

515
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:30,180
because I saw something consistent with Alzheimer's, but there was, you know, my gut said that there's

516
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:36,580
something else. This is, this is just strange. This is not clearly Alzheimer's. This, this could

517
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:42,340
be something else. And then when I talked to you, Lauren, about, and really I talked to, you know,

518
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:47,060
your aunt and your uncle, and I learned all the intricate details, I just learned that this was,

519
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,060
this was more complicated than Alzheimer's. Maybe there's Alzheimer's on one side, but there's

520
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,060
Alzheimer's plus something else on another. And I don't know if, I don't know if I never told you

521
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,660
the story, but your uncle brought in his Komak High School yearbook. I don't know if we're talking

522
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,260
about that. Yeah. And then, I don't know. And then when I was actually at your place in LA, your,

523
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:10,340
I think your dad found your mom's Komak High School graduation yearbook. And this is going to sound

524
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:17,620
even kookier, but you can tell in the handwriting, your grandparents signed your mom's yearbook and

525
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:24,100
your uncle's yearbook. And they were five years apart. And I could tell in the handwriting,

526
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,580
there's like research to support this, but you know, you could just tell by the change in the

527
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:34,100
handwriting over the years and just the, you know, like Alzheimer's is a neurological disease. There's

528
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:39,140
other neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies. And in

529
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,140
Parkinson's disease, when you, when you start writing, as you write more and more that the

530
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,860
writing gets smaller and there's like a shaky nature to the writing, this is really hard to

531
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,820
explain. I don't know. Something about the handwriting was just different and about the

532
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,980
word choice. Like, you know, there was a study that looked at nuns and the nuns wrote their

533
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:02,660
autobiographical sketches and like their late teens. And then depending on analysis of, of their

534
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:08,580
autobiographies that they wrote, you could predict which nuns were going to get dementia 60 years

535
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:12,980
later. So there's a lot, you know, I believe Alzheimer's is a life course disease. Yet

536
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:18,740
literally people with the APOI 4 variant, one or two copies have smaller brains when they're born.

537
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,660
So I know we say Alzheimer's is, you know, starts 20 to 30 years before in the brain.

538
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,180
Well, that may be because of the biomarkers of Alzheimer's that we can detect are noticeable

539
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,660
then. But I believe Alzheimer's is a life course disease. And sorry for the long story here,

540
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:38,260
but I learned a lot about your family from the clues that I got from those videos and the

541
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,020
handwriting samples of your grandparents. So I guess I would start with that. And then

542
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,940
I think I just said earlier, but my brother brand completely randomly cared for another

543
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,500
one of your family. My great uncle. Your great uncle. I mean, like just completely

544
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,700
strange and bizarre, but you know, I actually talked to my brother about him and we just start

545
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,820
to put the clues together. So, so first we do the detective work and kind of the investigative part.

546
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,620
And then we just do a clinical history. We ask about all sorts of things from medical history

547
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,940
to what are the risk factors or a parent. We did some genetic testing, which was critical.

548
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:20,100
So we just try to put together lots of different pieces to the puzzle and do as best as we can

549
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,500
with the information we have to personalize or individualize a person's care.

550
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,620
So Richard and Lauren, I don't know if you and if you don't, if you don't have permission to talk

551
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:35,300
about Lauren's uncle's case, then we don't need to talk about it at all. But if we do so, I'm

552
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:42,340
curious, Richard, you have this clinical history that is at least for me would be very overwhelming.

553
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:49,460
I realize that a lot of people walk into your clinic with stories as tragic and as complicated

554
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,980
as this. But what are the things you most want to see come back out of that blood work once you have

555
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:00,260
a very detailed clinical history? At this point, you've probably established that brother and

556
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:06,980
sister are on the same pathway, though sister is moving much quicker in Lauren's mom versus uncle.

557
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,180
The apoegenotype comes back. What does it show? And what does that tell you?

558
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:18,180
All I can say is my brain kept asking why, why, why, why, why, like, why did Lauren's mom have

559
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:26,580
symptoms at 52? But Lauren's uncle, five years older, start having symptoms in his late 60s,

560
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:33,060
or maybe it was early 70s. Why, why, why, why, why, why was there this 15 something year old?

561
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,380
What is going on here? So the first thing I think about is, and this is also because of a

562
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:44,020
genotype phenotype thing, I felt or smelled or whatever it was that there was some E4 or something

563
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,260
apoegenotype something. Or when I saw that video, your mom, I don't know, again, this is weird,

564
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,300
but your mom was E4. I actually thought she was E4. I'll just be frank.

565
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,180
She was for four.

566
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,620
Yeah, I know. Well, I know.

567
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,020
Exactly.

568
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,820
I mean, from the video.

569
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,900
Yeah, from the video. Yeah. And again, I don't, this is weird talking about when it's being

570
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,580
recorded, but like, I don't know, I've seen a lot of patients. So I can just, you know, I can,

571
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,340
I don't know, something subconscious when your uncle walked in for four.

572
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:17,220
But just to be clear, Richard, did you think that Lauren's mom was for four because of how early

573
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,860
it affected her or because of the fact that she had such a clear history of disease on both sides

574
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:30,180
of the family? Honestly, I guess what I'm saying now is I saw her on video and the phenotype that

575
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:37,220
I saw that the, the, her body makeup, her habitus, her structure, again, sounds weird,

576
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:42,900
but I saw for four, I felt for four. Plus, of course, in my subconscious mind, I knew she

577
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:48,260
got it early. I knew the parents, I knew her parents, Lauren's grandparents got it later.

578
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:53,140
So it just fit. And also big, big, big, you heard it here first. No, this is common knowledge.

579
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:59,940
I hope, or it should become knowledge. Women with the E4 variant, much higher risk.

580
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,660
I mean, women with E4 are very different than men with E4. And I think most people just

581
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,860
completely are not aware of that. And then Lauren, I forget when this came up, but I don't know if I

582
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,700
asked you this, but I said, when did your mom go through menopause? And then you told me about the

583
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,700
hysterectomy and they took the ovaries out. And I said, Oh my goodness, my goodness. I said, wow,

584
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,740
E4, four, even though I don't think we had the genetics at the time, or maybe we did plus the,

585
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,980
you know, surgical menopause, taking out, you know, immediate withdrawal of estrogen and taking out

586
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,620
the ovaries. Back then we had no idea relationship to Alzheimer's or anything else. Plus she's a

587
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:42,100
woman and there's a synergistic, you know, impact on risk. So it kind of was the perfect storm. But,

588
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:48,420
but still a four, four plus a woman plus a plus a hysterectomy. There had to have been something else.

589
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,020
And then we went on a spelunking mission to find the something else.

590
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,820
Lauren, how old was your mom when she had a hysterectomy? Was she in her 40s, late 40s?

591
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,380
I want to say she was 46, maybe 47, but I'm pretty sure it was 46.

592
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:07,140
All right. You've alluded to this just in passing a moment ago. I want you to expand on it a little

593
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,700
bit. You basically created a little bit of a contrast between your uncle and your mom in terms

594
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,980
of lifestyle, your uncle being exercising constantly. Tell us a little bit about your

595
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,460
mom. Obviously you've spoken about her intellectually and you mentioned she didn't

596
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,740
consume much alcohol. What other lifestyle factors do you know about her? Did she sleep well?

597
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,820
Was she under a lot of stress? What was her diet like? How much did she exercise? Did she

598
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,540
smoke? Any other things that you can tell us? I mean, she never, she never smoked. She told me

599
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,700
once she tried to smoke a cigarette in high school and threw up and never did again. So that's why I

600
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:46,900
never smoked a cigarette. But she did not exercise. We were a big sugar house who had dessert every

601
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:55,620
night. She probably had cookies most nights after dinner. She used her brain every single day,

602
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:05,620
but was she constantly learning new things? A little. She taught first grade for 15 years.

603
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,300
And so, you know, sure. Could she have been learning things? Yes. But was she recycling

604
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,980
information that she had already learned potentially? But I think, you know, knowing what I know now,

605
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:23,780
she got almost no cardio exercise and she ate a lot of sugar. And combining those things with,

606
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,820
you know, her family history, of course, and then of course the hormonal issues that

607
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:36,420
arose from her hysterectomy, you know, seemed to really put her on the path that she

608
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:41,700
eventually went down. Do you know if she had any difficulty sleeping prior to the

609
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,380
hysterectomy? I can only imagine afterwards it was devastating. But yeah, I mean, it's funny.

610
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:54,260
She and my uncle and my grandfather were similar sleepers, I would say, and that they would fall

611
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:01,060
asleep on the couch every night and then wake up super early. That's as much information that I

612
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,540
got from her. But like, you know, of course, less as I get older, but like I'm the kind of person who

613
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:11,060
loves to sleep and is very happy to sleep, whereas like she wasn't a big sleeper. She

614
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:16,100
definitely did herself no favors with her sleep habits, especially again, knowing what we know now.

615
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,700
She did not use her sleep to help her brain at all. I just want to comment one thing. And I talked

616
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:27,700
to your dad about this at some point. When you looked at your mom when she was in the 80s and 90s,

617
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,860
your mom was not unhealthy by any means. No, no, I don't want to paint the picture of her as being

618
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,980
this like disgustingly unhealthy person who didn't care about herself. It wasn't that,

619
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:44,020
it just she didn't make the effort that is needed that we know now to, as Richard said, to take

620
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,500
control of the genes that she had been given. In prevention, in the prevention space in

621
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,620
preventative medicine or preventative health, at least the way I think about it is there's normal

622
00:57:53,620 --> 00:58:00,500
and then there's optimal. Your mom for the time, that was kind of the typical, what I would call

623
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:08,740
your mom now is maybe they heard the term skinny fat, skinny on the outside, fat on the inside.

624
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,380
I don't know what your mom's waist circumference was in high school versus her waist circumference

625
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:19,380
in her 40s and 50s. Yeah, I can guarantee you it was larger based on my understanding of the

626
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,100
pathology of this disease. But back then that wasn't really talked about or thought about.

627
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:30,340
In the 80s, it was like when 10,000 steps came about, like who came up with 10,000

628
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,820
sorry, I know who came up with it, but I understand that there's some better than nothing and

629
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,220
calculating, but 10,000 steps is like so antiquated. It's like, it's like, you know,

630
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,020
literally the 80s compared to now we truly understand physical fitness and how to optimize

631
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,300
physical performance. Your mom was not unlike most middle aged women at the time.

632
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,580
You know, and the difference between her and my uncle or even, you know, me and my brother is like,

633
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:57,700
my mom was never an athlete. Like I was a gymnast growing up. My brother was a baseball player. My

634
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:04,740
uncle ran track and then he got into cycling and was always a physically active person. Whereas my

635
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:10,740
mom was an intellectually active person. She read, she, you know, like I said, she was a great

636
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:19,620
student. She loved to learn and then to teach, but she didn't use her body in a way that perhaps

637
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:26,340
could have at least delayed what, you know, her genes were leading her toward.

638
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,260
When someone meets me at a cocktail party or I think you asked me that question, Peter,

639
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:36,500
what are the three things that you tell someone when they, yeah, I refused to answer it. I was

640
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,780
like out walking the dogs the other day and someone, someone asked me the same question.

641
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,020
I'm like, well, but, but the number one thing by far is exercise and physical activity,

642
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:48,340
but it's not just like, you know, going for a walk. It's, there's physical activity and then

643
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,100
there's physical exercise and the difference is key. Cardiovascular and strength training.

644
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,500
And there's just so many degrees, high intensity interval training specifically for this case,

645
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,260
you know, high intensity interval training is probably the only thing that can move the needle

646
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,500
in terms of certain aspects of cognitive function and people with the APOE4 variant.

647
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,660
And like no one knew any of that even a few years ago, let alone a decade ago. So

648
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:13,300
optimization of physical activity is key. And your uncle, just so we can paint the picture,

649
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:19,380
your uncle was like, he was a machine. He was a beast. Yeah. He was rich. I mean,

650
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,900
you know, he could put Pete, I don't know him and Peter next to each other, be close.

651
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,900
You know, I'm scrawny or whatever compared, but he was ripped. He just looked great.

652
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,420
He, his leg muscles were like, Oh my word. Yeah.

653
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,620
My goodness. And because of that, your metabolism is better. All these different things.

654
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,540
Richard, was he three, four or four, four? He was four, four also.

655
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:44,260
I see. Okay. So this is very interesting, right? Because until you have that information,

656
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:49,060
you could say, well, maybe the reason everything came to him so much later is he was the three,

657
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:55,940
four, his sisters, the four, four. And that explains the 15 year gap, but to have them both

658
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:03,940
be four, four, you're basically looking at gender inclusive of the removal of hormones,

659
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:10,020
lifestyle factors. It's some, probably some combination of those things that's explaining

660
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:16,180
it. Can you explain a little bit the gender issue? Again, most people who follow the research will

661
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:23,140
be very well aware that Alzheimer's disease disproportionately affects women. The answer

662
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:29,300
that used to be thrown about was, well, that's because women live longer. Anybody who understands

663
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:35,700
even first order mathematics will realize that the increase in expected lifespan of women does not

664
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:41,060
fully explain that. So there must be something else. Do you think that it's the loss of hormones

665
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,460
that explains the remainder of that gap? Or do you think it's even something beyond that?

666
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,340
Yeah. So I would have answered that question just like you did with the age thing, you know,

667
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:55,460
even five, six, seven years ago. And then it was one day on some television, something where

668
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,740
someone kept elbowing me, someone named Maria, our friend Maria Shriver. It's like, no, no,

669
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,820
you got to figure it out. But why do women? No, no, no, two out of every three brains of,

670
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,740
of Alzheimer's or women's brains. And we don't know why Isaac's and go figure it out. And I said,

671
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:15,140
yes, ma'am, I'll go do it. I think I understand much better now. And in that category of likelihood

672
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:21,380
is during the perimenopause transition, there are bioenergetic shifts in the brain

673
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:29,380
that absolutely can predispose a woman to accelerated Alzheimer's pathology.

674
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:34,900
And we call it the window of opportunity during the perimenopause transition. If we can

675
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:44,660
intervene the right way at the right time in the right woman, I believe that we can negate

676
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:52,260
a reasonable amount, if not much of careful with my words, of the negative impact of this

677
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:58,500
precipitous drop of estrogen, which I believe is neuroprotective, again, the right type of

678
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:04,500
estrogen, the right whatever the natural estrogen, I believe is protective, whether we get into

679
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,180
hormone replacement, that could be a different part of the conversation and which types and

680
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,820
what this and what that but the bioenergetic shifts during the perimenopause transition,

681
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,740
why do people have perimenopause? What are the symptoms that get hot flashes, right?

682
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,100
Night sweats. Talk about that. Oh, boy. Night sweats.

683
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

684
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,780
No, not at all. Irritability, never.

685
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,140
Never.

686
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:30,020
So all of these different things, it's a brain disease. Perimenopause is a brain condition.

687
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:35,060
Those are manifestations of the hormone withdrawal in the brain. And those are the

688
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:40,340
symptoms that brain fog. I used to think, I'll just be very frank, I was completely dead wrong.

689
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:45,140
Like women that had perimenopause and they had this brain fog thing, maybe they're just not

690
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:49,380
sleeping, right? Maybe. Well, no, they're not sleeping, right? And their sleep is interrupted

691
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,380
because of this bioenergetic shift. And heck yeah, you're going to have brain fog. And now

692
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:58,740
we know what it looks like. I hate that term brain fog. It's so nonspecific. You know, it's

693
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:03,780
problems with processing speed and attention. And that's how I think of it. But perimenopause is a

694
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:09,540
brain disease. So I think that's really important. And this bioenergetic shift is like, it's like,

695
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,500
if you want to fast forward brain aging, like in a woman in it, sorry, in a susceptible woman,

696
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:21,060
because not all women are created equal, an E4 for a woman, a surgical menopause, meaning taking

697
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,940
out the ovaries with the, with the, with the uterus. Wow. That's that could do it. Now,

698
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:31,220
I don't want to say this in all cases. It again, depends on the individual person, but perimenopause

699
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:40,580
transition is a huge unrealized risk factor for progression to dementia in an Alzheimer's

700
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:45,060
susceptible woman. And just be careful and listen to those words, because just because you're going

701
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:48,740
through perimenopause does not mean you're going to get Alzheimer's, but in susceptible people,

702
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:54,500
it is. And, and I really believe that from a precision medicine perspective, we can intervene

703
01:04:54,500 --> 01:05:00,020
with specific hormones in specific ways. Is it a patch? Is it a gel? Is it a, you know,

704
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,100
all these different things you need estrogen, what type of estrogen from horses from, you know,

705
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,740
from, from natural, from what about progesterone? When do we add it? And these are things that I

706
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:15,780
talk, I talk to an OBGYN every other week now. I'm a neurologist. What the heck? So, so I could

707
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:20,820
talk about this for a long time, but just, just know that the, the, this hormone thing is real.

708
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:26,500
That's where you think the bulk of it is then Richard is, it's less about the age gap or the

709
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:31,140
age advantage likely, you know, the sort of lifespan advantage women have. And you think it's

710
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:38,340
the elephant in the room is this enormous hormonal shift. I think that's the most under-recognized

711
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:44,260
slash largest impact in a lot of women, but I have to take a step back and age is the number

712
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:50,980
one risk factor for Alzheimer's women plus age. So a 65 year old woman with the APOE4 with at least

713
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:56,740
one or two APOE4 variants. That's like the perfect storm. Plus you add in this, you know,

714
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:02,500
the perimenopause transition, but you know, there's individual things when it comes to a woman's life

715
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:12,180
of, for example, there's more widows than widow worse. And widowhood is a astronomically important

716
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:18,260
risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Also women specifically with abdominal obesity,

717
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:23,220
let's talk, let's, let's, or sorry, enlarged waist circumference, visceral fat is as the belly size

718
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:30,660
gets larger, the memory center of the brain gets smaller. And we now know that in women specifically,

719
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:37,700
women have a 39% increased risk of dementia when they have, you know, enlarged waist

720
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:42,500
circumference is over a certain degree and, and they're impacted more so than men. When I think

721
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:47,380
of a woman and I think of body composition, I'm really paying attention to body fat. And I'm not

722
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:52,340
just paying attention, like weight. I don't care about for women. I care about what's percent body

723
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:57,700
fat and where is the fat? Is it visceral or is otherwise cellulite on the thighs? I don't care.

724
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:03,540
Oh, thank God. Belly fat. Thank you. Thank you. Great. You don't have cellulite in your thighs.

725
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,340
You're on the Attia Isaacson program. Thank goodness. This is a podcast. No,

726
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:13,700
you beat, you beat me in, in the spin clay. You were, you were awesome there. I did.

727
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,980
That was impressive. I was dying. So where the fat is key, like in men, I really believe,

728
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:23,620
and I think evidence is coming around to support this, but muscle mass in men is more important

729
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:29,460
as opposed to body fat, especially visceral fat in women as a specific individual sex specific

730
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,140
risk factor to results. So I was going to ask you about that, Richard. Do you think that part of the

731
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:38,820
sex difference is that men have more lean mass than women? So it's that they have greater capacity

732
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:45,300
for glucose disposal and that that could be an independent predictor beyond the loss of hormones.

733
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,700
I don't know. I think we need to tease this out. You know, we're honestly doing one of the,

734
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:54,980
if not the only one of the very few studies where we're looking at, you know, pretty comprehensive

735
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:01,140
brain imaging on, on women and men between the ages of 40 to 65. Lauren, you don't qualify yet

736
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:06,660
because you're still a baby. Thank you. But one day you'll, you'll jump in. We're going to be able

737
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:12,740
to answer this question, I hope in the next five to seven to 10 years or sooner, but I don't know

738
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:19,380
the answer to that question. So Lauren, you finally decide you also now want to be a part of this

739
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:25,380
prevention program. You're watching your uncle hopefully have his disease course slowed.

740
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:34,740
You're watching your mom in the final stages of her life. What is the hardest thing for you to hear

741
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:41,300
from Richard once you get through that initial diagnostic workup and battery of tests? What are,

742
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,860
what are the things you're now starting to confront about yourself? What do you learn? First of all,

743
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:51,380
Oh God, where do I begin? I mean, I, I learned a lot. Well, I mean, first of all, I learned my

744
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:57,220
APOE status, which is that I'm a three, four. Okay. So that means you got a four from mom and

745
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:04,740
obviously a three from dad. Right. And you know, I felt okay. I didn't throw it. You know, it's

746
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:09,540
funny. My, my brother had done 23 and me a couple of years before, before we knew Richard before

747
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:14,260
anything. And he got it back and it was like, you know, and this is early on in 23 me. So I don't

748
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:20,980
even know if it said APOE four, it said like Alzheimer's risk. Yes. And he freaked out. But

749
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:25,780
then by a few years later, I think it was like, you know, and it even could have been the information

750
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:31,940
that came with that along with Richard, which is, this is not the genes that he had been talking

751
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,940
about before, which are you're going to get Alzheimer's. This is even a four, four. This

752
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:42,340
is a three, four. And there are things that we can do to modify my risk. And so I, again,

753
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,980
as I touched on as someone who's like, if I'm going to do it, I want to do it and dive in on it.

754
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:52,260
So I, don't get me wrong. I wasn't like, yes, I have a three, four. And so let's celebrate. But

755
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:58,180
like I felt, you know, okay, I have this information. Science is telling me there's

756
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:04,340
something I can do. Why don't I do it? But it was easier in the beginning. I kind of,

757
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,900
have I been a patient of the clinic for four or five years, five, five, at least four or five

758
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,420
years. Yeah. At least, you know, when I kind of like half started, I was like, you know,

759
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:17,060
a little better at my diet and a little less sugar. And you know, when I were, I exercised,

760
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:23,940
but not, not what I needed to be doing. And then certainly then, and in the year leading up to

761
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:28,340
when I met you, Peter was, you know, I was directing a movie that year. And that is certainly

762
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:33,300
not the time where you have all the space in your life to take control of your health. So that it's

763
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:38,260
certainly, I fell off the wagon during my sitting on my ass in an editing room for eight or nine

764
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:45,300
hours a day was, I didn't exercise before that. You know what I mean? It felt like power in a way.

765
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:52,820
And it took me a while to figure out how to harness that power and what lifestyle changes

766
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:58,900
I needed to adopt and to change. And certainly took both of you at different points in my journey

767
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:04,260
to help me and guide me. And I'm lucky for that. But to me, it felt exciting. You know, people often

768
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,820
are like, aren't you scared? How do you, why would you want to know blah, blah? And I'm just like,

769
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,980
why don't you want to know science gives us tools. I don't want to live in the dark and not use the

770
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:21,060
few tools that I've been given at this point. That seems way worse to me. So I felt very lucky

771
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:27,940
that I was, you know, getting to access your smart brains and of course, other people that I've met

772
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:33,700
and take some control over my genes. It is an interesting point you raised, Lauren, because,

773
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:40,180
and I may have even told this story on a podcast before, but I remember maybe 2014 or so I had a

774
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:44,660
husband wife that were both in the practice and simultaneously coming in and did blood tests on

775
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:50,100
both of them. And we always do screen for APOE on the way in. And each of them came back three,

776
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,380
four, three, four, they have three children. So one, I'm explaining to them what the E4, E4 means

777
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,460
for them. And I'm also saying, look, you know, your kids are young now, but at some point it's

778
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,820
going to make sense probably in their twenties to do a screen on them, because there's a 25% chance

779
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,700
that each of them will be a four, four, a 50% chance that there'll be three, four, and a 25%

780
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:16,740
chance there'll be three threes. And I think because their kids were girls, I wasn't so worried

781
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:20,900
about head trauma. If their kids were boys, I probably would have said I would even test

782
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:25,140
sooner to really revisit, you know, if they, if, if they're thinking about playing football,

783
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,300
I would probably reconsider that in the case of any four Richard, I'd like to hear your thoughts

784
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:36,100
on that, by the way. Anyway, the point of the story is I got a real heated call from their PCP

785
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:43,060
a couple of weeks later saying, how dare you test them for this gene? I mean, what are you trying to

786
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:50,740
do? We can't do anything about this. So what on earth, what good comes of scaring them with the

787
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:56,100
fact that they have an E4 gene? And obviously that led to a discussion. I actually think that

788
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,460
person has since then changed, changed their tune a little bit on that front, in large part, thanks

789
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:06,660
to the work that Richard's done. But Richard, just a quick digression there. Is there, what's

790
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:12,020
the evidence on people with an E4 gene being better off without head trauma? Not that anybody

791
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:17,780
does well with more head trauma, but are E4s more susceptible to head trauma? Well, just to take one

792
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:23,300
step back. I mean, Peter, you, you did the right thing. I mean, this, this is when the conversations

793
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:32,260
need to start. I mean, for example, eating fatty fish, people with ApoE4s just don't absorb for,

794
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:37,940
just one example, and I can just soap so many things, but eating fatty fish from early in life,

795
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:42,020
again, I'm not a pediatrician, so I'm not recommending little kids and 12 and, I don't,

796
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:48,740
I don't even know what or when to start, but omega-3 fatty acids in E4 brain should be started as early

797
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:53,780
as possible and at reasonable doses to really protect the brain. Head trauma is something

798
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:59,860
that's a little confusing. My opinion on this has shifted a little bit. You know, my nephew, Bobby,

799
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,420
my sister asked me about this, you know, should he be playing football? And, you know, of course,

800
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:09,780
I have some adjutant in my stomach, but you know, I, you know, if you have the four genes, sure,

801
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:15,780
you may be at higher risk and head trauma may certainly intermingle. Again, epigenetic risk,

802
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:21,860
head trauma plus E4 potentially can increase risk. These are really difficult conversations to have,

803
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:27,460
but knowledge is power. Lauren, you felt empowered, you know. Our patients like,

804
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:32,180
okay, I'm ready. Let's do it. And if I, at least I tried, you know, I mean, it's better to try than

805
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:38,580
not. When it comes to E4, I don't know when the best age is to learn. I guess that's a, that's a,

806
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:43,540
that's a tricky question, but you know, the reveal study showed that people that find out their

807
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:48,740
APOE4 status in the initial six months, maybe there's a little bit more anxiety initially, but,

808
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:53,300
but, but at the end, there's no negative psychiatric, psychological outcomes. And,

809
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,300
you know, the, the studies that we've published, I mean, I wrote, I wrote our first paper on this in

810
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:02,580
2011. So like a decade ago, and like just the fact that you could use genetics to personalize

811
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:07,620
Alzheimer's care, that paper fell on its face. I don't even think it's been cited. Like it's one

812
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:11,940
of those papers, you know, it just kind of sat. I mean, now we write papers that like specifically

813
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:17,940
the entire paper is about if you're E4 versus not E4, do this versus that. And, and I don't know,

814
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:22,420
one day, I hope it's soon. We're going to know all these genes and, and, and people, when they get

815
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:26,180
their preventative health screenings, we're going to, it's not just E4, we're going to get a whole

816
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:31,940
bunch of genes and primary care doctors, I hope one day soon, five years, 10 years, who knows,

817
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:36,740
are going to basically do these genetic screens on multiple genes and give people targeted

818
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:42,820
personalized plans for disease risk reduction as early as possible. So anyway, I support you doing

819
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,940
E4. I would say though, that most doctors are not aware of this. So it's not exactly the doctor's

820
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:53,700
fault, but understanding genetic type to personalized care is the future of medicine.

821
01:15:54,260 --> 01:16:00,580
What other genes are there? We've talked about obviously the three that are of greatest concern,

822
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:06,260
but fortunately the three that virtually nobody's ever going to have to hear about or deal with the

823
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:13,780
PSEN1, 2 and APP. APOE4 sucks all the air out of the room. There are a couple of other genes,

824
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:19,940
Richard, in this space that we're just starting to become aware of. Can you speak to a couple of

825
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:25,140
those and did any of those figure into the detective work you did in Lauren's family?

826
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:30,260
I learned a lot about Lauren's family and it was in part because of my brother. It was in part

827
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:35,300
because of actually you and your brother, Lauren. And I just met so many different people. I mean,

828
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:40,820
I really got to know your family tree pretty well between videos and talking and all this sort of

829
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:46,420
thing. And your family is one of the first, I would say first 12 to 15 families that we ever really

830
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:52,660
did some super deep dives on. I mean, I looked at all sorts of different things in your family.

831
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:56,900
And I guess what I would say is, huh, do I really want to call out one gene or another?

832
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:02,980
Or even just generally, like even independent of Lauren's family, Richard, when we think about

833
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:10,660
some of these other genes that are now kind of starting to become of interest to us, Tom40, TNF,

834
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,980
what can you say about these and how they impact our understanding of this disease?

835
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:24,740
I hesitate to call out any one specific gene because this is a complicated topic, but,

836
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:30,740
you know, there are around 30 or so Alzheimer's risk genes that have been found that I think are

837
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:38,100
very important. But aside from just those risk genes, and you know, you could say CLU and PICLAM

838
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,500
or whatever you call it and bin one, and, you know, I could just name a whole bunch and Tom40 is really

839
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:48,900
important because not all APOE4s are created equal. I believe this is confusing. And it's even been

840
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:55,940
confusing for me. But the Tom40 that's next to the E4 is really can influence in my opinion, I believe,

841
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:01,140
I'm not certain, but I believe that the different Tom40 chain length or whatever it is,

842
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:07,780
one E4 can behave one way and another E4 can have a lower or higher risk depending on the gene next

843
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:13,220
to it. So there's a lot of confusion here with this polygenic risk thing, but Tom40 is important.

844
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:18,740
But, you know, when we take a step back, and I look at Alzheimer's as a medical condition,

845
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:23,220
it's a medical condition that causes neurologic manifestations. I think Alzheimer's is a medical

846
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:29,300
disease. I love being a neurologist. It's fun. The brain is interesting. I possibly could have

847
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:34,420
should have been an internal medicine specialist. I am really intrigued by all the lower organs as

848
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:38,660
the neurologist would say below the neck. No, no, no disrespect to the lungs and the liver and

849
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:43,460
everything else. But no, it's a medical condition. And whether you're on the lipid path or the

850
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:50,020
inflammation path or the potentially infectious path or the head trauma path, there's so many

851
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:56,980
different things that can trigger brain related pathology. So I'm very interested in the vascular

852
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:05,300
genes, vascular like FTO and other cholesterol LDL and PCSK9 related genes. Like I'm interested

853
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:11,780
in those things because that can have an increase or decrease depending on polygenic risk.

854
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:16,020
Longevity genes. What about like Foxo and Clotho? Like there's got to be, there's,

855
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:20,820
I know that there are genes that kind of protect you against the Alzheimer's risk of the other

856
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:26,820
genes. So I really look at the metabolism genes. I look at the vascular risk genes in Lauren

857
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:34,100
specifically. Lauren was one of the first people that we found another gene that kind of co-interacts

858
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:42,500
with ApoE to even be even more interesting because maybe this gene related to TNF, TNF alpha,

859
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:48,580
which we can talk about when someone has that TNF alpha gene and also has an ApoE4 gene,

860
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:54,020
well, they're also at higher risk than someone with E4 without the TNF. So, so again, we're

861
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:58,660
trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together of why the heck did your mom get this? And we can

862
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:03,620
pin it on exercise and we can pin it on one thing, but, but it's not just one thing. It's not like

863
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:07,220
your mom didn't get Alzheimer's because she didn't exercise. Your mom would have gotten

864
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,700
Alzheimer's anyway, if she would have exercised rigorously, which no one knew back then.

865
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:17,780
Sure. Would she have delayed it? I firmly believe so. But your mom was different than your uncle in

866
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:22,740
other ways too. Cause you know, your uncle did not have that TNF alpha related gene. And now

867
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:28,180
because we found this gene, I mean, this is like imprecise science. This is like, I would call it

868
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:32,580
better than back of a napkin, but not perfect science. We're doing things with you, Lauren,

869
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:38,740
now that are trying to get ahead of the curve and trying to make that TNF alpha gene have a less of a

870
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:43,540
negative impact on your trajectory. So between Peter and I, we've really kind of hit you with

871
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:50,420
certain things that can potentially help that. So I guess what I would say is polygenic risk is

872
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:55,540
probably the answer. And I think there's something else you've said that the other analogy is not all

873
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:01,220
E fours are created equal. I don't think that can be overstated enough. And the analogy for in the

874
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:07,940
cardiovascular world is LP little a I've seen so many patients with elevated LP little A's.

875
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:14,900
And in some of them, it absolutely tears through the family with premature heart disease that you

876
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:21,460
can spot a mile away. So just in the same way you look at Lauren's family history and a mile away,

877
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:26,500
you say it's Apo E four, you'll look at people having heart attacks in their forties and dying

878
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:31,460
in their fifties from heart disease. And you say that's, that's LP little a until proven otherwise.

879
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:36,820
And then there's other patients that show up with elevated LP little a very, even very elevated LP

880
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:43,220
little a normal, apparently normal risk of cardiovascular disease. So even though this is

881
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:48,180
technically not the correct term, it's almost like there's variable penetration of the gene as well.

882
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:55,140
So let's go back to kind of the what can you do, Lauren. So let's go back in time. It's now

883
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:00,020
a couple of years ago, you finished, you're off the the editing floor.

884
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,860
You're off the cruise ship. Weren't you living on a cruise ship for a while?

885
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,500
Too long, too many days. Yes.

886
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:14,100
It's been about two, three years that you really switch this into overdrive. Yeah. I mean, you've

887
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:22,660
you've really become the poster child for I'm going to do every single thing in my power every

888
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:28,260
day to reduce the risk of this beast. I guess I just get the sense from you, like

889
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:34,740
you don't seem to push back on this. Like you've I guess it's in part because it's come from within

890
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:39,220
you and not it's not been thrust upon you. Is that do you think that's the reason that it's

891
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,580
been so I want to use the word easy because I don't think it's easy. But yeah, I think when

892
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:53,220
you see what I have seen over the last 15 years, you know, why wouldn't I do anything I possibly

893
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:59,860
can to avoid what I saw over the last 15 years? I want to do everything I possibly can to not go

894
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:06,900
through that myself, to not put that on my husband or my family. And I feel like I've been given an

895
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:15,380
opportunity to at least try. So why wouldn't I? Well, it is really amazing to watch how Seth

896
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:21,220
basically acts the same way, right? It's sort of like he's sort of in it with you, right? It's kind

897
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:27,620
of like, well, okay, you're both on the complete risk reduction pathway. Well, I mean, only since

898
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:32,900
this pandemic have I really gotten him into exercise in a way and he's still not where I am.

899
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,780
And of course, obviously all of us, I'm not, you know, exercising the way I was before all of this.

900
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:44,900
But yeah, we eat, we eat, you know, we eat every meal together. So we eat the same things. And he

901
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:52,660
has certainly changed his eating habits, which has been wonderful. And he supports me. And yeah,

902
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:57,060
he goes along with it. We don't have the same genes, but like, why wouldn't he also care about

903
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:01,620
his brain? He's still got one, you know, as, as Richard said, just because he doesn't have a four

904
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:07,460
doesn't mean he's not at some risk. And so I'm very lucky that I have someone who is supporting me

905
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:12,580
most of the time. That doesn't mean he's not always like, orders too much at dinner or orders

906
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,740
extra things. And I'm like, I have to have a bite of that. Or, you know, but exercise is always very

907
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:23,460
supportive of it. But it also speaks to, I think, the difference between having a spouse or a family

908
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:28,900
member that can kind of go through the journey with you, whether it's cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

909
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:33,220
heart disease, whatever it is that that a person is really trying to make these lifestyle changes

910
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:38,980
to to work against. And so we've spoken a lot about exercise, certainly on other podcasts,

911
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:46,740
we've spoken a lot about nutrition. How does one improve glycemic control? How does one ensure

912
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:53,300
maximum insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal? Richard, can we talk about some of the other

913
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:59,300
tools in the toolkit that we have with with Lauren and frankly, a number of the other patients that

914
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:04,260
we take care of that are high risk in some way. I mean, in our practice, Richard, as you know,

915
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:12,660
we define patients as high risk, meaning you come into their care, basically, if their family

916
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:19,220
history is notable, they have at least one copy of the four gene or the rover 60. You check one of

917
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:25,140
those boxes, Richard is a part of your care, and then we kind of have a protocol that obviously

918
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:29,380
you're the poster child for Lauren. What are some of the other things that we're doing on that

919
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:34,580
protocol, Richard? Sure. So to give you an evidence based answer, let's start with that

920
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:39,140
first. And then we'll go to a case study of Lauren. So within the last year we published

921
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:43,940
the results of our clinical trial that Lauren, thank you, you're a part of you. Thank you for

922
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:49,060
participating. You forced your arm upon me, but we said, okay, you have to sign the consent. But

923
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:53,620
and I think you guys win the prize for the most family members in I think you guys may be tied

924
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,380
for the most family members in the study. But we have a study that we published in the journal

925
01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:01,220
Alzheimer's and dementia, the journal of the Alzheimer's association and Peter, thank you.

926
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:08,420
You are a coauthor in that study. You're, you're really fundamentally helped me understand and

927
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:13,940
developed the approach towards maximizing human performance from both not, not just physical

928
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:18,020
activity, but nutrition. And just, you got me to understand quick shout out for Peter. I give you

929
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,620
all these shout outs, Lauren, cause you're, you're the best, but Peter, quick shout out. You got me

930
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:26,980
to understand the difference between lifespan, longevity, health span, which is kind of quality

931
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:30,900
and brain span. And really that's what, that's what we mostly focus on, but there's a lot of

932
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:35,380
overlap. But what we did is we did a study because we had to prove whether or not this

933
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:41,140
individualization of care could work. And in this study we found that on average,

934
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:46,500
people got 21 different interventions. You know, again, that's average, Lauren, how many things do

935
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,860
we tell you to do? Probably around there. I've, I can count to have, I have your list.

936
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:54,260
Definitely around there. I mean, have on a lot of supplements. And then of course,

937
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:59,140
there's the lifestyle stuff, the sleep and the food and all this stuff.

938
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:04,260
I'm just reloading up one of your things from December, 2019. So a major important part of

939
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:09,300
this is also a regular follow-up. So every six months we repeat body composition measures,

940
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,780
which is, we use the term ABCs of Alzheimer's prevention management. So the A is for

941
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:19,540
anthropometrics or body composition, body fat, muscle mass, stuff like that. The B is the blood

942
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:23,220
based biomarkers. We look at your cholesterol markers. We look at your inflammation, your

943
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:28,820
metabolism, your nutrition, genetics are in there too. And then C is cognitive function. So

944
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:33,860
we assess and track all of these things. And at each, every six months, depending on what the repeat

945
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:38,020
is, depending on what your memory function is and what your cholesterol is and all this, we will

946
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:42,420
keep refining or fine tuning so that we can, you know, this is really an iterative process.

947
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:51,060
So basically we keep tracking. And then in your case, because of your APOE4 and because of your,

948
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:55,620
and I have permission to talk about this, I guess. Okay. Great. Because of your APOE4,

949
01:27:55,620 --> 01:28:01,300
we really honed in on exercise and also more high intensity interval training, really, really

950
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:06,020
focusing on that in terms of nutrition. We, we, and we checked your omega three levels in your

951
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:11,380
blood, red blood cell, DHA levels and EPA and whatnot. We had you eat fish, but also omega three

952
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:16,180
fatty acids via capsules, a very specific type and brand that we often recommend. I have nothing to

953
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:20,980
disclose. I wish I did. I could pay my student loans, but nothing to disclose from any supplement

954
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:26,180
or vitamin companies, but omega three fatty acids are key, pretty reasonable dose. Omega three is

955
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,380
DHA and EPA based on studies that thankfully this was proven this past year, but we've had you on

956
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:36,420
this for the last several years that people with the APOE4 gene require higher doses of omega threes.

957
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:43,300
So even eating fish just wasn't enough. So we also have you on roughly 2000 milligrams or so of DHA

958
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:49,940
and something or other of EPA. We also put you on a very purified form of coco flavonols that

959
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:55,540
have been studied in multiple randomized trials. We gave you a very specific type of curcumin,

960
01:28:55,540 --> 01:29:02,340
a type of a more nanoparticle version, again, nothing to disclose, but that may have anti-TNF

961
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:07,780
alpha effects may help with inflammation. So we put you on a reasonable dose of that. We put you

962
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:12,820
on specific types of B complex vitamins. This was to address your homocysteine. Homocysteine is an

963
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:18,580
amino acid in the blood that is an independent risk factor. So if you have high homocysteine,

964
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:23,860
you are more likely to have brain shrinkage over time and impaired memory function, but only in

965
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:29,940
people with high homocysteine, we can give B complex vitamins, B12, B6 in tiny amounts, and then

966
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:35,140
a folic acid. If we can control that and the person has sufficient levels of omega threes,

967
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:40,580
then you can slow brain shrinkage, brain atrophy and improve memory. So we've modified that risk

968
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:45,620
factor, homocysteine. We optimized your vitamin D. I think your vitamin D wasn't terrible, but it

969
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:51,460
was lower than it could be. I think 60% of people, for example, in Florida are vitamin D deficient.

970
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,020
That makes no sense. The first time I saw you, my vitamin D was not good. I can remember that.

971
01:29:56,020 --> 01:30:00,100
Oh, it was like 19 or 17. I remember definitely not good. And I remember being like, I can

972
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:05,940
I sit outside more and not wear as much sunscreen because I'm obviously, I'm the palest human ever.

973
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:10,420
And so I wear a lot of sunscreen, but like, we've helped that.

974
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:16,980
Is there a level, Richard, that you try to do? Do you want to see vitamin D within a certain range?

975
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:21,540
Yeah, great question. So in a study in neurology, I think it was Little John and other other

976
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:26,260
studies I can name several. Cedric and Weiler also has some great, great work on this. But

977
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:32,180
the best that I can do in across the board and in a general answer is, you know, 30 is kind of

978
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:37,940
normal. But what is optimal? I'm thinking closer to 40 to 50, maybe more likely 50 in someone that

979
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:43,620
has two APOE for variants. So an APOE for four, based on a study in the European Journal of

980
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:51,060
Nutrition, a couple years back, he for four is probably preferentially protected or E4 for better

981
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:56,020
have good vitamin D levels. I'll put it that way at 50 or more, maybe it's 50 to 70. I don't think

982
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:01,140
we know the exact answers, but a level of 17 to 19 when Lauren first came in to see me was was

983
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:05,860
definitely not sufficient. Aside from taking vitamin D, we recommend how to take it. It's a

984
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,780
fat soluble vitamin. So take it with a meal with a little bit of fat in it. That's key. Otherwise,

985
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:13,620
it doesn't help with absorption. I'm getting some sun from from my perspective, you know,

986
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:18,420
10 to 15 minutes between the hours of 11 to one when the sun is when the UV or whatever it is,

987
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:23,060
is strongest. There's lots of devil in the details here. But you know, Lauren, we've been able to

988
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:27,940
completely modify that risk factor. So that's that's been pretty good. And going back to the EPA

989
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:36,500
issue, do you give whatever amount is needed to reach a certain level in the red blood cell

990
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:43,380
membrane? Or do you just say, look, we know that E4 is going to have a harder time assimilating,

991
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:49,860
we're just going to give a higher dose. Again, our patients, we use this stuff very liberally.

992
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:55,860
I think Lauren is on at least two grams combined EPA DHA. So do you just leave it at the dose? Or

993
01:31:55,940 --> 01:32:01,220
do you like to rely on the Omega quant type assay? I don't know that I have the perfect answer for

994
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:07,140
this, but I titrate it up based on the person's red blood cell level. I try to get an index of

995
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:12,020
at least 12 to 14 and higher is probably better. I think orange is like 14 plus, which is awesome.

996
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:18,420
I also look at the cholesterol. So APO B and Peter and I, I hate disagreeing with Peter on

997
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:24,740
anything, but I still like LDL P. But I know I've been a convert to APO B. If someone has high APO

998
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:29,860
B and LDL cholesterol, I really believe that we can even be more liberal on people. People need

999
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:35,940
it even more. But you know, the study by Hussein Yassin that was just published recently just showed

1000
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:41,140
that you really need to get at least two grams of DHA alone to even get enough. They did a spinal

1001
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:46,260
fluid study. Thankfully, these people volunteered to get spinal taps. And I mean, Lauren, we're

1002
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:51,380
really hitting you with this stuff. And I'm really glad because, you know, the cumulative effect of

1003
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:59,140
APO E4 plus DHA and EPA over time, there's a cumulative effect. And we really started right

1004
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:02,660
with you. So we hedged our bets a little because it was safe and then it was proven, you know,

1005
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:07,060
five years later. So that was cool. But I don't know that I have a great answer. I also look at

1006
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:12,980
Omega six to three ratio. And I know, Peter, I know you and I are may not look at the same

1007
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:18,260
that way. I also look at trans fats in the blood. And I know that that's maybe an imperfect assay

1008
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:23,460
or science, but trans fats are no bueno when it comes to Alzheimer's risk. So I don't know. I

1009
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:30,020
think there's a lot of important aspects to Omega threes and fat assays. But I don't know that I

1010
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:35,780
know the perfect answer on how to how to do it. You spoke briefly about theric human. We tend to

1011
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:40,740
reserve theric human for those higher risk patients versus curcumin for most people.

1012
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:47,060
What's our belief for why theric human? There's been some reasonable data suggesting that

1013
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:52,580
despite the enormous increase in cost when you switched to theric human, it's worth the cost.

1014
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:58,820
This is based on an important study from small Gary small UCLA. And they showed that, you know,

1015
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:03,060
when people randomized to this, you know, it sounds kitschy, but like nanoparticles,

1016
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:07,060
who that sounds cool nanoparticles can get through the blood brain barrier. Well, that sounds like,

1017
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:10,980
in some ways, marketing, but then they did the study and like they had less, you know,

1018
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:16,820
amyloid accumulation. So like, okay, sign me up. Like, it's safe. Yes, it has a cost to it,

1019
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:22,100
but it's not astronomically expensive. You know, I don't know what the exact effect is,

1020
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:26,980
but the effect size was large enough, even though it was a small study to, you know,

1021
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:31,620
when we talk about evidence based and safe, I think there's enough evidence. It's not perfect,

1022
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:36,900
but it's safe. And it's not super, super, super costly. So, and especially with TNF,

1023
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:44,580
should Lauren be on both curcumin longa plus therapy? Like, who knows? Like, I have no idea

1024
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:48,660
because of the TNF, but she's doing so much exercise that maybe we don't need to do it. But

1025
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:54,180
I'm babbling, but basically, I don't know the answer. I just think it's, it's a reasonable

1026
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:59,220
option, even though it's not perfect. Okay. Well, another supplement that I'm a huge fan of

1027
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:06,180
is magnesium L3 and eight. What are your thoughts on that? And I'll explain to folks what it is.

1028
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:12,100
L3 and eight is a transporter that gets magnesium into the brain much more easily. So normally,

1029
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:16,820
if you take magnesium, it's not, you know, going to get too much in the brain. There is actually

1030
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:23,780
some interesting clinical data in humans suggesting that magnesium L3 and eight in patients with MCI

1031
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:30,180
improve symptoms. So again, one has to take a leap of faith to say, well, if you give it to people

1032
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:36,020
prior to MCI, it would even delay progression from phase one to phase two, and potentially from phase

1033
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:39,780
two to phase three. So what are your thoughts on that, Richard? Yeah. So I actually learned a

1034
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:43,620
little bit about this from you. I've been a magnesium glycinate kind of guy for a while,

1035
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,300
because just kind of from the headache community as a neurologist, it's very well tolerated and

1036
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:54,100
that kind of thing. But I think the data on three and eight is compelling. I think it may also help

1037
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:58,340
with sleep, if I'm not mistaken. And I've had some success with that. And then some pretty,

1038
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:04,500
shall we say stressed out type A people. So it's not at the very top of my list,

1039
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,340
but it's somewhere in the middle ish, you know, middle to it's not super low, but it's

1040
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:14,900
again, evidence based enough and completely safe. So when it comes to Alzheimer's prevention,

1041
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:20,260
we don't want to give anything to anyone that has any degree of risk, because what if they're not

1042
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:23,780
going to get Alzheimer's anyway, then we've done our patients harm and we take the oath, do no harm.

1043
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:29,700
So I'm pro mag three and eight, but I don't have as much evidence that's lower on the evidence list.

1044
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,940
How do you think about you've already kind of alluded to this, but I want to make sure we

1045
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:40,900
round it out around what we would call E4 specific maneuvers, right? So let's assume you

1046
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:47,540
have two theoretical patients in front of you that you believe are both at higher risk than you'd

1047
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:54,980
like. One of them is an E4 patient. Another one is not given what we know about E4. How does that

1048
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:59,620
change your thinking? You've already made several points in reference to this. One of them, for

1049
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:06,660
example, is boy, there's no ambiguity around the benefits of exercise in E4 people. People with E4

1050
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:12,660
tend to require higher doses of EPA and DHA. They tend to benefit disproportionately from vitamin D.

1051
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,980
Are there any other things that are unique to patients with E4? Yeah. So we wrote a paper on

1052
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:21,460
this that's open access. It's in the journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease. It's called

1053
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:25,460
clinical application of APOE and Alzheimer's prevention, a precision medicine approach.

1054
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:30,180
Kara Berkowitz is the first author. She's awesome. She was a med student at Cornell. Peter, we lost

1055
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:35,060
her to surgery. I don't know how that happened. You surgeons. But she wrote this terrific paper

1056
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:40,100
and did several other papers with us too. So I mentioned this paper first because this is a

1057
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:46,900
complicated topic. Let's just start by saying physical exercise is, I believe, likely preferentially

1058
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:54,260
effective in people with the E4 variant or more. Brain imaging studies show that E4 carriers

1059
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:59,780
exacerbates the effect of having a sedentary lifestyle in Alzheimer's pathology. So someone

1060
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:05,220
with E4 really, really, really better exercise. And it's like no joke. It's got to be really

1061
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:11,540
important. And the intensity of the exercise is key. Tobacco use, just worse in E4s. I'm not

1062
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:18,740
telling you that a non-carrier can smoke, but I think it's worse. Alcohol use, alcohol is really

1063
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:23,460
confusing and the data on alcohol kind of darts all over the place. But a few drinks a week is

1064
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:28,100
kind of where I'm at now. Men and women may be a little bit different. This is really confusing,

1065
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:34,500
but there's probably an E4 impact. But what I would say that while light to moderate alcohol

1066
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:39,700
consumption, I mean more on the light side, like four to seven drinks, may be beneficial for

1067
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:46,820
non-carriers of E4, decreasing alcohol intake or even abstaining may be even more so helpful for

1068
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:52,500
carriers. But this is tricky and I don't really know the answer to that. Cognitive engagement.

1069
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:56,660
If you don't use it, you'll lose it. Staying cognitively engaged is like critical. There's

1070
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:01,460
some difference with E4s and cognitive engagement strategies, but I think the jury's out a little

1071
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:08,260
bit. The dietary stuff is, you know, just specific dietary types is key. Omega-3 fatty acids we talked

1072
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:12,580
about are probably preferentially effective, but you need to be at higher dose. You know, there's a

1073
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:17,620
randomized trial go underway now to try to understand, you know, the impact of high saturated

1074
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:23,220
fats and high glycemic index diet on cognitive function for E4 carriers, but that's not published

1075
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:27,860
yet. I guess I want to be cautious in saying this, but I think people with E4s are probably,

1076
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:33,140
you have to be more cautious and careful in terms of high saturated fat, you know, MCTs. I'm pro

1077
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:39,140
MCTs if they're the right MCTs, and this is a topic for another discussion. And I'm pro MCTs if

1078
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:46,100
it's not specifically more so likely in people without the E4 variant, there's more window or

1079
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:53,620
more leeway to be able to use them. But MCTs is a really tricky topic, but I personalize MCTs based

1080
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:58,420
on this, but this is a whole thing. So I don't know how much down the rabbit hole to go.

1081
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:03,700
I have another question about, this is one we've all spoken about, and yet I'm still very much

1082
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:11,140
unclear. And I'm curious as to where your thinking is evolving, which is THC in any form, be it edible,

1083
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:16,260
be it inhaled. I mean, what do we know and acknowledging that it's probably complicated,

1084
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:20,740
right? Because there are probably benefits that come in terms of stress reduction. Certainly,

1085
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:26,100
if it facilitates sleep, but what do we know on that front? And are we ever going to get good

1086
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:32,740
answers? Because the epidemiology is obviously heavily negatively biased based on the cohort

1087
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:40,900
that studied. This is a hard one. I'm not negative on THC specifically. I think there's something

1088
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:47,300
with the CBD and THC connection. I think it depends on the amount of CBD versus THC.

1089
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:54,580
If I had to choose, if someone's going to use THC or CBD, edible to me makes more sense because of

1090
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:58,580
less smoking is better. But I don't know, that's just what I believe, but I don't think that's

1091
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:03,220
grounded in perfect science. But I guess I would say, I don't know. If every one study you read

1092
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:08,580
where it helps Alzheimer's pathology, you can read another study where it causes greater pathology.

1093
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:14,980
So I'm not anti CBD THC. I'm not pro. I'm kind of, I'm kind of in the middle. I think it's an

1094
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:19,700
individualized decision. And I think if someone's going to use CBD or THC, because for example,

1095
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:25,060
Hey, when I take it, my sleep is better. I feel better. Okay. But that's subjective. I want to

1096
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:30,580
know objectively, you know, let me see your fitness tracker. Let me see your ring. Let me see your,

1097
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:35,300
whatever you do to track things. And these, these, all these gadgets may or may not work great in

1098
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:40,020
different people, but I think one has to really, the term here would be an end of one study where

1099
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:46,100
you make one specific change and then you compare what happens to that person over the three months,

1100
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:50,820
say, or six months of only taking that one thing. And does cognitive function improve or does what

1101
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:56,340
does sleep metrics improve? I think the THC CBD story is a precision medicine answer.

1102
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:00,260
Well, speaking of cognitive testing, Lauren, how many times now have you been through the

1103
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:04,260
battery of cognitive tests that Richard puts people through?

1104
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:07,860
I don't know. Is that a cognitive test to see if I even know that number?

1105
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:16,340
Maybe, but six, seven times. I don't know if you know that right off the information in front of

1106
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,580
you, but something like that enough that I'm starting to learn the tests.

1107
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:25,780
Is it intimidating when you sit down and do it? Cause I've had some patients that don't want to do

1108
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:33,060
it. Well, okay. Because I had a bad time, I visited Richard the day that like father came out,

1109
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:39,940
which was because of a number of reasons, perhaps the most stressful day and emotion,

1110
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:44,660
one of the most emotional days I'd had in a while and it was not good. And my brain was

1111
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:49,780
a million different places. And of course my body was not in the best of shape leading up to that.

1112
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:58,420
And it was bad news. And Richard was so unhappy and so mad at me, but it was a good kick in the

1113
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:03,700
behind to get myself back on track. Cause I had been making progress, then I lost that progress.

1114
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:08,580
So of course the test that I think now I've come in twice since then.

1115
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:09,540
Twice, yeah.

1116
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,500
Yeah. I psyched myself up a bit and I'm like, I'm nervous and

1117
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,220
get all into it. But fortunately I've done well.

1118
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:22,900
But is that true, Richard? I mean, do we really think like, I guess, do we know that

1119
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:32,260
that the cognitive test reflected her change in effort around the preventative measures or is it

1120
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:37,540
confounded by the fact that she was having a very, very stressful, distracted day, even though both

1121
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:40,820
of those are true, is the test really able to distinguish those things?

1122
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:45,460
And I mean, my blood work wasn't great that day either, but I'll let Richard answer.

1123
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:49,300
Yeah. You know, it's, it's really interesting. And I have the whole trajectory here. I mean,

1124
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:54,260
this is worth its weight in gold, like all these, all this decessed. Now let me take a step back and

1125
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:59,620
talk about cognitive assessments. Now, when we do a cognitive battery related to Alzheimer's

1126
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:03,860
prevention, we use something, it's a modified form of the Alzheimer's prevention cognitive

1127
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:08,580
composite. These are mostly computer-based tests, the NIH toolbox, as well as other kind of

1128
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:14,180
traditional tests that people with mild cognitive complaints kind of come in and intake, but we use

1129
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:21,780
it a battery that is sensitive to detect changes in brain function before symptoms and different

1130
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:30,020
cognitive domains or different cognitive areas are related to Alzheimer's disease pathology,

1131
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:35,460
as well as other things like vascular pathology, vascular cognitive decline, or age-related

1132
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:41,300
cognitive decline. So I'm not going to portend that our cognitive assessment battery is anywhere

1133
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:45,540
close to perfect. It is as good as cognitive testing can be because people can have good days

1134
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:49,860
and bad days. But it's funny, Lauren, like you, I remember you that day. That was all, that was a

1135
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:54,500
whole day. Didn't we do a video shoot that day with, well, that was the day you, you, you filmed

1136
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,660
Seth and I went for other blood work and then I just was in such a state. I couldn't even stay.

1137
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:03,140
Oh my what a, that's right. That's right. I remember that day. My in-laws are with us.

1138
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:10,740
Yeah. That was a lot. Yeah. That was a whole, that was a whole day. So I guess what I would say is

1139
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:17,300
there are certain, when someone doesn't sleep well, then the thing that I would expect to have

1140
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:22,500
a bad effect on cognitive testing that day would be related to processing speed and attention.

1141
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:30,340
When someone has, let's just say early Alzheimer's before symptoms, I'm more paying attention to

1142
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:37,060
certain types of memory tasks, certain types of naming tasks. When someone has vascular risk

1143
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:42,260
factors, I'm, I'm more concerned with how are they doing an executive function measures.

1144
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:48,820
So when I see homocysteine and vitamin D and, and the cholesterol, I correlate that or I, I,

1145
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:56,260
I associate that in my brain with different cognitive domains. So this is hard to explain,

1146
01:45:56,260 --> 01:46:02,500
but like Lauren, you felt like you did bad that day because maybe emotionally you were whatever,

1147
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:08,100
but looking back on it, if you take that into consideration, it made sense that you were having

1148
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:14,580
a stressful day. However, in the next couple of years, when I think I may have scared you,

1149
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:19,860
because I got upset. I mean, I was concerned. I think you saw the concern. I think, I think

1150
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:24,820
Seth was dead. Yeah. I mean, my, my in-laws were there. They were concerned. Yeah. I mean,

1151
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:28,020
I didn't know what I was going to call your brother. Like what do I do? Like I was, you know,

1152
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,740
I didn't want to involve other people with HIPAA and all that kind of stuff. But I was like,

1153
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:35,460
how do I address this? And I just said, I'm sorry you're having a crappy day, but here's the deal.

1154
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:40,740
Like this is, this is what's going on. And I'll be frank. I was getting worried. Things weren't

1155
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:43,540
going in the right direction. You were doing good and then bad and then good and then bad.

1156
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:48,820
And then your cruise ship situation and then the stress. And I said, Lauren, I'm sorry. It's got to

1157
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:53,220
change now. And I think maybe that's when we got Peter involved or maybe a little before that.

1158
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,660
We hadn't sat down with Peter. We'd been talking about Peter.

1159
01:46:56,660 --> 01:47:02,420
Yeah, that's right. So all I can say is in the, in the two plus years, whatever, since that time,

1160
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:07,460
Peter, I know you've, you've been cautious about cognitive tests because of the variability,

1161
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:13,860
the imprecise nature. And I agree with that, but you can't fake Lauren, your last set of cognitive

1162
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:21,300
tests. You can't fake this. You have optimized your cognitive function in my opinion, period.

1163
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:26,340
Like no discussion. You said there's an element of practice effects. Now I totally agree with that.

1164
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:30,260
There are certain tests because I have a, because I have a four that doesn't help me.

1165
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:34,820
Wow. Look at you little in psych. I can learn.

1166
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:36,340
That's higher order processing.

1167
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:42,580
Dr. Miller Rogan, you're learning. Good job. Correct. EPOE fours are more resistant to practice

1168
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:46,900
effects and also men's brains and women's brains have different strengths and weaknesses, for

1169
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:53,060
example, verbal memory. So when we really digest your trajectory of cognitive function over the

1170
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:57,700
last several years, I'm going to be honest. I don't know that I've really talked about this

1171
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:03,140
too much in public or on the recording, but your brain is functioning. And I, again, you can take

1172
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:07,700
all the practice effects you want. There are certain tests here that I believe are resistant

1173
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:10,740
enough. And it's not like you're taking these every day. You're taking these like every,

1174
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:15,700
you know, six to 12 months and we change it up. We change the versions and stuff like that. So

1175
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:22,020
you have a plateau at some point with the practice effects, but your brain is absolutely without a

1176
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:28,740
doubt, hands down, I have visual proof. Your brain and biomarkers, your blood-based biomarkers,

1177
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:35,220
you're optimized, you're different. Your brain is firing on more cylinders. Like you can even just,

1178
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:40,420
let's just say we'll average out the first three sessions, right? I mean, there's just no compare.

1179
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:46,660
You're more than a standard deviation above normal. Like you've improved, like your processing

1180
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:52,660
My brain is above normal. I know. Yeah. Well, no, I mean, it's interesting because I really want to

1181
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:56,980
see if you feel anything, but can you tell the difference? But the most important test that we

1182
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:01,220
do for age related cognitive decline, you're, you're several years older and I know you're

1183
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:05,620
30 something to 30 something big deal. Well, no, the brain ages in that, in that timeframe.

1184
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:12,980
Your brain is younger now than it was five years ago. Like you're greater than 90th percentile on

1185
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:17,300
all these different tests. Your, you know, your memory function is a standard deviation above the

1186
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:24,020
mean. And when you started out it like was 0.87 standard deviations below the mean. Yeah. I mean,

1187
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:30,820
I remember this Lauren, because I, our very first meeting was at Cornell and we were going over your

1188
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:36,900
results. And I remember we were kind of looking for an explanation for how it could have been so poor.

1189
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:43,220
And the best explanation that you came up with, which frankly, I thought was a viable one was

1190
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:47,220
you said, look, I did well in school, but I did poorly on standardized tests.

1191
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:56,420
And is it possible that my cognitive score is low because I'm not a good standardized test taker.

1192
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:03,220
So it's been very exciting to watch this progression. One element of the standardized

1193
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:10,500
test I want to ask you about Richard is odor. You put another one of our patients through this test

1194
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:19,540
recently. And I was very surprised to learn. So he came back. Is it 10, nine, nine item test, nine.

1195
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:26,740
And in this case, the patient correctly identified eight. And I remember thinking, oh, that's awesome.

1196
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:33,460
And you were like, if it had been seven, I would have been really concerned. And with eight, it was

1197
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:39,700
we're going to do a retest. Why is odor identification so important in this disease?

1198
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:44,580
Yeah, I mean, there's so much subjectivity to cognitive assessments. You could be sleep

1199
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:49,140
deprived. You could be like, you know, distracted by I don't know, you forgot to silence your cell

1200
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:53,620
phone. You could I don't know, it's warm in the room or cold in the room. And Lauren's always

1201
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,980
freezing. So, you know, we got to get the temperature just right for Lauren up. Lauren's

1202
01:50:56,980 --> 01:51:01,460
coming, you know, regulate the temperature. You don't do that. No, I'm kidding. And then

1203
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:07,060
sets coming all change the temperature, change the thermostat. No, as we get older, we change.

1204
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:11,300
Now he's the cold one. And I'm the hot one. I know I've been huddling during this because the

1205
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:15,860
air is low. But no, it's that's honestly, it's the funniest thing. The older he gets, the colder he

1206
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:21,940
is and the hotter I am. And of course, it used to be different. Anyway, fascinating. So odor is more

1207
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:28,100
objective rather than subjective and odor identification. Like what is that? Well,

1208
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:33,860
it's your ability to recognize a smell and name one of this. And again, in med school,

1209
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:37,860
decreased odor identification. The first thing I thought of was Parkinson's disease.

1210
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:41,380
That's something that's that's common in preclinical Parkinson's. So before someone

1211
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:47,140
gets the tremor and the slow movements and the shuffling gate, meaning the walking is slow and

1212
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:53,540
the rigidity odor identification loss of smell is something that can be a harbinger of badness

1213
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:58,500
for a neurodegenerative disease to come. Well, the studies have shown that loss of smell or lack of

1214
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:03,860
the ability to precisely identify certain smells can be a harbinger of Alzheimer's disease as well.

1215
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:11,060
My mom had a very poor sense of smell and not an amazing sense of taste either. But sense of smell

1216
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:15,540
was she never had a good sense of smell. That's impactful. With COVID, I mean,

1217
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:18,500
it's a different thing. Like, you know, and Peter, you know, you and I talked about this, but

1218
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:24,100
I lost my smell for five, six weeks, which is a little bit longer than than some people. And we

1219
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:30,500
can talk about has your smell returned back to normal. So I'm seven months out now. And, you know,

1220
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:35,060
just for folks know what we're talking about. You had a pretty good case of COVID. I did. Yeah. I had

1221
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:39,220
one of these cases where, oh, I'm fine. Three, four or five days later, I'm like, you know,

1222
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:42,900
okay, cool. I'll exercise tomorrow. And then on day nine, 10, I went through

1223
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:48,820
with my O2 sat dropping and all that stuff. And I'm Peter help and Paul help. And what the heck

1224
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:53,140
I called every doctor in my Rolodex. Um, did an EKG on myself in my office at midnight,

1225
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:58,660
because I wanted to stay the heck out of the ER. My O2 sat was 94 PTSD time, but they wouldn't

1226
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:02,900
have admitted me because it was above 90. But anyway, I had a pretty reasonable case of COVID

1227
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:08,980
and my smell after five weeks started to come back. I mean, like ahead of a thing of bleach,

1228
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:14,180
I smelled nothing. I mean, like zero. I'm like real smell sensitive. Then I had phantom smells

1229
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:20,100
for a while. I was like, Oh, the dog peed. Uh, oh, Bon Bon Kitty. My dog's name is Kitty.

1230
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,340
How's Zelda doing, by the way? Well, honestly, I've been worried a few. I don't know if you saw me.

1231
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:29,860
I was checking to see if my microphone has picked up her snoring. Oh, it's right across me. And she

1232
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:35,460
has been snoring so loud this whole time. So if anyone has heard that it's, it's just Zelda. Oh,

1233
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:40,740
no, it's golden. Yeah. Bon Bon had his second snoring surgery, but he's great now. He's awesome.

1234
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:45,380
King Charles Cavalier fan club of America we're talking to right here. Anyway, so I had phantom

1235
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:49,460
smells and then my smell is basically back, but I'm like a little smell sensitive. Can't,

1236
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:54,740
can't explain it so that this COVID may change our ability to use smell sensitivity for Alzheimer's

1237
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:58,740
related testing. But anyway, we'll cross that bridge later. Sorry for the tangent. What about,

1238
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:05,140
what about hearing? Because you see these reports from time to time that say we've got to get more

1239
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:09,860
aggressive with hearing aids in people. The moment a person has even the slightest amount

1240
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:16,580
of hearing deterioration, we've got to correct it. The implication being that hearing loss will have

1241
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:24,740
a causative role in Alzheimer's disease such that correction of it can delay or prevent versus just

1242
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:30,500
the obvious correlation between hearing loss and dementia given the obvious age association. What's

1243
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,420
your thought on that? Yeah, I don't, I don't know that I have a perfect answer, but hearing loss

1244
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:38,740
when they've done the studies, the Lancet commission 2020 report came out and basically

1245
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:45,780
show that hearing loss is like the most impactful, modifiable risk factor that they found in their

1246
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:52,740
study, which is like striking, like a huge number of cases of dementia could be potentially reduced

1247
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:58,020
if a person gets early recognition of hearing impairment and gets it addressed. Now, why is

1248
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:03,220
sorry, why is that? Yeah, this is confusing. And this is a quote unquote new risk factor. I mean,

1249
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:08,420
it's been around for the evidence has been emerging for years now, but I don't know. Is

1250
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:12,980
it because you're I hate to say I'm not an expert in this at all, but you're just you disengage,

1251
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:17,380
you can't hear, you kind of you're in your own little world, you have you miss social cues,

1252
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:22,100
you have different interaction levels. I actually don't know the answer to this. And this the

1253
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:26,340
classic line, we need more research to truly be able to figure this out. I mean, I feel like it's

1254
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:32,820
one of those things, Richard, that we because we're constantly updating our protocol. And

1255
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:38,900
I've been thinking for about the past three months, do we need to now take those high risk

1256
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:45,140
patients that we described and say, everyone's got to go to an audiologist. And of course,

1257
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:49,780
the implication is you're going to get people in their 30s and 40s that have low, low, low

1258
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:53,940
grade hearing loss. Are they actually going to want to wear hearing aids or is it just going to

1259
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:59,620
be, hey, we're going to use more noise cancellation stuff and sort of try to protect hearing longer.

1260
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:04,980
But I'm curious as to this. It also strikes me that from the precautionary principle,

1261
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:10,580
there's no downside to protecting your hearing. And as much as one can do that, I don't see a

1262
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:16,660
downside to it. I think we, meaning doctors need to do a little bit of say a better job. Doctors

1263
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:22,500
have it really hard. So this is not doctor's fault. It's like our medical system is in disarray

1264
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:27,300
and broken beyond. I have no idea how to fix it with 10 minutes or 15 minutes per patient. I have

1265
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:32,740
lots of empathy for tremendous empathy for physicians working out there, but in the trenches,

1266
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:36,980
but hearing screening, I think is something that should be part of at some age, at some point,

1267
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:41,860
an evaluation. Real briefly, though, I want to go back to Lauren's odor identification. So

1268
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:46,020
this is a weird comment. And I've never really also said this on a recording, but

1269
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:51,540
Lauren, this is not the first time that I've seen patients that have really firing on all cylinders

1270
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:57,060
done 23 of the 25 things we told you to do, like compliance out to wazoo 10 out of 10.

1271
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:02,420
Your odor identification, this is weird. And this may be a red herring, completely random or whatever.

1272
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:10,660
Your odor identification has improved. I think it's because, and maybe this goes again, goes

1273
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:14,740
against my four. It's because now I know the difference in the cards between the coffee and

1274
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:20,420
the gasoline smell, which used to really throw me off. Gotcha. Okay. So even with an objective test,

1275
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:24,900
we still have subjectivity with learning effects and stuff like that. Now, when I smell it, I'm

1276
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:30,180
like, okay, really be sure, is this the coffee or the gas? All the other ones are easy, but between

1277
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:34,500
those two, those always trip me up. Gotcha. Interesting. You know, just to get back to one

1278
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:38,820
thing, Lauren, yes, I have objective data, but you know, data is only as good as data is. And

1279
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:43,300
all of our tests are imprecise. And Peter and I talk about this a lot. Sure. Your calculated

1280
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:48,340
cardiovascular risk when we put all your numbers in a calculator, much lower. Your calculated

1281
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:53,700
Alzheimer's risk based on the different scales, much lower. Like we're doing a great job. Like in

1282
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:58,500
terms of living longer. Yeah. Not gonna would. Yeah. We are really, we're really doing well.

1283
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:06,340
Do you feel anything different in your brain or not so much? And just be honest. No, no. And,

1284
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:11,380
you know, and I don't, I don't know how much we want to get into any of this, but I'm on my own

1285
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:17,300
hormonal journey and often wonder, you know, if that plays a part in it. I, I've always been

1286
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:22,420
someone who's enjoyed sleep. We kind of talked about that and like, you know, I like sleep and I,

1287
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:30,340
I can, I love a nap as I get older and my hormones become bigger players in my health.

1288
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:37,940
I sometimes think that has to do with it, but overall, do I feel cognitively better? It's hard

1289
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:46,580
to say, but physically I feel better. My overall health is, I can tell that it's better from a

1290
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:55,860
total body energy. The way I can approach a situation, I feel like I have a different type

1291
01:58:55,860 --> 01:59:04,340
of body energy. If that makes any sense, cognitively, you know, knock on wood. I fortunately feel like

1292
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:10,980
someone who is pretty in control of their cognition most of the time. So, you know, do I have moments?

1293
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:16,580
Yes. Where I'm like, I feel tired or weird, or even that, you know, like you said, that brain fog,

1294
01:59:16,580 --> 01:59:21,460
which I don't think I understand at this point, but the black and white answer is yes, I feel

1295
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:26,180
better. Do I feel greatly better? I'm not sure. I mean, to me, I think there's an emotional piece

1296
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:32,020
here too, right? Which is we go back to 10 years ago, there's this depression that basically

1297
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:38,740
feels like there's something inevitable that's going to happen to you. And I think you know,

1298
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:45,860
by now, Richard and I are very much in the camp of saying there's no reason to believe you're going

1299
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:51,940
to get Alzheimer's disease. Yeah. Like there's really no reason to believe that. If you stay this

1300
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:58,820
course that you're on, you get to be like normal people in their 80s. So maybe that's the greatest

1301
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:04,740
single benefit of all this, is that it changes the way you feel. I wasn't physically in such

1302
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:11,060
rough shape that I could really pinpoint a difference, but emotionally, yes, so much of the

1303
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:19,060
fear has dissipated because I have control in a way that I didn't before. I see my blood work,

1304
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:26,420
you know, I see numbers going from red to green. And that gives me a hope that, you know, I think

1305
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:32,420
translates into my physical being, but also into my cognitive health as well. I don't want us to

1306
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:36,980
close without talking a little bit about hilarity for charity, which we started talking about a

1307
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:42,500
little bit, but I would bring us up to speed on specifically what the mission is, how you decided

1308
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:47,380
to pick the lane that you guys are going to be in. You know, we touched on this a little bit before,

1309
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:54,580
but I have been so fortunate in my terrible journey. I think I've had the best situation of

1310
02:00:54,580 --> 02:01:00,500
a horror show that could happen with Alzheimer's and that one, my family was able to afford care

1311
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:07,620
for my mom. And that too, I have, because of my relationships and the advocate that I've become,

1312
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:13,140
I have met smart people like you guys who have helped me take control of my brain health. And so

1313
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:22,420
HFC, what we've done with that is try to help other people be at least a part of that situation. And

1314
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:28,100
so I like to think of HFC as sort of like, this is our non-official, you know, mission statement,

1315
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:34,100
which is like, we're here for your brain today and tomorrow. Meaning that, you know, we're here for

1316
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:40,580
people today through care, through our numerous support groups, which are personalized and which

1317
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:46,100
we really take the time to connect people to people who would understand their situation.

1318
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:51,060
Early on, I went to a support group where, you know, I was like 26 and upset about my mom. And

1319
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:55,700
there was a guy there who was like 56 and who was upset about his mom. And not that I didn't feel

1320
02:01:55,700 --> 02:02:00,340
bad for this person, but also like, I did not feel bad for this person, you know, because I was

1321
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:08,980
like, you're 56. You have your mom at 56. Like I'm 26. And so, you know, we really try to recognize

1322
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:14,660
that in our care, we put people together who would understand a situation. And of course,

1323
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:19,220
then there is the other aspect of it, which is, I think what makes the greatest impact in people's

1324
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:23,060
lives today, which is our care program. You know, like I said, my family could afford

1325
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:28,420
care for my mom so that my dad could catch his breath and take a break and go to the grocery

1326
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:35,380
store if he needed or, you know, come have dinner with me if he wanted. And so many people are with

1327
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:44,660
their loved one 24 seven without a break, without relief. And that is a completely

1328
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:51,620
thankless job. And so we provide care for people and provide caregivers to go into people's homes

1329
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:58,180
and give the primary caregiver respite, give them a break. And then there's, of course, how we

1330
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:05,220
invest our dollars in research, which is in brain health. HFC really focuses on activating young

1331
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:10,580
people in the fight against Alzheimer's. We don't think that people should wait till they're older

1332
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,820
to start talking about their stories or losing loved ones to Alzheimer's. And they certainly

1333
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:19,780
shouldn't wait, as we've talked about today, to start taking care of their brains. And so we

1334
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:27,140
really do our best to share what we've learned from you guys and educate people that it is never

1335
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:33,860
too early to start taking care of your brain and how important that is. That's really our focus.

1336
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:41,060
I wish that we raised the kind of money that would research a medication that could cure Alzheimer's,

1337
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:46,820
but no one has yet given us five billion dollars. I'm out here ready to receive it if someone is

1338
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:52,260
listening and wants to send it our way. But for now, I'm going to do what is practical, which is

1339
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:59,860
help people today with support and care and teach people how to take care of their brains for

1340
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:06,500
tomorrow. So that's who we are. So people can go to the website. They can obviously donate directly.

1341
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:11,460
Is there any other way people can get involved or be a part? I mean, there are all sorts of events.

1342
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:16,580
Yeah. What else can people do? Yeah. I mean, obviously, this year, the event thing has sort of

1343
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:22,740
taken a turn for all of us and all nonprofits, I think, are feeling the strain of not being able

1344
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:28,180
to host our normal fundraising events. And in the strain of that, a lot of philanthropists who

1345
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:34,180
normally would donate our way feel that they can't this year because they are donating towards

1346
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:40,660
COVID-related organizations or even racial organizations, which please keep donating.

1347
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:44,100
These things are very important. I'm not saying you shouldn't, but at the same time,

1348
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:48,180
people still have brains. And unfortunately, there are still millions of people in this

1349
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:54,740
country with Alzheimer's and their caregivers are in even worse situations now. So what we do is

1350
02:04:54,740 --> 02:05:00,900
even more important these days. So yeah, you can go to our website and of course, give us your

1351
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:06,500
hard-earned dollars. We're happy to do something good with them. But we also give people a space to

1352
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:11,540
share their story if they have one. We provide infrastructure if you want to throw your own

1353
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:17,060
Alzheimer's fundraiser. We've had so many amazing individuals over the years who have done their

1354
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:23,060
own fundraisers for whatever speaks to them. One of my favorites is a guy like drove, would you say,

1355
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:28,500
a tuk tuk? Do you say drove a tuk tuk? I guess so. Road one, whatever. Pulled one across India and

1356
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:33,700
raised money for HFC. How cool. But that's what spoke to him. That was organic to him. And Seth

1357
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:37,780
and I always say when it comes to fundraising or philanthropy, like do what's organic to you,

1358
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:42,340
what makes sense for your life. So we provide an infrastructure if you want to raise money for us.

1359
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:47,140
We're happy to help you do it. You know, again, if you need support, you can come to us. We have

1360
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:51,540
so many different options. We have an amazing partnership with the Rosalind Carter Institute

1361
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:56,740
in which we train caregivers. We give them one-on-one caregiving training, which is really,

1362
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:01,540
I think, so invaluable. I mean, the truth is there's no training to be a caregiver. It's

1363
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:06,660
every day is a surprise and who knows, but there are certain tools that we can give people. And

1364
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:11,220
you know, and I think we try to do it all in a way that is approachable. Certainly, you know,

1365
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:15,220
our original name is Hilarity for Charity. Now we're HFC because we want to seem like grownups

1366
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:19,940
and we want people to take us seriously. But we approach everything through a way that, you know,

1367
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:27,460
has some comedy that is certainly our work. But we often say Alzheimer's is so devastating and

1368
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:32,100
it is so sad and people don't want to hear about it. So we'll tell them some jokes and trick them

1369
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:36,980
into laughing. And then all of a sudden we hit them with the facts and tell them how important it is.

1370
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:43,700
And we rope them in that way. I think overall, we're just trying to provide people the hope that

1371
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:50,020
I have found over the years. You know, we started this podcast talking about my dark, devastating

1372
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:56,020
times and like, that's not who I am anymore. And that's not my vision about all of this anymore.

1373
02:06:56,020 --> 02:07:01,460
And I think there is so much control that can be had that we did not have even just a few years ago.

1374
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:06,020
And you know, we through HFC are just trying to teach people that they have that control too.

1375
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:12,980
Well, Lauren, Richard, it has been such a pleasure to sit down with you guys today. And it has been

1376
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:20,260
worth every bit of the wait from almost a year ago when we wanted to first do this. And no one would

1377
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:24,900
have imagined a year ago all that was going to happen in the next 12 months. But it's also,

1378
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:31,540
it's also given us a chance to see one more year of your incredible progress, Lauren. So thanks

1379
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:36,980
for being the poster child for what Alzheimer's prevention looks like. Well, we're trying. It's a

1380
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:41,220
journey, right? I don't know if I can be the poster child yet, but maybe in some time we'll see if,

1381
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:45,140
I think, you know, we'll keep going. No pressure. There's poster trial for the journey.

1382
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:50,340
There you go. Well, hey, if we would have done this podcast a year ago, I could have only said

1383
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:55,380
one out of every three cases of Alzheimer's is preventable. But now based on the latest data,

1384
02:07:55,380 --> 02:08:01,300
four out of 10 cases of Alzheimer's may be preventable if that person does everything right.

1385
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:04,420
So I'm going to have to change the signature in my email.

1386
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:04,900
I'm sorry.

1387
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:05,860
Is what you're saying to me.

1388
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:07,860
Who wrote that signature? Jeez.

1389
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:10,100
Someone wrote that signature. I don't know who it was.

1390
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:12,340
Unbelievable. I have typos everywhere.

1391
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:19,060
Fired. Peter, thanks for sharing our story. And Lauren, thank you for being courageous. And

1392
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:22,740
you're the one that puts, I mean, I get to sit here at this desk and hang out and like, you know,

1393
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:26,980
whatever. And you actually have to go home and do all the 27 things that Peter and I tell you to do.

1394
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:30,820
So thanks for being a good sport. You do your own things.

1395
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:31,940
Yeah. Got to do what you got to do.

1396
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:37,220
Yeah. And we're really grateful to your family for also feeling that it's been okay for you to

1397
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:41,300
talk about this because I know that these are things people don't want to talk about. And yet,

1398
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:47,140
I think the understanding that, hey, we talk about these things that suck because it makes a

1399
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:50,660
difference because there's a lot of people that are listening to this right now that can relate

1400
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:56,900
to what you're saying. Yeah, I hope so. Well, there's so much that can be done. So I appreciate

1401
02:08:56,900 --> 02:09:01,300
the chance to talk about it. All right, guys. Thanks so much. Thanks so much.

1402
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:05,380
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1403
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:09,780
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

1404
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:15,220
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

1405
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:20,420
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

1406
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:26,020
bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

1407
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:31,140
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

1408
02:09:31,140 --> 02:09:36,500
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1409
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:42,260
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1410
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:47,620
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release

1411
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:52,020
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1412
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:57,380
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1413
02:09:57,380 --> 02:10:02,900
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1414
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:07,460
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1415
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:12,100
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member only benefits,
