00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,400

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,340
Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Peter Attia drive.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,000
This week I have the privilege of interviewing a good friend, a collaborator, and an all

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,080
around interesting dude named Richard Isaacson.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,520
Richard is a neurologist who specializes in Alzheimer's disease.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,640
He is the director of the Alzheimer's prevention clinic at Cornell here in New York City.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,320
His life has been touched by Alzheimer's disease and from a very early age, as Richard describes,

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
he felt a calling to go into neurology.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,280
It is clearly his life's work.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,360
He's an absolute expert in Alzheimer's disease, but specifically has chosen to focus his efforts

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,760
on the prevention of Alzheimer's disease as opposed to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,560
And actually this puts him in the minority of neurologists.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,680
Professionally, as I said, he's an associate professor of neurology at Cornell Medical

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,440
College here in the city.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,100
He's also an attending neurologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,640
He grew up not too far from here in Long Island or thereabouts.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,160
And actually one of my favorite little tidbits I learned about him is he went to a high school

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,280
called Connick High School and he was recently named among the most distinguished alumni.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,120
So his photo now hangs alongside fellow recipients, Rosie O'Donnell and Bob Costas.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
So that's pretty impressive.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
He's a little bit of a doogie-howser.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,080
Started college at 17, finished medical school at 23.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,720
So as I think I point out in the podcast, he finished medical school before I actually

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,040
started medical school.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,400
Did his internship in Miami before ultimately doing his training at Beth Israel and Harvard.

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Ultimately he has wound his way back to New York.

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,200
And as we get into great detail in this podcast about what his work is, and I think more importantly,

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,240
how it can help people listening to this or their loved ones.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,000
And also I think we, I think are very open about the limitations in this space and what

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
we do and don't know.

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Richard has developed, and I should say Richard and his team, let's be honest, like all great

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,440
people, they're sort of surrounded by a team of great people.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,760
They've developed something called ALZU.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,640
So that's www.alzletteru.org, which might be one of the single most important resources

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
for people with Alzheimer's disease or early cognitive impairment and their family members.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,600
So we'll obviously link to that very prominently, but I think that's something that will, if

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,440
you take nothing else from this podcast, other than a sort of visit to ALZU.org, that would

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,880
be terrific.

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,280
Richard and I get into a lot of stuff.

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
I think this podcast probably runs about two and a half hours.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,200
And we talk at the initial part, by the way, we get into something that was not at all

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
planned.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,520
But when Richard came over, I don't think at all the time I've known Richard, which

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,700
has been about three and a half or four years, I didn't notice how much he was into like

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,500
bling phones.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,620
And when he whipped his phone out, I just couldn't stop laughing.

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,560
So the first like 10 minutes of this podcast are us talking about this ridiculous thing

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,500
that I hope we have pictures of to link to in the show notes.

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,980
Obviously the show notes are usually timestamped, so you can skip past the patty cakes and get

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,800
to the meat of the discussion should you want.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,100
But that said, I can't highly enough recommend listening to Richard talk about his slot machine

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,820
addiction and his funny phones.

62
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,740
We talk about the etiology of Alzheimer's to the best of our ability to understand it.

63
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,260
We talk about the incidence prevalence and the distinction between those two.

64
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,780
We talk quite a bit about the distinction between men and women.

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,040
As some of you may know, there seems to be a bias towards women getting Alzheimer's disease

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,500
more commonly than men.

67
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,620
And both Richard and I agree that that's probably not just an artifact of women living longer.

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,220
There must be something else going on there.

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,940
And we explore that topic.

70
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,660
We go into great detail about what we believe the state of the evidence is, which admittedly

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,940
at this point is still relatively early about what steps people can take to reduce their

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,780
risk of Alzheimer's disease.

73
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,660
And we get really into the semantics of this.

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,620
What is the difference between risk reduction and prevention?

75
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,660
And we talk all about the politics of that and how those have changed.

76
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,940
We give, when I say we, meaning I discuss with Richard and Richard gives a great overview

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,960
and primer on APOE.

78
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,480
We've had a lot of questions on APOE and we've deliberately punted those from the AMA

79
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
because I knew that this discussion with Richard was coming up.

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,280
So for many of you to have questions about the APOE gene, I think you'll find that interesting.

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,080
And I'll tell you something that I learned even in this discussion was so much of the

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,200
subtlety around other genes that are named and unnamed at this point are SNPs that we

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,920
know about versus don't know about that also seem to be predisposing to Alzheimer's disease.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,760
Unfortunately, this is a disease that is going to touch pretty much everybody who's

85
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,480
going to listen to this podcast indirectly or directly.

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,040
In other words, if you're listening to this, there's a non-trivial chance that you already

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,880
know somebody who's afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,560
And tragically, there's an even greater likelihood that at some point you will, whether it be

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,680
a parent, a loved one, or a friend or something like that.

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:40,800
So I'm relatively unabashed in my praise for Richard's work and I'm relatively shameless

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,680
in my plugging for people to fund this type of research.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
The type of research that Richard does is relatively unsexy.

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,880
People don't really know what to do with clinical research that is focused on Alzheimer's prevention

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,280
and probably somewhere in the vicinity of like 10 basis points worth of resources, meaning

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,240
like one tenth of one percent of resources are going into funding this type of work.

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,480
And after this podcast, Richard and I went out for dinner and we talked about a gift

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,640
that a patient of mine gave Richard.

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,320
It was about a $50,000 gift or a $40,000 gift, which is obviously a lot of money, but in

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,400
the grand scheme of the types of dollars that people are pouring into this research, it's

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
not that much.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,520
And Richard was able to walk me through what came of that gift from that particular patient.

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,080
And I was so blown away that I came home from dinner and I actually emailed him to tell

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,560
him the impact of his actual dollars.

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,280
And I will say this, having spent a lot of my time around biomedical research, it is

105
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,800
very rare that a $40,000 gift can move the needle.

106
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,080
So if anybody is listening to this and they do feel touched and compelled to get involved

107
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
in this space, whether it just be through the standpoint of education and understanding

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,720
or through funding research, I think Richard's team at Cornell is doing exceptional work.

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,400
So finally, I'll just close by saying a couple of housekeeping things.

110
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,680
One, there's a weekly email that has grown immensely in popularity.

111
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,600
So I want to make sure that people who are interested in receiving such an email know

112
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
about it.

113
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
I sign up for it on the site.

114
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,280
Every Sunday morning, I shoot out an email that kind of highlights things that are interesting

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,600
to me over the course of the week.

116
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,320
I promise to do my best to make it not lame such that it's actually an email worth receiving.

117
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,960
Remember on the show notes for this podcast and every podcast are always found on our

118
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,120
website and we put an unbelievable amount of time into that.

119
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
In fact, more time goes into that than goes into the podcast.

120
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,560
The podcast, you know, two and a half hour discussion, I might spend two hours preparing

121
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
for it.

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,040
And then Travis, two of our analysts spend double digit hours preparing those show notes

123
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,000
and the feedback has been excellent.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
So for those of you that maybe aren't utilizing those, it might be something to consider.

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,800
And of course, if you do find this enjoyable, by all means, please go to Apple, leave a

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,680
nice review on iTunes and I guess you can leave a review if you don't like it as well,

127
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,500
but I won't push you quite as hard.

128
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,240
So without further ado, welcome to my interview with Dr. Richard Isaacson.

129
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,360
So Richard, thanks so much for coming over, man.

130
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Sure.

131
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Thanks for having me.

132
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
It's not a far walk, is it?

133
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Four minutes.

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Very well.

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
What do you think of the coaster I gave you?

136
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,640
I don't know if that was intentional, but we have someone with dementia pugilistica

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
on the coaster Muhammad Ali.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
My brother's a Parkinson specialist, so he would be the right one to talk to.

139
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,960
But yeah, amazing guy.

140
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,000
I gave him my Muhammad Ali coaster without even thinking about the implications of that.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,480
Serendipity or synchronicity, which one is that?

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Not sure.

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,120
Before we start this, I just learned something about you today that I have known you for

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
a while.

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
I thought I knew everything.

146
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,360
But as we were just getting ready to record, I was like, oh, by the way, let's just stick

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,200
our phones on airplane mode and you whip out your iPhone and you put on airplane mode.

148
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,280
And then you whipped out this white and gold diamond studded thing.

149
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,360
Can you tell our listeners what that thing was?

150
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,640
Well, I'm a very practical guy, so I collect luxury vintage cell phones.

151
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
It doesn't connect to the internet.

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,040
Every 75 text messages, the memory gets full, so I have to delete them all.

153
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
It's very practical.

154
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,080
Yeah, I collect vintage luxury cell phones.

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,760
The word collect implies you have more than just that white thing that's seven.

156
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Describe what it has on it.

157
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
Well, it's besides the alligator skin on the back.

158
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Sure.

159
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
It's white alligator.

160
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
It came from Africa.

161
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,120
It then went to Italy and then the skin was then shipped to the UK.

162
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,480
I had to get all the past or I had to go to the paperwork because it got stuck in customs

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,920
for fish and wildlife.

164
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,760
I had that phone in customs for like three or four weeks when I ordered it because they

165
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,840
couldn't verify that that wasn't an endangered species.

166
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
So they found all the paperwork.

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,200
Then I had to get the paper trail of where the fabric came from.

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,120
It's alligator, white alligator.

169
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,680
It was actually assembled though.

170
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,920
The phone was assembled in the UK and it's got white sapphire keys.

171
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,280
It's a pseudo blackberry.

172
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
It's actually a Nokia.

173
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,320
The Nokia is actually from 2008.

174
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
The phone was built in 2010.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,640
In 2010, this was the fattest phone on the market.

176
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
And that's PH fat.

177
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
PH fattest.

178
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
For the young people.

179
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
PH.

180
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Yes.

181
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
So we have white sapphire keys.

182
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,200
We have 18 karat gold trim, white alligator.

183
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,760
Of course, say that a few times.

184
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
Were you dating anyone at the time you got this?

185
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,400
You're very perceptive actually.

186
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
Wait, I didn't talk about the diamond.

187
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
It's called a diamond pillow.

188
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,440
Am I allowed to include a picture of this thing in the show notes?

189
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Absolutely.

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm looking at it as you're describing it and I can't freaking believe everything you're

191
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,320
saying except that I'm looking at it.

192
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,200
So I know that whoever is listening to this right now is thinking, what are these two clowns

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
talking about?

194
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
That they need to see this thing.

195
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,040
It's called like a diamond pillow.

196
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
Like that's what they marketed us.

197
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,280
But anyway, it's on airplane mode so I can keep it on the table.

198
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,200
No, I please keep it on the table because that thing is fantastic.

199
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

200
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Check this out.

201
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
The ringer is no joke.

202
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,760
I mean, I'm being recorded so you can like verify this, but the ringer for these phones

203
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,320
was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra specifically for this phone line.

204
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,400
I have to ask, how much did that cost in 2010 dollars?

205
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,360
In 2010, it was just over 25,000.

206
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,080
However, I got it in an auction on eBay.

207
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,520
Oh, no, you know what?

208
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,840
This one actually got ... So the company went out of business last year.

209
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
That's right and they were liquidated.

210
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,400
The company's a Vertu, V-E-R-T-U and the company went out of business last July.

211
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,320
They had a blowout auction sale, liquidation sale.

212
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,800
So I was the highest bidder.

213
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,200
Actually two people beat me, but then they'd never paid the money.

214
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,320
So long story short, I was the highest bidder.

215
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
I won the phone in September.

216
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,560
I didn't get it till January because of the customs and all the ...

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Oh, wait, wait.

218
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,920
So you didn't actually buy this in 2010?

219
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
Oh, couldn't afford it in 2010.

220
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Okay, okay.

221
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I was going to say because ...

222
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,880
But in 2011, I had a ex-girlfriend who was very ... that kind of whatever.

223
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,200
I went to Vegas and I won $1,600 in Vegas.

224
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,520
You were a huge slot machine guy, if I recall.

225
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,120
Yes, although when I first met you, Jay Walker burst my bubble and said, it's all luck and

226
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,600
random and I could have sworn it wasn't.

227
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,280
My uncle lived in Vegas, my grandfather lived in Vegas.

228
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,600
So he taught me the way of slot machines and I thought I'd beat slot machines until Jay

229
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,560
Walker that has like 700 slot machine randomization code passwords or patents basically said,

230
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,860
no, it's all luck.

231
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
He burst my bubble.

232
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
But anyway, I was in Vegas.

233
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
I like Vegas.

234
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,840
I go about every year, every other year and I won $1,600.

235
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,000
I was like, oh yeah, there's this luxury cell phone store and I'm going to go buy the phone

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,640
to impress the girl that I was hanging out with.

237
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,680
So we go and I put the phone and we take it out.

238
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,000
It was $8,600, not $1,600.

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,320
So I actually did buy one sticker price for $8,600.

240
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
That being said, I have-

241
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,360
And just to make sure I understand this, you walked in there with $1,600 in your pocket,

242
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,480
ready to give away your winnings because it's free money.

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,140
The guy whips it out, it's $8,600.

244
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,000
You can't back away now because the girl you're trying to impress, you have no idea how many

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,560
questions I want to ask you, but we will not end up talking about Alzheimer's disease or

246
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
dementia.

247
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,760
So just to summarize, you blew $8,600 in 2011 on a luxury phone.

248
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,280
You have since accumulated six more of them, including a retail $25,000 PIMP phone that

249
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,400
we're going to include a picture of that you got for hopefully a lot less than that.

250
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
You know what was the problem?

251
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,520
It was the shipping and the customs fees and all the-

252
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
This is a humanitarian crisis.

253
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
I mean, seriously.

254
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,400
I collected old Blackberries.

255
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
You?

256
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,080
Yeah, going back to like, remember the very first one, which was like a wedge that was

257
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
a pager?

258
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
So I just wanted one of every generation of Blackberry.

261
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Weird.

262
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,840
I didn't get blinged out ones.

263
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,400
I just wanted the regular one.

264
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,560
And I also collected Hewlett Packard calculators, all of the HPs.

265
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,200
Now, I never got some of the originals because those were just too out of my price range.

266
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
And I thought that was weird, but I got to tell you, this might be a bit weird.

267
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Well, here's-

268
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Now, there's anything wrong with that.

269
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Here's the deal though.

270
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,280
I've spent less than $12,000, $13,000 total because of the auctions and the deals and

271
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
whatever.

272
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,080
And I've traded in some, and then they once sent me a loaner and kept it because they

273
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
forgot they sent it to me.

274
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm not going to let them know that the business now, so they won't come after me.

275
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
But I actually-

276
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
So you think.

277
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
True.

278
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Good point.

279
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,440
So I actually have 80 something thousand dollars of cell phones that I've actually only paid

280
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,520
$13,000 for.

281
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,160
So no rhyme or reason to that.

282
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,480
You sound like me rationalizing the dumb shit I buy.

283
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,440
I have X thousands of dollars worth of Y that I only paid Z for, but Z is still probably-

284
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,600
Anyway, I'm not going to judge because I am the last guy that should be judging, but I

285
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
cannot wait to include a picture of that phone.

286
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,040
It's just hard to believe it exists.

287
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,960
It's like it was handmade and the signature is behind the battery.

288
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,720
The guy signed it in metal.

289
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,720
I can't believe we have been talking for six minutes and 55 seconds and we could talk for

290
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
another hour just about this.

291
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,520
That's how many more questions I have to probe your psyche.

292
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,200
The Ferrari one that I have, this is a good one too.

293
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,440
The Ferrari one actually, they stuck a recorder underneath a Ferrari in 2010 to record-

294
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
To record the sound?

295
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,080
The Ferrari is accelerating and that Ferrari is the ringer, the acceleration sound.

296
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,240
See that's one I could get into.

297
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,400
I might have to borrow that one.

298
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
It's beautiful.

299
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
That's like super bling.

300
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
It's got a red back hue.

301
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
You can see the red lights.

302
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,560
I didn't know such a market existed.

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,640
Well the company went out of business.

304
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,320
Needless to say it doesn't really exist.

305
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,720
Oh, and then there was the one, sorry, I'm sorry.

306
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,400
Then there was the one where I bought-

307
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
This is your show.

308
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,040
You can literally talk about whatever you want.

309
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,800
This is a great one because I bought, I got such a great deal online.

310
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,400
I couldn't figure it out and I get this phone.

311
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,120
I was so excited and it's all in Chinese.

312
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,560
So I would text my friends, family, just in Chinese, just then they wouldn't know what

313
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
I was saying.

314
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
I didn't know what I was saying.

315
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
That was a problem.

316
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,160
So when you say text, just randomly type characters.

317
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Yes.

318
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
And I was hysterical.

319
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,320
People were like, what are you talking about?

320
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm getting Chinese characters and I would reply in Chinese and that's a great phone.

321
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
It's on the shelf still, but that was a nice phone.

322
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Very inexpensive.

323
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh God, this is fantastic.

324
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,800
We might have to do a dedicated episode just on this stuff.

325
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I'll bring them on.

326
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
It's right down the block.

327
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,880
Okay, well, onto the Monday.

328
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,320
I was reading through something because we've known each other for several years now, but

329
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,960
there are like a bunch of things you just don't know about a person until you realize,

330
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,680
oh, you know, I'm going to sit down with Richard and talk with him.

331
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,480
I want to learn at least like five things about him that like tell me a little bit about

332
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,680
how he got to where he got.

333
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,560
And so I'm reading through this and the two things that I learned, well now three, given

334
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,640
this self, this bling phone thing, but the two things that I learned about you were you

335
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,500
had finished medical school before I had started medical school.

336
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,040
You finished med school at 23.

337
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,200
The other thing I learned about you is you were a rip roaring DJ DJ and recording producer.

338
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
My name was DJ rush.

339
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,600
I had a recording studio in my basement growing up with my bar mitzvah money.

340
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,720
Actually I took all the money and bought out this other guy's older guys, older recording

341
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
studio.

342
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,800
So I got like, again, it's all about value.

343
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,280
So I spent like three grand, which is a lot back then, huge amount of money, but it was

344
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,520
all of my bar mitzvah money, all the presents.

345
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,380
And I got like 12, $15,000 of recording equipment and magically I set up a recording studio

346
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,080
and I actually put an ad in the penny saver.

347
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm dating myself now.

348
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,280
I grew up in Suffolk County in Long Island in Comac and I put an ad in the penny saver

349
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,580
and people in Queens were my best customers because people in Queens would usually go

350
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,920
to the city and pay all this money for recording, but then they would come out East to Suffolk

351
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,280
County and that's how I made money in high school.

352
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Did that help you fund college or anything like that?

353
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,040
No, I was a computer tutor.

354
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,680
I had like 400 bucks in cash from computer tutoring for college that I got to use.

355
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
No I didn't.

356
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
You ended up spending that money.

357
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,000
You reinvested it.

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
You reinvested the recording.

359
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,800
In music equipment, random weird guitars shaped the NJ Warlock, like this weird looking guitar

360
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
thing.

361
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Yes, I like weird.

362
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It's not weird man.

363
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
It's beautiful.

364
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Appreciate it.

365
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Embrace it.

366
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,880
When you went to med school, did you know that you wanted to be a neurologist?

367
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Sort of.

368
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,320
If you don't think I'm a dork for collecting luxury vintage cell phones, this is even more

369
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,320
ridiculous, but I was in summer camp in sixth, seventh grade and we were teen travel and

370
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,440
we would go to like, I think we're on a trip to Tennessee actually and we're heading on

371
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,480
down to Nashville and on the bus I brought, I shouldn't giggle, but neuroanatomy made

372
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
easy and understandable.

373
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,360
It's like neuroanatomy for dummies.

374
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Exactly.

375
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Part of the same series.

376
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,400
Yep, that's exactly what it was and this is, I was in sixth, seventh grade.

377
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,000
My brother was a neurologist.

378
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Your brother's older?

379
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's older.

380
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He's 13 years older than me.

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
So he was finishing med school also at 23.

382
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,520
He did a six year program also.

383
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,760
I was 10.

384
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,720
So I got his hand me down books.

385
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,200
He would leave them in the room and I would, I guess, read them.

386
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,800
So I think I was interested in the brain, but I could never, even though I had this

387
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,680
book, I would read this book a hundred times.

388
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
I have no conception of neuroanatomy.

389
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,600
I just like, it's just like way over my head, even though I started studying it when I was

390
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
11.

391
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,180
So you guys are from an underachieving family.

392
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,900
You also had an uncle, I believe, that was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease when you

393
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
were quite young.

394
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Yeah.

395
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,740
So my uncle was diagnosed when I was in high school and I always knew I was going to be

396
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
a neurologist.

397
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,860
I didn't know exactly which area or which field.

398
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,380
I think the brain was interesting.

399
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,220
I also kind of chose neurology because it was the most challenging.

400
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,940
I wanted to be challenged for my career, but honestly, when I was in residency, I guess

401
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,580
I just felt a connection to older people.

402
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I didn't exactly have grandparents.

403
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,540
I only had a grandfather who passed away when I was eight.

404
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,180
I didn't meet any of my other grandparents.

405
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,980
They passed away before I was born and I don't know.

406
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,900
I just felt a connection to older people.

407
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
So that was part of it.

408
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,340
I guess I could have seen myself doing Parkinson's disease.

409
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,520
Actually in some ways the plan was to go to like a, as best of a residency as I could,

410
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,660
so I could then one day join my brother in practice, live in Florida, but I wasn't sure

411
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
about Parkinson's.

412
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I liked it.

413
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,820
I liked Alzheimer's also.

414
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,140
I like cognitive neurology.

415
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,940
I'm actually trained in Bethisual Deaconess Medical Center in Boston where cognitive neurology

416
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
really was born.

417
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,620
It's the first place in the United States.

418
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,620
A picture of Norman Gesch was in the conference room.

419
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,460
Long story short, I think cognitive neurology was always challenging and interesting, but

420
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,140
I didn't just want to do phenomenology like, Oh, look at this aphasia or look at this whatever.

421
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,740
I wanted to treat patients.

422
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,780
I think because I understood what it was like, Alzheimer's terrible.

423
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,340
It's just like a terrible, terrible, horrible disease.

424
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,220
I don't want to get emotional and upset, but it's just terrible.

425
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,300
My Uncle Bob introduced my parents.

426
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
It's number one.

427
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
That's why I'm here today.

428
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,980
This is a completely true story.

429
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
I was three.

430
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,380
My Uncle Bob was in the Navy and I was at my aunt Carol's house also among Island.

431
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
I jumped into the pool.

432
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,300
I sank to the bottom and everyone was inside.

433
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,700
My Uncle Bob ran out, jumped in and saved me.

434
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,340
To this day, I actually avoid water.

435
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
I hate swimming.

436
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,740
I hate, I don't go in the ocean.

437
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
I don't go in baths.

438
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,940
I mean, I stay away from water.

439
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
You were traumatized by that.

440
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Oh yeah.

441
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Oh yeah.

442
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,580
I can't even, I don't want to go near a pool.

443
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
I don't go in pools.

444
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,340
I don't like the feeling of water.

445
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,460
My Uncle Bob obviously was a special guy.

446
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
He was the life of the party.

447
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,740
That was like that relative where he was saying, what a party, like at all the weddings and

448
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
whatever.

449
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:35,820
So just to see someone like that become what he became and then just to see what the toll

450
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,780
took on his daughter and sons, it was just a terrible, horrible disease.

451
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,580
So I think I empathized with it.

452
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,740
I understood it and that's really where I chose to forge the career path.

453
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,420
I think it's so interesting how many people in medicine have a story about a moment that

454
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,500
either a moment or an interaction or a relationship that became so pointed in their decision

455
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,980
to enter medicine.

456
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,140
I don't think that's absolutely necessary.

457
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,500
I mean, I think many people enter medicine for sort of less specific or less tangible

458
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,140
reasons, but I'm always amazed by these stories.

459
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,300
So I appreciate you sharing that.

460
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,020
Let's fast forward a little bit and talk about you finished residency in Boston and then

461
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,180
did you come back to New York?

462
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
No.

463
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,100
So I actually left New York for longer than I was in New York.

464
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,460
I graduated at 17.

465
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,780
I spent six years in Kansas City.

466
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,380
This is a six year medical program.

467
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
And so I finished early.

468
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,180
This is how the way most other countries do it in Europe and in Asia.

469
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,940
But actually the unique part about our program was medical school from day one.

470
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,020
So I'm 17 years old, University of Missouri, Kansas City.

471
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,020
I have my lab coat and literally Tuesday and Thursday I was in the hospital and Monday,

472
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,260
Wednesday, Friday I was in college and it was a very unique blended program and I couldn't

473
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
ask for anything more.

474
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,060
I had literally six years of medical experience.

475
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,900
I was doing tons of medicine.

476
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,220
I was doing electives throughout the country, throughout the world.

477
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,580
I did a history of neurology tour throughout Europe for one of the elective months.

478
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,980
So I just got so much medicine exposure.

479
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,660
Usually medical students get two years of clinical medicine.

480
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,260
I had like six years intermittently of clinical medicine.

481
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
So I did that.

482
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,980
Then I popped over to Miami for a year to do medicine training and then to Boston for

483
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
three years.

484
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,380
And then I headed back to Miami.

485
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,420
My mom was down there.

486
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
My family's down there.

487
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,100
So I headed back down there and I was in Miami for eight and a half years.

488
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Was that how you met your fiance?

489
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Yep.

490
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
You got it in Miami.

491
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
And my band was playing.

492
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
She was in the front row.

493
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Wait, what do you play?

494
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I play bass.

495
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Okay.

496
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Because you grew up playing the cello.

497
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
That I knew.

498
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
I did.

499
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,900
I grew up playing the cello until I got in a fight with my orchestra teacher.

500
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,620
I told him to go F himself and that was the end of that.

501
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,100
He had this like complex that, you know, like I'm better than you because he was in a Maxwell

502
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
house commercial.

503
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,300
He was the conductor in the Maxwell house commercial and like, I don't know.

504
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Exactly.

505
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,940
He was the conductor in the Maxwell house commercial.

506
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,540
So like, you know, he was, his crap didn't stink.

507
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,180
So I just couldn't take it and I told him to F you and I walked out and.

508
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
What how old were you?

509
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
I was probably in 10th grade.

510
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Yeah.

511
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
10th grade.

512
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
So then I joined the band actually.

513
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,740
Is it easy to transition from cello to bass?

514
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,340
I didn't practice.

515
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
Didn't take a lot.

516
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,340
I took two lessons.

517
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
That's right.

518
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
I took two lessons and I just kind of.

519
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
But the fingering is similar.

520
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Yeah.

521
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
The frets through me actually.

522
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
The frets were hard.

523
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,540
So I actually got a fretless bass, joined a band with some of my friends and then actually

524
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,540
the guitarist and one of the bands I joined has been living on my couch for a year and

525
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
a half.

526
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
That's a whole nother story.

527
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,300
A lot of stories in your life.

528
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Yeah.

529
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,820
Keeping it simple, you know, exactly.

530
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,900
So play bass always been into music.

531
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,460
So you're the bass playing neurologist hipster in Miami.

532
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,460
Yeah.

533
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,140
Meet the blonde girls sitting in the club.

534
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,740
So yeah, I was wearing my Mexican wrestling mask and shirtless.

535
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
Yeah.

536
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
My band had this shtick.

537
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,780
We were called the regenerates music for the right brain and our logo was his brain, but

538
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,220
we had like the shtick where we played like anyway, long story short.

539
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,220
But yeah, so that video evidence of this, oh, we can link to all over Facebook.

540
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
Okay.

541
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
Very well.

542
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
The regenerates.

543
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,700
We have 99 likes on Facebook.

544
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,500
So Travis and Bob in preparing the follow up show notes for this will have a challenge

545
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,420
trying to just focus on some of the Alzheimer's stuff we talk about and limiting the bling

546
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,460
phones and band photos and videos to 10% of the total volume of show notes.

547
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Exactly.

548
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,780
The phone is called the virtue constellation.

549
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,500
Oh, we're going to be taking a picture.

550
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Okay.

551
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
After we talked, don't you worry.

552
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,340
I actually, nothing will be left to the imagination.

553
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,620
I had professional pictures taken of the phone because I dropped it.

554
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,620
Like it took like a few years.

555
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,300
I dropped it and so now I can totally, I'm sitting here laughing at you and look on my

556
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
wall.

557
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
There's professional photos of watches.

558
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,940
I feel much better in the, the blackberry collection.

559
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm redeemed.

560
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,220
I don't even know who I am.

561
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
The judge.

562
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,540
So then what got you to New York?

563
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,540
I guess in life, one needs to make a decision kind of where one goes and one, what priorities

564
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
one has.

565
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Miami was amazing.

566
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
I had amazing opportunities.

567
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,460
I wrote a book back in 2010 and then it came out like first week in 2011 called Alzheimer's

568
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,700
treatment, Alzheimer's prevention, a patient and family guide.

569
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,900
And I put together in this book, this plan about what I do for my patients.

570
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,460
I used to, I was known in Miami for spending a lot of time with patients and when patients

571
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,300
would leave, they would always have like 10 things to do or 15 things to do.

572
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,020
And that was very unique because most people, the neurologists are just saying it's called

573
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,220
diagnose and Adios and neurologists don't treat disease.

574
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
We admire it.

575
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
Well, not me.

576
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,460
I'm going to because of my family history because of whatever one thing leads to another

577
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,660
and I want to do anything and everything as long as it's evidence based and safe.

578
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,140
So I was known for jamming the printer in the neurology department because my recommendations

579
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,580
was like sometimes 10 pages, 15 pages.

580
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,180
And I put together nutrition, little pamphlet and this and you know, it got to the point

581
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,380
where I was jamming the printer so much that I went to Kinko's.

582
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,380
I had a bound.

583
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,940
It was more expensive to bind it.

584
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,220
So I wrote this book and I would give the book to the patient.

585
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,720
It was like printed out like $2 to print out the book.

586
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,300
So I would give the book to the patients and then magically the Today Show called one day

587
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,820
needing an expert about like music and Alzheimer's disease, which I talked about publicly.

588
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,140
Next thing I know I'm selling hundreds of books online and put up a website and all

589
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
that kind of thing.

590
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,140
So why do I tell the story?

591
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,620
I tell the story not to sell books.

592
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,780
I don't care about selling books, but when I wrote the book, I got a lot of flack because

593
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,780
in the title I wrote Alzheimer's treatment, Alzheimer's prevention, this plan, what is

594
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
this plan that you telling people to do?

595
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Show me the evidence.

596
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,120
You know, there's FDA approved drugs that may work marginally, but what is all this

597
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,180
other stuff you're doing?

598
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
It's crap.

599
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,940
So, you know, I talked to the Alzheimer's association on the phone and they said, no,

600
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
you can't say this.

601
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,300
And I talked to the actually a colleague.

602
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,340
I shouldn't really say this, but there's a colleague on the down the hall from me and

603
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
my academic appointment.

604
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,700
I knew his wife did this.

605
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,780
I shouldn't be saying this again.

606
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,840
It's being recorded, but whatever his wife wrote a really negative scathing review about

607
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,640
my book, it was actually probably him writing the review.

608
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
And I said to myself, but I really believe in this.

609
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I'm not trying to sell books.

610
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,760
I don't give a crap about books.

611
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,200
I made the book large print and it's cost more money to print and I make less money

612
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,680
per book and I don't care.

613
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,800
I want better quality pages.

614
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,720
And I just, I don't want to say that someone questioned my integrity or whatever, but I

615
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,600
guess someone questioned my integrity and I, I'm not trying to sell something.

616
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,000
I believed in it.

617
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,920
And the only way to prove in a rigorous way that multimodal interventions work, whether

618
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,000
it's patient education, lifestyle interventions, pharmacologic management, everything, the

619
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,800
only way to prove that that works.

620
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,400
The only way to do that is in a large academic medical center.

621
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,840
And I basically interviewed in a New York and Boston.

622
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,480
I was about this close to going back to Boston.

623
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,040
I had a great offer at Harvard, would have been a major stepping stone in my career to

624
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,480
be that age and that level to be an associate professor and you know, director of an Alzheimer's

625
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,680
clinic, but they wouldn't let me use the term prevention.

626
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,520
So then I came to interview a Cornell and my chair said, Oh yeah, Alzheimer's prevention.

627
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,960
That's probably going to be something new.

628
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Sure.

629
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,760
And the Dean as she was signing my letter back in 2012 said, no, I got to meet this

630
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
guy.

631
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
So July 4th weekend, 2012 I'm all like, uh-oh, it's about to move to New York.

632
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
What's happening?

633
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,240
And I go meet her and I got a 15 minute meeting.

634
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,400
I had a seller on literally the only place in the country that I thought was, I was allowed

635
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,160
cause I called around and whatever.

636
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,920
I wanted to start this Alzheimer's prevention thing.

637
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,440
And she interviewed me and she, you know, had written on my CV.

638
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,520
It was like, I think this was the Dean of Cornell medical school.

639
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,080
This is like the CEO of the medical school.

640
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Exactly.

641
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,040
The Dean of the medical school says, no, I'm not signing this guy's letter.

642
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,760
We're not starting an Alzheimer's prevention clinic.

643
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
That's crazy.

644
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I have to meet him.

645
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,720
I was given 15 minutes on my, on her calendar to plead my case.

646
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,400
And the first question she had for me, did you bring in a bling phone?

647
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
No, but I was so prepared.

648
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,240
I had like a collated folder and I had a USB with all the evidence and I was ready to

649
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,520
go and I walk in and she looks at me.

650
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,080
She looks down at my CV and she looks at me and she says, how old are you?

651
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,440
She doesn't know your doogie house or man.

652
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,120
She was expecting the traditional bearded bow tie, older fifties, whatever sixties neurologist

653
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
type.

654
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,800
And I look like that.

655
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,120
So we talked about my age and my training and the 23 thing, which by the way, today

656
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,000
is probably not even legal.

657
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,060
Probably, probably exactly.

658
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,620
And then in the last two minutes of after talking about the age and how the CV got so

659
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,640
long, I basically said, listen, I'm serious.

660
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,980
This is my plan.

661
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,860
I'm not over promising Alzheimer's starts in the brain decades before the first symptom.

662
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
People don't know that.

663
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,980
I don't even think she realized that when someone's diagnosed with dementia, didn't

664
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
start that day.

665
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,460
It started decades before I explained this to her.

666
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,900
The new criteria had just came out.

667
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,740
The new diagnostic criteria had come out like that summer.

668
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,260
And she said, okay, I'll let you do this prevention thing.

669
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
And that's it.

670
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,300
The only place that I could have gone in the country, possibly the world who knows

671
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,180
to do what I have tried to do and what I've actually been able to accomplish in the last

672
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,260
five and a half years is New York city.

673
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,180
It's just a, and while Cornell and New York Presbyterian has been the saying for New York

674
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,380
Presbyterian is amazing things are happening here and I'm not trying to give a commercial,

675
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,540
but there's just no other place that I would have been able to do this.

676
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,500
So you mentioned a diagnostic criteria.

677
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,380
So let's start from the beginning because at least once a week I get a call from a friend

678
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,580
or a patient saying, I think my mom or my dad is in the early stages of Alzheimer's

679
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
disease.

680
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,100
And I say, well, tell me why tell me a bit more.

681
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,580
And they're like, well, you know, my mom's just having a harder time remembering things.

682
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,700
She's repeating herself or my dad is, you know, having a hard time filling the blank.

683
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Right?

684
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,620
So how is the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease made and how does it differ from other types

685
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,020
of dementia?

686
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,980
Alzheimer's disease has traditionally been a clinical diagnosis, meaning you talk to

687
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,020
a patient like you were doing.

688
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,300
You get a history of progressive short-term memory loss.

689
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,820
And when that memory loss and other cognitive changes and sometimes sleep trouble and behavior

690
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,460
changes, depression, agitation, whatever.

691
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:36,620
So cognition, sleep, psychiatric, comorbidities, when all of these cognitive brain symptoms

692
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,900
cause activities of daily living to be no longer able to be done by that person, then

693
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,940
that person has something called probable Alzheimer's disease dementia.

694
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,940
So in the past, the clinical way was to talk to the patient, progressive short-term memory

695
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,780
loss, common things happen.

696
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,220
Commonly, it's probably going to be Alzheimer's disease.

697
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,300
Now it's about 60, 70% of the time when people get older, sometimes they forget things.

698
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,300
They lose their keys.

699
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,780
You have a word on the tip of your tongue, but you remember that later you find your

700
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,960
keys later.

701
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,940
That can be non pathological changes associated with age.

702
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,060
So there's something called age related, cognitive change or cognitive aging is even the more

703
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,620
appropriate term.

704
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,280
Cognitive aging is separate from Alzheimer's disease, but it doesn't lead to a pathological

705
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,920
diagnosis in the brain and it doesn't lead to alterations and activities of daily living.

706
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,220
People can still take care of themselves and they can still pay bills and function independently.

707
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:36,060
So Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, but there's different forms

708
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
of dementia.

709
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,420
Also there's frontotemporal dementia, which is more of a behavioral problem.

710
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:45,620
There's dementia with Lewy bodies and that's similar to Parkinson's disease symptoms along

711
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
with dementia.

712
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,500
It was reported that after Robin Williams death that he had Lewy body dementia superimposed

713
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,140
on whatever else people had speculated was going on.

714
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,580
Is that true or is that just a rumor?

715
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
No, that's true.

716
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,340
I've heard his wife, she was honored at the American Academy of Neurology last year and

717
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,460
she talked about this and he, I didn't treat him, I don't diagnose.

718
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,260
I can say only from a periphery, but it seems from what I've heard, some of the paranoia,

719
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,820
the hallucinations, the slowed movements, the vivid dreams, acting out dreams, it seemed

720
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
pretty consistent.

721
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,220
Would those be different from a patient presenting with the more typical Alzheimer's disease?

722
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,860
In other words, are those slightly more unique to Lewy body dementia?

723
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,060
Yeah, so by far Alzheimer's disease.

724
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,100
Which I've been told by the way, can only be diagnosed in an autopsy.

725
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,140
Yeah, I mean, I'm a clinical diagnostician.

726
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,820
So it's a new era, it's a new world.

727
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,780
So when your friends or your patients call you and say, does my mom have Alzheimer's

728
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
disease?

729
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,540
You listen to the story, neurologic diagnosis should be made based on the history 80 to

730
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,120
90% of the time.

731
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,520
So I still always defer to the clinical impression, but in 2018, 19, 20, etc.

732
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,220
It's just a different world.

733
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,360
We can do biomarkers so we can do scans and does the person have amyloid in the brain?

734
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Well, that's Alzheimer's.

735
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,360
But then again, people with Lewy body dementia also have amyloid.

736
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,920
So it's confusing, but long story short, when people have progressive short term memory

737
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,160
loss and other cognitive changes, it's probably Alzheimer's until proven otherwise.

738
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,180
The key thing is that we want to rule out reversible causes.

739
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,340
So make sure they don't have thyroid trouble or B12 deficiency, things like that.

740
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,460
Pretty uncommon 5% of the time, 8% of the time, whatever it is.

741
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,300
And a lot of times people have a thyroid problem or B12 deficiency, you'll fix it and maybe

742
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,900
the symptoms will get a little better, but they may have Alzheimer's anyway.

743
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,740
So we want to rule out reversible causes.

744
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,820
We always have to do some brain imaging, either a CAT scan, got to rule out a tumor or a MRI.

745
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,980
Now the American Academy of Neurology states you can do any brain imaging.

746
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,380
In my clinical practice, we always recommend an MRI.

747
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,780
What phase of MRI?

748
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,380
Just a regular MRI, no contrast.

749
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,380
I just want to make sure.

750
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,500
Which image are you looking at, the T1 or the T2?

751
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Well I want to look at everything.

752
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,860
Is there a vascular burden?

753
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,740
Could this be vascular cognitive impairment by itself?

754
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,220
Could this be vascular end Alzheimer's?

755
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,300
Because about 35% of the time you have Alzheimer's end vascular cognitive impairment.

756
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,820
So you just want to get a sense of what it looks like.

757
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,540
But to me, when I look at an MRI, I look for atrophy, shrinkage of the brain.

758
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,460
And if the frontal lobes, which is the planning, processing, higher order thinking part of

759
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,500
the brain, and the temporal lobes, which is the memory center of the brain, especially

760
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,300
the part of the brain called the hippocampus.

761
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,420
Hippocampus, I think in Latin, means seahorse.

762
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,860
It basically looks like a little seahorse thing when it's cut.

763
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,180
And if there's a hole in the hippocampus, where the big space of shrinkage, even without

764
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:31,260
the fancy biomarkers, which we'll talk about, progressive short-term memory loss and atrophy

765
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,420
in the brain in certain Alzheimer-specific areas, especially the hippocampus, is Alzheimer's

766
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
still proven otherwise.

767
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,100
Now, again, it's a new era.

768
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,980
We can check for amyloid in the brain.

769
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,940
We can look for amyloid in tau in the spinal fluid.

770
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,900
You know, even soon we'll be able to do tau scans.

771
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,540
Tau protein is another like amyloid pathologic protein that gets built up in the brain of

772
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,060
a person with Alzheimer's.

773
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,100
And you can look at these biomarkers to make a definitive diagnosis.

774
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,500
Does this person have Alzheimer's?

775
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,820
The only main reason to do that is if we're going to think about a clinical trial, because

776
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,460
if you get into a clinical trial, the only way to do that is to have Alzheimer's in the

777
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
brain.

778
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,940
And in the past, and we'll talk about why if so many Alzheimer's drugs failed, why

779
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,300
if studies left and right failure, failure, failure, there was one study that, you know,

780
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,660
this was only like five or six years ago, before the era of biomarkers, there was one

781
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:26,340
study where 40% of the people with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the study

782
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,580
did not have amyloid in the brain.

783
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,040
But they were getting anti amyloid treatments.

784
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,220
This was later found with a scan or on autopsies.

785
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,980
Different studies have done it different ways.

786
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,540
So the take home point here is that Alzheimer's is a little confusing.

787
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,420
You can make a clinical diagnosis, but the clinical diagnosis isn't always correct.

788
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,820
So that's why we need to think about biomarkers in certain situations.

789
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,940
You talked a lot about short term memory.

790
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,980
Where do you see changes?

791
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,460
When do you see changes in other parameters of cognition, such as executive function

792
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,860
or processing speed?

793
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,020
So when I think about the brain, I think about different areas.

794
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,420
And I don't want to say like pin the tail on donkey, but it's like, you know, pin the

795
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,140
tail on the part of the brain that's manifesting a change in cognition.

796
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,580
So you know, memory, there's short term memory, there's long term memory, in able to have

797
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,140
a memory, someone needs to be able to pay attention to something.

798
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,940
So another area of the brain in terms of cognitive function is processing speed or attention

799
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,420
and they're pretty similar.

800
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:27,020
Then there's executive function, which is higher order processing, judgment, planning,

801
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,020
things like that.

802
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
There's other things.

803
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,220
Language is important.

804
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Learning is important.

805
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,700
If you can't learn something, how can you remember it?

806
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:40,300
So what we do is we try to really hone in on exactly what the cognitive domain or cognitive

807
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,900
area is deficient.

808
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,820
So for example, when you have someone call you and say, oh, my memory is terrible.

809
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,660
Well, is it really memory?

810
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,580
That's what cognitive assessments do.

811
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,300
When my nephew was texting, I can't say when I'm texting because my phone's from 2010,

812
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,860
but when my nephew is texting at the, which you could check in Chinese though.

813
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
I could.

814
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Oh, the other one.

815
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Oh, that's a great phone.

816
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Next podcast.

817
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
I'll bring that.

818
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,380
Someone's texting and not paying attention.

819
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,180
And then I asked my nephew a question 20 minutes later.

820
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
It's not like they forgot.

821
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,180
They never assimilated.

822
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Exactly.

823
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,620
They never encoded it and never got into the memory.

824
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,260
So we always want to make sure, is this an attentional thing?

825
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,380
Because for example, common things happen commonly.

826
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:25,660
Dementia common, but depression is also very common in a pseudo dementia of depression

827
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,940
is very common.

828
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,860
So if someone says, oh, I can't remember it, but if they're depressed, whether it's a serotonin

829
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,740
issue, whether it's whatever, and you do the testing, they're not able to be attentive

830
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
during the exams.

831
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,260
So they're not remembering.

832
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,460
If you treat the depression, for example, serotonin drugs or whatever else, well, then

833
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,580
the attention gets boosted and then the memory comes back.

834
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:50,180
So it's not a dementia due to a neuro degenerative condition.

835
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,220
It's a pseudo dementia due to depression.

836
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,860
So there's a lot of things out there.

837
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,860
And that's why getting to the root of the, which area of the brain is truly not working

838
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,860
is key.

839
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,980
Short term memory, long term memory, processing speed, attention, that kind of thing.

840
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,140
It was about three or four years ago when I realized I wanted to start including cognitive

841
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,500
testing in our assessments in our practice.

842
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,940
And so Dan Palachar, who was one of our analysts at the time, I said, I tasked Dan with this

843
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
problem.

844
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,420
I said, Dan, I want you to go out there and I want you to learn everything about cognitive

845
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,540
testing so that we can get the best in class.

846
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
You know, we're going to do the best blood testing imaginable.

847
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,500
We're going to do the best, this, the best, this, the best, this, the best cognitive testing.

848
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,780
Well, that turned out to be a fool's errand because he came back with, I don't know, 27

849
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,460
different tests that one could do.

850
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,540
Some of these were clinical tests, like the NIH had a toolkit with all of its tests within

851
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,300
it, but then there were a bunch of commercial tests you could do online.

852
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,980
And you know, look at this stuff.

853
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,940
And I mean, my take on this sort of commercially available ones, because there was one problem

854
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,780
that immediately became obvious to me, which is it took a great deal of skill to administer

855
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,180
a subset of these tests.

856
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,300
So immediately said, we're not going to do those tests because like we don't have the

857
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,060
skill to do it and we're not going to invest the time to do that because we don't have

858
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,300
the patient volume.

859
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,500
Like we're not an Alzheimer's clinic, right?

860
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,980
So we figured we have to use an off the shelf thing.

861
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,820
And I was like, these all strike me as like kind of bullshit.

862
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,460
But I was like, look, here's the definitive assessment we're going to do.

863
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,540
And I had Dan, maybe I shouldn't be saying this story online, but it's probably legal.

864
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,580
If not, let's bleep this part out, please.

865
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,580
Bob.

866
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,580
I basically had Dan and a bunch of his buddies like get together one night at their place.

867
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,620
They're all over 21, by the way, and take the test.

868
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,700
Each of them took the test like there was like six guys that each took the test and

869
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,100
then do a shot.

870
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,580
I provided the alcohol and then redo the test and then do a shot and then redo the test

871
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
and then do a shot.

872
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,060
And I think they did this for six rounds.

873
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:52,980
And my question was if the test is truly a measure of cognitive capacity that cannot

874
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,880
be learned, their performance should deteriorate.

875
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,800
If you can learn the test, then their performance should stay flat or even get a little bit

876
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,920
better as they become inebriated.

877
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,360
And of course their performance was flat.

878
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,400
So like six hours later, you know, whatever their eight drinks into this thing, they're

879
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
hammered.

880
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,640
They're doing just as well on the cognitive test.

881
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,080
At that point, I was like, okay, we are not going to solve this problem using over the

882
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,980
counter commercial tests.

883
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,480
And that's when, you know, you and I already knew each other, but that's when I was like,

884
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,260
all right, Richard, what is going on with this cognitive testing thing?

885
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,040
And then I came into the clinic.

886
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
I met you.

887
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
I met Holly.

888
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
I met the team.

889
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,400
And I was like, oh yeah, we're never doing this.

890
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,160
Like we're going to send our high risk patients to you guys because this is way too much work.

891
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
It's really complicated.

892
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,720
Oh, this has been complicated for decades.

893
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
And you just tell a quick story.

894
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,160
I mean, first of all, our battery, the cognitive test we do is we do about a little more than

895
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,120
half on computer because, you know, we use the NIH toolbox.

896
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,320
We also use odor identification, which is important.

897
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,640
And that's hard to have a practice effect on some tests are less practice effectable.

898
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,880
Other tests are common to expect that we use pen and paper tests.

899
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,360
So what we've done is we put together an hour and 20, 30 minute battery that kind of is

900
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,720
a greatest hits that tries to look at people that are, you know, in the normal slash very

901
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,240
early phases of Alzheimer's.

902
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,680
The problem is, is that most of the cognitive tests out there have really been scaled or

903
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,640
used and validated and meant for people with dementia.

904
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,880
So they're not sensitive to pick up people with early cognitive decline who do not have

905
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
dementia.

906
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Exactly.

907
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,960
They don't have the robust validation in people who are normal versus normal, no amyloid

908
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,760
in the brain versus normal with amyloid in the brain.

909
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,480
And until we have thousands of people that do that, any off the shelf, any summer bed

910
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,600
than others for sure, we just don't have the perfect solution.

911
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,640
This actually is a great time to talk about this, but this past weekend we had the first

912
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,320
ever Alzheimer's prevention clinic and brain health clinic symposium where all of us are

913
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,560
there six centers like this, like ours.

914
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,760
Now we were the first in 2000.

915
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,160
Where are the other five in 2014?

916
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,840
The Alzheimer's risk assessment and early intervention program in University of Alabama

917
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,160
at Birmingham opened in 2014.

918
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Very different model than us.

919
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,640
It's a two visit model sort of thing.

920
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,280
They get an MRI and it's just a different way to do it.

921
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,400
Great person down there, David Gelbacher.

922
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,160
Then actually we opened a satellite clinic in Puerto Rico, Alzheimer's prevention clinic

923
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,680
and research center in Puerto Rico doing amazing.

924
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Everything was great.

925
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
And then, then the hurricane.

926
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,680
Oh boy.

927
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,480
She didn't have power for six months.

928
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,720
She's picking up the pieces.

929
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,840
Patients coming for prevention, patients just need to come to get electricity and get psychological

930
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,440
counseling for the PTSD after the storm.

931
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,840
She's calling it PTSD and Pueblo.

932
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,360
I think that's what she calls it.

933
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,840
So that was a tough time, but we're still running.

934
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,240
We have the brain health center at North Shore hospital in Chicago in Evanston, Illinois.

935
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
That's been running strong.

936
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I'll be there next week.

937
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Oh, cool.

938
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Yeah.

939
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Good people over there.

940
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,880
They have a very heavily focused on electronic medical record to try to track these things.

941
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,480
The newest center is actually two ones in Boca Raton, Florida at a Florida Atlantic

942
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,880
University in Boca Raton.

943
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,400
The dementia prevention initiative, Jim Galvin is like, if you think we do a deep dive, Jim

944
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,120
Galvin does the deepest dive.

945
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,440
I mean, we're talking to like the magma of the earth that he does from bone density to

946
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,720
metabolomics and proteomics to EEG.

947
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,280
I mean, if there's an outcome measure, he does it, but that's his expertise and he's

948
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,800
super great at that.

949
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,800
And then the newest center is opening at the Pacific John Wayne Cancer Institute, but

950
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,160
it's Providence St. John's and it's called the Pacific Brain Health Center in Santa Monica,

951
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
California.

952
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,800
Really great people that were recruited from UCLA.

953
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,280
David Merrill is one of them.

954
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,120
And we're all for the first time trying to collaborate and trying to harmonize these

955
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,680
measures because honestly, I don't know what the right measures are.

956
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,480
We're trying to create an additional free cognitive assessment that can be done online,

957
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,100
but the toolbox can only be done on computer and iPad.

958
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,900
The versions that we built were actually on the phone.

959
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,280
So we built six versions of something called the face name associative memory test.

960
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,920
We worked with Doreen Rents to help us with this.

961
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,920
She's amazing.

962
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,040
She validated this where if you do poorly on a face name associative memory, that predicts

963
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,340
amyloid in the brain.

964
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,360
So what we've done is then we then created all these.

965
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,760
Do you remember how predictive it was?

966
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,600
Don't quote me on that kind of stuff, but it's pretty predictive.

967
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
It worked pretty well.

968
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,440
I don't remember from the paper, but we created these tests and it was not the NIH perspective.

969
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,400
Say it was a different reputable organization because the words Alzheimer's and prevention

970
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
was in our name.

971
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,040
They didn't want to use our tools or really be associated with our program.

972
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,880
So we've been getting tomatoes thrown at us for quite some time.

973
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,720
And for example, this symposium we had this weekend, we had all these brain health centers.

974
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,320
We all get criticism and you know, we all get criticism because for example, we don't

975
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,400
even know what are the right tools to use, which are the best cognitive tests, which

976
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,780
is this, which is that.

977
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,000
So we've been getting criticism for a long time.

978
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,440
However, thankfully the tide is turning and it's kind of a new day in a new era.

979
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,960
For example, even the, you know, last year, the Alzheimer's association put out 10 tips

980
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,400
for brain health to preserve cognitive health.

981
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,480
That's amazing.

982
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,960
This year at the Alzheimer's association meeting in Chicago, the amount of the word prevention

983
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,320
that were used was I couldn't believe it prevention this prevention that now, now, you know, that

984
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,040
there's a big, big, big debate on, you know, Alzheimer's prevention or Alzheimer's risk

985
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,220
reduction, which is the most accurate term.

986
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,160
We just got our foundational methods paper accepted.

987
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,640
And the paper as we titled it was the clinical practice of Alzheimer's prevention, a precision

988
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,880
medicine approach went through the review process.

989
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,000
Now this is the journal Alzheimer's and dementia, the journal of the Alzheimer's association.

990
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,760
It's the number one journal of Alzheimer's journals.

991
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,200
It's the number four ranked clinical journal in neurology.

992
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Okay.

993
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,080
Great impact factor, 12.75, whatever it is.

994
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,500
This is the first time they've ever published anything from us.

995
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,940
So that's good news.

996
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,380
But one of the six reviewers said, no, you can't use prevention.

997
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,580
The title, you have to change it to risk reduction.

998
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,580
That then led us to write another paper, which I hopefully will be submitting soon called

999
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,780
Alzheimer's prevention versus Alzheimer's risk reduction, transcending semantics for

1000
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,860
clinical practice, because there's a big difference in my mind about prevention versus risk reduction.

1001
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,700
There's also implications because when you say prevention, the patient sitting in front

1002
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,780
of you gets that when you say risk reduction, what kind of messages that to the public?

1003
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,780
It's confusing.

1004
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,540
There's this whole semantic argument.

1005
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,180
We went through this with our paper.

1006
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,940
I had a different experience several years ago that has given me a window into understanding

1007
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,740
where this resistance comes from.

1008
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,860
So it was probably four years ago and I was asked to give a grand rounds and discuss breast

1009
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:27,020
cancer, but specifically to discuss the use of metformin in the risk reduction of breast

1010
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,100
cancer.

1011
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,820
And so I gave this long talk about all of these topics.

1012
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,740
And one of the implications of my talk was that if metformin could be effective in reducing

1013
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:45,020
the risk of breast cancer, the question then became could dietary choices also impact breast

1014
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,140
cancer?

1015
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,580
And so one of the questions was posed.

1016
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:52,340
If a woman has breast cancer, is she better off eating ice cream or not eating ice cream?

1017
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,660
And I said, look, all things equal.

1018
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,700
My intuition is she's better off not eating ice cream, given that most breast cancers

1019
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,020
are quite insulin sensitive.

1020
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,180
They're very sensitive to IGF and a number of other growth factors.

1021
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,180
This one person in the room who is very senior, quite an opinionated individual who I'm not

1022
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,500
overly fond of, basically leapt up and down and said, you know, this is complete bullshit.

1023
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,300
The moment you start suggesting and I had to ask like 12 questions to get at the layer of the

1024
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,540
hostility, but it became very clear to me what the hostility stemmed from, which is an

1025
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,420
understandable opposition.

1026
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:28,580
It was if you start talking about breast cancer prevention, if you start suggesting that a

1027
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,260
person with breast cancer can change the way they eat to reduce their risk of death from this

1028
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,300
disease, you are implying that the patient brought this disease on themselves.

1029
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,460
Now, again, I think that's an error.

1030
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,100
I think there's a logical fallacy there.

1031
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,940
But I believe that that logic exists in Alzheimer's disease as well.

1032
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,620
I think that when when we talk about Alzheimer's prevention, somehow it is being turned into,

1033
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,740
well, then you're saying patients are bringing this on themselves.

1034
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,060
It's their fault. There could be something done to prevent this.

1035
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,860
Therefore, you know, and we don't like that message.

1036
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,380
So that's what my intuition tells me is this opposition.

1037
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:08,220
And unfortunately, I think that type of third grade JV poor understanding of logic and risk

1038
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,460
is basically slowing down progress in this space immensely as evidenced by the fact that you

1039
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,540
can't get a grant. I mean, this was true a year ago.

1040
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,540
You can tell me through today.

1041
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,700
Things are much better now.

1042
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,700
Things are totally different.

1043
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,420
When you could not get a grant to study Alzheimer's prevention, if you had the word

1044
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,060
prevention in the grant title zero, we have three NIH grants now.

1045
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,500
Actually, I just got a like a fourth little part.

1046
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,820
So we have like three point one NIH grants.

1047
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,540
I mean, that's not any of these are ones.

1048
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,820
Yeah, one. We have one part of a program project.

1049
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,900
One are one. We're looking at the program project looks at women between the ages of 40 to

1050
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,180
65. Looking at the early onset.

1051
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,660
Well, well, apparently menopausal.

1052
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,540
Well, apparently, yeah, well, not actually.

1053
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,820
It's funny. You say 40 is early.

1054
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,940
I say we need to start at 30.

1055
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,660
But no 40 to 65.

1056
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,780
I think it's a good sweet spot.

1057
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,300
And we're looking at women between the ages of 40 to 65.

1058
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,580
That's the program project.

1059
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,780
Then we just got Lisa Moscone is the PI on the men's brain imaging.

1060
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,740
So we're looking at menopause transition as the window of opportunity.

1061
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,980
Like when do we need to intervene and how and then the R01 we got was the men's brain

1062
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,540
imaging study, which is basically the male menopause transition, which is andropause.

1063
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,580
So we're looking at it's a small, small number, only 15 men a year for four years.

1064
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,700
But it's better than nothing.

1065
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,580
Between 40 and 65.

1066
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,300
We then just got an administrative supplement to now image women, not just

1067
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,940
at baseline, but also at 18 months.

1068
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,500
So we just got that today, actually.

1069
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,060
And then I mean, that's pretty, pretty good.

1070
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,980
Yeah, no, that's a huge improvement.

1071
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,180
And so much of what you just said now makes me want to take a step forward.

1072
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,140
So let's start with the following.

1073
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,060
How do you define in your clinic what a high risk patient means?

1074
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,980
What is the definition of a high risk patient?

1075
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,420
Anyone with a brain is at risk for Alzheimer's disease.

1076
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,340
Well, let's take a step further back than that.

1077
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,700
What is the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States today?

1078
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,500
No one knows.

1079
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,820
You'll see 5.1 million Americans, 5.3 million Americans, 5.7 million Americans.

1080
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:04,220
This is all estimations based on like one county in Illinois from like years ago.

1081
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,220
And then it's been extrapolated and posted all over.

1082
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,420
So why don't we have those data the way we do for cancer, for example?

1083
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,700
Alzheimer's is confusing.

1084
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,340
I mean, there's Alzheimer's dementia and probably around four or five million

1085
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,180
people have it, but the best numbers were recently published.

1086
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,060
The most updated was that 47 million Americans have preclinical Alzheimer's

1087
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,340
disease, meaning Alzheimer's in the brain, but no symptoms.

1088
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,740
Sorry.

1089
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:33,380
Meaning based on something you would see on an imaging study or a lumbar puncture

1090
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,060
or because those would be basically the only two ways you could see something

1091
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,940
in the brain today, 47 million people would have that finding.

1092
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,860
That also must be an estimate, but do not yet have cognitive impairment.

1093
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,140
Yep.

1094
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,820
So 5 ish million people have dementia due to Alzheimer's.

1095
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,460
47 million Americans have Alzheimer's in their brain, but no symptoms yet.

1096
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,620
There's people before that with no Alzheimer's in their brain and no

1097
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,540
symptoms, and we don't know if they're going to get it yet.

1098
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,820
And then there's a kind of gray area in between called mild cognitive impairment

1099
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,260
due to Alzheimer's disease.

1100
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,100
And we don't exactly have the best numbers on that, but it's somewhere between

1101
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,380
the transition phase between preclinical, pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's and

1102
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,540
dementia due to Alzheimer's.

1103
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,460
It's stage one, stage two and stage three.

1104
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:21,340
When I talk to my patients about death, which if you're trying to practice

1105
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,940
longevity, you have to be able to talk about death.

1106
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,940
I share with them the obvious, which is once you reached about the age of 40,

1107
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,900
assuming you're not a smoker, your probability of dying from cerebrovascular

1108
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,260
disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease is north of 75%.

1109
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,220
And almost without exception that within that constellation of diseases, the one

1110
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,860
that people fear most is Alzheimer's disease, but a very few patients actually

1111
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,460
understand what it means to die from Alzheimer's disease.

1112
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,740
And this becomes a bit challenging when one starts to look at death certificates.

1113
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,180
And maybe this is part of the problem in coming up with an accurate estimate of

1114
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,940
that. How do people actually die when they have Alzheimer's dementia?

1115
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,260
Yeah.

1116
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,540
So Alzheimer's disease is a indirect cause of death.

1117
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,580
You know, for example, when someone gets a urinary tract infection, that urinary

1118
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,180
tract infection may be treated by antibiotics because the patient will say,

1119
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,340
Oh, it hurts.

1120
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,780
I'm going more frequently.

1121
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,180
Test my urine and give me an antibiotic.

1122
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,180
But when someone has Alzheimer's dementia, they're not able to convey this.

1123
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:31,220
And that UTI becomes pylonephritis, which becomes sepsis, which can kill them.

1124
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:31,860
Exactly.

1125
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,620
So some people will put Alzheimer's on their death certificate and other

1126
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,020
people will say, Euro sepsis.

1127
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,300
Yeah.

1128
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,860
So there's never going to be great numbers.

1129
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:46,020
Alzheimer's is the impetus to death in most patients for sure.

1130
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,900
They can't report their pain close.

1131
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,940
Call him a friend, but he's a patient in the clinic also.

1132
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,860
Good guy.

1133
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:57,500
I've seen his mom and his mom was just diagnosed with cancer and she was

1134
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,740
complaining of abdominal pain, something nonspecific.

1135
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,980
She saw a doctor, doctor said, Oh, and he's got dementia.

1136
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,180
He's got some belly pain.

1137
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
You probably constipated here.

1138
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,860
Take some constipation meds.

1139
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,340
Didn't get better.

1140
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:09,820
Didn't get better.

1141
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,380
Didn't get better.

1142
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,020
Turns out she made pancreatic cancer and she had a gallbladder or something.

1143
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,540
And now it's had to put a stent in, right?

1144
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,460
Only when she turned yellow, did they figure out what the cancer was.

1145
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:23,500
So Alzheimer's disease dementia causes a person not be able to express themselves

1146
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,820
and not be able to care for themselves in certain ways.

1147
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,940
And the caregiving has to happen for them.

1148
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,700
And so you can see a lot of these aspiration mnemonias.

1149
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,060
You see, you know, my closest friend, one of my closest friends, my

1150
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,220
roommate in medical school, I just went back to his father's funeral.

1151
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,420
Two weeks ago, his father just passed away.

1152
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,300
He had Alzheimer's disease, but it was very sudden onset.

1153
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,940
And within the course of eight months, his health deteriorated so quickly.

1154
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,340
And ultimately he died from cellulitis, obviously.

1155
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,380
But you can see that this is someone who probably at the very end was at risk

1156
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,700
for these things because of all these other changes.

1157
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,380
So, and I've also seen people die from just failure to thrive.

1158
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,380
They have Alzheimer's disease and they just can't eat it.

1159
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,060
They don't want to eat.

1160
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,180
They completely lose their appetite.

1161
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,580
They become anorexic and they be sort of almost drift into a vegetative state

1162
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,260
where unless you would force feed them, they will die relatively quickly.

1163
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,860
But this also strikes me as part of the challenge of trying to get a handle

1164
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:25,180
on a disease that has such a ubiquitous face at the end.

1165
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,420
And Alzheimer's disease is a life course disease at every moment.

1166
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,300
Someone is either potentially having silent pathology building up.

1167
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,940
Alzheimer's is a life course disease and each phase of life.

1168
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,340
Alzheimer's is a confusing, difficult disease to manage.

1169
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,980
End of life, it's more obvious, but towards even the beginning of life,

1170
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,940
people that are born with the ApoE4 gene, for example,

1171
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,580
which we're going to talk about a lot, commonly researched gene

1172
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,740
start off with a smaller brain.

1173
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,940
So you think of Alzheimer's disease the way I think of cardiovascular disease,

1174
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,820
which is this disease begins at birth.

1175
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,540
Everybody's on a different plane based on a number of hereditary

1176
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,740
or acquired risk factors.

1177
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,940
Your path is not set on that slide.

1178
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,260
You get to determine it, but your track might be a bit set.

1179
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,940
You know, you asked me before, what's your high risk patient?

1180
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,740
What does that look like? And I said, I mean, to be glib, I just was honest.

1181
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,460
If someone has a brain, they're at risk for Alzheimer's.

1182
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,060
OK, well, everyone has a brain.

1183
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,260
So go deeper. Not not everyone.

1184
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,260
Technically, I have some counterfactuals.

1185
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,420
Not talking politics, not going there.

1186
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,180
How did you know that's what I wanted to say?

1187
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,260
I wasn't even going to go there. Excellent.

1188
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,540
So moving right along at every point in life course,

1189
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,020
a person's risk may change.

1190
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,060
So early life, mid life and late life.

1191
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,220
There's different risk factors for Alzheimer's.

1192
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,980
And, you know, I agree with you that some people can do everything right

1193
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,100
and still get Alzheimer's.

1194
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,380
However, based on population attributable risk models.

1195
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,540
Being conservative, one out of every three cases of Alzheimer's disease

1196
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,820
may be preventable if that person does everything right.

1197
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,460
Now, the other two out of three cases, well, hmm, it may not be preventable.

1198
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,100
Maybe we can delay it.

1199
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,780
Could we delay it by two years, three years, five years, six years?

1200
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,820
I have some hot off the press data I sent you right before I arrived

1201
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,780
to send you some new results.

1202
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,500
So we're trying to hone in on the can we delay it and for how long?

1203
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,540
But honestly, other people will do everything right

1204
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,740
and absolutely still get Alzheimer's disease.

1205
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:27,540
And I think I understand why now, because there's a tug of war going on

1206
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,900
100% of the time, it's a tug of war between you and your genes,

1207
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,580
environment and genes.

1208
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,220
And when it comes to Alzheimer's, the mnemonic I use is age.

1209
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,620
A G E A stands for age because age is the number one risk factor for Alzheimer's.

1210
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,620
G is genetics and E is environment.

1211
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,300
So epigenetics, your interaction between the environment and your genome

1212
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,900
is going to put you on the path or try to knock you off of the path towards Alzheimer's.

1213
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,180
And some people can do everything right.

1214
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:59,180
But because of their APOE4 gene plus another gene or because of their X gene

1215
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,900
or because of their whatever, they're going to get Alzheimer's disease.

1216
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,460
Other people can modify their environment,

1217
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:11,180
modify the impact of that gene on their outcomes.

1218
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:17,340
And I believe that it's very reasonable to expect that one out of three cases

1219
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,540
of Alzheimer's can be prevented, because if you can delay Alzheimer's

1220
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,980
by two, five or seven or 10 years by doing everything right in that subset,

1221
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,300
they're going to probably die from something else.

1222
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,980
Yeah. And the other thing that I always talk about in the prevention space,

1223
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,100
I mean, as you know, I take such a hard

1224
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,340
liner on cardiovascular disease because it is the leading cause of death.

1225
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,940
And I believe of the major pillars, atherosclerotic disease, cancer

1226
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,220
and neurodegenerative disease, it's the most preventable.

1227
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,260
We understand the pathology of that disease so much better than the other two.

1228
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,380
And we have more tools that seem to have efficacy at preventing

1229
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,380
that if nothing else, I say it's an optionality.

1230
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,940
Time is optionality.

1231
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,020
And so similarly, if you take somebody who for whom maybe it is a fate

1232
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,860
accompli, that they are going to get Alzheimer's disease, but you say, you know what?

1233
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,180
Instead of getting it at 69, we can make it 78.

1234
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,780
Well, a lot can happen in nine years.

1235
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,020
It's not just that you could die of something else, which is maybe better,

1236
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,460
maybe not, depending on what that something else is.

1237
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,260
But more importantly, maybe you and your peers

1238
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,020
have nine extra years to come up with something else.

1239
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,740
Let's talk about APOE because everybody, you know, I was actually doing

1240
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,900
and asked me anything yesterday, this is the AMA's.

1241
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,940
And there was a great question about APOE4, and I just punted it

1242
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,500
because I knew you and I were talking today.

1243
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,220
So I was like, I love the speed round when I can say next.

1244
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,940
APOE is a gene.

1245
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:44,940
It exists mostly in three types, though I told there are actually a couple of others.

1246
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,860
But for the large part, there's an APOE2, an APOE3 and an APOE4.

1247
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,780
You get one from mom and one from dad.

1248
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,380
And that way, everyone either has a two, three or a three, three or a three, four or four.

1249
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,660
There are six combinations.

1250
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,500
The approximate prevalence, the three threes represent probably what, about 55, 60 percent?

1251
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,060
Yep. You got a neutral risk.

1252
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,860
So we call that unity risk, right?

1253
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,060
Those are the single risks.

1254
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,820
The two twos are very rare.

1255
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,780
I've actually never seen a two two.

1256
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,620
I've seen one.

1257
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,140
OK, they're reported at less than one percent of the population.

1258
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,500
Maybe two. I think I've seen two.

1259
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,860
And they come with a risk reduction, I believe, of about 20 percent.

1260
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,580
At the far end of the spectrum, you have the four four.

1261
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,340
Now, that used to be reported as one percent of the population.

1262
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,900
But I see that so often that I think that's closer to three or four percent of the population.

1263
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,540
You know, in our 600 person cohort, we have thirty seven.

1264
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,540
But you're selecting for high risk.

1265
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,260
Yeah, I don't select for high risk, but I still feel like it's about four percent.

1266
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,860
Yeah. Yeah. In our cohort, it's like six.

1267
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,940
Now, this is interesting.

1268
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:49,260
The very first time I started paying attention to APO-E gene, which was about 2011, 2012,

1269
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,700
the literature said the four four patients relative to the three three patients

1270
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,780
have a twenty five fold increase.

1271
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,180
Today, we see that number, I think, continually being downward revised.

1272
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:04,580
So for my four four patients, the good news that I have three patients in my practice

1273
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,740
who are four four, the good news for those patients is, look,

1274
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,300
these numbers are getting better and better.

1275
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,340
I mean, you and I, I think offline would agree unofficially.

1276
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,220
It might be closer to four to six X.

1277
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,700
I don't even think you even know optimistic.

1278
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,180
Well, I'm just going to be frank.

1279
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,820
Alzheimer's and APO-E is confusing.

1280
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,500
And having two copies before does absolutely not mean you're going to get the disease.

1281
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,220
And it's a polygenic risk when it comes to the disease.

1282
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,340
You know, you can have two copies of before, but never have a family member

1283
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,140
and never get the disease.

1284
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,460
I don't believe it's medically correct.

1285
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,780
You know, it's hard to split hairs or whatever.

1286
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,100
I don't even think you can say it's two percent or five percent or twenty percent

1287
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,420
or whatever percent higher or how many fold whatever,

1288
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,940
because you can't know until you know what the other person's genes are.

1289
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,500
Yeah, it's very hard to do.

1290
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,620
And I think the best that people are doing in these large population based studies

1291
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:03,380
is saying acknowledging the heterogeneity of those other risk factors.

1292
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,940
All things equal.

1293
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,740
The last paper I read basically said eight to 10 X.

1294
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,500
So again, maybe that's still an overestimate.

1295
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,700
I believe it is an overestimate.

1296
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,020
And I think it's certainly an overestimate with all the interventions we're going to talk about.

1297
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:19,980
But the point here is that's a heck of a lot better than a 20 to 25 fold risk.

1298
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,060
Then you have the three fours.

1299
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,700
Now they represent quite a bit of people.

1300
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,460
That's like 20 to 25 percent of the population.

1301
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,260
Solid 25.

1302
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,660
Yeah, and our cohort is about 40.

1303
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,900
OK, which again makes sense.

1304
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,500
You're over representing.

1305
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,940
Again, they used to be represented as about a three to four X.

1306
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,300
I mean, I think today we're saying maybe a two X.

1307
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,940
Again, not withstanding your category.

1308
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,020
So polygenic risk that, you know, we'll talk about precision medicine and kind of why

1309
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,740
what the future of Alzheimer's disease is.

1310
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,740
And I actually think the future of Alzheimer's disease prevention is now.

1311
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,460
I don't even think it's the future anymore.

1312
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,100
I think the future is artificial intelligence.

1313
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,940
But we can talk about that some other time.

1314
01:01:52,940 --> 01:02:00,660
The person that walks in with an E3 E4, I am actually more optimistic

1315
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,380
when they come in and less freaked out about the four, because at least I know what I'm up against.

1316
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,060
OK, if that person is you have so many three fours in your cohort now.

1317
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,460
Easy, easy.

1318
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,580
I know lifestyle interventions work.

1319
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:21,500
I am confident that when I do XYZ, ABC, the 27 things that I'll tell them to do based on precision

1320
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,860
medicine, based on their metabolic risk factors, their cholesterol, their individual risks.

1321
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:32,740
I can predict that they will have a response of this.

1322
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,460
And this is satisfying to me.

1323
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:39,420
The problem is, is when someone comes in with a three three, I'm like, oh, meaning for a three

1324
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,500
three to show up in your clinic, by definition, there's a reason either their family member

1325
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:49,860
had premature Alzheimer's disease and or they're potentially even showing early signs of cognitive

1326
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,260
impairment that are subtle or no.

1327
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,140
No, I mean, you know, we were a prevention clinic.

1328
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:58,700
So to get into our clinic, you have to have normal cognitive function with a family history of

1329
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,860
Alzheimer's. So so we focus on the normals.

1330
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:06,660
Now, a three three could mean you did not get the four from mom or dad and life is beautiful.

1331
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,940
Maybe the risk is lower.

1332
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:14,380
But if you have a three three and mom and dad were three three and they didn't have the four, guess

1333
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,980
what? They probably have another gene.

1334
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,340
And I don't know what that gene is.

1335
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,180
And I don't know what I'm up against.

1336
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,020
Do you test the parents in that situation?

1337
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,180
Well, it's tricky.

1338
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,860
I know a lot of I would say when I first started the program, most of our prevention patients, I

1339
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:31,100
would say 60 percent of our prevention patients came from the patient with dementia I was

1340
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,060
treating. I then saw their kids and their cousins and whatever else.

1341
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,620
So there's families I see with five, six, seven members.

1342
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:42,340
And that's like the best to see because you can really understand the genotype and phenotypes and

1343
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,980
see the pattern.

1344
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:47,060
I do the same thing with LP little a actually in the cardiovascular front, which is very

1345
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:47,740
helpful, right?

1346
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:52,540
It's to be able to say, let's track where this disease is coming from and see how much of it we

1347
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,540
can attribute to the genetic influence.

1348
01:03:54,540 --> 01:04:01,660
So so if a patient comes in and they're three, three and mom got Alzheimer's disease at 57 and you

1349
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,420
know that mom is three, four, you feel a heck of a lot better than if mom is three, three.

1350
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:05,900
Totally.

1351
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:06,940
Absolutely.

1352
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,020
And you know, we're trying to simplify things and either there's polygenic risk.

1353
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,100
There's dozens of Alzheimer's genes.

1354
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,940
And the goal is to now it's hard because we don't have a neurogeneticist.

1355
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,500
And as I mentioned Holly before and her practitioner and myself, we don't have the team it

1356
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,020
would take to spend hours and hours and hours and days to decode someone to genome.

1357
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:30,620
But in the future, hopefully we'll be able to do this in an automated way.

1358
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:35,020
But the goal is to understand, OK, if they have a four, we're going to do A, B and C.

1359
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,900
If they don't have a four, we're going to do X, Y and Z.

1360
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,660
And I want to come to the study that allowed you to talk about that.

1361
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,420
Before we go there, we'll round this out.

1362
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,460
You have two threes and two fours.

1363
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,820
Two fours are pretty rare about neutral risk.

1364
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:49,900
My cousin's a two four.

1365
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,060
I've seen two cases, but pretty rare.

1366
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,020
Do we think that the two fours are at increased risk, decreased risk because of the two

1367
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,300
increased risk because of the four?

1368
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:01,740
All things equal, similar ish to three three, but a little worse.

1369
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,140
Yeah, that's sort of my thinking.

1370
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,060
And then the two threes get a benefit.

1371
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,260
Not as much as the two twos.

1372
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,380
Looks like it's about eleven, ten to fifteen percent.

1373
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,100
Yeah, I like two threes.

1374
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,500
Two threes I can really sink my teeth into.

1375
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,220
And but you must not see many of these people.

1376
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,940
No, no, I see two threes all the time.

1377
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,380
Why?

1378
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,620
They still have risk.

1379
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,220
They're still coming to you because of family history.

1380
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:19,820
Oh, yeah.

1381
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,020
But it's a different gene.

1382
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,020
There's a different gene lurking in there, but we don't know what it is yet.

1383
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,820
Yeah, but their polygenic risk is lower because they don't have a four to amplify the

1384
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,100
gene of the whole family where they came in and they said, oh, no, we have early on

1385
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,060
said Alzheimer's in the family.

1386
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,460
And I said, no, you don't.

1387
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,340
Doesn't sound like it.

1388
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:40,180
And we did all the stuff and mom had four, four uncle had four, four.

1389
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,860
Well, that's pretty weird, but OK.

1390
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,460
Grandparents for I'm sure they had four four.

1391
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,100
There must have been a lot of fours going on.

1392
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,780
And then when we look at the kids, they have a three four.

1393
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,500
Well, we do the three four, but wait, why did they get early disease?

1394
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,100
What's going on?

1395
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,140
And we found another gene, a TNF alpha gene.

1396
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:56,580
Yes.

1397
01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:00,100
So when you take TNF alpha and you add to a four, well, you're going to have a six

1398
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,700
fold risk.

1399
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,940
That's polygenic risk.

1400
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,460
That's why they had early on with the TNF alpha gene does.

1401
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,020
What's the phenotype when they have this?

1402
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,020
Well, you have an inflammatory cascade.

1403
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,140
It's a pro-inflammatory.

1404
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:10,580
Sure.

1405
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,700
So that's like fast forwarding to Alzheimer's.

1406
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,380
Now, when you have a four four and a TNF alpha, that's when you start getting

1407
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,820
symptoms in your late forties or fifties, it's not early onset.

1408
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:22,700
What's the gene that is almost a Garen?

1409
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,740
Precinilin one, precinilin two and amyloid precursor protein gene mutation.

1410
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,220
These are three genes that cause true early onset Alzheimer's, meaning you have

1411
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,540
the gene and you get the disease in your forties or fifties.

1412
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:33,740
Yeah.

1413
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,020
Meaning this is one of the only deterministic genes for AD.

1414
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:37,500
Correct.

1415
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,620
Succeedingly rare, less than one percent.

1416
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,980
As an example, I have a 27 year old woman, great gal.

1417
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,020
She has a precinilin one gene.

1418
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,580
How old was she when her mom or dad was diagnosed?

1419
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:53,060
Well, her mom's in her early fifties and acting weird now and kind of in denial.

1420
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:56,020
Her family members range from fifties to early sixties.

1421
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,380
At the time that they were diagnosed.

1422
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:57,620
Yep.

1423
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,660
But then you take a deep dive into precinilin one and she actually has a

1424
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:04,140
good one from Belgium where they actually have later early onset, meaning like

1425
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,620
sixties, six zero.

1426
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,780
And she's the first person I'd ever seen the prevention clinic who had an early

1427
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,300
onset gene and I could not say that she was going to get Alzheimer's.

1428
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,300
I said, no, I don't know that you will.

1429
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,580
I think we can do something.

1430
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,300
We have so much time in the next 20 years for you.

1431
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,140
I'm not even like worried.

1432
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:23,500
Sure.

1433
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,380
We'll take care of this.

1434
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:28,780
So even, and this is super controversial, but I don't even think one person can

1435
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,460
say even having an Alzheimer's gene where you're going to get the disease means

1436
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,340
you're going to get the disease because the field is changing.

1437
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:38,860
Is the field of genetics considering that a deterministic gene?

1438
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:39,700
Yes, they do.

1439
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,460
There's only about 75 to a hundred genes.

1440
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:42,900
So there's 20.

1441
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:43,660
Just for the listener.

1442
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,180
There's about 23,000 genes in the human genome.

1443
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:53,180
Directionally only 100 are deterministic polygenic single gene leads to problem.

1444
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,380
So you have the mutation for cystic fibrosis.

1445
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,780
You are getting cystic fibrosis.

1446
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,220
You have the gene for this glycogen storage disease.

1447
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:03,460
You are getting it virtually every disease that we think of commonly, of

1448
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,060
course, does not have a deterministic genome.

1449
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:10,900
Certain cancers do, but very few virtually all cancers, of course, are

1450
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,980
somatic mutations and not acquired germline mutations.

1451
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,820
That's a ballsy thing to say, right?

1452
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,420
You're saying, look, 1% of Alzheimer's comes from a deterministic gene.

1453
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,260
I'm not even convinced that's deterministic.

1454
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,540
It might be an artifact of our GWAS.

1455
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,780
Well, no, no, no, no.

1456
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:28,300
It's meaning our GWAS has basically never tried an intervention.

1457
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:28,740
Correct.

1458
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:33,700
Since it's a late, well, it's early means forties and fifties, but since we have

1459
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:38,180
now 30 and 40 years to figure it out, especially in her case who's 27.

1460
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,740
And if she doesn't get symptoms for 25 years, I'm loading her up with curcumin.

1461
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,340
I mean, I got X, Y, and Z.

1462
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,860
We're going to be putting her in whatever amyloid drug that comes out in the next

1463
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,740
five to seven years.

1464
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,860
I mean, I cannot say that she's going to get it.

1465
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,500
So deterministic genes from birth.

1466
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,420
Well, that's a different story.

1467
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,140
You know, cystic fibrosis, terrible disease.

1468
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,660
You get it and you have it.

1469
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,420
Early onset Alzheimer's genes, it's a pretty, you know,

1470
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,100
No, that's my point.

1471
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:03,300
Yeah.

1472
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:08,980
I think that when I say artifact of GWAS, I mean the GWAS is only, so genome wide

1473
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:13,060
association studies, which for the listener is how we link genes to diseases.

1474
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,180
It's basically epidemiology of genes.

1475
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,780
If you study something where a potential treatment for a disease that could have

1476
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,220
played a role was never introduced, you can actually be misled.

1477
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:23,460
Yeah.

1478
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,260
I see.

1479
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:24,580
Yeah.

1480
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,700
So the other thing I tell my patients, so correct me if I have this right or wrong,

1481
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:34,940
is that about two thirds of patients in the U S who present with Alzheimer's

1482
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:39,980
disease have at least one copy of E four and about one third of patients do not

1483
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:40,940
have a copy of E four.

1484
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,260
Is that directionally about right?

1485
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,740
That's probably pretty close.

1486
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,980
I've always said 60 40.

1487
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,820
So I guess that's right.

1488
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,740
I'm going to trust you more than I trust me.

1489
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,940
But I don't, I don't know what's latest.

1490
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,220
It depends on populations.

1491
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,580
And so the point you want to make is look, about a quarter of the population

1492
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,340
has an E four gene, one or two copies.

1493
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:03,340
And that quarter of the population makes up two thirds to 60% of the disease.

1494
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:09,180
So for my patients who have E four, I say, the good news is this doesn't mean that

1495
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:12,900
your E four means they're going to get the disease to my E three and E two patients

1496
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,020
who are busy high fiving at this point.

1497
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,900
I say, by the way, the bad news is not having E four doesn't mean you are not

1498
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,380
susceptible to this disease.

1499
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,660
So you still need to pay attention.

1500
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:27,980
I think that individual risk needs to be calculated individually.

1501
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,980
I said before, oh, three, three, I'm worried.

1502
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,980
Well, you know, I don't want people who are listening to say, Oh, wait, I thought

1503
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,700
three three was good.

1504
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,140
Yes.

1505
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,620
For the grand vast majority of people, three three is good, but I need to know

1506
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:39,820
what your other genes are.

1507
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:45,140
And I take a stupid amount of time doing this through looking at their snips.

1508
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,700
And this is a, you know, research clinical complicated takes eight hours of Holly's

1509
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,140
time, four hours of my time, and then a whole lot of like cerebral, whatever.

1510
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:58,900
Looking at Tom 40, Tom 40 has, uh, we don't have a commercial test that we can

1511
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,620
test for it.

1512
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,820
There is a way to do it if we send it somewhere, but we really never went there.

1513
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,260
We pull it out of Prometheus.

1514
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,060
Do you guys do that?

1515
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,780
I may be getting this wrong, but I don't think all it depends on where

1516
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,980
the genetic test was done.

1517
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,380
And you won't be able to do this out of 23 and me anymore.

1518
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,340
Unfortunately, with through Prometheus.

1519
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:14,620
Yeah.

1520
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,260
You can no longer take 23 and me data into Prometheus and get this degree of

1521
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,860
fidelity anymore, which thanks FDA.

1522
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,580
If you're listening.

1523
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,220
Wait.

1524
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:27,980
So my understanding of was that the 23 and me no longer has an API or like a way

1525
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:32,060
to transmit the data, but you can still download the data from 23 and me and then

1526
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,380
re upload it to Prometheus and still get the same report.

1527
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:35,740
Okay.

1528
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,700
If that's true, that makes me feel better.

1529
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,460
We'll confirm that.

1530
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,340
I hope that's the case.

1531
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:42,620
We we've only done this once for citizen scientists out there.

1532
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:46,380
I talked to your doctor and don't do this at home, but one back of the napkin way

1533
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:51,220
to Google your genome is to do 23 and me download the data file, upload it to a

1534
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,180
service like Prometheus and then basically filter, filter, filter.

1535
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,220
I mean, we've been working with you and we've come up with basically the snips

1536
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:02,660
for everything that we see in the literature that is a high risk.

1537
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,660
And then we run like kind of an ad panel.

1538
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:06,660
You know, it's interesting.

1539
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,660
We only do this for patients who are E4.

1540
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,300
I guess we should be doing this for every patient.

1541
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,260
Family history of ad.

1542
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:11,460
Yeah.

1543
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:11,780
Yeah.

1544
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:11,900
Yeah.

1545
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:11,980
Yeah.

1546
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,420
Exactly.

1547
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,140
That's a good point.

1548
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,140
But it's interesting.

1549
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,620
You know, it speaks to another controversy that we won't get into, which is like

1550
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:23,980
information, you know, I mean, I've been scolded by physicians for measuring APO

1551
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,860
E4 and telling a patient that they have an APO E4.

1552
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,140
I won't go into that.

1553
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,900
So what is it about APO E4 that's so special?

1554
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,940
Why is it getting all this attention?

1555
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:36,500
I mean, aside from the epidemiology, which we've just discussed, what is it doing or

1556
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,500
not doing that is increasing risk?

1557
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:43,500
So APO E plus age, higher likelihood of amyloid.

1558
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:49,180
Then you add in gender, women plus APO E plus 65 and over much higher likelihood

1559
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:49,700
of amyloid.

1560
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:55,860
So again, it's a poly not just a polygenic, but a poly risk, whatever it amplifies or

1561
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,060
increases the likelihood of amyloid deposition.

1562
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,820
So you just brought up something interesting, which was the question of females.

1563
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,340
I've always found it hard to believe that the increased risk women see is explained

1564
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,580
only by their age, meaning their survival advantage over men.

1565
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,460
Do you, I mean, this, I think I know what my answer is.

1566
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,180
But I'm, I don't want to, what's the term I want to lead the witness.

1567
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,860
What is your view for why you think women are at a higher risk than men?

1568
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,580
All things equal.

1569
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,780
Well, you know, you can take different roads to Alzheimer's disease.

1570
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:28,100
Diabetes will put you in the fast lane and this and that women are definitely in the

1571
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,220
express lane and why are they in the express lane?

1572
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:34,260
I think it has something to do with ensure there's something about life course and,

1573
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,780
you know, having lots of children versus less children that can impact the two.

1574
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:41,380
And there's a whole variety of things, you know, more strata, you know, whatever

1575
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,140
does your study you want to read to attribute this.

1576
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:52,100
But my feeling is the perimenopause transition has bioenergetic impacts on the brain.

1577
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:57,580
And, you know, I believe that Alzheimer's disease is a mitochondrial based disease.

1578
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:01,940
My, the mitochondria, the battery of the cell, the mitochondria can cause all sorts

1579
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:07,500
of bad diseases from Parkinson's to ALS to whatever Huntington's, possibly actually

1580
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,380
that that's something separate.

1581
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:12,540
So long story short, people think of Alzheimer's as amyloid and tau.

1582
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,060
I think amyloid is the garbage that accumulates.

1583
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,380
And if you don't take the garbage out, you're going to get sick.

1584
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,540
But the upstream effect is mitochondrial dysfunction.

1585
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:25,340
And there's something about the mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways.

1586
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,340
I'll just talk in generalities because I'm not an expert at this.

1587
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:32,660
But I think there's something about the perimenopause transition, the bioenergetic

1588
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:38,780
shifts in the brain that are fast forwarding a woman to Alzheimer's disease.

1589
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,100
So I think it's hormonal.

1590
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,580
How do we intervene?

1591
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:47,860
Meaning you believe that it's the withdrawal of sex hormones that is accelerating

1592
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:55,060
the process of either mitochondrial decline or something that is leading to

1593
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:58,500
the accumulation of waste product being manifested as amyloid and tau.

1594
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:03,180
Yeah, it's brain aging accelerator due to the menopause transition.

1595
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:06,820
And that's why I think that the where we're going with our research and we have a

1596
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:11,460
whole sub research program to look at this is what is the critical window of

1597
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:12,700
opportunity to intervene?

1598
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,220
Now, how do we intervene?

1599
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:18,060
And when are the key questions you intervene before menopause, perimenopause?

1600
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:18,860
When do you intervene?

1601
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,140
What do you do?

1602
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,860
What progesterone estrogen?

1603
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,780
Should you use a pill or a cream or a patch?

1604
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,300
Do you use it for two years, five years, seven years?

1605
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:30,260
Do you have to balance the decision based on breast cancer and other things that

1606
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,620
have been blood clots and smoking?

1607
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:37,340
So I go by my gut in almost all things medical and can say that my understanding

1608
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:40,220
of this is kind of like if I had to use a television analogy, maybe we're at the

1609
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,500
black and white television, but at least we can see a picture.

1610
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:47,500
We're not at color and we're not at high def, but I think that my understanding is

1611
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,940
evolving and I think it has to do with brain bioenergetic pathways and an

1612
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,700
individual woman's risk versus a man's.

1613
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,780
Now that's interesting because you also brought up Alzheimer's disease has been

1614
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,860
referred to as type three diabetes or brain diabetes, which of course is also an

1615
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,220
energetics pathway.

1616
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:09,820
So that would suggest that there seemed to be at least two, maybe three or more

1617
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:13,540
completely distinct, which is not to say there's no overlap between these, but

1618
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:16,460
paths towards the disease, because the other one we didn't even talk about was

1619
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,340
a vascular path.

1620
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:17,900
Two or three.

1621
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,860
I think there's like 12 or 16.

1622
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,740
I mean, I talk because I'm sort of a simpleton on this topic.

1623
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:26,900
I generally refer to it as three or four different paths to the same place where

1624
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,500
you have the same final common pathway.

1625
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:33,300
Everybody's accumulating amyloid beta and tau, but you can get there through

1626
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:38,380
microvascular disease, which then becomes basically a disease of hypoxia.

1627
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:42,980
You can get there through diabetes, which then becomes an energetic problem.

1628
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,820
You can get there as you described through a separate sort of mitochondrial

1629
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,620
dysfunction.

1630
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,780
I mean, you can think of a dozen things that could lead to mitochondrial

1631
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,180
dysfunction among them.

1632
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:56,780
The one you describe, which to me strikes me as the Occam's razor explanation for

1633
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:00,300
why women would disproportionately have this difference from men.

1634
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,820
There's this great paper about this by Shelky and Attia.

1635
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:04,500
I've read it.

1636
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:04,980
It's great.

1637
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,140
You know, there was an interesting paper, Richard, about three years ago.

1638
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,900
It was a very small paper.

1639
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,900
I don't even remember how many women were in it, but I remember it was surprisingly

1640
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:20,820
small and it was, if I recall, also heterogeneous in ApoE type.

1641
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:26,220
And it asked the question if you took these women who were either perimenopausal

1642
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:31,060
or early menopausal and you treated them with HRT, did you improve cognitive

1643
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,940
performance? If I believe the result of that study was you did only in the

1644
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:38,820
women that had an E4 gene, but not in the women that did not, to which my

1645
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:43,300
interpretation was maybe you were just underpowered to detect a difference in

1646
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,860
the non E4s, but because the E4s come with another risk, you didn't need that

1647
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,060
many women to see the benefit.

1648
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:53,220
So is it your practice today in the clinic to use hormone replacement therapy

1649
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,340
in perimenopausal women?

1650
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,900
Yeah, this is a tricky one.

1651
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,940
You know, I know what I know and I know what I don't know.

1652
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,980
And I have a very specific scope of practice.

1653
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,580
I've never prescribed statins.

1654
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:05,420
I've never, I don't treat cholesterol per se, although actually thanks to you and

1655
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:08,580
others, I've learned a lot about plant sterols versus Zetia.

1656
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,980
And you know, I'll make tacit suggestions and I'll use Omega 3s and that kind of

1657
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:13,700
thing with cholesterol.

1658
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,700
Same thing with hormones.

1659
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,820
I would never prescribe.

1660
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:20,500
Do you have physicians that you that are willing to work alongside you in these

1661
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,060
areas?

1662
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,740
I mean, I have preventative cardiologists that we see eye to eye.

1663
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,900
I have primary care doctors that I can see eye to eye with.

1664
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:31,900
I have one reproductive endocrinologist in Texas who we see eye to eye and we

1665
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,820
speak the same language.

1666
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,940
I don't really have an endocrinologist or a hormone doctor that I can refer

1667
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:42,140
patients to where we can have cogent conversations because I think the area is

1668
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:42,780
just so hazy.

1669
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,180
The level of evidence is so hazy.

1670
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:48,020
And I'll just tell you my, you said APOE4 may have something to do with.

1671
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,700
I also think metabolic status has something to do with this.

1672
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:54,780
Roberta Brinton has looked at, you know, women with vascular risk, so high

1673
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,740
cholesterol, diabetes, you know, high blood sugar, whatever, that maybe those

1674
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:01,540
patients are the one that respond preferentially to hormone replacement

1675
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:06,100
therapy, but there's a lot of precision medicine in here that is very hazy.

1676
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:12,100
That being said, my kind of off the shelf answer would be women early on in the

1677
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,460
perimenopause transition for the first two, five, maybe seven years.

1678
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,860
Hormone replacement may be a good idea.

1679
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:22,180
I just, it probably is a good idea, but I just don't know if you need to take a

1680
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:27,380
pill, which pill, what ratio of what to what, and is a cream probably better.

1681
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:30,700
I may gear towards the ladder, but I actually just don't know.

1682
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,340
There's a study with out pregnant alone, which I think is going to be very

1683
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:33,940
interesting.

1684
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,860
So I just, I have strong feelings about this.

1685
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,580
So we're going to go have dinner after this.

1686
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:44,020
We're going to talk for probably two hours, just about this topic.

1687
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,460
This is a huge passion of mine.

1688
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,860
And I know what's happening right now.

1689
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:50,740
Someone's listening to this and they're going, wait, just tell us the end.

1690
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,860
And no, I don't want to get into, I don't want to jump on my soapbox about this

1691
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,660
because I want to come back to talking about this.

1692
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:59,540
So you alluded to one of the most interesting things in your clinic.

1693
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,020
Now, I don't know.

1694
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:04,900
Are we, is the manuscript submitted so that I'm talking about the matrix of MTHFR

1695
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:09,540
by ApoE biomarker versus cognitive thing that is that submitted?

1696
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,220
We literally have such as just give you a brief snapshot.

1697
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:16,860
So we started the Alzheimer's prevention clinic in 2013 took about a year and a

1698
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:20,860
half, just under two years to get the IRB approvals and get all of our ducks in a

1699
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:23,740
row with getting the cognitive assessments and the IRB approved and whatever.

1700
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:29,540
So since March of 2015, um, less three and a half years in change, we've been

1701
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,740
recruiting patients into a registry where we basically follow patients across

1702
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:37,460
primary prevention, secondary prevention, and tertiary prevention of Alzheimer's

1703
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:38,220
disease dimension.

1704
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,380
And I can define those in a minute.

1705
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:46,260
So when we have this data, we are deep, deep, deep in the data analysis phase.

1706
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:52,940
And we literally have no joke and over a thousand pages of results, data tables,

1707
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,380
graphs, and I've only scratched the surface.

1708
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,780
So let's explain the intervention.

1709
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,620
Taking a step back, you're saying, look, we're going to stratify

1710
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:06,140
patients by four things, one genetics, and the genes you looked at were ApoE and MTHFR.

1711
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,380
Can you say a little bit about MTHFR for the listener?

1712
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:10,020
MTHFR is confusing.

1713
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,860
When I started the program, I thought MTHFR was a whole bunch of whatever.

1714
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,460
And now I don't believe that anymore.

1715
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:19,140
MTHFR is methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase gene, something like that.

1716
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,580
MTHFR, if you have multiple mutations.

1717
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,860
Do you know how many patients have come to me and said on their test, when they

1718
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,860
look at MTHFR, they're like, why does it say motherfucker?

1719
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,300
I'm like, no, actually it's methyl tetra.

1720
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:33,740
Exactly.

1721
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,500
So it's quite an interesting gene.

1722
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,980
You can Google and find all sorts of stuff out there, but MTHFR does have a

1723
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:44,700
role in Alzheimer's risk, but to me it is, you know, how you can take different

1724
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,580
roads to Alzheimer's.

1725
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,700
It's one of those roads.

1726
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,940
It's a metabolic road through homocysteine.

1727
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,380
I mean, is that what your hypothesis is?

1728
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:50,940
Exactly.

1729
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,180
Yeah.

1730
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:55,420
And basically methylation, detoxification, you know, whatever word you want to use.

1731
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,300
I don't love using these words because I just, it's very hazy.

1732
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:03,500
But if you have multiple mutations, two mutations in one of your main MTHFR

1733
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,020
genes, a 6, 7, 7 gene, you know, and this is the back of the napkin.

1734
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:11,580
I'm not sure if this is technically correct, but just for listeners, the person

1735
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,820
may have problems or be inefficient at metabolizing B vitamins.

1736
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:20,220
And because of that, they're in the downstream cascade of biochemistry.

1737
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,500
Homocysteine goes up and it's a marker for something not working efficiently and

1738
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,380
well and detoxifying, whatever you want to say.

1739
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:31,660
When it comes to MTHFR, homocysteine in people with Alzheimer's risk, and this

1740
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:35,980
is precision medicine, where if someone has an elevated homocysteine, but they're

1741
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:40,060
treated with B vitamins, they can slow overall brain atrophy and improve memory.

1742
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:44,220
However, that will only work if you have optimized omega-3 fatty acids.

1743
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:49,100
So this precision component of understanding the person's individual biology is necessary

1744
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:53,500
because if you don't have high homocysteine, you probably don't need this stuff.

1745
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,100
You probably don't need B complex vitamins.

1746
01:22:55,100 --> 01:23:00,780
So in this case, MTHFR is helpful in terms of looking at the gene because if someone is

1747
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,780
taking the regular B vitamins, if you look on a B12, it says cyanocobalamin.

1748
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,980
If you look at folic acid, it says folic acid.

1749
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,100
We're giving the person extra folic acid and cyanocobalamin.

1750
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,540
We're giving them the B vitamins, but their homocysteine is not coming down.

1751
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,180
They may need a more metabolically active form.

1752
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:20,860
And there's different racemic mixtures and there's different biochemical, blah, blah,

1753
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:24,140
blah, that we can talk about in different forms and different companies that make it.

1754
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:28,940
Actually, the company that I use for my practice, you told me about because literally, reliably,

1755
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,580
it's in that little bottle and the yellow bottle.

1756
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:32,140
It always works.

1757
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,340
It always works.

1758
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:34,460
It absolutely always works.

1759
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,780
And you can do the prescription version.

1760
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,380
That actually probably always works too.

1761
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,780
It's just a little more expensive, but definitely always works.

1762
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:44,620
So I'm going around the block to get across the street because it's complicated.

1763
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,940
But when a person is not responding to traditional B vitamins, I will then

1764
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:57,580
step it up and give them methylcobalamin B12 and methylfolic, whatever, folic acid,

1765
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:02,620
methyltetrahydrofolate, whatever version of folic acid and the combination that is

1766
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,940
usually enough to get the homocysteine down.

1767
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:11,180
So this is a nice example of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics in our Alzheimer's

1768
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:11,980
prevention practice.

1769
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,460
And I think the table or the image that you're referring to is when we basically

1770
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,580
take all of our patients and we map different people with different genes,

1771
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,940
do they respond to different things?

1772
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:21,340
That's right.

1773
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:27,820
It's every the X axis would be, or the top of the table would be each of the APO-E

1774
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:28,620
combinations.

1775
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,300
So here's all six of them.

1776
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:35,180
And then each of the MTHFR combinations, there's two genes, four combos per gene.

1777
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,060
So eight of those.

1778
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:41,340
And then it's basically in response to the lifestyle intervention program,

1779
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:46,300
where did we see an improvement along which biomarkers and or which element of cognitive

1780
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:46,620
testing?

1781
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,180
But I guess just to be clear, we're not going to be able to show that table here.

1782
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,140
That's not yet published.

1783
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:50,540
Right.

1784
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,420
Oh, no, no.

1785
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,740
I mean, that's on page 700 to 900.

1786
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,220
Yeah.

1787
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,660
So, you know, the first paper that we got except I show that to patients all the time,

1788
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,500
but I mean, that poster is great.

1789
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,260
Yeah, that's a poster we presented last year.

1790
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,220
But you have to put the cart before the horse or whatever that saying is.

1791
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,780
But first, you have to get the methods paper published.

1792
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:09,580
And this is pretty amazing that we got this published in the Alzheimer's

1793
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,900
and dementia journal, Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.

1794
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,700
And this is currently available, just recently published.

1795
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:18,940
Yeah, we'll link to anything and everything that you let us my primary care doctor who

1796
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,060
you got to meet in Miami.

1797
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,780
This guy, Dr. Wolf, you guys are like two peas in a pod.

1798
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,900
He basically said, Oh, this is your manifesto like that's not my manifesto.

1799
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,060
It's just, you know, whatever, but he called it the manifesto.

1800
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,660
It's 11,000 words of everything you need to know about how to manage a patient for

1801
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,780
Alzheimer's prevention.

1802
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:36,460
And we've created a free will be accepted in one journal article.

1803
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:39,100
It's 3000 words, 3500 words in the main thing.

1804
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,580
And then we have all the rest in the appendices.

1805
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:41,900
Yep.

1806
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,660
And I can't believe it, but it was all accepted.

1807
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,340
And it took seven months.

1808
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,700
But basically, we've actually since this is hard to read an 11,000 word article,

1809
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:54,380
we've actually created a free online CME course for physicians, basically using this.

1810
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,660
Will that be ready by November?

1811
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:55,820
Yes.

1812
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,220
So alzu.org you will make sure we absolutely link to that.

1813
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,060
Is there value in there for patients as well?

1814
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,740
So alzu.org is a free site that is for the public.

1815
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:10,460
So for the late public, if you want to learn everything about what is and what is not in

1816
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:15,660
our control about Alzheimer's disease, alzu.org is a completely free site to learn about everything.

1817
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,260
Then there's the healthcare provider page.

1818
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:21,340
If you go to the little healthcare provider tab and you type in your information, you can

1819
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:25,020
then enroll in the healthcare provider course and actually receive CME credit for it.

1820
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,420
So there's actually a valuable CME course out there.

1821
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,700
Like, are they not the most useless, idiotic things on the face of the earth?

1822
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,820
I mean, once in a while you find a gem like this.

1823
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,380
Hey, yeah.

1824
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:38,540
And every time I do a CME course on nutrition, I have to deliberately answer the questions

1825
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,460
incorrectly to pass the test.

1826
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:40,940
Right.

1827
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:41,740
Yeah.

1828
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,180
CME is one of those things.

1829
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:48,620
We've tried to really use CME to our effect because no one knows about this stuff.

1830
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,500
Doctors just don't know.

1831
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,060
Well, that's great.

1832
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:51,740
You know, we're trying to get the word out.

1833
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,020
We got the methods paper out.

1834
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:55,020
That's done explaining the intervention.

1835
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,780
Let's explain it sort of at a high level.

1836
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:59,820
The intervention is a lifestyle intervention that is multimodal.

1837
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,780
Patients are stratified, as I said, by genetics.

1838
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:05,180
So you have an MTHFR-APOE.

1839
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:07,020
You also have an anthropometric.

1840
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,140
We try to keep it simple.

1841
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,860
So the ABCs of Alzheimer's prevention management.

1842
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,980
It sounds kitschy, but I really think ABCs actually fit.

1843
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,260
So A is anthropometric.

1844
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,140
We look at body fat.

1845
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,100
We look at lean mass.

1846
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,780
We look at visceral fat.

1847
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,900
Where is the fat?

1848
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,100
You know, I learned a lot of this stuff.

1849
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,220
We really take a deep dive.

1850
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,900
It's not just about weight and BMI.

1851
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,020
Like that's just like the worst.

1852
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:25,980
No, it's about body fat.

1853
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,740
Where's the fat metabolically active?

1854
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:28,780
Yada, yada.

1855
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:34,460
Then the B is for biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers, specifically cholesterol markers,

1856
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,900
especially the deeper dive.

1857
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,980
I just want to take my hat off to you, Richard.

1858
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:43,100
You do more detailed lipid profiling than most cardiologists do.

1859
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,700
I remember the first time I sat down with you, I was fully expecting you to just whip

1860
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,780
out like the LDL, HDL, triglycerides, or this.

1861
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,740
And you went deep.

1862
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:55,820
I mean, you had APO-B. You had LDL-P. You had particle subtype.

1863
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,420
You really got into it.

1864
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:03,740
And I was like, why is the neurologist knowing all of this stuff when every cardiologist seems

1865
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:05,900
to like still be in the dark ages on this?

1866
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:06,700
That drives me crazy.

1867
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,100
You know, it's interesting.

1868
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:11,100
We have four cardiologists now in the practice, actually one who listens to the podcast.

1869
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,460
I give him a shout out.

1870
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,500
She probably shouldn't say his name.

1871
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,380
Yeah, let's not say his name.

1872
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:14,860
What's up?

1873
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,580
Really great guy.

1874
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:19,660
Actually, he's been a great, he's a patient, but he's been a mentor and a teacher to me too.

1875
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,500
And you know, we have cardiologists in the practice.

1876
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,620
And one who's like totally anti, like, what are you ordering?

1877
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:27,660
And he's still anti all that stuff, but he really wants to know his numbers.

1878
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,020
And he really wants me to interpret it.

1879
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,340
But for his patients, you know, I don't use this stuff.

1880
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,580
What are some of the other biomarkers you focus on?

1881
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:37,580
So the four main categories are cholesterol, but deep dive cholesterol, inflammation.

1882
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:41,500
However, there's just four inflammation labs and they're just not great, but it's just in our panel.

1883
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,780
So what are you looking at besides CRP and fibrinogen?

1884
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,340
Do you look at IL-1 or IL-6, TNF?

1885
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,300
Yeah, I wish.

1886
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,500
Yeah, baby steps.

1887
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:54,460
It's myeloporoxidase and LP-PLA2, which I don't exactly know what to do with.

1888
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:58,460
But yeah, fibrinogen, interesting and high sensitivity CRP.

1889
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,780
Now that I see all the results in our outcomes,

1890
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:06,140
HSCRP is probably the most informative, but you know, something like myeloporoxidase is a

1891
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,940
risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment later.

1892
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:09,820
That's a new study.

1893
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:13,260
So I don't exactly know what to do with the inflammatory markers, but we're checking them.

1894
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,980
And what stands in the way of adding some interleukins to that?

1895
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,500
Some of the money, Benjamin's.

1896
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:22,620
I would love to get better nutritional biomarkers, which we'll talk about.

1897
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,660
We do it in the serum.

1898
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:27,020
We absolutely need to do it in the red blood cell, but we need to send it to a different place

1899
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,220
in a different FedEx account.

1900
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,020
And this is the thing.

1901
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,940
Can I just, I'm just going to get back on my soapbox.

1902
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,500
God damn it.

1903
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,380
I'm allowed to do this.

1904
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,860
I guess this is the one perk of having your show.

1905
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:39,020
If you're listening to this and you're in some way touched by Alzheimer's disease,

1906
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,340
either because you have a family member who's got it or you're concerned about

1907
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:45,100
or anything like that, and you're considering like funding research in Alzheimer's disease,

1908
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:49,020
I can't emphasize enough the importance of funding the type of research that Richard does,

1909
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,340
whether that means funding Richard directly or somebody else, because

1910
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:55,420
Alzheimer's prevention is so underfunded.

1911
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:59,260
It is an embarrassment to this disease state.

1912
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:04,300
And so, and I've had patients who have said to me, you know, a loved one just passed away and

1913
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:07,740
I'd like to throw $100,000 at something for Alzheimer's research.

1914
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:11,500
And I think to myself, luckily, those patients like to give that money to you because you can

1915
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,420
do more with $100,000 in your clinic.

1916
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:13,900
Immediately.

1917
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:20,220
$100,000 doesn't buy you five animals to do a study on a drug that has a 99.6%

1918
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,060
chance of not working.

1919
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:23,500
Let me repeat that.

1920
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:29,500
The success rate of pharmacology for Alzheimer's disease is 0.4%.

1921
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:38,380
In other words, 99.6 of drugs brought forth to treat Alzheimer's disease are abject failures.

1922
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,980
Now, if you are interested in the philanthropic side of Alzheimer's disease and you want to put

1923
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:47,660
more money in that pot, you must ask yourself the question, which is what is the definition

1924
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:48,540
of crazy?

1925
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:52,620
Is it throwing more money into the same pile that's taking the same approach to a disease

1926
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:58,300
that's not working or is it possibly looking to this novel idea of Alzheimer's prevention?

1927
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:58,700
Okay.

1928
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,460
Rent over off the soapbox.

1929
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,100
Let's go back.

1930
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:01,580
And it's funny.

1931
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:11,100
Like if I would have had $75,000 more three years ago, I would have had the right biomarkers.

1932
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,300
So I could definitively say about which Omega three, which this, which that I could have

1933
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:21,660
for $75,000, you know, we've gone through $8 million in five years.

1934
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:22,220
Okay.

1935
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,580
It's not too bad actually.

1936
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:28,060
I mean, for a major research program, 5 million of it, philanthropy, 3 million NIH and other grants,

1937
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,140
$75,000 extra.

1938
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:35,180
I could have definitive evidence about which Omega three is to take is it ALA, DHA, EPA.

1939
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:39,340
I think it's DHA and EPA, but I wasn't doing the right biomarkers because I couldn't afford the

1940
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,060
right tests.

1941
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:46,140
So for the littlest tiny investments, you know, we have a data set with 3,000 pieces of data on

1942
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:47,020
every patient.

1943
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:49,900
We have such a deep phenotypic characterization.

1944
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,660
I have thousands of pages of data.

1945
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,180
I don't know how I'm going to write this up.

1946
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:57,100
I need to hire two full-time people for $50,000 per person.

1947
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,780
We can churn out papers, you know, two papers every few months.

1948
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:04,940
So the take home point is in an imprecise world, in an imperfect world where I don't have unlimited

1949
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:07,020
funds, we have to be cautious.

1950
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:11,580
So we've done the best we can, but oh man, I wish if we could have TNF, Alpha and DeLucans

1951
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,540
and CD fifties and I wish we could do it.

1952
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,660
And I think the way to think about this, again, if you're listening to this and you're

1953
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:22,460
trying to understand how should funding be allocated, you have to think about this as

1954
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:23,660
how would you hedge, right?

1955
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:28,380
So I'm not suggesting for a moment that no effort should be made at doing research around

1956
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,500
Alzheimer's treatment.

1957
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:33,900
I mean, the disease is devastating and you don't have to meet but one person who suffers

1958
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:38,620
from this disease to think we should be throwing heaven and earth at figuring out how to treat

1959
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,660
these patients.

1960
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,300
The question is how would you balance that portfolio?

1961
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,340
Because right now that portfolio is about 99 to one.

1962
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:49,900
$9.9 are going into treatment, $0.1 going into prevention.

1963
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,620
I'm asking simply what if it were 90-10?

1964
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:56,700
What if it were $90 that go into treatment and $10 into prevention?

1965
01:32:56,700 --> 01:33:03,340
In reality, I think if it were 10-90, we'd move the needle even more if we were willing

1966
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:06,940
to acknowledge that, hey, a lot of people can't be helped right now, which is an awful

1967
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,300
message to consider.

1968
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:12,620
So anyway, I do think that prevention suffers from a number of things.

1969
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,300
It's way squishier.

1970
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:17,820
There's always going to be a bias against the idea that you can get people to change

1971
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,980
behaviors, lifestyle behaviors.

1972
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:23,100
In other words, it's one thing to get a patient to take their pill.

1973
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:26,380
It's quite another thing to get a patient to change the way they sleep, the way they

1974
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:30,140
meditate, if they do it all, the way they exercise, the way they eat.

1975
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,020
These things are harder to do.

1976
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,020
That's the downside.

1977
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:38,820
That is, if you can do those things, I think the evidence is pointing to you can have a

1978
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,820
much bigger impact.

1979
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:40,820
Oh, yeah.

1980
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:44,380
And if when you do this precision medicine approach where you look at their cholesterol,

1981
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:48,540
inflammation, metabolism, we'll talk about in a second, nutrition biomarkers, genetics,

1982
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:52,820
and you take all these factors and you look at their body fat and you look at their cognitive

1983
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:56,980
function, which we'll talk about, A, Bs, and Cs, you can then give them a personalized

1984
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:02,140
precision medicine plan and they end up getting that right plan.

1985
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:04,660
And then the outcome is better.

1986
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:07,780
And then they're going to have positive reinforcement to where they're going to keep doing it.

1987
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:10,980
I have people that say, I haven't been able to lose weight my whole life.

1988
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:13,100
Are you doing the wrong thing?

1989
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:16,260
You're on elliptical for 20 minutes, three times a week.

1990
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,460
That's not going to get you to lose weight.

1991
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,540
That may get you to maintain yourself a little bit, but not really.

1992
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,060
You need to do high intensity interval training.

1993
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,060
You need to lose body fat.

1994
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,060
Here's your fat.

1995
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,220
Here's your this, here's your that.

1996
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:30,340
When you attack it with knowledge about the non one size fits all approach and the N of

1997
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:35,620
one do everything and everything based on your individual biology and genetics.

1998
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:38,420
That's when a person can have the most success when they have success.

1999
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,420
It's positive reinforcement.

2000
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,420
Yeah.

2001
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,420
And I think seeing those biomarkers improve.

2002
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:47,820
I saw three patients today in clinic and in all cases we're reviewing labs and it's really,

2003
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,820
I love it.

2004
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:49,820
Yeah.

2005
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:52,500
They really like to be able to, especially the ones that dial into this stuff that think,

2006
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,820
Oh wow, look at how this change led to that, but not this.

2007
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,260
And what do I need to do more here?

2008
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:01,460
And I mean, I guess in the end, one of the challenges is you and I both have a luxury

2009
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:06,900
that not, not a lot of doctors too, which is we have small practices that allow us that

2010
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,340
luxury of time.

2011
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:12,700
And so hopefully some of these other tools you're developing will allow physicians to

2012
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:17,940
be able to scale themselves a little bit by saying, look, I, you know, Dr. Smith might

2013
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:22,340
not have as much time as Dr. Isaacson to sit down and spend an hour with each patient going

2014
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,500
over this stuff.

2015
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:28,820
But I can at least point a patient to a tool that can help streamline this process.

2016
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:32,460
When I'm sleeping without any PR without any, everything just because the way the internet

2017
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:37,100
works, when I go to sleep and wake up, my ex-girlfriend with the phone, the phone thing

2018
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:40,900
who I was trying to show off and impress, she said, well, you work so much.

2019
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:45,180
And every time you get a lecture, okay, fine, but make money while you're sleeping.

2020
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:46,180
Well, it's the same thing.

2021
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,220
I want to help people and educate people on sleeping.

2022
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,220
You're right.

2023
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:52,740
I see seven patients in a day, sometimes five because it takes a lot of time.

2024
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:56,940
But when I'm sleeping over a thousand patients are on that free education website with two

2025
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,180
hours of interactive educational content about Alzheimer's prevention.

2026
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,180
That's how we impact lives.

2027
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:07,300
So I'm hoping that we can increase that from a thousand to 8,600 patients while you're

2028
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,300
sleeping.

2029
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,300
I would get the reference.

2030
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,500
We'll get the reference to that.

2031
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,500
So does my pocketbook.

2032
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,500
Absolutely.

2033
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,780
So and it's everything's free and we don't charge for any of the stuff, but that was

2034
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:17,020
an inside joke.

2035
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:20,740
So I guess as we go back to the ABCs and Cs, so the other bio blood biomarkers that we

2036
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:25,100
could probably wax poetic and talk about for another several hours is metabolism because

2037
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:28,980
I believe Alzheimer's disease is a metabolic disease in the vast majority of cases.

2038
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,860
And we look at getting the talk about this.

2039
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,460
Is that becoming a mainstream view yet?

2040
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:36,100
I mean, that was such an out there view six, seven years ago.

2041
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,900
Is it less out there now?

2042
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:42,220
It's hard to ignore the fact that patients with type two diabetes have a disproportionate

2043
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:46,860
risk with the amyloid centric people and the Taoist, the amyloid and Tao people.

2044
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:47,860
The Taoist.

2045
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,860
I mean, that's a sweet title.

2046
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:50,140
That is cool, right?

2047
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,780
I would like to be a Taoist.

2048
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:56,060
I call it amyloid centric, but other people say the Baptist Baptist means Bapenuzumab,

2049
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,700
which is an anti amyloid drug.

2050
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:02,500
Anyway, the Baptist, Taoist, whatever I'm a mitochondrial list or whatever it is.

2051
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,500
What I would say is those people that don't get it, most people don't understand that

2052
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,540
the leaders in the Alzheimer's field that are like leading major initiatives, like two

2053
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,820
of the most major initiatives in Alzheimer's disease.

2054
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:18,540
One is led by actually both are led by non clinical physicians that have never seen an

2055
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,740
Alzheimer's patient.

2056
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:23,060
So box rant number two coming up now.

2057
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:26,860
This would be a good time to hit forward by two minutes if you don't want to hear the

2058
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:27,860
rant.

2059
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:35,340
You know, few things chap my ass more than the leaders in the field treating clinical

2060
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,460
diseases who don't treat patients.

2061
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:43,420
And I often get asked like, do you one day see yourself not actually practicing medicine,

2062
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:47,180
but instead just focusing on the types of research and collaborative things that you

2063
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,180
want to do?

2064
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:49,180
And the answer is always no.

2065
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:53,860
The day you stop seeing patients is the day you stop getting humbled by and reminded of

2066
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:56,580
what the hell you do this for.

2067
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,620
And what you just said is staggering.

2068
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:02,780
Yeah, I would not have guessed that when I found out this one person had no clinical

2069
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:05,300
training and basically did some radiology trash.

2070
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:09,620
I don't want to talk about specifics, but in the other person like a related kind of

2071
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:15,340
field, but not psychiatry, not geriatrics, like not the traditional anything drives you

2072
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,340
crazy.

2073
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:19,660
And then you have this conversation with them or you say, Oh, Hey, nice to meet you.

2074
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,340
And they say, I heard about you.

2075
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,340
Give me the scowl.

2076
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,340
They give me that scowl.

2077
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:28,060
At least they're saying now because you're such a low life neurologist who's like on

2078
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,740
the ground actually touching these patients.

2079
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,740
Yeah.

2080
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,740
I heard about you.

2081
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,180
You're that guy prevention.

2082
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:38,860
At least they're saying multiple shots on goal.

2083
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:41,900
Maybe we need to look at other targets aside from amyloid and tau.

2084
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:42,900
That's at least what they're saying.

2085
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,900
All right.

2086
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:44,900
We'll take that's progress.

2087
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,900
I'll take it.

2088
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,780
They're throwing at me less and less, which is good.

2089
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:48,780
So let's go back to metabolism.

2090
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:52,740
And for a guy who doesn't cook, this is a highly inefficient use of tomatoes.

2091
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:55,540
Like if someone threw a bunch of tomatoes at me, I could make some nice sauce.

2092
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,540
Yeah.

2093
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:58,700
I've turned on my oven once and that was in 2001.

2094
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,780
Before you started storing your textbooks in there?

2095
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,700
My textbooks are that was in 2001.

2096
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:05,500
I started putting my textbooks in there because I had no room in Boston.

2097
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:09,100
I actually, I've put my textbooks and other things in my oven for a long time.

2098
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,500
I live in a tiny apartment.

2099
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:14,060
I have two dogs, two cats, a guy in the couch is a problem.

2100
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,060
You guys got venting.

2101
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,060
I talked to my therapist.

2102
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:20,060
Are you trying to figure out why your fiance hasn't moved to New York yet?

2103
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,060
I wonder why.

2104
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,060
Yeah.

2105
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,060
I have no insight into why.

2106
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,060
And the guy's got long hair.

2107
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,060
Oh no, she's in California.

2108
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,060
She's in California.

2109
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,060
She's in California.

2110
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,060
Yeah.

2111
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:29,060
One of those things.

2112
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,060
We have a bi-coastal dog, cat, whatever.

2113
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,500
A guy in the couch definitely got to go by the time she comes back.

2114
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,900
Is he listening to this?

2115
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,060
No, he's not a podcast listener.

2116
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:39,060
So there's no risk that he's going to be offended by the fact that you said he's got

2117
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,060
to go.

2118
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,060
No, no.

2119
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,060
I don't have to cut that part out.

2120
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,060
No, no.

2121
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,060
I think he's got long hair.

2122
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,060
The hair's everywhere.

2123
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,500
It's just like so messy.

2124
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,980
Anyway, back to metabolism.

2125
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:49,980
Metabolism.

2126
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:50,980
What are you measuring metabolism?

2127
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:52,620
Do you do oral glucose tolerance test?

2128
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:57,300
Well, Dr. Peter Attia has schooled me on this more than one time.

2129
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,960
And I would love to, however we can only do as much as we can do.

2130
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:01,960
You don't have the budget.

2131
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,960
Yeah.

2132
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,960
And the time and the trickiness.

2133
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,060
But sure, I'm not doing everything as precise as I need to.

2134
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:10,300
And you're the one that's taught me about how you can have fluctuations and sugar up

2135
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:14,980
and down, but then the average hemoglobin A1c is normal, but you're missing those other

2136
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:15,980
things.

2137
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:20,540
So we do it better than maybe the average Joe, but we look at hemoglobin A1c.

2138
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,540
We look at home IR.

2139
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:22,940
We look at fasting insulin.

2140
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:26,740
We look at fasting blood glucose, which I really like, even though it's imprecise.

2141
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,700
It just does give me a good snapshot.

2142
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:31,380
We look at adiponectin, which is confusing sometimes.

2143
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:32,820
So these are some of the main...

2144
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:35,260
We used to look at more things and then it was expensive.

2145
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:38,980
So we do the best we can, but then we triangulate.

2146
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,580
So the key here in the ABDC...

2147
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:42,260
Are there any other classes of biomarkers?

2148
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,260
Oh, sorry.

2149
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,260
Nutrition.

2150
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:45,260
Nutrition, yeah.

2151
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,260
So we look at their specific...

2152
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:51,940
This is our problem because we look at saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, DHA, EPA, ALA, all

2153
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:52,940
this sorts of stuff.

2154
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,980
Based on what food frequency question you're in?

2155
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:55,980
No, no, in the blood.

2156
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:56,980
Oh, okay.

2157
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:58,540
You're measuring RBC levels of all of these.

2158
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,140
No, that's the problem.

2159
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:01,140
Measuring serum levels.

2160
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,140
It's a problem.

2161
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,620
Oh yeah, that's a problem.

2162
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:04,620
I know.

2163
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,020
We'll add that to our discussion.

2164
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:11,140
Hence my $75,000 whatever that got sucked away back in 2013.

2165
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:12,700
That was 2015.

2166
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:16,660
We had money for this and then things happen sometimes.

2167
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,540
So what's the C?

2168
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:22,300
The C is as important as the A and the B, and I never would have said this five years

2169
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:27,700
ago or even thought that I would be talking about something this ridiculous, but C is cognitive

2170
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,700
function.

2171
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,300
That doesn't sound ridiculous.

2172
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:35,980
Well, using cognitive function to personalize or individualize a person's care from a biological

2173
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:40,780
perspective, that sounded ridiculous to me five years ago, but we look at processing

2174
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:46,620
speed, attention, memory, executive function, all of these different cognitive domains.

2175
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:49,060
When I see lipids, I now see executive function.

2176
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:52,860
When I see vitamin D and homocysteine, I say, hmm, could that be processing speed?

2177
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:58,780
When I see metabolism problems and high visceral body fat, that's screaming memory, metabolism

2178
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,100
and memory.

2179
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,460
And what we do...

2180
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:02,460
So this is news to me.

2181
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,460
Like I didn't...

2182
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,460
Oh, me too.

2183
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:06,660
So are you seeing this as...

2184
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:10,620
Is this just basically a blind squirrel has found some nuts?

2185
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:13,740
Like you're just digging through your data and these patterns are emerging?

2186
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:14,740
No, not data.

2187
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:15,740
No, this is clinical.

2188
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:16,740
This is clinical observation.

2189
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,900
That's what I made though, because you're still generating clinical data.

2190
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,900
Yeah, this is pre-data analysis.

2191
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:24,660
And some of the data analysis doesn't even hold up with maybe my clinical observations

2192
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,940
because people are different.

2193
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,260
And when you lump Bob and Jim and whoever else together all in the bunch.

2194
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:34,820
So these are just very loose sort of observations that are becoming now testable hypotheses.

2195
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:35,820
Right.

2196
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:39,460
And the testable hypotheses are tricky here because what we do is more traditional statistics.

2197
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:45,500
We do your means and averages and all the fancy least squares means and whatever, Bayesian,

2198
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,580
yada, yada.

2199
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:48,980
But we probably need to be doing N of one studies.

2200
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,500
And N of one is a way to...

2201
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,900
Which brings us back to AI.

2202
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:52,900
Yeah.

2203
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,500
I mean, until you have the AI engine to do this.

2204
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Totally.

2205
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,980
And I was a computer dork in a past lifetime and I would do artificial intelligence with

2206
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,020
my life.

2207
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,420
If I had a billion dollars tomorrow, I would fund my research and get the right people

2208
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,500
on the bus to do all the things I want to do.

2209
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:09,100
And I would focus professionally on programming and artificial intelligence because that's

2210
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,100
how we can really beat this stuff.

2211
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,100
That's another...

2212
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,100
I'm getting on my rant or my...

2213
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,380
That was my soapbox time.

2214
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:19,420
But long story short is N of one people where you can make these associations and you average

2215
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:24,740
it all together in the cohort and it gets too hazy, but metabolism and memory, metabolism

2216
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,700
and learning and memory specifically.

2217
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:31,060
And what we do here, and this is the key, triangulating on the A's, the B's and the

2218
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,060
C's.

2219
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:36,500
So never say, oh, your blood sugar fasting is 97.

2220
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,980
You need to do X, Y, or Z differently.

2221
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,580
No, no, no, no.

2222
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,580
97, that's above 95.

2223
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:45,940
And that's my cutoff of normal for brain health, memory and cognitive function, which is less

2224
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:50,260
than the 100 cutoff, which in med school it was 125 and then 116 in residency.

2225
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:53,020
And now it's 100 and hopefully in five years it'll be 95.

2226
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:57,220
I don't know what you think a fasting blood sugar is appropriate in terms of a reference

2227
01:43:57,220 --> 01:44:01,020
range, but for brain health, I think it's 95 based on some work from Germany.

2228
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:04,660
So what we do is we take the A's, the B's and the C's, we triangulate the information.

2229
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:11,440
Only then do you make a clinical decision and you can't just treat based on one.

2230
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,700
You have to interpolate everything.

2231
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:16,600
And when you do that, that's when you can come up with the clinical precision medicine

2232
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,600
plan.

2233
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,740
So what cutoffs are you using on your lipids these days?

2234
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:21,180
Let's just go with LDL particle.

2235
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:26,300
Oh gosh, this is confusing because I don't want to talk about bimodal curves and maybe

2236
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:29,060
people with too high HDLs can be bad.

2237
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:32,780
And I mean, there's a lot of complexity here and it's an individual and this is a phenotype

2238
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:33,780
thing.

2239
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:37,260
Like I just see C-TEP, C-E-T-P cholesterol, ester, transfer, whatever.

2240
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:41,220
I don't know what that gene is called, but I can see that the person has the gene because

2241
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:45,380
I can feel it in my gut and I can look at the labs and I can just, I can see.

2242
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:49,100
Based on their HDL cholesterol, you mean, or the combination of their HDL particle and

2243
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,380
their HDL cholesterol and size?

2244
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:54,420
It's really hard for me to give generalities because there are certain people where the

2245
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:56,580
rules don't apply or the rules apply backwards.

2246
01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:01,820
So LDL cutoff, sure, absolutely below 100, I'd love below 70.

2247
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:02,820
What about in the particle?

2248
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:08,780
Sub a thousand, but 600, 500 better than 800 or 900 maybe, but I don't really know for

2249
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:09,780
sure.

2250
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:14,380
And are you concerned that statin use, even though at the population level, statin use

2251
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:18,580
is always associated with a lower risk of dementia that in certain individuals it can

2252
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:19,580
exacerbate it?

2253
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:21,020
I hate to say this, but yes.

2254
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:24,540
And five years ago I would have said, heck no, statin should be in the drinking water.

2255
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:28,100
I'm very pro-statin period.

2256
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:29,460
Just like you said, population based.

2257
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:35,740
I'm very pro-statin because of this clinical observation where you see patient after patient

2258
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:39,500
after patient and you see genotype and then phenotype and whatever.

2259
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,020
I do believe that different statins work differently in different people.

2260
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,500
I think there's a gender difference.

2261
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,500
I think when in doubt, low dose is better.

2262
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:51,580
I think people with ApoE4 genes, especially two ApoE4 genes, holy cow, you have to be

2263
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:52,580
careful.

2264
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:55,580
I think you were the one that taught me about Livolo and then I learned more about Crestor

2265
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:59,020
and high potency and low potency and lipophilic and blah, blah, blah.

2266
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:03,100
And how atorvastatin showed to be beneficial in men with slowing hippocampal atrophy, but

2267
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,100
not in women.

2268
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:09,820
And I've just seen men change from one cholesterol drug to another because, hey, their numbers

2269
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:13,220
look great, but now their memory got worse.

2270
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:16,500
ApoE4, maybe we need to come down a little bit.

2271
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:21,140
So I am pro-statin period and I think I'm pro-statin.

2272
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:24,580
Let me just say that, but I'm anti one size fits all.

2273
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:25,580
Yeah.

2274
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:30,460
I think this is one of those things in medicine that I think is very hard for people to understand,

2275
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:34,860
which is how can something like a statin potentially be good and potentially be bad?

2276
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:40,220
And the reality of it is it can be very positive from a vascular standpoint, can be positive

2277
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,860
from an inflammatory standpoint.

2278
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:46,820
It could be negative from a cholesterol biosynthesis standpoint in a susceptible individual.

2279
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:51,820
And so, I mean, like you, I consider myself pro everything under the right conditions.

2280
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:58,640
I'm pro-hammers when I have a nail and a piece of wood, but I'm pro-Philip screwdriver when

2281
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,980
I have a Phillips screw and a piece of drywall.

2282
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:01,980
Perfect.

2283
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:02,980
Yeah, that's a great point.

2284
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:07,740
So then there's plant sterols and Zeti and this and that and Omega-3s and I'd like Omega-3s

2285
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,740
to get down.

2286
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:10,540
And you mentioned earlier on the Omega-3 front.

2287
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:13,740
I mean, I think in the last year and a half, actually during the time when we were writing

2288
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:18,060
that manuscript, I think it became a little bit more clear that it might even be the DHA.

2289
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:22,460
And it works better in E4s, but it just takes years to work, to have the most robust.

2290
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:26,340
Takes two and a half years, I think, to recycle the amount of DHA in a person's brain.

2291
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:29,660
So when you study it for six months, then you're only getting 20% of the effects.

2292
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:30,660
I'm sorry to do it.

2293
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:31,660
It drives me nuts.

2294
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,900
Rant number three soapbox again.

2295
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:40,020
When someone says such and such an agent was studied and it had no effect, should you immediately

2296
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:46,540
dismiss the intervention only if you can be confident that it was studied correctly

2297
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:51,080
and that the time course of the disease and the intervention were appropriately matched.

2298
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:55,460
And it's that latter point that almost always seems to be the missing link.

2299
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,300
And that's a great example of that.

2300
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:01,660
Frankly, half the primary prevention studies in disease, I think, missed the mark because

2301
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:04,340
they don't understand the time course of the disease that's being studied.

2302
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:07,940
And the other part about this is, you know, if you do this one size of its own, you give,

2303
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:12,620
say, Omega-3s to everybody, but people with high Omega-3s maybe don't need it, but then

2304
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:13,860
they lump the results together.

2305
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,860
Well, guess what?

2306
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:16,140
The study is going to be negative.

2307
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:19,940
Maybe you should have just given you Omega-3s to people that actually needed it.

2308
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,900
And that would have been your enrollment criteria.

2309
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,460
Then your outcome would have been different.

2310
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:29,620
So precision medicine in this whole one size fits all thing is just, you know, very dichotomous.

2311
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:34,180
So yeah, we take these ABCs and we generate evidence-based and safe from patient education,

2312
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:39,460
you know, two hours more online, interactive education online for free, patient counseling

2313
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:41,740
with me and Holly.

2314
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:45,340
And then we really type out a whole plan.

2315
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:47,060
And this is four pages, five pages, sometimes six pages.

2316
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:50,580
So in which patients, not to get too tactical, but I know that a lot of people listening

2317
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:53,300
to this are probably chomping at the bit to know some of the things.

2318
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,800
I mean, we've alluded to a number of these things now.

2319
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,660
Another one that's really come on my radar in the last two years is a specific type of

2320
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:01,880
curcumin called thericumin.

2321
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:04,240
Can you talk a little bit about what that is, how it works and why?

2322
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,240
Sure.

2323
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,240
And I have nothing to disclose.

2324
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:11,000
I did a Medscape piece on thericumin and man, I got tomatoes thrown at me in the comment

2325
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
section.

2326
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,320
This one ER doctor in Kansas, hopefully he's not listened to this, actually called him.

2327
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,320
Hopefully he is listening.

2328
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,320
Yeah.

2329
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:20,080
Well, I actually called him to discuss and the secretary in the ER said, all right, we

2330
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,760
don't give your whatever out.

2331
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,360
But you know, I have nothing to disclose and I don't so supplement.

2332
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,120
You don't have a supplement company on the side?

2333
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,120
No, I wish.

2334
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,800
I have hundreds of thousands of student loans.

2335
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,320
My fiance has a 450,000 student.

2336
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,680
I have a recommendation.

2337
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:39,200
If you could start monetizing your bling phones, there might be a way to start putting a dent

2338
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,200
in those.

2339
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,280
This is a very unique audience is interested in these though.

2340
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,360
So I'd have to spend money to find that person.

2341
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:51,320
If you know any oligarchs, that's what usually if you can find a Chinese billionaire, I have

2342
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:55,360
a Chinese Chinese phone and then this white alligator skin one.

2343
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,560
So we want to part with this.

2344
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,640
So you wrote this thing in Medscape about thericumin.

2345
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,800
Yeah.

2346
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,800
And I got in there.

2347
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:01,800
He's trying to sell things.

2348
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,280
So just for just for disclosure, I wish.

2349
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,720
But I've made a conscious decision not to.

2350
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:10,360
I live in a one bedroom apartment with two dogs, two cats and a guy on the couch.

2351
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,280
It's my bathroom is the size of a closet.

2352
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,280
I live in New York City.

2353
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,800
I have tons of loans.

2354
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,760
I am negative when it comes to my net worth since moving to New York five years ago.

2355
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:20,320
I don't need a sob story.

2356
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,320
I have a roof over my head.

2357
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,240
I'm very fortunate, whatever.

2358
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,240
But I am not trying to make money.

2359
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:25,240
I'm not trying to sell stuff.

2360
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:28,600
So although I probably should not not sell my phone though.

2361
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,480
So when it comes to thericumin, it is a specific type that comes from Japan and this Japanese

2362
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:39,240
company from my understanding basically made this nanoparticle small particle version.

2363
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:43,720
Now there are versions of curcumin that may be optimized for absorption and blah, blah,

2364
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,720
blah.

2365
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:48,280
But in the Alzheimer's study by John Ringman and colleagues, when they did a randomized

2366
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:52,240
study on curcumin for mild to moderate Alzheimer's, the study was negative.

2367
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:57,160
But when they did the blood samples, the curcumin was being swallowed and not being absorbed

2368
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:58,160
in the blood.

2369
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,360
I wonder why curcumin didn't work.

2370
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:05,560
So this basically led to this Japanese company putting together this thericumin version,

2371
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,360
nanoparticles, whatever it is.

2372
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:11,640
And a study by Gary Small and colleagues basically showed that after 18 months of using it, when

2373
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:16,560
you look at PET scans, there was less amyloid in the group that got the real optimized.

2374
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:20,880
So does that mean we should be using thericumin even in our non-high risk AD patients that

2375
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,160
we would otherwise be giving curcumin to?

2376
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,920
Precision medicine, no one size fits all.

2377
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,960
So sorry to get back on that.

2378
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:28,960
Soapbox.

2379
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,760
But no, not everyone I don't think needs curcumin.

2380
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,400
I think it depends on what their ABCs are.

2381
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:37,360
If they have some inflammatory stuff, well, I'm not checking the right inflammatory stuff,

2382
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,800
so I can't use that as a biomarker.

2383
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,040
If they have some memory stuff, well, maybe if they're at higher risk and they have an

2384
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,480
EPUB4 gene, maybe.

2385
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,520
What was the dose if they were curcumin in that small study?

2386
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,520
Well.

2387
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,520
Small, meaning the author, not the size.

2388
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,520
Yeah.

2389
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,520
It's two pills a day.

2390
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,520
It's like 500.

2391
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,520
600 maybe.

2392
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,600
It's just two pills a day.

2393
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,600
Read the label, read the study.

2394
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,600
I'm forgetting.

2395
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,600
But it's one pill a day for a week.

2396
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,400
Several companies that sell curcumin now are just one.

2397
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,400
Several companies, yeah.

2398
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,000
So again, I'm not vouching for any brand.

2399
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,680
But as you said earlier, Peter, you taught me which methyl yada yada to use.

2400
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,960
And it works every time.

2401
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,880
And it's like, finally, we have a good version.

2402
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,320
I do vouch for certain.

2403
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:16,520
For the listener, the brand that we've switched to across the board is Jarrows.

2404
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,480
They have a combined lozenge that's methyl folate and methyl B12.

2405
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,040
Yeah, the yellow bottle.

2406
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:23,000
But a little yellow bottle with a pink lozenge.

2407
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,000
So we choose specific supplements because we know that they work and they're verified.

2408
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,120
And we've used them and we can see it jumping in the blood.

2409
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,120
So we know it works.

2410
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,120
Theracumin is...

2411
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,600
Theracumin, I don't even know how to pronounce it.

2412
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,880
I don't think everyone needs to be on it.

2413
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,480
But I do think if you're going to be on it and you have amyloid in your brain, you better

2414
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,520
be on the right stuff.

2415
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,720
So that's important.

2416
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,720
Should someone take more?

2417
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,720
I have no idea.

2418
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:46,960
I've never told someone to take more.

2419
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:52,520
But I have this family, multiple, actually two families, three, that have the ApoE4 gene

2420
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:53,920
and the TNF alpha gene.

2421
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,400
Well, how does Curcumin work?

2422
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,200
They're on the TNF alpha pathway.

2423
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:00,920
What we've been doing is then we can add additional labs that cost money, but you got to do what

2424
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,720
you got to do sometimes.

2425
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,800
And we look at CD50 and other inflammatory markers and TNF.

2426
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,960
And while TNF isn't really changing, for example, in multiple patients that we put on this

2427
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,440
their acurman, the CD50 is increasing.

2428
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:16,080
So I don't exactly know what that means, but I do know that their memory is not getting

2429
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,800
worse and maybe hopefully over time we'll get better.

2430
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,760
So has anybody commented on this rise in CD50?

2431
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,320
I've never really talked about it before.

2432
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:28,400
I mean, you've sent me this data, but is there anything in the literature about CD50?

2433
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,840
I'm not aware.

2434
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,800
My brain can only hold so many things.

2435
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:35,160
I'm a one third preventative cardiologist when I shouldn't be.

2436
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,640
And I have a great guy, Randy Cohen, bless his heart.

2437
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:41,240
He's just been, I email him and he emails you back at 48 hours.

2438
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:43,960
I have this phone a friend list of people that are way smarter than me.

2439
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:47,160
But I'm one third preventative cardiologist, make believe one.

2440
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:49,720
I'm one third neurologist and one third primary care doctor.

2441
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:52,920
And I just can't internalize all this stuff.

2442
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:57,480
So I email you and I have this group of 12 to 15 minutias that just help me for free

2443
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:58,480
and it's amazing.

2444
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,320
So don't know what to say.

2445
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,080
What do you think of as kind of like the five most important things you tell a person?

2446
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:11,120
So let's say you're at a cocktail party and someone finds out what you do for a living.

2447
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:14,880
By the way, when I'm at a cocktail party, if I'm ever asked what I do, there are only

2448
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,880
two responses.

2449
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:17,840
I sell carpet or sofa beds.

2450
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:18,840
That's what my dad did.

2451
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:19,840
That's a great answer.

2452
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,920
I'm either a shepherd or a race car driver.

2453
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,920
You look like a race car driver.

2454
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,600
I thought you were going to say I look like a shepherd.

2455
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:26,600
No.

2456
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,200
Well, you have that sheep thing in the corner over there.

2457
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,200
Yeah.

2458
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,960
The sheep herding stick.

2459
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,960
Race car driver is a great.

2460
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:36,560
It's just a great way to not have to talk about formula one.

2461
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,080
Yeah, I wish.

2462
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:42,960
But let's say you're at the cocktail party, someone corners you in a moment of weakness,

2463
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,780
you explain exactly what you do or they've listened to this podcast and they see your

2464
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,700
picture and then they come up to you and they go, hey, you're Richard Isaacson.

2465
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,780
And they say, look, I'm 30 years old, right?

2466
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,100
I'm as healthy as a horse.

2467
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,580
There is nothing wrong with me.

2468
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:57,860
I couldn't even begin to relate to cognitive impairment.

2469
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:02,020
But my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease when she was 70 years old and by 80

2470
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:03,620
she was dead.

2471
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:07,620
And let's just assume that the patient doesn't know their APOE status or any of these other

2472
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:08,860
things.

2473
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,460
You're not going to see this patient again.

2474
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:14,940
You're at a cocktail party in Los Angeles and you're flying back the next day.

2475
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:20,700
What are five things that you would put in the no regret move list that you could say

2476
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:22,820
to that person even at a general level?

2477
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:28,260
I hate to be general, like too general, but one is knowledge is power.

2478
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:32,780
Learn about brain health now because brain health, incremental changes that you make

2479
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:36,900
now at 30, 40, 50, whatever the earlier the better, but throughout the lifespan, learn

2480
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:37,900
about brain health.

2481
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:40,140
So I will refer them to this website again.

2482
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:42,100
It's free, alz.org.

2483
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:44,620
There's been 1.1 million people that have been on the site.

2484
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:47,860
I'll never be able to treat 100,000 people in my clinic.

2485
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:51,260
So go to the site, learn everything I think possible.

2486
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:52,500
I can't tell you everything at a cocktail party.

2487
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:57,300
Are there diagnostic tests that people can do to get a sense of their own cognitive abilities?

2488
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:58,300
There are.

2489
01:55:58,300 --> 01:55:59,460
We don't give results at this time.

2490
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,340
We have like one test that gives results, but it's for research purposes.

2491
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,660
But it's for tracking.

2492
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:04,660
It's for tracking.

2493
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:07,620
So a patient can say, I'll take the test on ALZU once a year.

2494
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:09,340
There's email reminders to tell you to take it.

2495
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:12,900
And do they get results if their performance deteriorates or do you get a result?

2496
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,740
No, this is for research purposes only.

2497
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,900
So everything's decoded.

2498
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:19,900
So right now we don't give results, but give us a little more time.

2499
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:24,740
And we unfortunately don't have the funding to analyze this 1 million strong cohort because

2500
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:29,380
when you get a million points of data, it's very expensive to analyze and we don't have

2501
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:30,460
the right statistical team.

2502
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:33,980
So step one is at least go and familiarize yourself with all of this information.

2503
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:34,980
Yeah.

2504
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,980
And I'm not trying to be like, go whatever.

2505
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:37,860
I'm not trying to like, everyone wants that.

2506
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:38,860
Like, what do I do now?

2507
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:40,260
Do I, what pills should I take?

2508
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:41,380
How much should I exercise?

2509
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,580
What's the magic dose?

2510
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:45,740
To me, it's like if you're going to really get serious about brain health, it's just

2511
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:47,340
not that simple.

2512
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:50,340
Our intake at the clinic, it's an hour and a half cognitive testing, hour and a half

2513
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:55,100
with me filling out a 45 minute survey, taking courses online before you can even get an

2514
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:56,100
appointment with me.

2515
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,740
You have to do all this pre stuff.

2516
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:59,460
All time intervention is not simple.

2517
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,460
Take the time.

2518
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:03,780
You're going to be watching YouTube or flipping through Facebook or doing whatever the heck

2519
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:07,220
you're doing to waste time on your cell phone late at night.

2520
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:08,220
Take the course online.

2521
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:11,020
You're going to learn things, internalize them, make incremental changes.

2522
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,020
Number one is education.

2523
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:16,500
Nelson Mandela said education is the most powerful tool to change the world.

2524
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:20,260
Whatever the quote was that I mangled, but education is number one.

2525
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22,700
Number two is know your numbers.

2526
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:23,700
What do I do?

2527
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,700
They want me actionable tips.

2528
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:25,700
Actionable tips.

2529
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:26,700
No, take a step back.

2530
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,700
Know your numbers.

2531
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,700
What is your blood pressure?

2532
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:29,700
What is your pulse?

2533
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:30,700
What is your body fat?

2534
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:31,700
What is your weight?

2535
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:32,700
What is your cholesterol?

2536
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,700
What is your blood sugar?

2537
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:35,540
Know everything about yourself.

2538
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:36,540
Your body is a temple.

2539
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:37,620
That's the saying.

2540
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:38,620
Know everything about you.

2541
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,740
You and I use the aura ring, I believe.

2542
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:43,660
I use the WOOP biosensor, nothing to disclose, whatever.

2543
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,660
I know everything about-

2544
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:46,940
I do have something to disclose, which I disclose publicly.

2545
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:49,340
I have invested in aura and I advise them.

2546
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:50,860
So please make sure everybody knows that.

2547
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:51,860
Yeah, of course.

2548
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:55,980
So I want to know everything about my physiology, about my sleep, how many hours, when I go

2549
01:57:55,980 --> 01:58:00,980
to sleep, when I whatever, how much my exercise is, what my strain is, what my output is,

2550
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:03,540
what my average heart rate is, my resting pulse.

2551
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:05,380
I want to know, I'm a data junkie.

2552
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:06,380
Right.

2553
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:07,380
Now the person's ready to spill their drink on you.

2554
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,380
They're like, I got it.

2555
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:10,140
I'm going to memorize the site.

2556
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:11,660
I'm going to learn everything about me.

2557
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:16,220
But I want to know, is there anything that I should be doing more or less of with respect

2558
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:21,180
to exercise, food, sleep, meditation, yoga, supplements?

2559
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,940
Are there any no regret moves?

2560
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:26,340
So exercise is the number one thing any person can do.

2561
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:30,060
The only thing a person can do right now if they have amyloid in their brain to reduce

2562
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,980
it or slow the accumulation is exercise on a regular basis.

2563
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:33,980
Yeah.

2564
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:38,180
When we were writing up what our white paper that eventually became the basis for the paper

2565
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:44,940
we collaborated on, I remember when Dan first presented to me just internally like all of

2566
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:45,940
his findings.

2567
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:49,780
I guess I should take a step back and explain why we did this because I think it provides

2568
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:51,500
an example of how we started working together.

2569
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:55,340
But I remember he said that he was like, Peter, you're not going to like this answer.

2570
01:58:55,340 --> 01:59:00,500
But like there's literally only one thing in the literature that suggests that you have

2571
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:02,780
any hope of mitigating Alzheimer's disease.

2572
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:04,260
And I was like, oh, let me see if I can guess.

2573
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:06,500
And I came up with like 10 guesses and they were all wrong.

2574
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,020
And he goes, no, it's exercise.

2575
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,780
And I was like, OK, I mean, I get that exercise is important.

2576
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:15,940
But are you telling me that in the literature, exercise is the only thing that meets level

2577
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:19,300
one evidence for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?

2578
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:21,460
And look, I mean, that's an important thing to know.

2579
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:22,420
I would say risk reduction.

2580
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:23,420
Yeah, risk reduction.

2581
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:25,620
So again, we could wax philosophically on why.

2582
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:32,340
By the way, the reason we ended up doing this is we read a review article by Dale Bredesen,

2583
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,540
who many of the listeners will probably recognize.

2584
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,580
I don't know, Dale, I've never met him.

2585
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:40,980
I don't even think we've exchanged emails, but we read a paper that was a pretty exhaustive

2586
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:44,700
paper based on his recommendations for Alzheimer's prevention.

2587
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:48,180
And we just wanted to start from first principles.

2588
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:51,420
And there were 200 or so references in the paper.

2589
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:57,460
And poor, I don't know, Dan or Bob or one or two analysts got the task of please go and

2590
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:01,420
get every one of those references and make sure the references line up with what's being

2591
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:04,180
said. And I don't think this is deliberate.

2592
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:06,540
I think this is just the nature of what happens when people are writing papers.

2593
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:09,700
But like we couldn't verify a third of these references.

2594
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:12,820
For example, there was one reference that said take resveratrol.

2595
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:17,140
And we went to that paper and that paper, while it was about resveratrol, it had nothing

2596
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:18,700
to do with resveratrol and Alzheimer's.

2597
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:21,620
So so that's when we decided we just wanted to do this from first principles.

2598
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:23,940
We wanted to go and take a first principles approach.

2599
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:29,140
And we had an unusual methodology, as you recall, which was start from an intervention,

2600
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:32,340
look at an intermediary and understand a mechanistic pathway.

2601
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:35,140
And then how does it lead to the convergence of a final common pathway?

2602
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:38,660
And so in many ways, Dale's work was helpful to get us started.

2603
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,660
But we felt that we wanted to do better.

2604
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:44,580
Could we do better if we were able to abandon everything that had been done?

2605
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:48,740
So exercise, let's go back to the woman at the cocktail party.

2606
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:49,820
She wants to exercise.

2607
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:51,020
Is there a type of exercise?

2608
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:54,140
Do we have any belief that you talked about high intensity training?

2609
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:57,820
Do we believe that that's better than sitting on the elliptical for 30 minutes or going for

2610
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:58,820
a run or lifting weights?

2611
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,660
Here I go again. Not one size fits all.

2612
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:02,380
But know your numbers.

2613
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:03,300
What is your body fat?

2614
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,180
What is your muscle mass?

2615
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,220
Men body fat is less important.

2616
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:08,700
Potentially muscle mass is probably more protective on brain health.

2617
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:12,580
Women body fat is why do we think that is a smart people smarter than me have told me this.

2618
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:13,740
Mechanistically, what is it?

2619
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:14,900
Glucose disposal?

2620
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:17,340
Is it other circulating factors?

2621
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,300
IGF seems to be somewhat protective.

2622
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,300
That's not over my pay grade or whatever that saying is.

2623
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:24,180
Yeah, I'm not 100 percent sure.

2624
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:27,260
But I can tell you that mixing it up is important.

2625
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:33,340
The vast majority of evidence out there is aerobic exercise minimum of 150 to 180 minutes

2626
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:36,220
a week, for example, and that's mixing it up.

2627
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:40,740
Most people would say based on the preponderance of evidence, two thirds cardio, one third

2628
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:41,860
strength training.

2629
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:44,420
But someone's going to have to personalize it based on themselves.

2630
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:46,460
For me, it's fun this morning.

2631
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:47,620
I do spin class.

2632
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,140
I was never a spin person.

2633
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:50,140
And this is not.

2634
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:51,140
I don't want to get.

2635
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,140
I go to flywheel.

2636
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,140
I love flywheel and Peloton.

2637
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:54,380
Why do I like those two?

2638
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:55,380
Because I know my numbers.

2639
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:59,540
I can see my it's actually competitive because I can I can race against people in the class.

2640
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:02,580
But it tells me what my torque is, what my average output is.

2641
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:06,020
And that way I can know I can see what is my pulse, what is my strain.

2642
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:09,380
So just to be clear, when you talk about I think anybody can dog it.

2643
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:12,220
But if you're doing a Peloton class, right, you're working up a sweat.

2644
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:17,020
I mean, it's that's a very different experience than I'm going to go on the elliptical and

2645
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:22,120
watch the news while I'm raising my pulse from 80 to 90.

2646
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:23,700
That doesn't seem to count as exercise.

2647
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:24,700
Oh, no.

2648
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:26,460
I feel like I talked about the patients all the time.

2649
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,460
They say, oh, I go to an elliptical three times a week.

2650
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,460
I do 45 minutes.

2651
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,460
I'm like, really?

2652
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:31,460
Well, yeah, that's great.

2653
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,460
I don't mind it.

2654
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:33,460
I talked to my friends.

2655
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:34,460
I text on the blood.

2656
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:35,460
Do that.

2657
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:37,180
Watch TV in my spin class.

2658
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,340
I can't talk.

2659
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:39,540
I can grunt.

2660
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:40,540
That's about it.

2661
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:41,540
I can grunt.

2662
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:43,380
And then I am a absolute mess.

2663
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:49,420
And the amount of, you know, my average pulse rate during a class is over 150, no, no,

2664
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:51,660
155 ish, sometimes higher, sometimes lower.

2665
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:54,660
And my max is going to be, say, 180, you know, give or take.

2666
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:55,740
I know these numbers.

2667
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:57,940
So high intensity interval training is important.

2668
02:02:57,940 --> 02:03:00,940
But you've got to be careful because if you do too much, you're going to burn muscle.

2669
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:01,940
So I have to be.

2670
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:02,940
Sure, if you can hurt yourself.

2671
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:03,940
Yeah, exactly.

2672
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:06,800
And, you know, I started off very low weight when I was getting back into exercise several

2673
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,800
years ago.

2674
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:11,140
And I, you know, now I'm at higher weights, but I do weights at least once a week.

2675
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:13,460
I hate weight training, but I should probably do it twice a week.

2676
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,940
I probably only do it on average once, maybe once and a half.

2677
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:18,580
You definitely need to be doing it two or three times a week.

2678
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:19,580
It's a big problem.

2679
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:23,900
I completely understand you and my primary care doctor who was like a clone of you and

2680
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:25,660
son in a different way.

2681
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:28,660
If you want no other proof point, just look at Oliver Sacks.

2682
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:31,100
Do you know like what a beast that guy was?

2683
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:35,420
There was like a powerlifting champion in medical school in residency.

2684
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:40,220
When he passed away, there were some really, really remarkable tributes to this man who

2685
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:42,900
not only is, I didn't have the luxury of knowing him.

2686
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,900
Did you?

2687
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:44,900
He lectured at a seminar.

2688
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,900
I talked to him for about 10 seconds.

2689
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:46,900
Oh, wow.

2690
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:47,900
Yeah.

2691
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:53,420
I never had the luxury of knowing this remarkable human being, but I was amazed after his passing

2692
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:55,220
to learn so much about him that I didn't know.

2693
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:58,640
Because you know, you always saw him and he looked like a fit, strong guy in photos as

2694
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:03,260
an older guy, but then to see pictures of this guy in his 20s and 30s, I was like,

2695
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,260
my God.

2696
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,260
Neurologist powerlifter?

2697
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:06,460
You're the neurologist DJ.

2698
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:08,460
He can be the neurologist powerlifter.

2699
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,460
Indeed.

2700
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:11,100
So muscle strength.

2701
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:13,260
So she's loosening her grip on the glass now.

2702
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,100
You've actually given her that.

2703
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:16,660
That leads to my next question.

2704
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:20,340
Should she be drinking alcohol or more to the point, should she think about moderating

2705
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:21,340
her alcohol?

2706
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:22,340
Sure.

2707
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:25,020
I'm going to go on my top five because there's a lot of other stuff.

2708
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:27,020
Meaning moderation of alcohol would not be under-called.

2709
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:29,460
Not in like my five most important things.

2710
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:34,620
You know, Nifsey and Collins in 2011 or so came out with a paper that basically said

2711
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:39,020
one to two drinks a day in men and one drink a day in women is probably protective.

2712
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:43,140
Then you have all these new UK studies that show actually if you do zero, that's better.

2713
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:45,380
So the data is a little bit all over the place.

2714
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:51,660
I kind of hedge my bets and I say women for drinks a week, men seven to 10 and other people

2715
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,780
that are really smart that I work with says less.

2716
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:54,780
I'm sorry.

2717
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:58,380
Is the distinction you make in women to be lower because the risk is higher or do you

2718
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:01,020
think it's related more to body mass or muscle mass?

2719
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:04,940
The ladder and body mass, muscle mass and the data and the data with the data shows.

2720
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,940
I'm not sure.

2721
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:06,940
Yes.

2722
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:07,940
I think those data kind of suspect.

2723
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:12,180
I think there's so much healthy user bias in those data that I, but again, I think

2724
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,820
one also has to balance.

2725
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:17,300
You know, I sort of think of alcohol like I think of Tylenol.

2726
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:20,540
There is no dose of Tylenol that isn't taxing your liver.

2727
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:21,540
Right?

2728
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:27,540
So you are asking the question as a hepatocyte, the smallest cell within a liver, how much

2729
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:30,820
Tylenol is too much?

2730
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:33,220
It's like any amount becomes too much.

2731
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,060
Any amount becomes taxing.

2732
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:39,580
So the question is if you take a hepatic centric view of Tylenol, you should never ever ever

2733
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:41,140
consume it.

2734
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:43,340
But the reality of it is we're not just walking livers.

2735
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:47,380
We're walking people and sometimes we have fevers and sometimes we have pain and things

2736
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:50,160
for which Tylenol is a remarkable drug.

2737
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,240
So we have to balance that.

2738
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,640
And so similarly, I would say alcohol is a known hepatotoxin.

2739
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:59,340
There is no dose of ethanol that isn't on some level chronically toxic to the liver.

2740
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:01,320
The question is we're not walking livers.

2741
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:06,680
Therefore, are there benefits of alcohol that may in the early stages of administration

2742
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:09,160
offset some of the downside?

2743
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:11,360
And I think the answer for some people probably is yes.

2744
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:17,000
I mean, I have patients who if they don't sit there and sip their cognac at night, it's

2745
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,560
very difficult for them to unwind.

2746
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,680
And while I could sit there and lecture them about how they need to pick a different unwinding

2747
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:27,400
practice, in the end, if you can monitor a bunch of things, you sort of take the view

2748
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:30,960
that says, look, there's no measurable harm that's being done by this.

2749
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:33,680
Your liver function tests are incredibly low.

2750
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:35,420
Your coagulation factors are low.

2751
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:37,280
It's not producing other adverse harm.

2752
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,280
Maybe there's benefit.

2753
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:42,520
But it'll be interesting to see how that story shakes out in Alzheimer's disease because

2754
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:45,360
you could certainly come up with plausible hypothesis on either side of that.

2755
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:47,440
Yeah, I have much stronger evidence than other things.

2756
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,200
So since the evidence is murky, I always hedge my bets, like you say sometimes, and

2757
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:54,640
less is more, but I'm not sure a little bit.

2758
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,780
So where are the things where you feel stronger?

2759
02:06:56,780 --> 02:07:00,680
So nutrition has to come after exercise.

2760
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:06,080
But again, education, know your numbers because nutrition is a close second.

2761
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:10,320
Probably, I mean, honestly, vascular risk factor modification is probably after exercise.

2762
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,160
So I should probably put nutrition next.

2763
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:18,000
But vascular risk factor modification, cholesterol, diabetes, blood pressure control, the Sprint

2764
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,980
Mind Study, just if you haven't heard about the study, it's like a major, major, major

2765
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:24,440
important study in the field that needs to be on like every...

2766
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:27,640
Yeah, it's really modified the way I think about blood pressure management.

2767
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,120
Yeah, and this was a five year study.

2768
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:33,520
It was the Sprint Study, which is trying to figure out do people, you know, because lowering

2769
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,200
blood pressure less than 140 has always been a little bit unclear, like does it improve

2770
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:38,200
outcomes?

2771
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:42,000
So the study in cardiovascular disease was, and I may be paraphrasing, but is 140 is

2772
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,400
better or is 120 better?

2773
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:44,400
It's a style.

2774
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:47,560
And, you know, there's always been this like dogma where, oh, you got to be careful, you

2775
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:48,760
can't lower blood pressure too much.

2776
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:51,600
And someone who's older, because then they're going to over 70, they're going to pass out

2777
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,440
and they're going to have bad outcomes and fall.

2778
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:57,160
So in the Sprint Mind Study, they ended the study early because the outcomes were so much

2779
02:07:57,160 --> 02:08:02,500
better in the 120s that actually there were no side effects either.

2780
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:03,920
So they stopped the study early.

2781
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,600
Well, the Sprint Mind Study then looked at outcomes several years later.

2782
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:10,880
The Sprint Mind Study, this is just like several years in follow up, like not like

2783
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,160
10 or 20, just even after a few years.

2784
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:20,160
And this intervention was not that long, actually showed a reduction in the people that had

2785
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:26,480
blood pressure more tightly controlled to a systolic of 120 actually had a reduction

2786
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:32,320
in development of MCI mild cognitive impairment by 19%.

2787
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,880
Like that is huge.

2788
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:34,880
Over how many years?

2789
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:35,880
Two years?

2790
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:39,800
After three and a half-ish, four years of treatment of lower, and then they stopped

2791
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:43,120
the study at five years or whatever, and then three years later or something like that,

2792
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,240
I'm mangling it.

2793
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:49,200
But long story short, I mean, 19% risk reduction of MCI, and then you add in the exercise and

2794
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:52,560
the blueberries and the low carbs and this and the precision medicine.

2795
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,880
I mean, we're talking tangible, like real stuff here.

2796
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:57,040
All right, so let's go to nutrition.

2797
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,040
Why blueberries?

2798
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:01,520
Anthrocyanins, I'm mangling how to pronounce that too.

2799
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:06,280
Robert Krekorian, pioneer, I believe in the field of nutrition research and Alzheimer's

2800
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:07,280
disease.

2801
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:08,800
So the antioxidants you think provide benefit?

2802
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,280
He would be the person to ask about this, but I know he has a paper that he's been trying

2803
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,800
to figure out, is it the blueberry?

2804
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,800
Is it the anthrocyanin?

2805
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,320
Is it the whole fruit?

2806
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,920
Can you just take out the compound?

2807
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,640
I don't know that I'm 100% sure.

2808
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:22,600
I think it may just be the compound.

2809
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:24,720
I actually got an email about this in my news.

2810
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:29,240
We get those newsletters every day about Alzheimer's disease, and I think they mentioned this in

2811
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:34,040
today's newsletter, which was, yeah, just the idea was could this be one of the more

2812
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:36,800
potent antioxidants that could be studied in clinical trials?

2813
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:41,560
Because Dr. Krekorian is looking at not just blueberry intake, but wild blueberries is

2814
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:42,560
a non-wild.

2815
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:44,600
Then we say, okay, well, what about blueberry powder?

2816
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:45,600
Can we just take the blueberry powder?

2817
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,200
Well, then can we go even deeper?

2818
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:49,240
Can we just take the active ingredient?

2819
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:55,200
So nutrition research, people say, well, first of all, nutrition research is hard to study,

2820
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:59,600
but there's a science to nutrition research, and just randomizing 100 people to one diet

2821
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:00,760
versus another.

2822
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,760
People aren't mice.

2823
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,480
You can't just make sure that they eat that diet.

2824
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:07,840
People go to McDonald's and do other things that they shouldn't do.

2825
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:08,840
So nutrition research is inherently difficult.

2826
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:09,840
Wait, wait, wait, McDonald's is bad?

2827
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,840
McDonald's is bad?

2828
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:13,600
I'm just taking notes here for the girl at the cocktail bar.

2829
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:14,600
Right.

2830
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:15,600
No, McDonald's is not.

2831
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,640
My cousin Stacy caught me at McDonald's once and got pictures.

2832
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,640
It was a problem.

2833
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:22,560
But everything in moderation, everything in moderation.

2834
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,960
I have had two McFlurries, Oreo McFlurries in the last year.

2835
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:27,960
Like once in a while.

2836
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:28,960
I'm not judging, by the way.

2837
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:30,760
I'm just craving one myself.

2838
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:33,480
Oh, Oreo McFlurries, man, like forget it.

2839
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:34,520
Anyway, long story.

2840
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,240
You don't, you don't even have sugar in your house.

2841
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,280
I put xylitol in my coffee.

2842
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:39,520
Killing me, man.

2843
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:44,000
So nutrition would be, you know, lower carbs, good carbs versus bad carbs, green leafy vegetables.

2844
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
So so so important.

2845
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,960
Any role of fasting, any early data on intermittent fasting or caloric restriction?

2846
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:53,280
Well, I don't have data in my practice just yet, but we recommend our diploma diet is

2847
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:56,840
looking at 12 hours versus 16 hours and the differential effects.

2848
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:01,440
Unfortunately, I have looked at that data not written up unpublished.

2849
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:02,760
There's a lot of noise.

2850
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:05,800
I think 16 is better five times a week.

2851
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:06,800
Better than 12.

2852
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,440
I don't know the 12 works.

2853
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,640
The error bars and our data is are so wide.

2854
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:14,000
I think your sample size is too small and there's too much variability at this point.

2855
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,680
You sent me some of those data weeks ago.

2856
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:16,680
Yeah, I think I did.

2857
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:17,680
Yeah.

2858
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:20,360
I think you take all these different clinics and all these different programs and get a

2859
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,360
uniform data set.

2860
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:22,520
So that's a pretty good list.

2861
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:23,960
I think you've given her five things.

2862
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:24,960
Yeah.

2863
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:25,960
And you know, stress reduction is important.

2864
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:28,880
And you know, whether it's meditation or blah, blah, blah, do whatever you need to do to

2865
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,720
de-stress deep breaths.

2866
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:32,280
Sleep is super important.

2867
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:33,520
Getting adequate sleep.

2868
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,240
You don't lose fat and you don't get healthy if you're not sleeping well.

2869
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:37,240
And it's the same thing.

2870
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:40,040
You age terribly when you're not sleeping well.

2871
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:42,320
So there's there's a lot of components, sleep, stress.

2872
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,000
So I guess the reciprocal to this question, we're now no longer at the cocktail party,

2873
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,000
but we're sitting back here at the table.

2874
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:55,120
Everything that you described to this woman is quote unquote lifestyle based.

2875
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:59,720
Meaning the top five things that you suggested that she would do once she understood her

2876
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:04,640
baseline all have to do with modifying how she eats, drinks, exercises, sleeps, and manages

2877
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,800
stress.

2878
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:13,720
What that makes me wonder is when we see the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease

2879
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:16,280
today higher than it was 40 years ago.

2880
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:19,040
Well, the I'm terrible with this.

2881
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:23,500
I shouldn't admit this on a recorded podcast, but the rate of Alzheimer's cases actually

2882
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:24,500
coming down.

2883
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:25,500
The incidence is coming down.

2884
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,160
Incidents coming down, but prevalence is going up because of her aging population.

2885
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:29,160
Okay.

2886
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,640
But the incidence today is still much higher than it was 40 years ago, even though it's

2887
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:33,760
less than what it was 10 years ago.

2888
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:36,360
And as you said, of course, the prevalence, which is I think of the prevalence is the

2889
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:37,360
integral, right?

2890
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:40,200
It's the area under the curve of what you're accumulating is so much higher.

2891
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:44,200
Both of these facts taken together suggest there was something triggering environmentally

2892
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:48,360
Alzheimer's disease more today than 40 years ago, which is usually a constellation of these

2893
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:50,400
lifestyle factors.

2894
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:59,680
So do you believe that the difference in prevalence today from the year we were born is what percent

2895
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:04,240
a result of the changes in these environmental factors you just mentioned versus what percent

2896
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:06,640
in increase in awareness and diagnostic acumen?

2897
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,780
I've written on this and my answer is I don't know.

2898
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:09,880
But it's some combination of both.

2899
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:10,880
It's both.

2900
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:11,880
It's both.

2901
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:12,880
Yeah.

2902
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,280
I mean, you know, Alzheimer's is a huge stigma and shame, right?

2903
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:18,240
Now people are coming out of the shadows and talking about it more.

2904
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:22,440
And there's like young people that are talking about, you know, Seth Rogen has this charity,

2905
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:26,800
hilarity for charity, and they're raising money for Alzheimer's education and young

2906
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,800
people.

2907
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:30,120
I mean, they're talking about Alzheimer's in high school students and college students

2908
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:31,120
and medical students.

2909
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:35,240
I mean, like the conversation is not only like getting better, but you have like people

2910
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:39,640
that are speaking up on its behalf and kind of adding a new, new flavor to it.

2911
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:42,720
So there's much less stigma, much more attention to it.

2912
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:43,720
Doctors are talking about it.

2913
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:44,720
It's not just senility.

2914
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:45,980
Oh, that's normal with age.

2915
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:46,980
We now have biomarkers.

2916
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:47,980
So sure, sure.

2917
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:53,420
We have all that, but we, this is definitely lifestyle component to, you know, sitting

2918
02:13:53,420 --> 02:13:55,480
all day, there's like sitting as a new smoking.

2919
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:58,560
I think, you know, I've heard whatever about that.

2920
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,960
That's like really bad for the brain.

2921
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:03,680
It's not just bad for the, the bigger the belly as the belly gets larger, the memory

2922
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:06,520
center in the brain, the hippocampus gets smaller.

2923
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:12,280
So you know, metabolic conditions and lack of activity and sedentary lifestyles, like

2924
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:14,400
it doesn't just affect the belly and the body.

2925
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,180
It affects the brain because they're all connected.

2926
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:24,060
So that reminds me of another question that I have, which is how much does mental activity

2927
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:25,360
ward this off?

2928
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:31,080
You know, we hear so often the anecdote of Bernie was working his little tail away, beavering

2929
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:32,080
away.

2930
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:35,640
And then when he retired to play golf, it all went to hell in a hand basket.

2931
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:42,280
And then the other one you often hear anecdotally is once so and so spouse passed away, oh

2932
02:14:42,280 --> 02:14:46,960
my God, the remaining spouse just regressed completely and seemed to have this accelerated

2933
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,040
case of Alzheimer's dementia.

2934
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:53,080
So the idea here being once that person retired and they weren't cognitively engaged and they

2935
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:58,040
were not to say golf is cognitively bankrupt, but presumably it's less cognitively engaging

2936
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,960
than whatever that person was doing before.

2937
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:03,800
Or once the sense of purpose, the social support vanishes.

2938
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:08,040
Again, anecdotally, this seems overwhelmingly the case.

2939
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,840
Is there any data to support that?

2940
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:13,960
So yes, but it's complicated.

2941
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:16,960
The cognitive reserve can't one thing just be freaking simple.

2942
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,520
No, Alzheimer's prevention.

2943
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:21,640
No, no, man, this is this is sound like me, man.

2944
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:22,640
Yeah, everything's complicated.

2945
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:23,640
Everything's complicated.

2946
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:27,400
I wish I could give you a concise bullet points that, you know, like a bumper sticker.

2947
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:28,400
Yeah.

2948
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:29,400
Live TV.

2949
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,720
You got to give them like a quick snapshot.

2950
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:31,720
Not on this topic.

2951
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:37,080
Early life risk factors for Alzheimer's are different than mid life and late life and

2952
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:43,560
early life risk can be mitigated most so by long term educational attainment.

2953
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,840
That's the best evidence we have.

2954
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,680
We also have to be clear.

2955
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:50,200
Has that been normalized for socioeconomic status?

2956
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:54,760
It strikes me as almost impossible to normalize that for socioeconomic status.

2957
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:57,000
But my pay grade don't know the literature as well as any.

2958
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,280
The point here being like people who go on to get secondary and tertiary education are

2959
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:03,640
going to have lower risk.

2960
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:09,600
Is it because of the things that enable them to do that, perhaps having more resources

2961
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:15,200
lead to them doing other healthy lifestyle things that go beyond the education as I hope

2962
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,840
the studies have controlled for that.

2963
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:18,720
But I know it's impossible to control for everything.

2964
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:22,960
But that being said, I think early life educational attainment, for example, musical experience,

2965
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,080
mid life and mid life musical experience as well as early life absolutely can give

2966
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:30,840
built up greater cognitive reserves that when you get Alzheimer's, you're more resilient.

2967
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,360
You have this resiliency.

2968
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:37,440
The other aspect is I don't know enough about music, but when you were the cello playing

2969
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:41,200
to bass guitar playing guy, what part of the brain is getting exercise?

2970
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:43,160
Well, it's very multimodal.

2971
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,160
It's the parietal lobe is the music side.

2972
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:49,280
Maybe on the right side, the reading music notes is kind of like language.

2973
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:50,840
So it'll be the left side of the brain.

2974
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:52,240
And that's visual.

2975
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:56,440
It's basically an association courtesies basically the whole brain is talking to each

2976
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:57,440
other.

2977
02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:01,480
So I think music is a great way to recruit different parts of the brain to work together.

2978
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:03,920
And the stronger those pathways get, the better the person does.

2979
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,240
And again, teleologically, that makes so much sense.

2980
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:12,320
I guess it begs the question, I would argue we will never know the answer to this question.

2981
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:16,200
Because if we're going to have to rely on very loose epidemiology, which can never be

2982
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:21,480
fully controlled and suffers from all of the usual problems that epidemiology suffers from

2983
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:27,440
the question ought to be, is there any harm in believing that the epidemiology is right,

2984
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:32,200
attaining a higher level of education, staying more mentally engaged, sustaining more loving

2985
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:35,080
social supporting relationships, having a greater sense of purpose, learning to play

2986
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:36,080
musical instrument?

2987
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,600
I mean, is there a chance that doing those things increases your risk?

2988
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:41,920
Well, I don't think that there's been any evidence to suggest that it increases risk.

2989
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:46,040
But then there's this whole, you know, the naysayers will say, well, what is the cost?

2990
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:47,040
What are the trade offs?

2991
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:48,040
What's the opportunity cost?

2992
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:49,040
What's the opportunity cost?

2993
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,600
What's also the how much does it like music lessons?

2994
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:53,960
You're going to pay money to do music lessons or buy a guitar.

2995
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:55,960
But shouldn't you be like buying healthy food?

2996
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,880
So there's a lot of confusion.

2997
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:01,220
And there's when we get reviewers of our papers, this comes up all the time.

2998
02:18:01,220 --> 02:18:02,920
So I'm not sure.

2999
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:07,960
All I can say is when you build a better backup pathway in the brain, and you there's a saying,

3000
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:10,200
if you don't use it, you lose it.

3001
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:13,760
Well, someone that has Alzheimer's and is very cognitively engaged and has a good backup

3002
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,720
pathway, they're not going to decline as quickly.

3003
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:20,680
That being said, once the disease takes hold, and maybe they stop working, or they stop

3004
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:23,880
the loser's sense of purpose, you can have a much more sharper decline.

3005
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:28,120
So people with high cognitive reserve, high cognitive backup systems are resistant to

3006
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,640
the effects of the amyloid.

3007
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:35,360
But there's a time that comes when they decline, and those people decline much more sharply

3008
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:38,320
than others because they had like this emergency backup system.

3009
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:42,880
But sometimes when the parachute fails, the person goes down and Alzheimer's disease.

3010
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:46,440
That's a subtle, that's a nuance I wouldn't have predicted.

3011
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:47,440
It makes sense.

3012
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:49,560
The mechanism that you postulate makes sense.

3013
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:54,480
And you gave the other example of the woman whose husband passed away, and then she just

3014
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:55,480
went downhill.

3015
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:59,000
Because when you have a collaborative relationship, and you know, when one person's brain isn't

3016
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,400
working well, but you have another person to cover for you and do the dishes and feed

3017
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:06,840
you and, and then that person has gone aside from depression, serotonin, and you have all

3018
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,840
that.

3019
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,520
Oh, I see this all the time.

3020
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:11,600
Like I knew she had it.

3021
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:16,320
But then the husband and you know, caregivers of Alzheimer's patients have terribly higher

3022
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:18,080
medical illnesses.

3023
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:23,360
And when a husband dies, and he was the primary caregiver, and the wife has Alzheimer's, that

3024
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:26,200
person will decline absolutely exponentially.

3025
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:27,920
I saw this in a high school teacher of mine.

3026
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,640
I see this all the time.

3027
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:31,960
You know, Richard, your passion for this is palpable.

3028
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:36,200
And I mean, I feel like we could talk a lot more about other things, including, I think

3029
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:41,000
some of the stories of your patients are some of the most remarkable stories.

3030
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,760
Both the successes and the failures, truthfully, the failures are what keep you doing what

3031
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:46,760
you're doing.

3032
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:49,080
And you are probably the hardest working neurologist.

3033
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:51,760
What's the expression, the hardest working man show business?

3034
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:52,760
Hardest working man show business.

3035
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:55,120
You are the hardest working neurologist in show business.

3036
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:59,880
I know you personally, so I can say this from a, you know, from a close perspective, your

3037
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:02,600
drive to help patients is a beautiful thing.

3038
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:05,920
And I know that the patients that you get to work with directly are blessed.

3039
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:10,440
And more importantly, I think your work will have a tremendous impact on people that you

3040
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:15,480
will not have the luxury or privilege of laying hands on because there's only one Richard,

3041
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:19,400
but there are lots of neurologists like you who I think want to be able to do more.

3042
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:23,800
And I think it's really special that you have built the team around you that you have that

3043
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:27,000
I didn't actually know the story about the Dean of the medical center at Cornell taking

3044
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
this big chance on you.

3045
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,280
I mean, I knew it was obscure to have an Alzheimer's prevention clinic.

3046
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,800
Of course, you now have the largest Alzheimer's prevention clinic in the United States.

3047
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:40,780
It's a really heartwarming story to know that a big name medical center would take a risk

3048
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:46,660
on a young up and coming neurologist and sort of give him the keys to that kingdom.

3049
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:51,980
And I hope that if one person listening to this is sort of thinking, you know what, that's

3050
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:55,660
the way I want to deploy my philanthropic dollars in Alzheimer's disease.

3051
02:20:55,660 --> 02:20:58,220
Maybe I'll hedge on the side of prevention.

3052
02:20:58,220 --> 02:20:59,980
Hopefully this discussion will have been worth it for you.

3053
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:00,980
And I appreciate that.

3054
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:04,100
You know, I never asked for a single dollar until the bottom dropped out about a year

3055
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:06,900
ago and you know, you Peter helped and I've never asked for money.

3056
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:07,900
I've never asked for a single dollar.

3057
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:09,780
It's the worst feeling in the world.

3058
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:15,260
But man, I guess, but it's like so little can go so far.

3059
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:19,820
You know, I sent you on the way over here an abstract like the hot off the press.

3060
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:23,380
Literally we finished it at 4 32 p.m. and I forwarded to you and I got here at five

3061
02:21:23,380 --> 02:21:26,780
and I forwarded this to you and like you read the final statement and you know, this hasn't

3062
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:27,780
been published yet.

3063
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:29,700
So I can't exactly read it out loud or whatever.

3064
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:33,260
And you read that statement and you're like, whoa, if this is the abstract and if I'm about

3065
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:37,780
to read this paper and this paper holds water, this statement.

3066
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:39,060
Wow.

3067
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:43,580
We're so close and you know, we're every day we're moving closer.

3068
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:47,300
But that being said, we have thousands of pages of already collected data that we can't

3069
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:48,300
really jump into.

3070
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:52,980
So I appreciate your call to action and I can tell you that our philanthropic funds

3071
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:57,820
that have come in, we use immediately and yeah, the ROI on those dollars is remarkable.

3072
02:21:57,820 --> 02:22:01,820
You know, there are a lot of people who say, look, I mean, maybe I can only part with 25

3073
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:05,500
$50,000, which in New York philanthropic circles is nothing, right?

3074
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:08,340
You don't get your name on a bench for that much.

3075
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:10,140
What a difference it can make in your clinic.

3076
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:14,460
Oh, several thousand dollars is helpful, but yeah, 50, 25, 100.

3077
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:18,100
I could just do so much tomorrow, but I'm not asking for money because that's just done.

3078
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,100
I was raised.

3079
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:20,100
Yeah, no, screw it.

3080
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:22,380
I'm asking for money for it.

3081
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:29,900
Well with that said, Indian or Persian or Turkish tonight for dinner?

3082
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:33,700
There's a neurology resident happy hour that I may need to stop by for a second.

3083
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:34,900
So maybe somewhere near there.

3084
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:35,900
Okay.

3085
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:36,900
Okay.

3086
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:37,900
We'll figure it out.

3087
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:41,340
I prefer food with no taste.

3088
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:43,980
So and I don't do onions, garlic, shallots, scallions.

3089
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:44,980
Oh, for heavens sake.

3090
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:45,980
I don't do alliums.

3091
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:46,980
I'm going to go have dinner by myself.

3092
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:47,980
You can go to your residence.

3093
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:48,980
I don't do cilantro.

3094
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:49,980
All right.

3095
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:51,300
But no, no, no, but I like, I like plain Jane.

3096
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:53,940
We'll find something to talk about glucose and metabolism.

3097
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:54,940
Very well.

3098
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:55,940
All right.

3099
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:56,940
Thanks so much, Richard.
