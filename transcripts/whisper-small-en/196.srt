00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:15,000
All right. Well, here we go. Another AMA. Of course, I'm joined with a new co-host for this

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,160
episode, Nick Stenson. And Nick, we'll save the intros till the end. But you ready to jump into

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,960
this? Let's do it. We compiled some good questions here. I think it should be a fun one.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
Yeah. You showed me the list that you were working on and it's got me a little overwhelmed. If we can

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
through it, I'll be super impressed. But you've got a good, great question. So just tell me where

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,560
you want to start. So we got a lot of good questions following the Jeremy Lenicki and

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,800
some of the exercise podcast. So I thought we'd kind of start there and there's some blood flow

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,240
restriction questions, but I thought it might be helpful for people before we get into some of

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,640
those specifics. Just what is your current exercise routine look like each week? You know,

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,280
I know it's always changing, but if you can give people a rough overview, I think that will be

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,880
helpful as we get into some of these other questions. Yeah. I mean, the actual macro

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,960
structure of what I do has not changed much in the last year. The microstructure has changed a lot,

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,560
meaning the exercises have changed a lot. But the macro structure is that on, let's see, Tuesday,

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,280
Thursday, Saturday, Sunday are cardio days. So Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday are zone two.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,880
Saturday is either a zone two followed by a zone five as kind of a separate workout. So each of

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,600
those are 45 minutes zone twos and then kind of like a 30 minute zone five as a separate workout

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,760
that's done almost immediately after. So basically getting out of bike clothes and putting on, you

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,560
know, sort of stair climbing, stair climbing clothes. Alternatively, I might just do a longer

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,720
bike ride on Saturday and make it more of an anaerobic workout. Then from a lifting standpoint,

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,840
it's Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday is lifting. And about, I don't know, nine months ago, I switched

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,520
to an upper body, lower body split. I used to lift three days a week and do upper body, lower body

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,720
every day. So each day I was doing kind of pushing, pulling and hip hinging. And now the lower body

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,440
component I think is Monday, Friday, the upper body is Wednesday, Sunday. And I always lift

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,160
after doing cardio because I think the reverse has been demonstrated to erode strength training

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,120
gains. So Peter, what happens if you miss a day? Because I noticed you didn't say day one,

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,640
day two, day three, you were very distinct on the days of the week. I know you typically don't miss

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,160
a day, but if you miss Wednesday, do you just scrap those exercises and then just continue with your

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,560
program or are you trying to make up in the interim? No, like yesterday, Sunday would have

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,420
been a ride followed by lift day, but I was on the track the whole day and I knew that in advance. So

31
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,880
I just ended up doing that lift on Saturday, but obviously was short changed on the zone two for

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,620
yesterday. So I pretty much will never compromise a lift. I will always get those four lifts in,

33
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,740
during the week, no matter what. And sometimes it just means moving the days around or doubling

34
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,980
up on a different day. And what about timing? Do you have a preference morning, afternoon, evening?

35
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,540
Is that flexible as well within kind of your schedule? A little more flexible on weekends,

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,300
but Monday through Friday and pretty much no flexibility. Those lifts have to be done first

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,140
thing in the morning and not first thing in the morning. So morning routine is kind of more about

38
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,580
the kids and stuff like that. But once they're out the door to school, around 7 15, 7 30, that's

39
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,980
when I'll typically lift. Got it. So I know from the Jeremy Lenicki podcast, you were talking about

40
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,660
kind of how you were starting to incorporate blood flow restriction. So like I think one of

41
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,300
the main questions we saw from subscribers after that was, you know, how are you utilizing that

42
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,060
into your exercise program? Is that something you do every day? Is it days like you mentioned

43
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,540
where you were just not really feeling it and it was injury prevention, or if you had an injury,

44
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,420
you were trying to recover kind of how do you utilize that throughout the week? So I have really

45
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,860
enjoyed blood flow restriction, especially since I got new cuffs. So when I started, I was doing it

46
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:27,060
purely ghetto style and I still, I enjoyed it, but I wasn't even coming close to tapping into sort

47
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,020
of what the potential of that was for the last, oh God, probably three months. I've been using

48
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,540
kind of a, well, it's called the brand is actually called smart cuff and it's a night and day difference.

49
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,580
So they're, they're kind of absurdly expensive. I don't remember how much they cost. I want to say

50
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,740
like $600 for the four cuffs to upper body to lower body plus the device, which is what really

51
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,940
makes it so essential, meaning the device that is measuring occlusive pressure and pumping each

52
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,420
time. But it makes such a difference that in my mind, it's just totally worth it. I do plan to

53
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,540
try a couple of other devices out. There's even more, you know, extreme versions of this that

54
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,060
apparently have better features like the catsu one. But you know, I think my guess is there will

55
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,340
be no bigger jump than the one I took from going from, you know, basically $20 junky bands to these

56
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,780
ones. And so I do BFR every day that I lift and I just do at the end of the workout, I'll typically

57
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,420
do two, one to two exercises depending on the muscle group. So today, for example, at the end

58
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:38,620
of a leg session, I did a BFR leg press set. At the end of an upper body session, I'll probably do a

59
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,940
bicep set and a tricep set. And I'm always doing it in the way that we discussed on that podcast,

60
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:52,020
but just for folks to remember, it's 30 reps, rest 30 seconds, 15 reps, rest 30 seconds, 15 reps,

61
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,020
rest 30 seconds, 15 reps. That is the standard prescribed procedure for BFR. You're doing this

62
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:08,180
at a weight that is 30 to 40% of your one rep max. So the easiest way to calculate that is to take

63
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,860
the weight that you can barely get 10 reps with. So what is your best 10 rep weight? Divide that by

64
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,620
0.75. So your best 10 rep weight is about 75% of your one rep max. And then you multiply the

65
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,580
resulting figure by somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4, depending on how strong you are. So use an example

66
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:44,100
if your best 10 rep of curls is 40 pounds, you would divide 40 by 0.75, which what is that? That

67
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,140
takes you up to 57 or something, I'm guessing. And then you would multiply that by somewhere between

68
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:56,060
0.3 to 0.4. I typically tend to go closer to 0.4. That becomes the weight that you'll use for the BFR.

69
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,940
With these smart cuffs, you have a whole additional variable, which is it comes at three different

70
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:08,460
pressures. So it calculates the pressure. And again, just for the refresher for folks, the purpose of

71
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,780
blood flow restriction is to operate at about 30% of the occlusive pressure, the arterial occlusive

72
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,060
pressure, which when you're using kind of crap, you know, just bands, you don't really have a sense

73
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,820
of what your occlusive pressure is unless you're applying a Doppler signal to your distal extremities,

74
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:34,740
which is very cumbersome. Instead, when you use these cuffs that come with an inflation device,

75
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,780
they're actually measuring the occlusive pressure. So the first time you do it, it takes a little

76
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:46,740
longer. And then it says, okay, now I know what it is for your arms and your legs. Do you want to go

77
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,020
at the highest level of intensity, medium level intensity, or a lower level of intensity,

78
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,180
which basically just adjusts the pressure. And you mentioned a Doppler signal for your other

79
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,940
bands. Can you just remind people what that is in case they're using this with cuffs that don't

80
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,740
have kind of what yours have? Yeah, a Doppler device, you'd have to buy one. And that's the

81
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,620
reason I think like if you're going to go to the trouble to buy a Doppler device, you might as well

82
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,300
buy a smart cuff or something similar. But it's basically a medical device that we used to use in

83
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,780
the hospital all the time when you can't feel a pulse. Like if you put your hand on your radial

84
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,980
artery here, you can feel the pulse hopefully if you're healthy. But in people who have peripheral

85
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,420
vascular disease, you can't. So, because their pulse is too weak. So the Doppler is basically

86
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,820
a little, it looks like a little pen, you put it there with a little bit of jelly, so it has

87
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,540
better sound conduction. And it's basically sending a sound signal to the artery and it's

88
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,620
recording that sound. So when there's complete occlusion, you'll hear nothing. And if there's

89
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,900
only partial occlusion, you'll hear like a woo woo woo. And it's sort of picking up that sound.

90
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,620
So what you would basically do is use this device to figure out how tight to go. But of course,

91
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,620
then you're like trying to figure out like how tight to make the band to get to that occlusive

92
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,980
pressure. And then how do you even know how to back off it? So you'd have to use a cuff that at

93
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,180
least allows you to know how many millimeters of mercury you're putting in to figure out what

94
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,500
complete occlusion is and then backing it down. In my opinion, it's just not worth doing that.

95
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,980
No, that makes sense. One of the things I was surprised by, because I was in your gym the other

96
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,820
day and was just the difference between the two cuffs. And I think because of that, I asked you

97
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,180
to pull them out just so you can show people, do you have them quick?

98
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:38,900
Yeah. So these are kind of what my cheap $20 cuffs were that I used for many months. And you have

99
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,620
two of these and you would kind of wrap them around your arm and your leg. And you sort of

100
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,260
look like a bit of a heroin addict because you're sort of like trying to squeeze this thing. Again,

101
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,220
I would just york on them really hard until I would, my guide was once it hits seven out of

102
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:04,860
10 pain, that was probably the right spot. But I find that's very inaccurate. The current cuffs,

103
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:14,100
this is the arm cuff. So it's obviously a much more rigorous cuff. And you apply this,

104
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:22,700
you know, slap it on, then a little device hooks onto here that hooks up to a little pump. That's

105
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,980
where I program this thing. And that will achieve the occlusive pressure. The other thing I really

106
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,100
appreciate now is like, look at how thick this thing is just for the arm, right? Look at the leg

107
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:43,500
one, like totally different, right? So now I can, because I could never get, I was never really

108
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,820
doing BFR for my legs when I had that little blue thing. Whereas with this thing, wow, you get it,

109
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,820
you get, you really are getting the true occlusive effect. And what are you using to measure like the

110
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,660
difference there? Or how do you know like it's working? How can you tell us it just feel?

111
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,100
Subjectively? Yeah. Yeah. It's not hurting where the band is compressing me. I'm feeling that

112
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,580
sensation of basically lactic acidosis throughout the entire leg, as opposed to just the pain of

113
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,780
being constricted where the band is when it's a thin band. It's interesting to note the pressure

114
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:26,420
of occlusion is much higher than systolic pressure because it's a function of how wide the band is.

115
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,940
So I noticed today when I did my legs, the occlusive pressure was 158 millimeters of

116
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,900
mercury. Well, that's way above my systolic pressure. My systolic blood pressure is very low.

117
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,900
I tend to run super low in blood pressure as evidenced by the fact that I face planted in

118
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:50,300
Brazil last month. And my upper body occlusive pressure with those cuffs is about 58 millimeters

119
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,220
of mercury. So you have one that's like, or sorry, 94 millimeters of mercury tends to be

120
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:02,140
approximate occlusive on upper body, 154 or something, 158 on the lower body. But again,

121
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,980
it's also a function of the width of the cuff. So that's why I realized you can't just, just

122
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,740
knowing your blood pressure isn't enough to do this. Yeah. And you mentioned you always do it

123
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,500
at the end of the workout. I assume that's purposeful. Have you ever played around with

124
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,060
like prior to your actual workout? I mean, maybe others could speak to it. For me personally,

125
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,620
I just think when I'm doing my heaviest, most neurologically demanding component of exercise,

126
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,700
I want to be a little fresher and I don't want to be as taxed. Whereas I kind of like using this

127
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,660
as sort of a finisher or near the end. Sometimes I'll do, I'll still do something after this,

128
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,580
but it's, you know, like I'll do a dead hang is usually the very, very last thing I'll do.

129
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,500
You'll never do a dead hang with a BFR cuff on. I tried. It didn't, it didn't matter. It didn't,

130
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,500
it didn't impair the ability to do it at all. Cause the dead hang is really about grip and that

131
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,300
didn't seem to be impaired by, uh, by the upper body BFR, but I have tried it once.

132
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,100
What's your record for dead hang these days? Like a little over three, three 10.

133
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,020
Jeez. And how,

134
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,140
But that's at the end of a workout. And I think, you know, if you do these fresh,

135
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,380
I think you can go a little more. Yeah. Do you have a goal set in mind that you want to hit?

136
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:23,940
I was super happy to get over three. Um, I, I mean, most days when I do it, I just want to go to two,

137
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,260
two 30 and, and not go to failure and just kind of build strength without failing every time. Uh,

138
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,060
lately I've been doing a lot of finger pull ups. I think I showed you that device. Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,100
That thing is painful, super painful. It gives you a new respect for those climbers.

140
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,020
Oh, that was the first thing I thought of because walk people through, you're not doing all four

141
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,580
fingers, right? You only are doing three and you're just straight in the pull up position.

142
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,380
I do both. So I'll usually start with four fingers, but that's very easy relatively speaking,

143
00:13:53,380 --> 00:14:00,260
but the jump from four finger pull ups to three finger pull ups is so much harder than I would

144
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,700
have ever guessed. Oh, I can't imagine. And are you looking to do two finger and one finger? Is

145
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,500
that the goal? It's just to just, yeah, yourself up. If I can do, you know, four sets of two,

146
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,820
three finger pull ups at the end of doing, you know, maybe three sets of four, four finger pull

147
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:25,700
ups. That's, that's pretty good. For sure. Um, one other question we had on the BFR was,

148
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,780
do you ever do it in zone two training? Like have you ever played around with that?

149
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,780
Thank you for listening to today's sneak peek AMA episode of the drive. If you're interested

Membership benefits are many and beyond the complete episodes of the AMA each month,

153
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,620
they include the following ridiculously comprehensive podcast show notes that

154

155
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,340
Access to our private podcast feed, the qualities, which were a super short podcast,

156
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,060
typically less than five minutes released every Tuesday through Friday, which highlight the best

157
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,260
questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of the drive. This is particularly

158
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,700
important for those of you who haven't heard all of the back episodes, becomes a great way to go

159
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,740
back and filter and decide which ones you want to listen to in detail. Really steep discount codes
