Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,540
Hey, Patrick. Thank you so much for making time to sit down. I know you've done a number

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,240
of these interviews. One of the things I always like to do is try to go places or at least

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,520
deeper than maybe you've gone before. We'll see if that can be accomplished. There's certainly

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,520
no shortage of material here to dive into. I guess I want to start with a question that

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,360
I know you've probably spoken about before, which is what drew you to this story because

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,920
the depths that you've gone to to research your book have been certainly at the upper

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,960
desk aisle, I would suppose, of what an investigative journalist would do.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,480
Thanks. It's great to be with you. Happy to talk about how I came to this. I've always

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:00,880
been interested in drugs as a subject, the way in which drugs fit into our society,

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,400
how we feel about them, which drugs are illicit, which drugs are illicit. I wrote a big piece

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,000
a number of years ago about the legalization of cannabis in Washington state. I was just

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
very interested in this idea that you have this existing industry, this pot industry

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,160
that's been around for decades. Then with the stroke of a pen at midnight, it's legalized.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,800
What does that look like? How do you turn it into a tax and regulated economy?

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,640
I had done a lot of writing on Mexican drug cartels. I did a big piece actually before

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,320
I was full-time at The New Yorker. I did a cover story for the New York Times magazine

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,960
back in 2012 about the Sinaloa drug cartel. To give you a sense of context, I mean, at

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,760
the time I had to explain to the editors of The New York Times magazine who Chapo Guzman

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,840
was. He was not a household name at all. The idea there was I wanted to do a Harvard Business

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,640
School case study of a cartel. I wanted to look at it as a multi-billion dollar transnational

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,920
commodities enterprise. I was really interested in how they diversified and how vertically

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,080
integrated they were. One of the questions that grew out of that research was you saw

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,640
at a certain point a surge in heroin. They had different pro- I mean, Sinaloa, dealt

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:29,200
in cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine. After 2010, you start seeing more Mexican

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,080
heroin, huge volumes of it coming across the border in ways that it hadn't been before

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,240
into the US. That was kind of a riddle that I started with, was this question of why this

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,960
sudden uptick in heroin? The answer was the opioid crisis. It was one of these funny things

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,360
where I started out with an inquiry that was kind of solidly grounded in the realm of the

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:02,560
illicit drug trade and found my way into the world of the FDA regulated legal drug trade

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
with OxyContin and Purdue Pharma. I started looking into the origins of the opioid crisis

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,960
and then discovered that this company Purdue was owned by the Sackler family. That kind

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,240
of blew my mind, the idea that this family that's quite well known for philanthropy had

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,880
made such a huge fortune on this drug with such a controversial legacy. That was kind

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,240
of the way in for me.

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,280
I kind of drew on a piece of paper a long time ago when I was trying to get my mind

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,880
around this, how many actors there were. The paper looked something like this. It started

38
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:45,960
on the left and it had producers. I was talking about this not through the illicit chains.

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,400
You had the pharma companies of which Purdue would be the champion of them. Then you have

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,240
the distributors or the intermediaries, the McKesson's and the Cardinals of the world.

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,400
I actually knew a lot about McKesson through a previous life, so I was intimately familiar

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,680
with what companies like McKesson did and how they were able to distribute products

43
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,880
from the producers to the retail, the pharmacy, the CVSs of the world. That became your third

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,720
actor. Your fourth actor then became the FDA in the approval process of a drug and then

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,160
the DEA around enforcement. You could even put those two in a bucket. You then have the

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,360
regulators that create or the policymakers rather that create the policies that allow

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
these entities to exist. Then you have the providers, people that write the prescriptions

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,920
for these things and ultimately you have the patients. That's maybe a bit of an oversimplification,

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,120
but it gives you a sense of just how complicated this web is. Now, we're going to spend a lot

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,880
of time talking about one entity within one of those buckets. Why do you think that that is a

51
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,960
place for someone who's maybe listening to this podcast to get a pretty good sense of the magnitude

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,440
of this problem? Because I don't think anybody could with a straight face say there isn't a

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,320
problem. You'll put some numbers to what that means. But it's interesting that perhaps the

54
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,000
study of Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers, more than any other single entity in that entire

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,960
chain that I explained, could provide a greater context of what we're up against. Would you

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,280
agree with that? I'm assuming you have a bias, otherwise you wouldn't have studied them so

57
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,160
extensively. Yeah, it's interesting. It's great that you lay it out with that much nuance because

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:35,880
that's the kind of nuance that often gets lost. There's two things I'd say. One is a sort of

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,320
observation that I would make as a writer and a journalist and somebody who writes books. I go

60
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,240
where my interests lead me. I write stories that I think are interesting stories, interesting to

61
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,520
me that I think are important, that I think would be interesting to readers. It's very, very often

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,840
the case that I'll spend a lot of time on something and the reaction that people have is,

63
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,040
well, why did you pick this? Why didn't you write about this other thing? I think that there's this

64
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:12,400
other variable that's very important here. I kind of instinctively resist those types of questions,

65
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,120
right? Because on some level, I feel as though it's my prerogative as a writer to kind of pick the

66
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,560
area that interests me and do it and hopefully do it well in a way that has some integrity. But I

67
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,720
make no claim to suggesting like this is the be all and end all. So in this case, if it's the opioid

68
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,480
crisis, there would never be any suggestion that like this is the only book you need to read on the

69
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:39,080
opioid crisis. And to segue from that into the particulars here. So when we talk about the opioid

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,000
crisis, we're talking about an incredibly complex public health crisis that unfolds over the course

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,240
of a quarter of a century. Today, the numbers are a little imprecise, but you have at least a half

72
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,080
a million people who've died from opioid overdoses since the mid to late 1990s. By some estimates,

73
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,680
you have two plus million Americans today struggling with an opioid use disorder of one

74
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,600
sort or another. And when we talk about opioids, that's actually a kind of pretty capacious

75
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:20,080
category, right? So it's regulated drugs like OxyContin, but it's also fentanyl that comes in

76
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:30,480
from China or Mexico. It's heroin. And in fact, when you talk about the death toll today, I think

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,400
the Sacklers certainly would be quick to say today, people are dying in very large numbers from

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:47,360
heroin and fentanyl overdoses, not from OxyContin or indeed from most prescription painkillers.

79
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:55,760
This problem has kind of transitioned into an illicit drug problem. So why pick OxyContin and

80
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,080
why pick the Sacklers? In my view, in part because it's an interesting story, I'm interested in the

81
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,560
fact that this was a family, family dynamics are interesting to me, in part because of the

82
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,640
philanthropic legacy because there's this kind of disconnect or there was until recent years

83
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,080
between the reputation that the family had and what I would argue is the reality of their business.

84
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,880
But most importantly, because I think that this was a, OxyContin was sort of the, in the words of

85
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,600
somebody who worked on the drug, was the tip of the spear. So I think it's, you know, this is the

86
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,880
kind of nuance that often gets lost, right? But it can be possible to stipulate that today the

87
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,680
opioid crisis is a heroin and fentanyl crisis. And also to keep in your mind the idea that

88
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,560
absent OxyContin, we might not be where we are today, that it was the kind of first mover

89
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,720
in terms of changing prescribing habits in the United States in a way that had really fundamental

90
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,920
consequences and ultimately built up a market for these drugs, a market which eventually migrated

91
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,360
to illicit sources of supply. So that would be the reason I'm sure we can talk about it in more

92
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,160
detail, but I think there's kind of a special role that Purdue and the Sackler's played, which is not

93
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,400
for a second to suggest that there isn't blame with all those different buckets that you mentioned,

94
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,640
because they're absolutely it is. And I think, you know, based on what I've read of your writing,

95
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,480
you also seem very, very well informed about those other buckets. So I definitely want to make sure

96
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,400
we touch on them, but there's no place to start like where we're going to start. So

97
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,880
let's start with the three Sackler brothers. Take your pick of who you want to begin with, Arthur,

98
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,040
Raymond Mortimer. Who were these guys? What got them interested in pharmaceuticals?

99
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,680
Yeah, I mean, you have to start with Arthur, I think you've got these three brothers who,

100
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,000
they were the children of immigrants, their parents had come over from Europe at the turn

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,160
of the last century, settled in Brooklyn. They were Jewish, parents didn't speak English really

102
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:12,160
all that well. Initially, they spoke Yiddish in the home. And they raised their kids to

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,640
believe in a few things. I think to believe in education, to believe in meritocracy.

104
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,760
You know, there's this, I think, kind of wonderfully American. There are these kind

105
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,200
of very American mythical contours to the early parts of this story, right? Where there's a family

106
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,280
that kind of came with nothing and had a hope and an expectation that within the span of one

107
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,000
generation, they would build an empire and really kind of make their mark on the country and the

108
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,720
world. And they were right. And so they raised these three brothers. Arthur later said that

109
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,600
from the age of four, he knew he would be a doctor with a sense that, you know, you're all

110
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
going to grow up, you're going to get educated, you're going to become physicians. And there was

111
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,440
a sense that there was kind of nothing as prestigious and virtuous as being a doctor.

112
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,920
I think there was a real kind of veneration in this family for the role of the physician

113
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,520
in society. And so the brothers grow up, but they also grow up against the backdrop of the

114
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:28,000
Great Depression. There's a period where their father loses everything. And so there was an

115
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,800
expectation that you also have to go out there and hustle and make money and have jobs. And so all

116
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,400
three brothers worked multiple jobs. And I'd say in the book of Arthur Sackler, it's like he's a

117
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,040
guy, it's like he squeezed four or five lifetimes into one lifetime in terms of everything that he

118
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:56,320
did. And they end up eventually in the pharmaceutical business. But the way they get there is through

119
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
pharmaceutical advertising and marketing. And that actually starts back in high school. You know,

120
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,640
when Arthur Sackler's in high school, he gets jobs on the student publications. He's at this

121
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,480
huge high school, Erasmus Hall High School. It's something like six or seven thousand students

122
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,720
in Brooklyn, in Flatbush. It's still there today. And he gets jobs, you know, on the student

123
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,200
magazine, the student newspaper, but he becomes the advertising manager. And if you think about it,

124
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,280
you have six or seven thousand students that you can reach. That was a real job. And so that's

125
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,040
where the hustle starts with Arthur. And all three brothers end up training a psychiatrist,

126
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,240
practicing a psychiatrist. But they pretty quickly pivot into commerce.

127
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,440
So what were the types of drugs of that era that were really making a difference in their practice?

128
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,080
It seems that, you know, sedatives were potentially becoming of interest in that era.

129
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Yeah. I mean, you know, you have this kind of early amazing moment where Arthur there's this

130
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,120
pattern that asserts itself with the brothers where Arthur goes and he does something and then

131
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,120
he kind of brings his brothers in with them. That starts in high school with him getting he's got

132
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,440
got more jobs and he can handle. So he starts handing them off to the brothers. And he ends up

133
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,640
at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Hospital, which is a huge asylum, vast kind of industrial asylum

134
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,280
in Queens, New York, public state mental hospital with a staggering capacity. Right. It's something

135
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,160
like six thousand beds. I mean, when I read that, I thought that can't be possible. I don't know what

136
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,480
that would look like, meaning I literally can't picture the infrastructure large enough to have

137
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,200
six thousand inpatient beds. Yeah. I mean, there's a vast facility, but I believe it was a facility

138
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,000
designed for four thousand beds. So I mean, part of this is a reflection of the kind of,

139
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
you know, it's interesting because in these years, right, like this is this is pre-thorazine.

140
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,240
It's kind of the the it's like the last kind of maximalist phase of

141
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,760
of big state mental hospitals, right, of people basically being warehoused for life in these

142
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,360
facilities. It's just prior to the deinstitutionalization that happens in the decades that

143
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,240
follow. And so the brothers get there and they're shocked by the conditions. And also, if you think

144
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,080
about it, I mean, Arthur in particular, he was a Freudian. He trained us at Freudian. Right. So

145
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,000
not a lot of talk therapy happening at a six thousand bed hospital. They were looking for.

146
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
Were they still doing lobotomies and things like that?

147
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,680
They were. I mean, in fact, lobotomies start up during this time. So it's a lot of electroshock

148
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,680
treatment. And then and then lobotomies. And I should say, I mean, you know,

149
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,040
electroshock has its has its defenders even today. It obviously has, you know,

150
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,240
it is very successful for some people in some circumstances. But the Sackler brothers are there

151
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,760
and they're administering it thousands of times. And I think it just became more and more demoralizing

152
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,040
for them because they just felt as though we have to. How can we as physicians not have

153
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:29,120
developed some more humane way of administering to our patients? And so they develop, even at that

154
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,400
point, this theory that a lot of the afflictions they're seeing are probably have some some basis

155
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,120
that is fundamentally chemical. And if that's the case, then there's probably some chemical solution.

156
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
And the brothers don't have anything to do with Thorazine. But when it comes along,

157
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
they see that right. I mean, this is in some ways a kind of glimpse of the future that they had

158
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:01,520
that they had envisioned. And it was, I think, generally speaking, an exciting time in the

159
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,960
pharma business, right? Because you have you have penicillin, which is a huge game changer in the

160
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,880
Second World War. And then a lot of these, you know, these companies that today we think of as

161
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,080
like big pharma. Prior to the Second World War, they didn't really look like they do now.

162
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
They were producing chemicals, but they weren't really producing branded drugs in quite the same

163
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,320
way. And then you just get this go go period where they're all competing, and they're developing new

164
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,720
antibiotics, and they're coming out with new products every few weeks, and suddenly they need

165
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:46,240
to differentiate themselves. And consumers are, you know, they're no longer going to the pharmacy

166
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,920
and having the pharmacist mix whatever it is that their doctor has prescribed. They're going in and

167
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:00,560
requesting drugs by their brand name. And so it's in that kind of exciting, I think quite idealistic

168
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,440
whirlwind climate that the Sackler brothers come of age.

169
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,880
Where did Purdue Pharma come from? Was it a company that they founded? Was it something

170
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,560
that they bought and later transformed? It was the latter. It had been its origins date back to the

171
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,920
19th century. It was a little patent medicine company based funnily enough on Christopher

172
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,760
Street in Greenwich Village, which is like, you know, you can go to the building that it once

173
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,840
occupied. It's just funny that the, you know, the what had once been the sort of humble Purdue

174
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:46,960
Frederick factory is like today, somebody's $18 million townhouse. And in 1952, Arthur Sackler had

175
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,320
already achieved a great deal of financial success, not in the drug business per se, but in

176
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,640
in pharmaceutical advertising. So he kind of, he really makes his name by joining and then

177
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,600
taking over a pharmaceutical advertising firm. And he's a genius for advertising drugs. At this

178
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
point, where all these drug companies need to figure out ways to differentiate their products

179
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:19,280
and reach doctors and persuade them to prescribe. And with some of the money he's made, Arthur

180
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,840
purchases this company, Purdue Frederick, and he basically gives it to his brothers. So he remains

181
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:31,040
a, you know, he's a stakeholder in the company, he owns a third of it. But he's a silent partner,

182
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,200
basically, and the brothers will run the company. And that's in starting in 52.

183
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
And what happens over the next 30 years?

184
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,960
So they, you know, it's funny. Purdue Frederick was a very successful company. I mean,

185
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:55,440
the brothers get rich, but they're getting rich in a way that is, I think that even Arthur would

186
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:04,480
probably have sniffed at. Because Arthur, who again, you know, he's one of the owners of the

187
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,520
company, but not involved day to day, he's really focusing on the marketing of pharmaceuticals.

188
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,240
And his big success is, I mean, he had many successes, but his biggest success

189
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,600
is that he designs the marketing and advertising strategy for the minor trinicalizer, Librium,

190
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,000
and then for Valium, both of which Roche develops. And Librium becomes the biggest selling drug in

191
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
the history of the pharmaceutical industry. And then it's surpassed only by Valium. And then for

192
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,080
years, the two of them are in the top five drugs nationwide. And Arthur designed all the advertising

193
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,880
and the marketing for that. And he devised this interesting compensation scheme where basically

194
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
he said, I'm going to get an escalating series of bonuses depending on how many pills you sell,

195
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,800
and there's no ceiling. So he becomes vastly wealthy on the basis of these drugs.

196
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,440
His brothers, meanwhile, you know, what they're doing is less cutting edge. They basically license

197
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,680
over the counter products and then sell them. And they were really smart about it. So they

198
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,920
had an antiseptic solution, Betadine, which is still out there. And they got the rights to that

199
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,240
just before the Vietnam War. It had kind of battlefield applications in Vietnam. They had

200
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,200
a laxative, Seneca, very successful. These are these kind of cash crop products. They're very

201
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,640
unglamorous, but they're staples, over the counter stuff. But year in, year out, they're

202
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
very, very successful. The irony, by the way, of the company that would create

203
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,960
the opioid boom, having a laxative, which is, of course, they already would address one of the

204
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,000
most painful short term consequences of opioid use being constipation.

205
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
Well, and the crazy thing is that they eventually it gets to a point where

206
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,600
the sales reps for Purdue would go out and, you know, they'd market the one with the other,

207
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:08,720
right? It's they would market them together. But it's really only in the 80s.

208
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,560
That the company starts getting more late 70s, early 80s. The company starts getting aggressive

209
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:23,280
about really investing in R&D and developing its own prescription drugs. And it's at that point

210
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,160
that they move into pain management. Any inclination from your research why they decided to keep this

211
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,280
company private, as opposed to take it public, like many of the large pharma companies?

212
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:50,560
God, you know, I can only speculate. But the the Sacklers had a real sense, I think for a long

213
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:58,240
time, that this was a kind of old world enterprise, that it was a family business. It was family owned,

214
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,880
physician owned, they would always say there was a sense that they controlled it. And they thought

215
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,720
of the people who worked for them as family. You know, it's really only with the advent of

216
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,560
OxyContin in the 90s that the that it becomes this, you know, multi billion dollar company up to that

217
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:23,520
point. It was a pretty modest outfit. The Sackler brothers themselves did really well. They were

218
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:32,400
very wealthy. But it was a kind of manageable family firm. And I think that there was there

219
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,080
was something to that. I don't know. I don't know what it would have looked like if it went public.

220
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I do know that you've kind of put your finger on something there. Because I think when you when

221
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,040
you get into the later stages, kind of post the introduction of OxyContin, there's a lot of stuff

222
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,800
that happens in this story that would never happen in a public company. Yeah, that's sort of my

223
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,440
that's the revisionist history in me, which is saying like, had they been a public company,

224
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,160
how far would this have gone? Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to suggest that I think in the early

225
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,560
going, and we can sort of get into the into the particulars, but there are these like hinge

226
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:15,760
moments in this story. And so you have, you know, you've got all the stuff that happens prior to the

227
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,680
introduction of OxyContin. And then you start seeing things go wrong, and then they go more wrong.

228
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,000
And it's like, well, how do you handle it when you see how do you handle it when you start getting

229
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,320
calls saying that the product that you sell is killing people. And I think that probably would

230
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,760
have been a different response in a public company. And then the really crazy thing is eventually

231
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,040
we're getting ahead of ourselves here, but eventually you get a guilty plea in a federal

232
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:49,280
criminal case in 2007. And I think at a public company, if you had that, I just think heads would

233
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,960
have rolled, you'd have a total change of personnel, you know, big shake up on the board.

234
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,080
And at a privately held family company, what happened was like, no, you're fired. Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,000
So talk a little bit about MS content as the precursor to OxyContin and

236
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,560
maybe the pharmacokinetics of it, but more importantly, what that transition was about.

237
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:26,560
So, you know, in the 1980s, you saw the beginning, I mean, actually, taking back to the 70s, a kind of

238
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,320
revisionist school of physicians who felt in the UK and in the US and other parts of the world,

239
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,480
who felt that the medical establishment had been not taking pain seriously enough as a problem,

240
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,800
that doctors weren't treating pain aggressively. They were treating it just just merely as a

241
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,800
symptom, not as a problem in and of itself, that there wasn't enough medical education

242
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,680
for physicians in terms of identifying pain and responding to it.

243
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,200
And kind of going along with this was it was a sense that that many physicians had that

244
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:12,560
there was a resistance to prescribing opioids out of a fear of addiction that

245
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,520
that doctors have been too stingy in prescribing opioids for pain because of

246
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,160
concerns about abuse and addiction. And it's in this context that MS content,

247
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,960
this drug has developed and it's a cancer drug. It's a drug for cancer pain.

248
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,400
And it's basically just morphine. But the real innovation was the content part. So content

249
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,240
short for continuous. And it's essentially this decoding on the pill. And the idea is that this

250
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,600
will regulate the flow of the drug into the bloodstream over a course of hours. And so

251
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:55,120
MS content was developed in the UK and then rolled out in the US. And it was it was

252
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,400
it was it was kind of a groundbreaking drug in its way, very successful for the company.

253
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,800
I remember exactly what it was generating in terms of revenue at its height, but

254
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:13,040
three or four hundred million dollars a year, which was a lot for Purdue. And at the time, and

255
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,680
it was a big success. And I think that the family was was proud of it. And there was a sense that

256
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,920
they were doing a good thing, relieving terrible pain for people suffering from cancer

257
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,520
and and doing very well financially. And so they were kind of in this world of doctors who were

258
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,560
thinking about pain and wanting to kind of reevaluate the way in which pain is treated.

259
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,680
They were heroes. And you had this kind of interesting. And I don't think necessarily

260
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,640
altogether cynical confluence of interests, right, in which Purdue starts sponsoring

261
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,640
academic conferences on the treatment of pain and medical conferences and seminars. And they're

262
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,360
sort of out there with an obvious commercial interest. But also, I think a sense that,

263
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,880
you know, we're part of a revolution here. We're going to revolutionize the way in which pain is

264
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,720
treated. So whose idea is OxyContin? I mean, in some sense, it's an obvious leap because if

265
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,680
M.S. content is simply morphine sulfate formulated in a continuous fashion, there are other narcotics

266
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:33,440
out there. Percocet already existed. It was simply hydrocodone with acetaminophen. Hydrocodone existed

267
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,240
by itself in a non-time released format. So was there great innovation basically saying we're just

268
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,720
going to make a time release version of hydrocodone just as it had been done with morphine? Was that

269
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,280
effectively the aha moment? Yeah, I mean, what happens is that M.S. content is something I mean,

270
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,880
I should say, and this will be this will be not a surprise to you. But but to me coming from the

271
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,840
outside, I was really startled. I knew as a kind of objective analytical matter that that the

272
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,760
lifecycle of a patent is very important to a drug company. I don't think I fully appreciated the

273
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:21,360
degree to which it is the sun and the stars. And you know, it's everything. And there were so many

274
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,280
points in the course of my reporting for this story where there'd be some some sort of mystery

275
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,240
about motivation. There'd be some weird thing that they did, and I couldn't figure out why.

276
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
And I would puzzle over it and puzzle over it and puzzle over it. And then it always turned out to

277
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,360
be something having to do with a patent, you know, that the, for example, the pediatric indication,

278
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,960
the pediatric indication, very good example, right? So the where they they applied to get at a point

279
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,240
where oxycontin was hugely controversial already, causing all kinds of problems they they applied to

280
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,120
for the the pediatric indication for the drug. And I sort of couldn't figure out why. And and

281
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,200
they had all these explanations that turned out to not be true. And then it turned out it was

282
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,320
because they thought they would get an additional six months of patent exclusivity if they got it.

283
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,800
But the there's a bunch of cases like that. And in the case of MS content, the patent is running

284
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,240
out at a certain point, and they realized that it's going to decimate their profits.

285
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,800
It's going to decimate their profits. And so they just start talking about, hey,

286
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:33,920
what else could we put with, you know, the content system? And some of the family dynamics here are

287
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,160
a little humorous. But there's, according to Kathy Sackler, who's one of the second generation

288
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,360
Sacklers, who's involved in the company and is a medical doctor. She has dinner with Richard

289
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:51,120
Sackler, her cousin and kind of rival within the company at a certain point. And she suggests what

290
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,560
about oxycodone? And according to her, Richard didn't know what oxycodone was. And she had to

291
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:04,880
explain. And oxycodone is stronger than both hydrocodone and morphine. It is. And the end,

292
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,320
well, I mean, part of what's interesting about about oxycodone is that the there's this amazing

293
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,760
thing that happens basically where they make their decision. Okay, we're going to use oxycodone.

294
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:22,160
So we'll develop oxycontin. And there are these conversations that happen, and they happen over

295
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,760
email. And I have the emails where these senior executives at the company and Richard Sackler

296
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,160
are talking about the market and the idea that MS content was a drug for cancer pain.

297
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,200
And the stigma associated with morphine, this notion that, you know,

298
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,280
if you're a regular person, not a doctor, and your doctor tells you that your mother is going on

299
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:59,040
morphine, that means your mother is going to die. And what they realize is that oxycodone didn't

300
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,760
have those same associations, even though it's stronger than morphine. They did focus groups.

301
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,360
And you have oxycodone in Percocet and in Percodan. And that was the primary way in which

302
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,720
physicians were encountering those drugs. And, you know, that's right. I misspoke earlier.

303
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,680
I said it was hydrocodone. It's actually oxycodone. That's right. It's oxycodone. And when they're cut

304
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,400
with aspirin or acetaminophen, it's you know, it's a relatively small dose. There's only so much

305
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:34,480
you can take. So what they noticed in these focus groups is that physicians had a sort of a sense of

306
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,760
oxycodone as more benign, you know, less threatening. There was less stigma, but also they saw it as

307
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,320
weaker. And there are these incredible emails where they say, well, listen, there's only so

308
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,360
many people who have cancer pain. You know, we did great with our cancer drug, but there's a

309
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,080
much bigger market out there of people suffering not just from severe pain, but moderate pain,

310
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,960
chronic pain, back pain, sports injuries. There's a funny cartoon you could envision here,

311
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,600
which is another revisionist, which is imagine if instead they just decided to figure out a way to

312
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,120
make more cancer patients. How could we do to increase a number of people dying of cancer

313
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,600
to expand our market? And then someone goes, no, no, no, that's too hard. That's too hard.

314
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,760
I got a better idea. Let's just figure out a way to make everybody who doesn't have cancer

315
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,360
takes this drug. Right. And in fact, to kind of to sort of create the need, which is, you know,

316
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,680
a big part of what the marketing ended up being. Yeah. I mean, the analogy that I come back to,

317
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,720
you know, the first third of the book is devoted to Arthur Sackler in those earlier years. And

318
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,000
that was a very deliberate choice, even though Arthur Sackler dies in 87 before the introduction

319
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
of Oxycontin. Because I think there are all of these, I think there are all of these

320
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,680
things that happen earlier that are kind of the seeds for what comes later. So the analogy I

321
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,880
always think of is Thorazine, which the original Sackler brothers see. You know, Thorazine is a

322
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:10,000
major tranquilizer for people who are psychotic. And it was very successful, you know, emptied out

323
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,880
the the asylums pretty quickly. I mean, there were other things that did as well, but it was

324
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,840
a real game changer. But there's only so many people who are actually required that kind of

325
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,480
heavy duty solution. And then Arthur Sackler makes his fortune on the minor tranquilizers, where,

326
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,600
you know, who among us doesn't feel a little stressed at the end of the day? You know,

327
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,160
who couldn't benefit from something to make them relax a little bit? And that was what turned

328
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,680
Liberty and Valium into these huge blockbusters. It's kind of a similar thing here, where

329
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,520
there's this sense that, you know, MS-Contin is a drug for this subset of people who are

330
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,160
experiencing terrible cancer pain. There's a much bigger community of people

331
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,000
who have moderate pain. But the weirdness of it is that they then take a drug that is stronger,

332
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,400
not weaker, and market it that way. And you see these emails in which these executives say,

333
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:12,640
in our focus groups, doctors erroneously think that oxycodone is weaker than morphine.

334
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:19,840
Let's not do anything to make them realize that they're wrong about the product that we're

335
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,240
selling them, because if we did, it could constrain our market. So they developed this new drug.

336
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:33,520
What's unusual about the process by which it receives its FDA approval?

337
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,720
A handful of things. So they-

338
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,680
We can insert Curtis Wright at any point here, by the way.

339
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, exactly. So there's a guy named Curtis Wright, who was the medical examiner at FDA,

340
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,440
who was kind of the grand inquisitor. He was the one they had to satisfy

341
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,320
in order to get the drug approved, but also in order to get the marketing claims.

342
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Maybe explain to folks why those two things are very important. Why is it that

343
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,680
if you and I went into business tomorrow to create a drug, the FDA would have to approve it

344
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,440
from a safety and efficacy standpoint. But then they'd also have to basically put guardrails

345
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,200
around what we could actually say it's for. I don't think people fully understand that dual

346
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,880
role there. Well, I mean, it's the strangest thing. Richard Sackler, the second-generation

347
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,760
Sackler, is probably the most intimately acquainted with or involved with OxyContin.

348
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,000
There's a point where he talks about how the package insert in a bottle of pills

349
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,320
is our most potent selling instrument. And it's a strange thing, right? Because I think for the

350
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,600
average consumer, you see the sort of dense wording on that and it feels like the fine print.

351
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,240
It feels like something the doctors read. You may read it as well, but it doesn't feel like a

352
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,760
marketing document. But if you're the drug company, it's all about the indications. It's all about

353
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:18,000
the claims that you can make for what kinds of ailments this medication might alleviate.

354
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,800
And then also in terms of the kind of competitive positioning. So in the case of OxyContin,

355
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,760
I mean, I'll give you a very extreme example. They didn't do any tests on the

356
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,160
addictiveness of the drug. They didn't do any tests on the abuse liability of the drug.

357
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,400
But there was a kind of hypothesis that they had at Purdue, which was because of the content

358
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:51,360
system, you wouldn't have the kind of peaks and troughs of a sort of wave of euphoria when a big

359
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,760
dose of the drug hits your bloodstream, followed by a kind of diminution and withdrawal. Instead,

360
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,280
it's the steady, regulated, continuous flow. And their hypothesis was that because of that,

361
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,720
it wouldn't be addictive and it wouldn't be subject to abuse. And that that was a competitive

362
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:20,160
advantage vis-a-vis other opioid products that were out there on the market. And you have this

363
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,320
kind of crazy stretch where they start working very closely with Curtis Wright on the approval

364
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:35,360
process. Some strange stuff happens. I mean, the company said, I don't even think this is in the

365
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,320
book, but the company sends Curtis Wright, this is in the 1990s, this is in the 95. The company sends

366
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:47,840
him a webcam. This is like a very early webcam where he can talk directly with folks in Stanford.

367
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,840
Curtis Wright starts requesting that they send things not to his FDA office, but to his house.

368
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,080
And at a certain point, a team of people from Purdue travel to Maryland and get a hotel room

369
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,960
and they spend three days with Curtis Wright helping him write his reviews of their studies.

370
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,920
Let's just pause there for a second. It's almost impossible to imagine that happening.

371
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm not saying it didn't because you've got the email proof that it happened.

372
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm just saying from a matter of process, that statement is so difficult to comprehend.

373
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,880
So how do we put that in perspective? What did other people at the FDA know at this point in time?

374
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:49,440
What do you think emboldened the Sackler leadership to do that without fear of Curtis Wright turning

375
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,680
to them and saying, are you freaking crazy? I mean, how does this unfold?

376
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,720
So it's really hard to say, and I've tried to kind of puzzle through this. And I should say,

377
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,160
I mean, Curtis Wright wouldn't talk about it. I got him on the phone and he very quickly hung up.

378
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,080
He didn't want to talk to me about any of this. I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with

379
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:23,120
the FDA, which they dragged their feet in the way that federal bureaucracies always do. So I

380
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,560
actually sued them in federal court to compel them to turn over documents to me. And I got a New York

381
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,040
federal judge to order them to do document production to me, thousands and thousands of

382
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:42,320
pages of documents. And my first request was for all the emails of Curtis Wright. And the FDA came

383
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,320
back and told me that all of his correspondence and emails have either been lost or destroyed.

384
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,800
Yeah, which again, you couldn't make that level of malfeasance up. Like you can't,

385
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,920
you know, it's so ridiculous. How do they even say that with a straight face?

386
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,960
I know. I know. Well, particularly given that the, you know, I could understand if it was a sort of a

387
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,040
document retention thing where after a certain number of years, they eliminate stuff. In his

388
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,720
case, though, this is a guy who had been, you know, he was investigated by Department of Justice

389
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:23,200
investigators, really starting in like 2002, 2003. I mean, this was somebody who was red flagged

390
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:32,400
early by other federal agencies, the notion that they would today say, you know, it's the equivalent

391
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,960
of saying like there was a very small warehouse fire. It's just that box, I'm afraid that, you know,

392
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,720
we didn't retain. It's pretty shocking to me. But so I've tried to sort of puzzle this out.

393
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,160
There's an interesting email chain. So some of this email has come out, not through the FDA,

394
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,320
but through federal investigations of Purdue. There's an interesting moment where one of the

395
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,640
Purdue officials says that he happened to bump into Curtis Wright at a conference. This is as

396
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,680
all of this approval stuff is happening. And they talked in a kind of a sidebar way. It was not

397
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,760
formal. And I, you know, my sense is that the generally speaking, the FDA process, at least in

398
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,920
theory, is one that is, it's pretty formalized, right? Because you don't want too much of an

399
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,200
opportunity for improper influence to happen. And there's this interesting memo that the Purdue

400
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,400
guy sends back to headquarters where he says, you know, I got talking with Curtis Wright, it was

401
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,040
great. We talked about the whole Oxycontin thing. And he indicated that he would be open to other

402
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,480
such informal exchanges in the future or something to that effect. So I don't know. I don't know how

403
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,720
to how to make sense. I mean, wouldn't the Occam's razor response be the following given that a year

404
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:50,400
after leaving the FDA, Curtis Wright is now employed by Purdue Pharma? Isn't the only obvious

405
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,040
explanation here that there was a quid pro quo, a very clear and direct quid pro quo made between

406
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:05,280
Purdue and Curtis Wright? So it's interesting, the former federal prosecutor, long time federal

407
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,320
prosecutor from the Western District of Virginia who prepared really the, you know, the biggest

408
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,800
case against Purdue and spent years pouring over millions of pages of documents and looked really

409
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,920
hard at Curtis Wright. He told me on the record, this guy is pretty careful about what he says.

410
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,520
And he told me on the record, I think a deal was made. He said, I can't prove it, just my opinion.

411
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,480
But I think a deal was made. When you look at the totality of the evidence, it seems hard for me to

412
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,600
believe any other, I mean, he's saying exactly what you are, you know, any other explanation.

413
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:46,720
I don't know that I need to go that far. And here's why. I don't think Purdue even needed to say,

414
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,200
hey, make this work for us, and there might be a job for you on the other side.

415
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,920
I think that, and this is where from a policy point of view, this gets really hard to

416
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,080
regulate, right, is that the FDA is full of over educated, really smart people who are making

417
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:12,400
government salaries. And, you know, they have the unglamorous task of working on these approvals. And

418
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,080
on the other side of the table is this huge multi-billion dollar industry, where, you know,

419
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,640
you can make a lot of money and where there's a great deal of interest in former FDA officials,

420
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,800
you know, both in having them come and work at the firm because it's at the pharmaceutical firm,

421
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,240
because that's useful in a whole bunch of ways. But also, I would argue, I think there's probably

422
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,800
a great deal of interest in having the FDA officials that you're talking to know that someday there

423
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:52,800
might be a job for them. And that's this hard thing, because it's not corruption in an explicit

424
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,520
quid pro quo sense. It's not corruption in a way that's actually all that easy to please.

425
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,360
Because if you're the FDA, what do you do? I mean, do you say, okay, we're gonna have a cooling off

426
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:09,760
period, you know, once you leave the agency, how long? A year? Three years? You know, at what point

427
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,160
do you start losing talent? Because people don't want to be locked up after they leave. I think

428
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,200
these are, I don't mean to suggest for a second that these are easy questions. But I also think

429
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,760
there's what I would call a kind of soft corruption that pervades this whole process. I don't think

430
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
it's unique to Curtis Wright. He's a very extreme example. But what you get is in his case, as you

431
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,000
said, he goes a year after OxyContin is approved, he goes and works at Purdue for three times his

432
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,560
government salary. But to your point about the marketing claims, there's a line in the original

433
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:57,440
package insert for OxyContin that says the content seal is believed to reduce the abuse liability of

434
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:09,440
the drug. And that's a weird thing to have in a package insert. In general, I think I mean, it's a

435
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,120
great marketing claim. But it's like is believed doesn't seem very scientific, necessarily.

436
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,120
What was the basis of that belief, the scientific basis? There was there a study that was cited?

437
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,360
Was there an experiment that was done? I mean, it wouldn't be hard to have studied these things.

438
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,120
There wasn't one. No, in this case, what it was was it was this conjecture that because of the

439
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,880
content system, you're not getting the high highs and the low lows. And therefore it would it would

440
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:47,200
make it less prone to abuse than other drugs. And the real measure of how compromised this line was

441
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,640
is that to this day, nobody will admit writing that line. So Curtis Wright has been asked about

442
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,400
this and he said, oh, yeah, it was it wasn't the FDA, it was Purdue Pharma, the Purdue Pharma

443
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,880
officials who were there say, oh, wasn't us, it was Curtis Wright. But I mean, to me as a consumer,

444
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,480
right, the idea that the FDA is working so closely with a drug company that literally you don't know

445
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,240
where one ends and the other begins. And there's a line that ends up in the package insert claiming

446
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,440
that this drug is safer than other alternatives. And nobody can tell you who wrote it.

447
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:26,160
So is it 96 when MS when when OxyContin hits the hits the retail?

448
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:35,040
Early 96. Yeah. So how long does it take before the unintended consequences?

449
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:43,520
Because there's really two unintended consequences here, I guess. The first is people who probably

450
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,360
would be better served with another form of pain control or instead using this drug. That would be

451
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,360
one unintended consequence. That's one that Purdue would not be against because that's simply more

452
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,400
market share. And then there's the unintended consequence that everyone, including Purdue,

453
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,760
would presumably not want, which is you start to kill your customers. You know, sort of the tobacco

454
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,960
company problem, right? Like to have an addictive product with no termination of use,

455
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,000
is wonderful if you just could figure out a way to keep the customer alive. So

456
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,920
what are the canaries in the coal mine with respect to these problems and how are they handled?

457
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,720
So, I mean, I think in some ways it's probably

458
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,120
useful to start with what the official story was,

459
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:44,880
which is that the drugs released in early 96. And according to sworn testimony by

460
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,920
several senior executives at the company and by Richard Sackler, they had no inkling that there

461
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,280
was any kind of a major problem for four years. There were four blissful years where they got

462
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,360
lots of letters from pain patients saying, you know, you've given me my life back. And there was

463
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,160
no real sense at all that there was any kind of a problem. And it's only in early 2000,

464
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,440
when the United States attorney for the state of Maine writes a letter to thousands of physicians

465
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,880
saying this drug OxyContin is really dangerous, actually. It's killing people. People are

466
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,120
overdosing. We've got a real problem here and there's a crime problem associated with it.

467
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,480
And a little bit after this time, the chief medical officer, Paul Goldenheim, the chief medical

468
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,480
officer of Purdue Pharma is brought in front of Congress, right? And he's asked questions about

469
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,480
this. What does he say? Same thing. He says we had no inkling that there was any kind of big problem

470
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:51,760
until this hinge point, which is when this U.S. attorney writes this letter in 2000. So,

471
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,640
and interestingly, the other thing they say is that they say, oh, we read about it in the press.

472
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,600
They say we read about these problems in the press. And for me as a journalist, this was funny

473
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,760
because I've written about a lot of companies doing bad things and

474
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,880
reporters like to take credit where they can get it. But generally speaking of a company is doing

475
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,280
a bad thing, they don't find out about it because they read about it in your article. They usually

476
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,880
know a long time before the rest of the world does. So there was something about their explanation

477
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:41,440
that always seemed just on its face seemed a little fishy to me. When I dug into it and got a bunch of

478
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,600
documentation, what I learned is that it was it was a lie. I mean, they, you know, they knew really

479
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:59,040
early on. How bold a lie was that? Let's use Goldenheim as a specific example. So in 2000,

480
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,920
he's giving sworn testimony that we no clue this was going on. What do his emails from the late 1990s

481
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,600
suggest? That they did. I mean, it's not just, you know, you name it. There's all kinds of back and

482
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,480
forth about these drugs. There's another sort of associated lie that they told, which is that there

483
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,320
had never been a problem with MS content, which also is a lie, a lie that was told under oath,

484
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,240
when in fact, there's all kinds of back and forth about that. But you've got very, very senior

485
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,800
people, including Goldenheim, emailing about the fact that there's an abuse problem. Pharmacies are

486
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:43,280
getting robbed. You know, there's the kind of people talking about the street value of the drug.

487
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:50,320
There was a kind of media advisory group that was brought in to do interviews with these

488
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,320
senior officials. There are literally emails in which some of these senior officials who later

489
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,000
claimed that, you know, nothing was said will be emailing about it. And then they'll say,

490
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,000
should we have all this chat on email? You know, it's maybe not a good idea for us to be having

491
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,640
these conversations on email. So you have a very clear awareness that there's a problem. And if

492
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,400
you back up for a second, part of the reason OxyContin did what it did. Part of the reason I

493
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,200
would argue it changed the way in which these drugs are prescribed as a category of drugs

494
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,360
is that they had one of the biggest marketing forces ever. And they sent out hundreds of

495
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:32,080
say something like 700 sales reps to fan out across the country, meeting with thousands and

496
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,000
thousands of physicians. And that was how they kind of got the message of OxyContin out there.

497
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,440
But those are the canaries in the coal mine, right? Like those are the sales rep who

498
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,360
goes into a local community. There's a story I tell in the book about a guy named Steve May,

499
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:58,080
who was a Purdue sales rep in Virginia and West Virginia. And he had a, it's 99. So this is like

500
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:02,480
before, according to Goldenheim, like they didn't know anything at this point. It's 99.

501
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,600
Steve May had this one doctor, the really big prescribers, they would call them whales,

502
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,840
you know, to use the vernacular of a Vegas casino for a big gambler. Because if you had a big

503
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,960
prescriber, that was great for your, for your bonus if you were a sales rep. So Steve May had

504
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,760
this whale and he went to call on her, which he would do from time to time. And she's upset

505
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,760
when he showed up and he asked her what the problem was. And she said she had a young relative,

506
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,360
a young girl who'd just died of an OxyContin overdose. So there you literally have an OxyContin

507
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,160
sales rep going out and meeting with a doctor who's a big prescriber and finding out that her

508
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,320
relative has died from an OxyContin overdose. And all those reps are writing these encounters up

509
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,200
in notes and sending them back to headquarters. So I think what I was able to substantiate in

510
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,240
the book at some length is that it's clear really early on there's a problem. I think, you know,

511
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:07,760
from as early as 97. So that's just a year after the drug is released. And word is coming back

512
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,440
into the company and those discussions are not just happening at low levels. They're happening

513
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,320
at high levels. I think what happens in 2000 is it just becomes impossible for them to deny it

514
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,280
anymore. Right. It's like at that point, the sort of head in the sand won't work as a strategy. So

515
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,600
then you need to pivot. You need to say, okay, there is a problem. Here's our spin on it.

516
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:34,880
And that spin, of course, became these are really bad people. Like, you know, we've created

517
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,760
a miracle breakthrough product that helps millions of people. But there are these derelicts who abuse

518
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,960
this product and are jeopardizing it for everybody else. We really need to ramp up

519
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,720
the enforcement of those people or we need to somehow just decide that they're bad. I mean,

520
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:01,520
what was proposed as the remediation for the problem? It was a bunch of things, all of which

521
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,000
were very much along the lines of what you're talking about. So the suggestion was, you know,

522
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,760
there's nothing intrinsically dangerous about the drug. I should say the level of denial here

523
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:20,640
is pretty impressive. But I mean, the Sacklers even today argue that instances of iatrogenic

524
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,480
addiction to OxyContin, where it's prescribed to you by a doctor for a legitimate condition and

525
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:33,200
you take it as instructed by the physician, are vanishingly rare. That's like a block that they

526
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,240
have where they can't really acknowledge even today. Now, do we know what that true number is?

527
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:48,320
So if we say there are, and I'm being a bit perhaps overly simplistic, but and so feel free

528
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:54,320
to make this more realistic. But if we say there are three buckets in which a patient came across

529
00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:01,200
OxyContin, bucket one would be, and this excludes the cancer patient. So I want to take the end of

530
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,880
life cancer patient out of the equation for a moment. So you talk about patients who are not

531
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:12,080
terminally ill, who have become exposed to and or addicted to OxyContin. Entry path number one

532
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:20,480
is the individual who is recovering from surgery. They are by their actual doctor who is a legitimate

533
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,680
doctor given a prescription for a reasonable quantity of OxyContin that should get them through

534
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:34,160
the perioperative period. Path number two is the person who, and by the way, you can get to path

535
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,000
number two from path number one. So these are not independent paths, but path number two is

536
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,440
the sham doctor, the doc in the box who's prescribing this stuff from one state when

537
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:53,200
you're in another state, doing it online or running basically the revolving door clinic where you just

538
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,800
come in, you ask for what you want, you get a prescription, you go out the door provided you

539
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,240
fill it at a pharmacy a couple of hundred miles away. So, you know, they're a doctor only in legal

540
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,360
terms, but they're certainly not a physician in any reasonable sense of the word. And then path

541
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:15,040
number three is the illicit acquisition of OxyContin through a stolen channel. So in the much in the

542
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,160
same way you would buy any illegal drug, you're simply buying OxyContin. Do we have a sense of

543
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,840
the relative distribution of paths one, two, and three?

544
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,480
No. And I mean, I think it's very hard and in fact impossible to parse it out. And I also think it's

545
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,960
something that's fluctuated a lot over time, but you do get these little data points that I think

546
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:43,120
are illuminating. And these are honestly like two of the more shocking things I discovered in my

547
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,600
research, but it's hard because it's a little complex. And so sometimes I think from the cheap

548
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:56,560
seats, it's like hard to appreciate the gravity of this. So Purdue sells OxyContin, they release it in

549
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:04,000
96. Right away, people realize that that that content seal, you can override that just by

550
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,480
crushing the pills. So you can chew them, you can grind the pill, you can dissolve it in water after

551
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,640
you've grinded and shoot it if you want intravenously. There's actually a warning on the

552
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,200
models telling you not to crush the pills because if you do, you could get a potentially toxic dose

553
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,960
of oxycodone. So in a weird way that functions as a kind of inadvertent how-to. I think that's

554
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:33,920
significant for at least maybe for all three of the buckets you're talking about, because you get

555
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:44,800
people who are just kind of opportunistic drug users looking to get high. I certainly have

556
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,360
interviewed a lot of people who say that heroin was scary, you bought it on the street, you shoot

557
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,760
it with a needle, that they were looking to get high. It was like a party drug in high school,

558
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,040
OxyContin was, but that there was something reassuring about the fact that it had been

559
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,200
approved by the FDA, that it is, you know that even if you bought it from a dealer,

560
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,080
at some point this entered the stream of commerce. There was a doctor writing a prescription.

561
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:17,200
You also have people who are prescribed the drug by a doctor and it doesn't work for as long as

562
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,800
they think it will, or they find themselves just kind of in its grip, they want more, and some of

563
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,800
those people actually convert to the immediate release thing. What they find is they don't want

564
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:33,120
to wait and so they'll end up chewing the pills because it relieves their pain faster, you know,

565
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:40,560
is what they'll say. So you get different ways of getting there, but the pill can be crushed.

566
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:50,000
That's 96. In 2010, Purdue rolls out this reformulated version of OxyContin that they've

567
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,280
worked on for years. It's basically you kind of crush it. It's sort of, it's like a gummy bear,

568
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,840
you know, if you try and break it up, it just kind of goes chewy and gummy on you.

569
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,640
There's an interesting backstory there, questions about why it took so long to roll that out. There's

570
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,800
an interesting aspect of the timing, which is that the original patent on OxyContin were about

571
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,680
to run out. So it kind of just in the nick of time, they have this line extension basically in

572
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,680
the form of the reformulated drug. Well, it goes one better than that, doesn't it Patrick? Because

573
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,440
at the time they even basically declare that their old formulation is probably unsafe,

574
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,560
which is really a great dig at the competition, which is as we're about to roll this thing off

575
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:36,720
its patent life, we want to make sure that nobody else uses it either as we reignite a new patent

576
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,040
on a new drug, which is infinitely safer in the presence of our old dangerous drug. I mean,

577
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,960
again, that would be the skeptical view of things. Oh, I mean, and I think in this case,

578
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,760
the skeptical view is right on. And in fact, there are emails going back years and years and

579
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,640
years talking about how if they came up with a kind of abuse period, they would have to

580
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,960
kind of abuse proof, tamper proof formulation that would function as a line extension, that

581
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:05,040
that was the reason they were doing it primarily was to extend the patent life. But yeah, the kind

582
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:13,040
of the surpassing cynicism of the idea that having for at that point, 14 years said, oh,

583
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,560
it's perfectly safe. It's perfectly safe. It's perfectly safe. The original formulation,

584
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,440
they develop their new formulation, and then they turn around and say, but we wouldn't want to see

585
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,200
any generic versions of the original formulation, because in fact, it's not so safe after all,

586
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,280
is amazing. And it worked. And the FDA obliged. But so here's the statistic that really blows my

587
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:41,120
mind. 2010, the reformulated version is rolled out. And the old pills are, you know, they kind

588
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,800
of disappear from the shelves and the new ones take their place. And what I discovered was a

589
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:53,840
study, an internal study that found that in 2010, when this happened for the 80 milligram pills,

590
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,160
which is the biggest and most profitable pills on the market, also the most popular on the black

591
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:08,640
market, sales nationwide felt 25%. So I can't tell you proportionately who's in what bucket.

592
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:18,000
What I can tell you is that up to 2010, I think it's safe to intuit 25% of the sales of 80 milligram

593
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,400
OxyContin. We're going to people who were abusing those pills in, you know, in one way or another,

594
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,480
which is astonishing to me, because I mean, that's, that's like a non-trivial

595
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:37,040
part of the company's profits. So on the one hand, it's, you know, they don't want their patients,

596
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,520
their, their, their customers to die. On the other hand, there is a sense in which even as

597
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,880
they were decrying the black market, like the black market was helping to pay the bills at the company.

598
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,040
Yeah. And the thing that, the thing that I really wish we could have an insight into is

599
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,120
even if you take the most charitable view of things, which is that every person's first interaction

600
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:04,640
with OxyContin was through path one. That is to say you were legitimately prescribed this for

601
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:12,640
non-cancer pain by a legitimate caring, understanding physician. But then, you know,

602
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,960
a subset of the people left bucket one for bucket two or bucket three as their appetite for the drug

603
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,960
grew in the absence of an indication, right? That's versus how many people de novo show up in bucket

604
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,720
two and bucket three drug seeking. You know, the fact that we don't know that is, it makes this

605
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:37,680
very difficult and creates this moral ambiguity around it, which, you know, frankly is a bit of

606
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,120
a distraction from the real, you know, the culpability here. Oh, that's interesting. I mean,

607
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,400
I think it's, it's a very, I think the fact that we don't know it and that it's impossible to know,

608
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,040
combined with the fact that when you look at, you know, this is a favorite of Purdue and the

609
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,640
Sacklers, but like when you look at the toxicity reports on people who die, people who overdose,

610
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,120
it's often not just OxyContin in the bloodstream, right? It's often mixed with other things.

611
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:15,600
There's this whole kind of exercise of parsing, like moral and legal parsing that they do,

612
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:26,000
which, you know, I have to say for me, just as a, as someone who's trying to live a righteous life,

613
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,440
it's always amazing to me because I always just think, I can't imagine how do you get there? Like,

614
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:40,000
how do you, how do you get there? At a certain point, so many people have died from your product.

615
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:48,960
It's this kind of incredible symphony of rationalization that happens. But on your,

616
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,640
on your, on your point about, you know, everybody, the idea that, you know, ideally you'd have a

617
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,680
situation which everybody sort of enters through bucket one. Let me give you the other statistic,

618
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,280
which is that we'll get to this, but Purdue Pharma is now in bankruptcy. And in the context of the

619
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,960
bankruptcy, there are many, many, many creditors who have a claim that they'd like to exert against

620
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:17,520
what's left of the company. And one of them is UnitedHealth. And UnitedHealth had this fascinating

621
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:23,520
filing where they were, they were, you know, talking about the idea that they should have a

622
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,960
piece of the pie, such as it is, and we'll leave aside for a second, whether a big insurer should,

623
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:37,360
you know, should be there in line along with all these people whose lives have been ruined by the

624
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:43,360
drug. What was interesting is that they said they ran a study. And I don't remember how many years

625
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,000
it was, but it was, it was over the course of something like seven or eight years. They looked

626
01:04:48,000 --> 01:05:00,000
at people who had UnitedHealth plans and who were prescribed OxyContin or another Purdue opioid

627
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,920
and subsequently diagnosed with an opioid use disorder. So I think that would actually be a

628
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,720
kind of a smaller subset because you, you literally have a diagnosis of an OUD. And they said that,

629
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:20,320
so for that subset, prescription from a doctor, subsequent diagnosis, just UnitedHealth over seven

630
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:25,520
or eight years, they said the number was in the hundreds of thousands. And did they say, I mean,

631
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,360
I'm sure it would be in the study, but what percentage of that, what percentage of people

632
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:35,840
was that who were initially given a prescription? Was that 10%, 20%, 50%? Oh, that I don't know.

633
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:41,760
That's interesting. I don't know. It probably was in the study, but it's not, it hasn't been,

634
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,680
it was not revealed in the filing to the bankruptcy court.

635
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,040
That would be interesting because that would actually shed great light on this issue.

636
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,880
It would. I mean, I think to me, the thing that's interesting is that it remains a talking point

637
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,400
certainly for the Sacklers and their legal counsel that it's virtually impossible if you're a

638
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,560
paying patient and you're prescribed to drive by a doctor and you take it as directed to become

639
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:13,040
addicted to put that side by side with this hundreds of thousands number is extraordinary.

640
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:18,080
Even if you build in a discount where you say, okay, well, some of those people probably did,

641
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,320
you know, some of those were fraudulent docs or fraudulent patients or what have you,

642
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,760
you still end up with a really huge number of people who have become hooked on the drug

643
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:38,000
in an iatrogenic context. Yeah. So, you know, I have a real personal history with this,

644
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,160
which I'm sure you'll appreciate. I wasn't sure I was going to tell you this story,

645
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,200
but I think it's appropriate here. So in some ways I feel very lucky to be sitting here

646
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,320
having a discussion right now as opposed to being dead. A little over 20 years ago when I was in my

647
01:06:52,320 --> 01:07:00,560
last year of medical school, I had a really bad back injury. Kind of, you know, sort of hurt it

648
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:05,520
kind of acutely and for two and a half weeks just ignored it. But the pain grew more and more

649
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:11,760
debilitating. I remember I was doing a rotation, you know, one of my rotations and I couldn't even

650
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,560
sleep. I had to get, you know, the residents to inject tort all into my thighs just to allow me

651
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:22,320
to have enough, you know, of an inkling to be able to sleep for a while. So finally, at some

652
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,000
point I just agreed to go get an MRI and look and sure enough, there was a really bad herniation

653
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,520
in my lower back and about a five centimeter fragment of disc had broken off on the left side

654
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,000
and it floated down the canal and it was sitting on the S1 nerve root, which is what was causing this

655
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:43,040
almost comical amount of pain. I say comical now because it's hard to even describe.

656
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,360
There's nothing funny about it. So I underwent surgery the next day,

657
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:54,720
but surgery didn't go well for a number of reasons. But the surgeon operated on the wrong side.

658
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:01,440
So I woke up from the surgery in terrible pain, but also with a new complication on the other side.

659
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:10,800
This resulted in a number of follow-up procedures initially aimed at correcting the first problem.

660
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,960
But before I knew it, you know, even once this, the structural problem had been fixed,

661
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,400
the pain was so bad that I finally relented and agreed to take pain medicine.

662
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,400
I had been horribly petrified of taking anything beyond NSAIDs.

663
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,440
So what was the first drug? This is the year 2000. So what's the first prescription I get?

664
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:37,200
It's for 20 milligrams of OxyContin to be taken, I believe twice a day. I think you take 20 in the

665
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,240
morning and 20 in the afternoon or evening or something like that. But you can probably

666
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,640
imagine where this story is going, Patrick. How much OxyContin do you think I was taking within

667
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:55,600
four months? Tell me. Almost 400 milligrams a day. Unreal. So again, maybe for the listener who

668
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,600
doesn't know what that means in context, that would be enough to kill an entire family of drug naive

669
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,480
people. Right. That, you know, 400 milligrams would kill mom, dad, Susie, Bobby, Sally. They'd

670
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:15,600
just stop breathing. So it didn't take long for me to go from 40 milligrams a day to 400 milligrams a

671
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,720
day. And there are a couple of things about this that are interesting. The first is that was all

672
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:27,680
prescribed by a legitimate doctor who was not at all an expert in pain management. This was a

673
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:33,360
surgeon who had already demonstrated gross incompetence, not operating on the right side.

674
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:40,080
No one was monitoring how much of this drug I needed. The dose just kept going up and up and up.

675
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:48,960
I was very fortunate at the time to be dating an anesthesiology resident. So she was about three

676
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,120
or four years older than me, actually probably in her last year of anesthesia. And she herself was

677
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,800
actually interested in pain management. So she would go on to do a fellowship in pain management.

678
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,720
And, you know, she was a bit troubled by how much of this drug that I was on.

679
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,800
And that sort of got me thinking, like, how the hell did I get here? Because it happened so quick.

680
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,520
Right. It was, you know, one minute you're like, I never, ever, ever want to take one of these drugs.

681
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,960
And then the next minute you're basically in a day, you're in a constant haze. You're, you know,

682
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,720
there was no moment that I wasn't high. The turning point for me came when I realized

683
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:34,240
that I couldn't differentiate between the pain relief and the high. In other words,

684
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,240
I realized I was probably taking the drug to avoid the psychological pain, which at the time,

685
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,320
I was pretty convinced I'd never walk again. This was a one year recovery process. But the first

686
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:55,040
three months I couldn't walk. So that basically shattered all of my dreams. I was no longer going

687
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,280
to be able to be a surgeon, I believed, let alone be an active, healthy person that I'd been all my

688
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:09,440
life. And so I was actually taking this drug just as much to blunt that grief as I was taking it to

689
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:17,360
blunt the pain. And finally, in the fall of that year, I just decided this is not, I don't want to

690
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,840
do this anymore. I never imagined I would overdose. That's the other thing, by the way,

691
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,440
it never even crossed my mind that I could get to a point where I would stop breathing.

692
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,680
But I just thought, no, I can't do this anymore. So I said to my girlfriend, I said, I'm going to

693
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:39,840
stop this cold turkey. And she said, you absolutely can't do that. The withdrawal from this will kill

694
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,880
you just as much as this drug will kill you. You need to be on nortriptyline, morphine. I mean,

695
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,480
she rattled off all the drugs I would need to take to taper off. But I was a stubborn kid and

696
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:59,360
I just stopped cold turkey. And the next three weeks of my life would be about the most miserable

697
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,880
three weeks of my existence. I certainly hope I don't have another three weeks somewhere down my

698
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:12,800
life that will be that bad. But here's the thing that is interesting. I'm not telling this story to

699
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,960
for a moment suggest any superiority, like look at me, I was able to come off this drug.

700
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,640
What my point is that what I've learned about addiction since then would suggest that I'm

701
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:33,040
simply biologically lucky. In other words, I truly believe that the neurotransmitters in my brain

702
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,520
are not wired the way that someone who in that exact situation would have become a lifelong addict.

703
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:46,880
So that's why I say I'm very lucky. I'm not lucky because I have willpower. I'm lucky because that

704
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,280
chemical didn't put a hook in me the way it would in others. So in other words, I had become

705
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,000
physiologically dependent on it. And that's why I went through withdrawal just as anybody would.

706
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,280
But I'm really lucky that I managed to escape this drug. And it's interesting, I was still

707
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:10,000
deathly afraid of the drug after the fact. And only seven years later, when I had a really,

708
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,080
really bad dental issue, would I ever touch another Percocet in my life, which of course is

709
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,280
a fraction of the drug. Right. And I remember being really worried like what's going to happen?

710
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:27,040
Is this going to escalate into massive use? And fortunately, it didn't, you know, I needed

711
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,760
Percocet for like a week until I had a tooth extracted. And then I just stopped it and that

712
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:42,400
was fine. But, you know, it paradoxically gave me more empathy than self-righteousness over the

713
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:48,240
people who became addicted. I don't know why. That's not obvious why that would be the case.

714
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:53,760
But I think I just sort of believed that there are some of us who don't get addicted to these

715
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,480
things even when exposed, but there are enough people who do. And I don't know what that number

716
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,200
is. Right. And to your point, I don't know that we can ever know that number. But I agree with you

717
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:09,200
that that doesn't remove the moral obligation of the people that were involved in exposing people

718
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:15,760
like me and people much less fortunate than me. Yeah. I mean, I would imagine that part of the

719
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:26,080
reason that it gave you a kind of, you know, a sense of compassion for those whose experience has

720
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,360
turned out much worse is that it does sound as though you encountered the,

721
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:38,800
and I've talked to so many people whose lives have been upended by this drug and other opioids.

722
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:45,600
And it's often like there's a kind of undertow, right? There's just this sense that

723
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,360
you're suddenly in the grip of something and, you know, you managed to get out of the grip,

724
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,120
but it sounds like even you were in terms of the physiological dependence and the idea that you were

725
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:02,960
titrating up so fast. That upward speed was unbelievable, Patrick. I mean, unbelievable

726
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,520
how quickly tolerance developed. And by the way, it's total bullshit to say you don't get high from

727
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,320
a time release drug. I mean, maybe I don't know what it's like to take heroin. So I'm sure compared

728
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:20,720
to heroin, it's blunt, but there is an absolute blast off high that came from those mega doses

729
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:28,000
of that drug. Yeah. What's so intriguing to me though about your story is actually the doctor,

730
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:35,120
right? The idea that you have a surgeon who writes you the prescription. And, you know, part of what's

731
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:41,360
so fascinating is that the drug companies, Purdue and the other companies, argued from the beginning

732
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,680
that doctors don't know enough about pain management. They haven't gotten the training.

733
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:51,120
And there was some truth to that, but the weirdness of it is they then rush into the vacuum and they

734
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:59,040
say, we'll provide that training. We'll do that education. And the catchphrase for OxyContin early

735
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:04,800
on was that it's the drug to start with and to stay with. And so, you know, the first part of

736
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,800
that, right, is it's like, this isn't some nuclear solution you keep on the top shelf where you would

737
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:14,720
try other courses of therapy and only when those fail do you resort to it. It's the first thing you

738
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:19,760
should administer. And then it's the one to stay with, meaning you can just keep taking it, you

739
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:25,520
know, for chronic pain conditions you're in, you're out, even if you have to keep titrating up. And

740
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,000
it was a core belief at the company. Richard Sackler felt very strongly about this, that there

741
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,640
was no, you know, what was what he described as no ceiling effect with OxyContin. That in fact,

742
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,720
you could just keep taking greater and greater doses, which you would need to as your system

743
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,800
accompanies itself to it. And then you have the pharmaceutical reps who are meeting with doctors

744
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:53,600
like your surgeon and are heavily incentivized to get those docs to titrate up. That's always

745
01:16:53,600 --> 01:17:01,440
the message because, you know, the profits and in fact, even the bonuses for the pharma reps

746
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:10,720
were all based on the volume of the drug that's sold and prescribed. So it's just funny because

747
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,320
hearing your anecdote from your side, what I see on the other side is this sort of perfect storm

748
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:23,280
of scenarios where, you know, when you're thinking about like, do I go cold turkey? Do I

749
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,440
taper off? Should I be taking morphine? You're having this conversation with your girlfriend

750
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:33,600
because the guy who prescribed you the drug probably doesn't know how to explain to people

751
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,960
how to get them off. I mean, you have this kind of crazy situation in which you have a generation

752
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:46,000
of doctors who learn how to how to like on-ramp their patients with these drugs and never learn

753
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,040
how to off-ramp them and actually kind of don't necessarily have any interest or inclination.

754
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,560
And if you talk to people who've had these experiences, they'll say, I went back to the

755
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:02,160
surgeon who wrote me the original script and I said, hey, listen, you know, I'm having problems

756
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:08,960
here. And they say, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not an addiction specialist. So when you look at all

757
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,600
those circumstances and you kind of extrapolate from that story you just told, it's not surprising

758
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:21,040
to me to think that there are many, many, many people who, you know, who had a similar situation

759
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:25,440
and ended up in very dire straits. Yeah. And I think you, you, you, you made me think of

760
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,480
something else, which I should have mentioned earlier, which is there's another reason I was

761
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:36,000
very, very fortunate was to have a girlfriend at the time who is not just an anesthesiologist,

762
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,640
but someone who's a year away from doing a pain fellowship. She actually got me in to see a pain

763
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,960
expert at Stanford, who I think really is the guy that saved me because remember,

764
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,720
it's one thing to sort of quit this drug cold Turkey, but I still had pain.

765
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,200
You know, it didn't, it's not like, you know, getting off the drug was one problem,

766
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,880
but addressing the pain was another. And I think only because of this other guy,

767
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:07,440
whose name was Sean Mackey, I don't even know if he's still at Stanford, but, you know, he was able

768
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,760
to treat me, I think appropriately, right? So that meant doing a lot of injections to begin and sort

769
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,200
of cool things off that had flared up using a drug called Neurontin, which is not addictive,

770
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,440
incredibly benign. It is sedating. So that's a drawback to deal with the neuropathic pain

771
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:30,720
and then using very strong NSAIDs. So at the time Vioxx was a drug that basically saved me. And,

772
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:36,640
you know, that allowed me to break the cycle of pain and do enough PT such that a year from when

773
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,760
that whole thing began, I was actually in my surgical residency and free of all pain medication,

774
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,520
meaning free of the Neurontin and free of the Vioxx. So, you know, that part of the story also

775
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:54,880
speaks to the incredible fortune that I had that many people don't have. And maybe had I not had it,

776
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,840
there still would be a different ending, right? It still might've been that, well,

777
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,160
after three months of going cold Turkey, I had to go back because there was no alternative.

778
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:07,600
And it's funny, I'll take better. When I was in my residency, I was still amazed at how ignorant

779
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:15,840
we were as surgical residents of pain management. I mean, completely ignorant. There was absolutely

780
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:23,280
no teaching of this subject matter. Something that I learned that was very simple was studies

781
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:30,160
had demonstrated that before you do an incision on a patient, if you inject Markane, which is a long

782
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:35,360
acting sodium channel blocker, like a, you know, like the type of, you know, like a Novocaine type

783
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,200
thing that the dentist would put in your teeth. So you have Lidocaine, which is short acting,

784
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:46,160
Markane, which is long acting. If you inject the incision site with Markane before you cut,

785
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:53,520
wait a moment, you then make the incision and then immediately following surgery, you put the patient

786
01:20:53,520 --> 01:21:00,880
on a pretty aggressive dose of NSAIDs. Many patients can actually avoid narcotics postoperatively

787
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,920
for the incisional pain, which is the dominant source of pain. And I remember thinking,

788
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:12,240
why aren't we doing this with every patient? And I got into an argument with one of the attendings

789
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,240
because I was about to do an operation and, you know, I went to do this and he said, come on,

790
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,080
come on, come on. That's going to take five minutes. You've got to, you know, put that in and

791
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,680
then we have to sit here and wait five minutes with our dicks in our hands while it sets in

792
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:28,000
before you cut. No, no, no, no. We don't have the time for that. I remember thinking, really?

793
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,800
We don't have five minutes? You know, it was shocking. Yeah.

794
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,360
Yeah. But listen, I mean, I think in a weird way,

795
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,280
and I say I'm not a doctor, right? I say this, I say this coming from the outside,

796
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:54,320
but having done a little bit of a kind of anthropological bushwhack through this world

797
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:59,360
over the last few years, you go back to what we were talking about earlier,

798
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:06,240
where you have the Sackler brothers in the 1940s and 50s saying, wouldn't it be beautiful

799
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:12,880
if someday there was just a pill you could take for everything? And particularly Arthur Sackler

800
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:20,320
kind of trying to sort of intermingle medicine and commerce in ways that I think ended up being

801
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:26,400
more profound than anybody could have probably recognized at the time. From the outside, I think

802
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:33,200
that one of the ingredients that gives you the opioid crisis is actually that idea of like,

803
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:42,080
we want to waste five minutes. You know, we need to get our patients in and out. Time is money.

804
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:49,680
And there was a, you know, I've interviewed, I've interviewed doctors who talk about the,

805
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:59,440
how they felt duped. How when the produce sales reps started flogging OxyContin,

806
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,800
you know, if you're a doctor, you encounter patients who are in pain, you want to relieve

807
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,640
that pain. You know, it's often it's kind of in some ways inherent to why you chose to do this

808
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,080
in your life, right? You want to, you want to bring relief to people who are suffering.

809
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:20,960
And suddenly there's this medical innovation, which you're told is like a panacea. It can

810
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:27,760
relieve that pain and has virtually no side effects and people can take it forever. And

811
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:34,240
there's no dosage ceiling. And so, you know, I've talked to people who've said just earnestly,

812
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:43,760
that was a siren song I was all too ready to listen to, because it filled a need in my,

813
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,960
you know, in my kind of therapeutic arsenal. And of course, it ended up being more complicated.

814
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,200
But I also think that when you think about the way in which American medicine is structured,

815
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,440
the idea that you have a patient who's in pain and you say, I'm going to write your prescription for

816
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:07,200
20 milligrams of OxyContin, be on your way. I never have to see you again. I'm not really going to

817
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,760
give any thought to how this is working out for you two weeks from now or two months from now or

818
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:21,360
two years from now. I think that the that notion that, you know, that five minutes is money,

819
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,160
right? Five minutes is, you know, that five minutes is five minutes you're not spending

820
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,160
with the next patient. It's a longer line in the waiting room. I think those kinds of structural

821
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:39,440
considerations were part of what allowed Purdue and other opioid makers to kind of snow the medical

822
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,600
establishment as effectively as they did. Where if you look at the prescribing levels for these

823
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,440
drugs, with the introduction of OxyContin, they just suddenly start climbing in this really

824
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,920
dramatic way. And you would think that there would have been more skepticism that it would

825
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,480
have been slower growth. But I do think there was a sense in which it sort of it filled a number of

826
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,600
needs. Right. And that was what allowed it to take off the way it did. Well, it also seemed to become

827
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,800
very politically correct in the sense that they somehow managed to infiltrate the AMA. I mean,

828
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:14,080
one of the other memories I have from, you know, the early days of residency was how all of a sudden

829
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:21,040
a new vital sign emerged. So vital signs are by definition objective. So they are things that can

830
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:27,280
be measured for which there is no ambiguity, temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood

831
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:34,320
pressure. But then a fifth vital sign got introduced, which was pain, a subjective measurement on a scale

832
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:42,880
of one to 10. And there were laminated posters on every corner of the hospital. Don't forget the

833
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,480
fifth vital sign. Don't forget the fifth vital sign. What is the fifth vital sign? What is your

834
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:55,600
patient's pain? I mean, it was, you know, and this really came from the medical community. This was

835
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:03,440
some this was a form of self policing. So how involved was Purdue in driving that agenda?

836
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,480
I mean, I want to be careful about how I put this.

837
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:18,160
Very would be the short answer. But I think you have this tricky thing. It's a little bit like

838
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:23,840
when I was talking about Curtis Wright and the FDA and how there's a kind of soft corruption

839
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:30,240
that happens, which is, you know, it's not as glaring as the kind of caricature is corruption

840
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:36,320
that you would think of. I think there's a similar thing here where you have the American

841
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:43,920
Medical Association, you have all kinds of groups, you know, groups of doctors, groups representing

842
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:52,400
patients, patients rights, you know, kind of pain advocacy groups. And and then you have industry

843
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,840
underwriting a lot of this stuff. And there's just quite a good piece in Mother Jones just

844
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:07,840
recently about the AMA and, you know, the Richard Sackler was on one of these boards, and you have

845
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,800
a lot of money going to sponsor education. Yeah, well, that that's I just read that Mother Jones

846
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:21,600
piece. And I couldn't believe that the AMA both as an organization and its foundation separately

847
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:27,040
are receiving money from the Sacklers. Yeah, yeah. And then and then often what happens,

848
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,720
right, is that you get these things where it's there's like an educational pamphlet that they

849
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,720
end up distributing. There's a kind of laundering that happens, a sort of institutional laundering,

850
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:42,160
right, where where industry comes up with these educational brochures or they sponsor research or

851
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,960
what have you. I mean, the example that I love from from that story, the Mother Jones story was

852
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,320
that there was one kind of handy guide to pain and the fifth vital sign and the idea of how do

853
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:57,040
you talk to a child about the pain they're feeling. And there was there was a kind of an admonition to

854
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:01,760
the doctors that you remember, you know, you got to tell the child that no pain is not an acceptable

855
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,720
answer. You know, there's a continuum, but but the end of the continuum where there's no pain,

856
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:13,920
you know, that's that's that's not not not an option. The yeah, I think it's tricky because I

857
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:19,920
just think that a lot of the time it's not necessarily that I think it's more a coincidence

858
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,760
of interests in which you have people who earnestly believe these things and then are

859
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,400
underwritten by industry. And that kind of turbo charges the arguments they're making

860
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:36,480
more than it is a situation of docs being paid off to tell what they know to be lies, right.

861
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,720
And I think there was a kind of like when you when you talk about the idea of the fifth vital

862
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:47,440
sign, even just that phrase, on the one hand, I think that there was some truth to the critique

863
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:53,440
that that there hadn't been enough education and pain management and enough consideration given to

864
01:28:53,440 --> 01:29:00,080
how you relieve patients pain. I think as a critique that had some truth to it. On the other

865
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:04,720
hand, when you say the fifth vital sign, like to me, that sounds more than anything like a great

866
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:11,280
marketing slogan. I don't know who dreamed that up. But it sounds like something that an

867
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:16,880
advertiser would come up with, right? It's catchy, it's kind of pithy. And of course,

868
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,480
it's totally subjective. There was a study I couldn't give you the citation, but I remember

869
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:28,960
reading this reading about this great study, where it was like the scale of one to 10 thing,

870
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:33,120
right? And they found that it's not just that it varies that you may have, you know, what,

871
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:40,560
what might be a seven for you could be a nine for me. But that it actually varies regionally,

872
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,600
where they, you know, they found that like people in Northern Europe,

873
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:51,840
you'd exert some sort of standard amount of pain, and they would say, you know, oh, that's a four,

874
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,960
and then people in Southern Europe, you'd exert the same amount of pain, and they would say,

875
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,600
it's a 10, it's a 10. But you know that you actually get these kind of cultural regional

876
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:06,160
differences in terms of people's pain threshold. So the it's hard, because I do think it's a

877
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:10,400
legitimate thing that people should be looking at and inquiring about, but at the same time,

878
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:17,040
it's totally subjective. And I think that again, and again, you see just the money pollute everything.

879
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,520
You know, you mentioned earlier that Curtis Wright effectively,

880
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:32,160
whether, you know, in a direct quid pro quo, or more of just a confluence of interests,

881
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:40,000
not only basically approves this drug single handedly for the FDA, but then ultimately winds

882
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,160
up working for this entity. But, you know, the other story in this one that really blew my mind

883
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:55,360
was that of Lyndon Barber, the DEA, a guy who on the one hand is seems by all accounts to be one

884
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:06,320
of the most credible voices within the DEA to standing up to the, you know, unmanaged distribution

885
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:14,160
of these drugs, and then kind of doesn't about face and becomes one of the most powerful lobbying

886
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:19,280
entities for the very companies. I believe Cardinal was one of his largest clients,

887
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:26,560
Cardinal McKesson being two of the largest distributors. Kind of hard to believe,

888
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,120
but at the same time, I guess you, you know, going through the, what you said earlier, it's like,

889
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,680
look, how long can you work for nothing as a government employee? Right. And at some point,

890
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:41,680
he has a choice, which is he's going to go make a living harnessing his existing skills, but it

891
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,040
just doesn't feel right. You know, I don't know. I don't know how else to put it. It just doesn't,

892
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:58,000
just doesn't sit well with me. Yeah. You know, I, it's funny. I, it's, it's very, you know,

893
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,080
I don't want to sound like a scold or preachy or somebody who's holier than thou or like a

894
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:16,480
boy scout. Cause cause I'm not by any stretch, but the, but it has been one of the more dispiriting

895
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:22,400
things working on this project where, you know, a lot of the time in the past I've written about

896
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,640
crime a fair amount and you, and you, it's just kind of baked in that you're writing about a bad

897
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:34,720
person doing a bad thing and they kind of know they're bad usually. And there's a sort of moral

898
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:42,160
clarity there. What was so fascinating to me about this story is that, you know, I think the

899
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:49,040
Sacklers are, are, are kind of are bad actors. I think they, they did really bad things. And

900
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:57,280
they're the focus of the story, but then around them are all of these facilitators and it's, it's

901
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:04,000
former prosecutors who go and work as private defense attorneys for the family or for the

902
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:11,440
company. It's former DEA officials who go and work as lobbyists for the industry. It's former FDA

903
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:19,440
officials who go and work at the company. It's, you know, folks at McKinsey, it's this whole kind

904
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:26,960
of amazing entrenched machine of people who I think in many instances don't think of themselves

905
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,160
as the bad guys. And in some cases, society doesn't think of them as the bad guys, right? You know,

906
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:38,320
one of the characters in my book is Mary Jo White, this, you know, former U.S. attorney for

907
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:44,560
the Southern District of New York, former, she was Obama's head of the SEC. She's a hero to lawyers,

908
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:49,920
many, you know, all over the place of a woman who kind of broke the glass ceiling. And she's

909
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:55,520
represented Purdue and the Sacklers for years and is totally a handmaiden to them. So it's a thing

910
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:01,600
that I've kind of wrestled with personally. I'm a lawyer by training. And I know that there is a

911
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:07,280
sort of it's very fundamental to the ethos of the profession that, you know, the lawyer isn't the

912
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:14,400
client and that we shouldn't necessarily kind of transpose the moral stink of the client onto

913
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,560
the lawyer. But it's hard for me when, you know, you tell the Linda Barber story,

914
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:25,840
there's a hundred people like that in the book who play that kind of role. And again and again

915
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,160
and again, you get these people who are supposed to be the cops, basically, they're supposed to be

916
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:36,960
law and order and they get co-opted by the money. And it's really discouraging. And sometimes I

917
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,880
don't get it because the money isn't even that much. And when you look at Chris Dodd and Marsha

918
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:47,360
Blackburn and Tom Marino and Orrin Hatch, I mean, it's just hard for me to look at these people and

919
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:52,240
think of them as reasonable or respectable truthfully. You know, when I look at their involvement in

920
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:58,080
the bills that they sponsored and the positions that they took in all of this. And when you look

921
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:03,200
at the dollars that they received from the. They're bought so cheaply. Yeah. That's exactly

922
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:09,120
the point, Patrick. You know, I expected that it would have taken tens of millions to have

923
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:16,240
bought those people. They were bought for hundreds of thousands of dollars. U.S. senators for sale

924
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:22,960
for hundreds of thousands of dollars. I don't understand it. I think, yeah, I mean, I think so.

925
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:30,160
So I think the thing is, it's some of it is the is the money donations and what have you. But I

926
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:36,800
think there's this other thing that is more about the revolving door and the kind of this insidious

927
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:42,400
thing where the it's the lobbyists and the lobbyists are often people they know. Right. And

928
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:48,000
it's a kind of you know, you see this with the way in which Purdue and the SACRIS would use

929
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:53,440
lawyers like Mary Jo White is a good example, or they hired Rudy Giuliani for years was kind of

930
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:58,800
their hatchet man. And it's like if you were a federal prosecutor and you're investigating me,

931
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:07,120
the real move is to not to sort of fight it out with you on the merits in court the way most

932
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:13,360
people would. It's for me to go to your boss, but not for me personally to go to your boss, for me to

933
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:20,720
find somebody who your boss knows and respects. And that's the person I buy off. And I send them

934
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:25,920
to go and kind of make the overture. And so I think when you look at these people, it's not just that

935
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:32,720
they're again, it's the sort of soft corruption thing where some of it is the it's not like

936
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:38,480
campaign contributions. It's that you're you know, it's like the it's the you know, it's that scene

937
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:44,080
in the godfather where the where the guy is supposed to testify in court. And they sent they

938
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:48,080
get the old guy from Sicily to come and just sit in the courtroom and it happens to be his uncle or

939
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,920
whatever. And he sees the guy in the courtroom and he he suddenly sort of loses all his moral

940
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:58,000
conviction and decides he's not going to testify. It's sort of that. It's it's like being really

941
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,280
smart and strategic about who's the right messenger? Who would we send to make the case to

942
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:12,960
Chris Dodd, you know, about why he shouldn't come after us or why he should help us in this or that.

943
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:19,200
And man, they're really good, really, really good at that. And it's interesting at how,

944
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,840
if I want to use the word, you might not use the word, but if I want to use the word corruption,

945
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:30,400
how bipartisan the corruption was. Totally. What was the bill? H.R. 4709.

946
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:39,520
This is the sleeper bill, right? It's like this three page nothing burger that basically opened

947
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:46,320
the pipelines to move these drugs and put the DA's hands behind its back. I mean, again,

948
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:52,960
it's a little detail, but my God, it's amazing how unopposed that bill went.

949
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:58,720
Yeah, but I mean, this is absolutely. But but but some of that, I think, is the fact that

950
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:03,360
nobody's really reading the bill. The bill was carefully designed to look like it was sort of

951
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,760
doing the opposite of what it was doing. Right. It's like we're going to fight the opioid crisis.

952
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:14,880
You know, Obama signed it and who knows how closely he looked at it. I think that there's a

953
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:21,760
there's enough business that goes on in Washington. And I think particularly when it comes to law

954
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:27,520
making, you know, you have these members of the House and senators who are they spend all their

955
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:36,000
time raising money. They if you can make what you're doing look like business as usual,

956
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:47,040
you can pull it off. It's it's super dispiriting. But again, I mean, listen,

957
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,520
you know, the painkiller, the opioid painkiller industry spends, I think the statistic is like

958
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:59,840
seven or eight times what the gun lobby spends on lobbying in Washington. Right. So so just imagine

959
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,920
the kind of impact that you can have on the on the legislative picture. And then you see this with,

960
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,320
you know, with a company like Purdue, you have this long period of time where all these states

961
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:14,560
are trying to respond at a state level to the opioid crisis. And they're there, you know,

962
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,760
they're trying to introduce new legislation to shut down pill mills or, you know, go after bad

963
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,080
docs and what have you. And you have these legislative initiatives at a state level that

964
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:30,400
gets set up and Purdue finds the right state lobbyists to go to the state capital and help

965
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:36,320
neuter those bills as best as best they can. And we're very successful at doing that. I mean,

966
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,280
it is a when you have a drug that's generated $35 billion in revenue,

967
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:46,240
the amount of influence you can buy is just awesome.

968
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:51,840
So what what happened? What was the first sort of shot across the bow 2007?

969
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:56,800
It's a little bit of a slap on the wrist. What what led to that?

970
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:05,600
You had a couple of investigators at a small federal prosecutor's office in the Western

971
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:14,000
District of Virginia, who their community had been upended by OxyContin specifically. They're

972
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,280
just they started realizing, you know, we're getting all these pharmacy thefts and crime

973
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:25,600
is going up and you get people ODing. And they started investigating. And and to them,

974
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,240
it was this kind of weird thing where they felt like they felt like a hurricane had just like hit

975
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:38,800
their town. And they wanted where it came from, and came from Connecticut. So they started

976
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,720
investigating. And they they did this really amazing investigation. They spent five years

977
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:47,600
investigating Purdue, they subpoenaed millions of documents, they did, you know, huge amounts of

978
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:57,360
grand jury testimony and wanted to charge three senior executives at the company with felonies.

979
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:05,840
The idea being that these guys were, you know, we're not going to go to jail. Faced with jail

980
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:12,640
time, they would flip on the Sacklers. One of those federal prosecutors has said this on the

981
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:18,480
record. And there's another one who's confirmed for me that the plan was actually to target the

982
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:23,040
Sacklers if they could flip these guys. And what ended up happening was that the

983
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:29,440
the company sent Rudy Giuliani and Mary Jo White to kind of go over the heads of those federal

984
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:37,120
prosecutors to the George W. Bush Justice Department in Washington and say, you can't go

985
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:40,880
after these guys for felonies. We need to take felonies off the table, take jail time off the

986
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:47,280
table. And so they got overruled by their own bosses. This was Alice Fisher and Paul McNulty.

987
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:54,400
This was Alice Fisher and Paul McNulty. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And which is funny too,

988
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,560
because it's again, there's it's a little bit like that line in the in the package insert where

989
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,760
in 2021, I talked to Alice Fisher and Paul McNulty and said, who made that decision to tell these

990
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,520
prosecutors in the Western District of Virginia? They're each pointing at each other. They're

991
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:14,400
pointing at each other. Nobody would own it. You would think, you know, all these years on,

992
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,720
it's a pretty consequential decision. You would think that somebody might take responsibility

993
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:24,080
for it. But what that meant is that because they couldn't charge these guys with felonies,

994
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:27,840
the guys weren't going to flip. They just they charged, they pled to misdemeanors. So they

995
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,080
couldn't go after the Sacklers. The company paid a six hundred million dollar fine and pled guilty

996
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:38,640
to felony charges of misbranding. And then it was pretty much business as usual. I mean, they didn't

997
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:47,040
they did not slow down their marketing a job. So what changed in the last couple of years,

998
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:56,080
what's led to the bankruptcy and perhaps more importantly, where do we stand on this? What

999
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:03,040
is it called? This nonconsensual third party third party release? Yes, this this seems to be a very

1000
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:10,880
important granting on the part of a one white Plains bankruptcy judge. Yeah, Robert Drane.

1001
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:20,720
So so 2007, the company pleads guilty. And the official line after that was, oh, you know, we

1002
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:27,600
we kind of cleaned up our act. We had a few bad apples, but everything's OK now. But they didn't

1003
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:36,560
really change a whole lot. And really, all the senior folks, you know, but there were three guys

1004
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:41,280
who pled guilty to misdemeanors had to leave. They couldn't keep working at the company. But other

1005
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:46,320
than that, all the senior folks who were involved in this stuff stayed on. Heads did not roll.

1006
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:55,840
And Purdue kind of kept doing what it was doing. And they were doing a lot of work. And they

1007
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:04,400
um, in 2020, the company pled guilty to a new set of federal criminal charges. And the the conduct

1008
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:11,200
that it pled to dated back 10 years. So if you imagine, right, like the company pleads guilty in

1009
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:16,400
2007. And then in theory, there's like a couple of years of good behavior. But then starting in about

1010
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:22,640
2010, they were back to committing crimes and kept at it through 2020 when they pled guilty again.

1011
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:29,760
And in between those two guilty pleas, what happens is that you get all these lawsuits. So some of

1012
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:34,720
these are private class action lawsuits, lawsuits brought by hospitals, school districts,

1013
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:42,960
cities, states, eventually every state in the union pretty much is suing Purdue over its role

1014
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:52,640
in the opioid crisis. And what's happening in parallel to that, which we didn't know about

1015
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:57,840
until fairly recently, is that the Sackler starting in 2007, after that guilty plea, they

1016
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,960
start quietly taking money out of the company. So they're just sort of siphoning money out 100

1017
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,760
million here, 100 million there. Over the course of about a decade, they take more than $10 billion

1018
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:20,720
out of the company. And then in 2018, 2019, 2019, you have thousands of lawsuits against the company,

1019
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:25,680
companies kind of on the ropes. And the family kicks the company into bankruptcy, they say the

1020
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:31,040
company doesn't have any money anymore. Which is only the case because they took $10 billion out of

1021
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:36,160
it. But they say the company's bankrupt now. So all those lawsuits against the company have to be

1022
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:44,320
suspended. And they end up in this bankruptcy court in White Plains, New York. Because this is

1023
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,480
the way bankruptcy law works, they got to pick their judge, you can decide where you want to

1024
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,640
declare bankruptcy, corporate bankruptcy. So they picked this judge who they thought would be

1025
01:45:52,640 --> 01:46:01,440
sympathetic. And where it gets really interesting is that by this point, roughly half of the states

1026
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,040
were not just suing the company, they were suing individual members of the family who had sat on

1027
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:12,800
the company's board. And there's a move by the company and the family to say, okay, so you

1028
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:18,800
suspended all these lawsuits against the company, because it's in bankruptcy. But we want you to

1029
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:24,480
spend the lawsuits against the family too, even though they haven't declared bankruptcy.

1030
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:33,200
And the judge did that temporarily. Which is pretty controversial. There are states in which

1031
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,160
you're not able to do that. You're not able to say to like the attorneys general of

1032
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:42,560
half of the states, no, you cannot bring your lawsuit. A federal bankruptcy judge in New York

1033
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:49,120
says to the state AG of Idaho, like, no, you cannot bring your state based claim. It's pretty

1034
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:58,480
exotic, but he did. And where we are now is we're sort of in the end game, where the Sacklers have

1035
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,560
made this bid, which is they want him to make that grant permanent, where he would permanently

1036
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:09,680
immunize them from any litigation. So the phrase for this, and it's a mouthful, is non-consensual

1037
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:19,600
third party releases. And this is happening in real time. Like, as you and I are talking,

1038
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:25,920
there's a bankruptcy trial going on with testimony. But I think everybody knows how it's going to end.

1039
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:33,520
Why are we so pessimistic? Why are we pretty convinced that the ruling is going to hold up?

1040
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:40,720
Because the judge has kind of telegraphed where he's going with it. And because

1041
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:47,040
there are some states that continue to fight, but they effectively don't have the votes. So

1042
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:52,080
basically what you have is a situation in which the Sacklers have made a proposal to,

1043
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,400
in one fell swoop, deal with all this litigation kind of once and for all. And they're doing it in

1044
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:02,720
the context of this bankruptcy proceeding, where they say, we will pay $4.5 billion of our money

1045
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:11,040
to remediate the opioid crisis. We'll pay it out over nine years. And we'll make no admission of

1046
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:18,800
wrongdoing. We'll give up our interest in Purdue. And we'll be granted one of these non-consensual

1047
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,360
third party releases where basically this judge gets to kind of wave his wand and say,

1048
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:29,680
nobody can ever sue you again. No state prosecutor, no private plaintiff. Nobody can

1049
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:33,280
sue you ever again over anything having to do with OxyContin or the opioid crisis.

1050
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:40,720
And I think there are a lot of states that are desperate and fighting, you know, dealing with

1051
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:49,760
the kind of the trillions of dollars in public costs that this crisis has generated. They're

1052
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:59,200
reeling. They see $4.5 billion and they think, I could use one 50th of that, you know. So they're

1053
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:04,000
inclined to take the deal, even if they don't like it. You know, it's an interesting one, because I

1054
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,440
think a lot of people look at it and they feel like this wouldn't be justice.

1055
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:16,800
To put that $4.5 billion number in perspective, the SACRA is still having an $11 billion fortune

1056
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,840
and they're going to pay it out, pay out the 4.5 over nine years. And it's actually not linearly

1057
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:28,000
weighted. The majority of that payment comes at the end of time. So in theory, they're technically

1058
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,080
going to come out ahead if they reasonably invest well. Yeah. I mean, I, you know, I did some, I had

1059
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:41,360
some conversations with people who advise high network families and invest their fortunes in the,

1060
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:47,840
you know, I think conservatively between interests and a very conservative portfolio,

1061
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:55,280
they can probably expect a, you know, a 5% return on that $11 billion fortune. And if that's the

1062
01:49:55,280 --> 01:50:01,760
case, they never have to touch their principal. Yeah. I mean, this will not, again, in absolute

1063
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:06,960
terms, it's a lot of money, but it's, I don't think commensurate to the damage. And I think

1064
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:12,240
ultimately it'll be a pretty good deal for the SACRA's, but I think that's how it's going to shake

1065
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:19,520
out. Now, do you think that this accomplishes anything else? So no amount of money is going

1066
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:27,200
to bring back a loved one. You know, I have several patients whose lives have been directly

1067
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:35,600
impacted by this, whose children have overdosed. So kids that became addicted to prescription

1068
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:43,440
pain pills and, you know, in one situation, one of the kids was clean for a number of

1069
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:51,520
months, if not a year, was at a party. Someone suggested he tried a pill. It turned out to be

1070
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:56,960
laced with fentanyl. And you know how that story ends tragically. So no amount of money

1071
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,840
is going to fix that. And so whether the SACRA's have to give four and a half billion or forfeit

1072
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,880
every dollar they've ever made and will make in perpetuity that never brings back a life.

1073
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:15,760
So really it's about two things, isn't it? It's sort of about how much can be fixed today with

1074
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:21,280
money, because maybe some things can be fixed with money. Some things can't. I guess three things

1075
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:29,360
is justice being served. And the third thing would be, is this creating a deterrent

1076
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:36,080
for another entity in the future to be a little more careful with what they do? So

1077
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:42,320
let's talk about the latter. Do you think that this will create a sufficient enough deterrent?

1078
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,680
And not just this. I mean, if you look at what was that other company, Insys or something like that?

1079
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:51,760
Yeah. Well, Insys was different because people went to jail.

1080
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:58,400
Yeah. So when you look at the totality of these things, do you think that at least for their

1081
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:05,520
foreseeable future, the legal slash illicit drug market is kind of on notice?

1082
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:14,240
I do and I don't. I mean, I think that the... Look, in some ways this kind of, this fits into a

1083
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:21,920
larger trend that we've seen happening over the last 10 or 15 years, sort of since the days of

1084
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:27,760
Enron and WorldCom, which is that there's a pronounced disinclination, this is across

1085
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:37,120
political parties, to bring criminal charges and jail time into the equation when it comes to

1086
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:45,360
corporate executives acting within their role, even if the conduct is criminal. So you have this kind

1087
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:50,400
of bizarre thing with Purdue Pharma, where when the company pled guilty for a second time in 2020,

1088
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,680
there were no individual executives even named. So I say in the book, it's like it's a driverless

1089
01:52:55,680 --> 01:53:01,120
car. I mean, how is it that the company could commit federal crimes if there's no individuals

1090
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,520
who can be identified as having committed crimes? It doesn't make any sense.

1091
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:12,640
But I think it's sort of expressive of or reflective of the general posture of the Justice

1092
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:19,280
Department and our whole sort of system of justice, broadly speaking, which is we don't really...

1093
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:28,160
It's really the exception when a corporate executive ends up doing jail time, as we saw

1094
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:34,560
in Incis. And the Incis case is kind of particularly extreme. Incis is like,

1095
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,480
everything you see in the Purdue story, but just like dialed up to 11. I think there were a bunch

1096
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:44,480
of reasons why you saw jail time in the Incis case and you don't in the Purdue.

1097
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:48,080
What was the CEO? Was Kumar, wasn't that his last name?

1098
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:54,320
Something I'm blanking on his name. But yes, I mean, Incis was just such a scam. And there you have

1099
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:07,440
like, kind of strippers working as sales reps and real kind of fairly sort of bald bribery schemes,

1100
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,960
not the soft corruption I've been talking about, but like the hardest of hard corruption.

1101
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,800
So there you saw jail time. In my view, jail time is the only thing that really

1102
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:22,880
that really is a deterrent. I think otherwise, I don't know. I mean,

1103
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,320
people are rational, particularly when it comes to money. And when it comes to money,

1104
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:37,680
and they think about risk, right? They evaluate risk. And if you look at the Sacklers, right?

1105
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:43,920
It's like you take $10 billion out of a company during a period of time when it's committing

1106
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:54,720
crimes, you're going to have to give back 4.5 billion. Do you do it? You know, do you do you

1107
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,880
you look at that fact pattern, you take you got a company company commits crimes, you own the

1108
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,080
company, you're on the board of the company. You're never going to go to jail, you're never going to

1109
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:10,960
get charged with any crimes, you will have to give back 4.5 billion, but you can do it over nine

1110
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:17,040
years. Do you do it? I mean, I could probably go out on the street and find you some people who

1111
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:24,160
would say, hell yeah, sign me up. For the Sacklers, I think, you know, the real costs are going to be

1112
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:35,440
reputational. And it's hard to measure that. Yeah, that's the thing that I mean, you have to

1113
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:43,680
argue that are they any different from O.J. Simpson? You mean in terms of the notion that

1114
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:52,560
everybody knows. Yeah, like, I mean, O.J. Simpson commits this completely heinous, graphic, premeditated,

1115
01:55:53,600 --> 01:56:01,120
violent act in front of the world. And if not for a technicality, effectively, you know,

1116
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:08,160
an eraser cop gets off, right? Right. But I don't think the world's ever really forgiven him,

1117
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:17,200
right? I mean, I my guess is he probably is being basically socially punished for the rest of his

1118
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:23,840
life. And rightfully so. Is justice served? No, presumably not. He should be in jail, but

1119
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:29,520
nevertheless. So the blood of two people is on O.J. Simpson's hands. The blood of how many people

1120
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:35,360
is on the Sacklers hands conservatively. What would be the most conservative estimate? Right.

1121
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,320
I mean, it's so hard to say, right? Because the thing is you can you can, you know, do you look

1122
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,760
just at people who have O.D. done Oxycontin? And of course, they would say again with that parsing,

1123
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,960
they would say, oh, yes, but, you know, there were other drugs in their systems. Yeah. My point is,

1124
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:57,680
of the half a million people who have died in the last two decades, I'm willing to acknowledge that

1125
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:04,480
some subset, maybe a small subset of those people, the blood is on the hands of this family

1126
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:13,600
and work like yours has really brought that to light. And it just I just wonder what the rest

1127
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:18,880
of their lives look like. And will this be basically forgotten about? And will the next

1128
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:26,720
generation of Sacklers carry no shame for this? Or will this be something that forever makes people

1129
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:32,560
in polite company a bit embarrassed to be around them? It's funny. I mean, I think.

1130
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:40,480
I think both of the last two things you said are are going to be the case. I think the I think

1131
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:45,600
people will forever be embarrassed to be around them. I think the name is toxic and it's, you know,

1132
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:50,160
it's it's coming down off of institutions. I think it'll come down off of more institutions.

1133
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:58,480
I think the family isn't happy about that. But I also don't know that any of them feel any shame.

1134
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:04,560
I mean, there's this kind of one of the things that's been so revealing to me is

1135
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:16,160
it's funny. There's an analogy that I don't draw in the book in any explicit way deliberately. But

1136
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:20,080
it was one that I thought about a lot as, you know, I was writing this book in the last years of the

1137
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:31,520
Trump presidency and, you know, one sense in which the Sackler situation I think was a little bit

1138
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:38,160
similar to Trump's and it's a sense in which I'm almost sympathetic in both cases is if you're a

1139
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:44,960
billionaire, you're surrounded by advisors and lawyers and PR people and all these people whose

1140
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:52,720
livelihood depends on keeping you happy. And I feel as though that there is a kind of heightened

1141
01:58:53,760 --> 01:59:00,640
danger of delusion of you just getting out of touch with reality. And it probably starts in

1142
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:06,960
small ways, right, that you tell a joke and everybody in the room laughs. But then you can,

1143
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:13,680
you know, so initially, you're just like kind of a millimeter or two off track in terms of the

1144
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:21,840
the fidelity of your perceptions of the world. But then the longer you go, the further off course

1145
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:27,280
you get. And what you saw with Trump, which you also see with the Sacklers, is that there are

1146
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:34,160
people in the mix. I mean, I've talked to people who a decade ago said to the family, what if you

1147
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:39,280
took some of this philanthropic money that you give to art museums and started a foundation

1148
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:45,680
dedicated to the study of addiction, you know, redressing the opioid crisis,

1149
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:51,360
people who were making, you know, frankly, a cynical argument, but saying just purely in terms

1150
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:59,120
of the optics here, you should make some gesture, recognizing that there's a problem and that people

1151
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:03,520
think that you're responsible for it. And those people were always sidelined and fired, right?

1152
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:09,360
And the people who end up in the kind of inner circle are the ones who say, you are just terribly

1153
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:16,160
misunderstood. All these people don't understand you, you know, the press, the public, the people

1154
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:23,600
making jokes on The Late Show, the attorneys general of every single state, you know, all these

1155
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:27,920
members of Congress who keep condemning you, all these studies that are done about OxyContin and

1156
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:34,080
its legacy. It's all just a big misunderstanding. You never did anything wrong. And what's been

1157
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:40,320
astonishing to me is they tend to pretty uniformly feel that way, the family members.

1158
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,880
Yeah, that's one of the things that surprised me about your book is

1159
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:49,360
you had to do all of this without actually talking to anyone in that family. And when you

1160
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:56,480
think about how many children the three Sackler brothers had and how many children they had,

1161
02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:02,400
and how many spouses they have, like, that's a pretty good list of people who could have

1162
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:07,280
come forth and said something to you even off the record or on background. And yet,

1163
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:14,080
I don't think that happened, did it? No, I mean, I listen, my assumption from the beginning had

1164
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:19,600
been that there must be some apostate, you know, there must be some third generation Sackler who

1165
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:26,960
looks around and, you know, never mind my writing, right? It's like they read the New York Times,

1166
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:33,280
they read the LA Times, they read Sam Kinyones' book, Dreamland, and they say, geez.

1167
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,200
Yeah, this is blood money. My trust fund is blood money.

1168
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:40,240
I'm a little uncomfortable with this. Yeah. Right. Let me, you know, I don't need this. I'm

1169
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:47,440
going to turn my back on it. Couldn't find one. And one of the more revealing documents I got my

1170
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:55,280
hands on was this. It's a WhatsApp log. It's like a chat log from the the heirs of Mortimer Sackler.

1171
02:01:55,920 --> 02:02:01,840
This came out in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding, where they all talk over the course

1172
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:08,240
of a couple of years, all these different family members, siblings, cousins, and they're talking

1173
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:12,880
about, you know, their problems and how do you deal with it and the litigation and the bad PR and,

1174
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:18,560
and what's the right strategy? And it's this private channel.

1175
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:28,160
And there's nobody, nobody who at any point says, you know, geez, maybe our critics have a point or

1176
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:36,080
like, maybe we should ask some tough questions. Instead, it's this pretty lockstep feeling of

1177
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:40,240
persecution. And in fact, I mean, sometimes when you read their private correspondence,

1178
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:44,160
the way they talk amongst themselves, at times it feels that feels as though in their minds,

1179
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:49,920
like the real victims of the opioid crisis are the Sackler family. That's amazing.

1180
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:56,800
That's more amazing to me than the indignant response that is seen publicly.

1181
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:06,160
It's that even privately, there's no awareness. No. Not a shred of introspection.

1182
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:11,040
None and a profound sense of grievance, you know, a sense that this has been,

1183
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:16,320
that they've been kind of persecuted. I mean, there's this amazing email that I quote in the

1184
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:23,360
book where Jacqueline Sackler married to Mortimer Jr., a second generation member who was, who was

1185
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:27,840
on the board of the company. She's talking about how, you know, with all this press coverage and

1186
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:35,120
the sort of stigma for the family, she's worried about her children applying to elite private

1187
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:41,520
schools in Manhattan in the fall and their chances. And in the context of griping about this,

1188
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:49,360
she says children's lives are being destroyed. And not to pivot from the comic to the tragic,

1189
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:58,000
but like, I get emails every week from people who have lost children to opioids. You know, I mean,

1190
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:06,560
when you hear from as many bereaved parents as I do, it's just amazing to read an email like that

1191
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:14,080
and kind of consider the level of disconnection that it betrays. I know you've spoken about how

1192
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:20,000
you also hear from basically two groups of people, right? So you hear a lot from exactly what you've

1193
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,840
just said, the family members or friends of people who themselves have become addicted or who

1194
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:32,080
more tragically have lost those. But you also seem to hear from people saying, you know, your

1195
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:37,760
work is potentially threatening to the supply of pain medication to people like me who genuinely

1196
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:44,880
and legitimately need it, which of course is not your intention. But you seem to be sensitive to

1197
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:52,320
that and you seem to understand that there's a fine line here and an overreaction or an overcorrection

1198
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:58,320
that would limit the supply of or access of patients who do need pain medication to it would

1199
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:04,480
be an unintended consequence of this work. So do you get a sense that that is actually happening?

1200
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:20,240
Yes. I mean, I think that there is a definite sense in which the pendulum has swung back.

1201
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:30,080
And in which a lot of doctors are less likely to prescribe these drugs in the first place,

1202
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:36,960
more likely to prescribe shorter courses at lower doses. I think a lot of that is a good thing

1203
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:45,360
ultimately. There are many chronic pain patients who are very fearful and are, you know,

1204
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,280
I certainly get emails from people talking about how they're just fearful that they're

1205
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:57,680
supply of this drug, you know, these drugs, I'm not just talking about OxyContin here, but

1206
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:04,240
prescription opioid painkillers broadly that they count on in order to function in life

1207
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:10,000
is really jeopardized by these kind of changing currents in terms of the way in which

1208
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:19,200
people perceive these drugs. And it's an incredibly difficult thing. I mean,

1209
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:24,560
I am very sympathetic to this. I certainly don't want to see

1210
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:33,840
people who use these drugs stigmatized, whether they use them legally or illegally. I tend to be

1211
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,920
to be pretty sympathetic with people. I'm also not a prohibitionist. You know, I don't,

1212
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:44,160
given all my work on illegal drugs, I tend not to think that the drug prohibition is the way to go.

1213
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:52,800
People certainly make arguments that if you cut off pain patients and do kind of rapid force

1214
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:57,360
taper and what have you, that that might actually drive people onto the black market and become,

1215
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,840
you know, more unsafe, that that might be part of what's driving the opioid crisis.

1216
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:10,560
Where I balk at that kind of note, and this sort of goes back to the thing I said to you at the

1217
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:17,760
outset is the suggestion that I shouldn't write about the Sacklers and their culpability because

1218
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:26,240
there might be some sort of second or third order consequence of that, or that my kind of focus is

1219
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:32,880
in the wrong place. And there I'm not going to, you know, I'm going to write the books that I

1220
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:38,560
want to write and the articles that I want to write. I find it's very often the case that people

1221
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:42,240
who are sort of telling me that I shouldn't be doing these things, generally speaking,

1222
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:46,720
haven't read the book, you know, haven't really engaged with the particulars all that much.

1223
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:52,560
But yeah, look, I do hear from pain patients quite often, and I think this has been a sort

1224
02:07:52,560 --> 02:08:02,960
of an agonizing period for them because from where I sit, the problem was not that a drug like

1225
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:08,720
OxyContin shouldn't have been produced or made available to pain patients. It was all in the

1226
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:13,680
decision to do two things. One was dramatically expand the universe of people who should be taking

1227
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:21,200
it. And the other was, I think, pretty systematically play down the risks so that there's a kind of

1228
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:29,600
dishonesty with the consumer and with physicians about what the dangers are. You know, I don't go

1229
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:35,040
from that to any sense that these drugs should not be available at all. There are some doctors

1230
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:41,600
who do, but I sort of don't feel the need to go there myself. I'm pretty squarely focused on

1231
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:48,000
the origins of the crisis and some pretty unambiguous wrongs perpetrated by Purdue and

1232
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,960
the Sacklers. So if the Sacklers represent a cancer, right, that cancer has largely been

1233
02:08:54,960 --> 02:09:00,240
excised, right? The Sacklers themselves are no longer going to be a part of this dilemma.

1234
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:07,200
But unfortunately, the cancer metastasized before it was excised. So as you point out,

1235
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:12,720
we still have an opioid crisis. And in fact, it doesn't seem to be showing any signs of abatement.

1236
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:20,000
In fact, last year we saw more people die of opioid overdose than any other cause of

1237
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:25,600
accidental death, which is actually a staggering statistic when you consider how many people die

1238
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:34,480
in car accidents, how many people die of gunshot wounds. So in that sense, your work has been a

1239
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:39,520
success in the work of all the people you've written about who have finally brought a modicum

1240
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:47,200
of justice to at least the initial perpetrators of this. But what does the path forward look like?

1241
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:52,240
Like what will it take to actually address this crisis?

1242
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,360
Yeah, I mean, you know,

1243
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:04,560
this will sound like a cop out, but in some ways I'm so overwhelmed by that question. I think anybody

1244
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:13,600
would be. You know, the way in which I've grappled with that is to kind of take this small piece of

1245
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:19,120
it that I can focus on and understand. And for me, in some ways, it's kind of, you know,

1246
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:22,800
looking at the origin story of the crisis really more than where we are now.

1247
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:30,080
The numbers are staggering. As you say, they're getting worse.

1248
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:36,320
The sense in which I feel as though the sacros are not absolved by the fact that this is today a

1249
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:41,360
heroin and fentanyl crisis is the sense in which there are many, many people who I think would

1250
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:46,880
never have taken heroin or fentanyl in the first instance that started on prescription opioids

1251
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:52,880
like OxyContin. But of course, you know, from the vantage point of today, I'd rather people

1252
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:59,200
be abusing OxyContin than abusing fentanyl, right? Or heroin that's laced with who knows what.

1253
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:07,040
But it is a very, very scary situation. I feel as though

1254
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:14,240
we need far more resources than we have. I mean, I think it's a problem that needs to be

1255
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:18,720
resourced. I think treatment is very often not available to people. I think there's still a

1256
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:27,360
huge amount of stigma associated with the abuse of an addiction when it comes to these types of

1257
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:34,080
drugs and anything we can do to diminish that stigma. I think, you know, medically assisted

1258
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:40,880
treatment, which I think there are still some for whom that's a kind of a scary concept. And I

1259
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:51,200
think it's one that should be adopted and embraced and not cause the consternation that it does for

1260
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:58,240
some. But I think it's a huge national crisis. And in a strange way, I feel as though were it not for

1261
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:04,000
Covid. It's not that the problem would have been solved, but I feel as though the

1262
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:10,320
just prior to Covid, there was a sense in which I, you know, it's tricky because it was the Trump

1263
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:16,000
administration. But the but I think there was sort of a recognition that we need a major national

1264
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:23,200
strategy to deal with this. It is out of control and killing people in vast numbers. And we need to

1265
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:31,200
to kind of, you know, have all ideas on the table and be strategic and resource the solution.

1266
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:40,560
And then Covid came along and there just wasn't really the bandwidth, right, or the oxygen in the

1267
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:45,360
room to have that conversation. But when we neglect the problem, as we have during Covid,

1268
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:51,280
just purely in terms of the triage or the last 18 months, you see what happens.

1269
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,320
Are you optimistic that 10 years from now things will be different?

1270
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,040
I mean, I have to be just because I'm, believe it or not, after this after this grim conversation,

1271
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:14,960
I'm fundamentally an optimist about a lot of things. I have to believe we will learn and

1272
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:22,240
we'll sort of find a way out of this. But it's hard. And I think the hardest thing in a way is,

1273
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:26,240
you know, I've had many of these conversations and it sounds like you have too. You mentioned,

1274
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:34,080
you know, the patient who had a family member who actually managed to stop using and seemed as

1275
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:43,040
though they'd moved on and then went to a party and relapsed as such an issue with these drugs.

1276
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:53,520
When you talk to people who've sort of achieved, you know, they've found their way out of the

1277
02:13:53,520 --> 02:14:02,400
woods. Often the thing that's so striking to me is that there's a kind of, there's a sort of fragility

1278
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:09,680
to it, you know. They're always talking in the present tense. There's this sense that kind of

1279
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:18,000
every day is a battle. And that's what worries me, I think, about the idea of us kind of 10 years

1280
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:23,520
from now, right, is that on a kind of very micro level for the individual who is struggling

1281
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:28,880
with addiction, there's that sense in which it's like each tentative step. You just never know when

1282
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:37,920
you're going to get pulled back in. And so on a kind of macro level nationally, I worry that

1283
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:49,520
there may be a similar danger. Yeah, I worry about the sort of impact of what it takes to escape the

1284
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:58,880
gravitational pull of an environment that facilitated the use. I did my residency at Hopkins,

1285
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:06,720
which is in inner city Baltimore, and even 20 years ago was probably a leading indicator for how bad

1286
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:16,480
heroin use could get. And I remember, you know, we would take care of a lot of patients who had

1287
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:23,840
abscesses and all sorts of, you know, infections and cellulitis and things like that from IV drug use.

1288
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:30,560
And sometimes these infections themselves were life threatening. So it wasn't just the overdose

1289
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:36,320
on the drug. It was the repeated use of a dirty needle or a needle that gets broken inside the

1290
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:43,360
arm and gets infected. And, you know, so you would take care of these patients and you always wish

1291
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:48,480
them the best when they left, but you were really in the back of your mind, you knew you were going

1292
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:55,440
to see them again. Because even though for the five days that they were in the hospital, they

1293
02:15:55,440 --> 02:16:01,360
were not using any drug and they with the total clarity of the thought that they had realized

1294
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:07,120
how lucky they were to get this second chance, they were still going back into the same environment

1295
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:14,880
that brought them into the hospital in the first place. And we used to sort of say to ourselves,

1296
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:20,000
like, you know, the only way this person's not coming back is if they get a whole new group of

1297
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,640
friends. Like, in fact, the best thing you could do for this person is get them out of inner city

1298
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:30,720
Baltimore. Like they can't go back to the row home they came from. Now, that might sound like a very

1299
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:34,960
extreme example, right? Well, come on, inner city Baltimore. I mean, you're talking about a crack

1300
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:41,840
house, but is it really any different for a college kid who's trying to desperately get off

1301
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:51,280
the transition from oxycodone to fentanyl and this is being done in a dorm room or at a party

1302
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:55,920
or something like that. And it's their friends and they decide, you know, they managed to,

1303
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:59,840
you know, again, pull out of the grip of that, but they find themselves at another party in three

1304
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:05,920
months. I mean, it's really difficult. That's the part that concerns me is if it's hard to do this

1305
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:19,280
one person at a time. Yeah. Yeah. And it's again, I mean, I think it's funny. I kind of come back to

1306
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:25,840
the, you know, that idea of undertow and even you telling your own story about your experience with

1307
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:35,040
OxyContin. I think the big thing that comes home to me is just that the, you know, these things are,

1308
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:46,800
these substances are, they have an awesome power and that's compounded by all of the kind of

1309
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:53,520
atmospheric social sort of situational things you're talking about. But just having talked to

1310
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:58,720
a lot of families over the years who've dealt with this and they, you know, they thought they

1311
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:05,360
were out of the woods and then they weren't, I think you're right. Like in any one individual

1312
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:09,600
life and even somebody who actually has a really supportive, you know, they've got a whole support

1313
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:17,360
system there. And in some instances, you know, in many instances there are people who don't have the

1314
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:22,800
resources for the appropriate treatment, but in many instances there are people who do, right?

1315
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:30,640
Who throw resources at the problem and it's not enough. It's not adequate. So I think that the,

1316
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:40,320
I just think we should all be sort of humble and mindful in the face of the

1317
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:46,640
tremendous kind of potency and power that's on the other side of this problem.

1318
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:54,560
Yeah. Well, Patrick, thank you very much for, first and foremost, for your book and your

1319
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:59,040
investigation, which I think has brought to light a lot of things that probably could have easily

1320
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:05,600
gotten ignored or swept away. I mean, it's true that during these proceedings, a lot of documents

1321
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:09,680
are brought into the public light, but that's only half the battle. That's the easy half. The hard

1322
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:14,320
part is actually going through them and extracting what the story is. And you've done a better job

1323
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:18,880
of that with respect to this important part of the story than anybody else. But also thank you

1324
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:24,400
for making time. I know this is, I imagine as an author, you must get tired of having to do

1325
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:28,400
interviews on the same topic, but I really appreciate it. But this one was so, it was really,

1326
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:33,600
really in depth and yeah, I very much enjoyed it. It was a great conversation. Thank you.

1327
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:38,560
