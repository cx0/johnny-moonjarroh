00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright Lance, thank you for making time today to come by.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Absolutely.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How does it feel to be back in Austin?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It is, it's pretty surreal. I mean, having been here or having lived here for 30 years,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the, the, you know, I've seen the city change and I saw it change as a cyclist.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I think cyclists see more stuff than most people.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And you're always, you know, you're covering ground, you're finding back roads, you're, you're, you get a sense for a town growing.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, you know, obviously the roads get more crowded, but you see more construction trucks and you figure you're like, wait, this is, this place is getting built out.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so, and then if you go down the rabbit hole of hearing these offers in the real estate market, it's just, this is a different city.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, before we get into the great city though.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, no, look, I, the only thing my wife and I could say after moving here is what took us so long.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Before we get into kind of the details of, of all the stuff I want to talk about, I think it's just sometimes easier if we can get into some hard yes and no questions just so that there's no ambiguity about some of the really important stuff.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay. So I've been here before.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I think this is going to be familiar to you, but I, I want you to really limit yourself to a yes or no only Lance.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is, these are important questions.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is Dura Ace better than campy super record?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is the greatest innovation in time trialing the aerodynamic water bottle?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is Edgar Allan Poe, the greatest poet of the 19th century?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sure.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are today's clinchers as high performing as tubulars?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is Alberto Contador, the greatest cyclist of all time?

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Absolutely not.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Can you still ride up Alpe d'Huez in under 45 minutes?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Probably not.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Is the 1985 Oakley Pilot Big Ass Sunglass the greatest shades of all time?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Um, no, but.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just yes or no.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is Pinarello the best bike on the market?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is George Hincappi the best lieutenant you've ever had?

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Absolutely.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Was your grandfather the first man to ride his bike on the moon in 1969?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All right.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now that we've got that out of the way, talk to me about Plano, north east suburb of Dallas.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Pretty much straight north.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Plano is, um, you know, it is, uh, it lives up to its name, right?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Plano is, is Spanish for flat Plano.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Uh, very flat, very windy, um, growing, you know, that's another community like Austin, uh, that's drastically changed when I was a kid growing up in Plano.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You know, I would, you know, leave the house and be out in the, in the fields and I would head up into Allen and go around Lake Levan or I would, um, out to Frisco.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I mean, now Frisco is one of the fastest growing communities in America.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Um, there was only one building out there and that was the global headquarters for EDS.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
People thought Ross Pro was nuts to build, you know, the EDS headquarters there.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And, and now it's, you know, mom's still there.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I just going back is crazy.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A lot of times I'll, when I visit my mom, I always take my bike everywhere, but I'll, I'll just kind of ride around and, you know, go past Duly Elementary where I went to middle school and I'll go to, I actually went to,

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
sorry, elementary school and middle school was Armstrong.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll just go by these places and just, and look at them through a 50 year old's eyes.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's crazy.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So it's, uh, um, is it bittersweet by the way?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because like, I hate seeing where I grew up.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I hate it with a passion.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I, the last time I went back to look at my elementary school, I mean, it just upset me so much.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't know.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I mean, I could no, no, no, no, no.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, I think, I think most people have a.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Some, uh, level of that in their lives.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're allowed to sort of hate where you grew up.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Uh, I think, um, I don't want to live there, but you know, it's, it's, it's, it's fine to go back.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
See mom.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So your birth father is, is Eddie Gunderson, right?

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He left you guys when you were two.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Did you ever see him again after that?

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Never saw him again.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you ever want to?

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, he's now passed away.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He passed away in 2012.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, that's a good, maybe around there.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Um, and from what I hear, he died of a spider bite.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Maybe that led to some other complications, but, um, I never had a desire, um, to sort of reconnect with him.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Um, for most of my life and even, you know, of course now it would be too late, but I might have a different view.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Of that now.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Did he ever reach out to you?

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He, uh, not directly.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know, when, when, after the first tour, when in 99, um, people reached out to him.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So a lot of the press and journalists, they wanted this story.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Um, and his, I mean, his interviews are just, yeah.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They were totally inappropriate.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You know, the comments about my mom that, you know, that far down the road.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Um, but that community, they were, meaning he had disparaging things to say about your mom or.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And so, uh, you know, but I mean, I don't think Eddie was, uh, I was a road scholar.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So how long after, or how old were you when she met and or married Terry Armstrong?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So I would have been three or four.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Right.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And so that's where the name comes from, right?

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's, I wasn't born Lance Armstrong.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Um, funny thing is my initials would have been leg if I would have stayed Lance Edward Gunderson.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But yeah, she became obviously blend Armstrong and I became Lance Armstrong.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You've told me stories in the past and I know you've spoken a bit publicly about Terry and kind of how strict he was.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And did you ever think of him as a father?

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Did he feel that way to you in any way, shape or form?

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, sure.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't, uh, you know, as a five, six, seven year old kid, you don't know, you know, you're, you, you have your mother and I knew he wasn't my biological father, but, you know, we had a roof over our heads and, and my mom seemed happy.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And so, yeah, at a young age.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Um, and he wasn't, uh, when you say violent, I mean, he, he was just strict.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean, it was every little thing got you in trouble.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I mean, if I did, if I look at my kids' lives and, you know, if they leave their drawer open, I walk by and I'm like, first of all, I don't care if they leave their drawer open.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That would have been a big deal to him.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Um, so I know you've told the story before about, hey, you know, playing every Texas sport, every kid does, you didn't shine in any of those things.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And you're 12 years old, mom throws you into swimming, which you didn't really know how to do, but you obviously picked it up super fast, huh?

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I mean, I caught it early.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're right.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't know how to swim.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And, uh, and she didn't necessarily suggest swimming.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She just, she knew that she had a high energy kid that if that wasn't applied somewhere, directed somewhere, it was going to go somewhere toxic.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And so she was right about that.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But, uh, and I sucked.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I mean, I, at, at, at sort of mainstream sports, um, I've had an issue with balls my whole life.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But you didn't have an issue with your phone a second ago.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That phone came falling out and you, that was one of the most impressive one-handed catches I've seen in a long catch.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was, I was, yeah.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Um, but, uh, I had a few friends on the swim team.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So I thought, well, I'll try that.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And, um, problem is I was, you know, they, I was 12, they were all 12.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And was this an age group team?

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This was an age group team.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So very different.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Um, you know enough about swimming to be dangerous.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And so it's, it's, uh, swimming is really kinda.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's different categories, so to speak, right?

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The most serious is age group swimming.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's where everybody, that's where Michael Phelps grew up swimming.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's where everybody grips.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Um, then you have sort of country club setups where it's a summer league and you swim some laps and you have some meets and all the parents are there.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Um, and then you have kind of high school, right?

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Which most of the time, at least for us age group was the, the serious training for high school swimming.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Um, but yeah, I was, I was 12 and, and I didn't know how to swim.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And, uh, I certainly didn't know how to swim.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I mean, I could have faked freestyle, but I couldn't have, I didn't know any strokes.

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, you know, I showed up and man, the coach that kind of watch you for a while.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And they, I mean, they stuck me in the six year old lane, six, seven year old lane.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I still don't, when I think back and I never even questioned it, I just stayed, I stayed swimming with these little, little kids.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Meanwhile, all my buddies are over at the other end of the pool, you know, doing 3100s on whatever.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And I'm like, but I just hung in there and I, and I swam the kids.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then after, you know, a month of that, then I moved over a lane and I was with the eight year olds.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And then a month later, I was, I just kind of kept going across the pool until, you know,

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
probably, you know, less than a year later, I was, uh, I was a legit swimmer.

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Still, still one of my great loves.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So by the time you get into high school, you're swimming both for the high school team and the age group league.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes. Yes and no, because I turned pro in triathlon when I was 15.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I was, I was already my swim coach at the time who was just a total hard ass, but an amazing coach and Chris McCurdy.

155
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wonderful coach.

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
One of the best coaches I've ever had, but man, he was tough and it was, I mean, you don't, you did not miss a workout.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You didn't skip a workout.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There were no excuses.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean holidays, family, it doesn't matter.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Like, and we were, our age group team was called Cops, city of Plano swimmers, which was at the time, one of the best age group teams in the country.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And that was because McCurdy and, you know, I started traveling to triathlons and, and, and skipping workouts.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Cause I was on a ride or a run and he was just, he wasn't having it at all.

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So you gravitated to the mile and swimming, right?

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, yeah, I mean that was, I mean, I'm an endurance guy.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, you know, my, I have no other than catching that phone.

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't have great fast, which muscle, you know, my hundred free.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I mean, I could, I could have, you know, whereas the, you know, the miles 16 and a half of those.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You know, my, what was your best mile?

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'd have to go back and look, it was decent.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I mean, at state championships one year, I got third.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's decent, but not, I wasn't going to the Olympics.

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you think if you'd stayed with swimming and that was the only thing you could have pursued, you would have at least, you know, you would have swim in college, presumably.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I would have swam in college.

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And if you asked McCurdy, he thinks I could have gone far, but I did, you know, I was 15.

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There was prize money. There was travel. I was like, Hey, this is way cooler.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
When did you realize you also had an act to run and bike?

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I actually was running right around the same time.

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So at the same time I was swimming, I was running track and cross country in high school.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So I was, and I was a decent, you know, in Plano, I was city champ in the, um, it wouldn't have been the, I was, I was young enough that we ran the 1200 city champ in that.

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I remember, you know, back then the timing was primitive.

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You got these timers per athlete and you had stopwatches and you come across the line.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's a funny story.

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And they'd ask you, uh, your name.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And so I came across the line and the timer says, what's your name?

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I was going to Armstrong middle school and I said, Armstrong.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And he said, I didn't ask you what, what school you went to.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I said, what's your name? And I said, I finally, I was like, after three or four go rounds, I was like, I'm Armstrong from Armstrong.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But as, you know, it was a decent runner.

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How much did you enjoy training at that age?

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Uh, I love, I loved, you know, I loved it.

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I mean, the most structured thing I had was swimming.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I mean, McCurdy was, I mean, you should have seen the board.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, this dude, I don't know.

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I mean, he must have laid awake every night and dreamed up these workouts.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It was so detailed and like, I, I loved that.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Um, and that was the most structure I had running.

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I would train a little with the, with the cross country team that had structure.

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Uh, we had another great coach in, in, um, track and cross country named James.

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So James Mays was a world-class 800 meter runner.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Uh, he was actually the rabbit for, uh, for the dream mile.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And this guy ended up being our high school track and cross country coach.

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And he was awesome.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He'd run with us and he like drove a Porsche and we're like, holy shit, our teacher was his dude.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Um, he was awesome.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And then cycling was more, yeah, I just go pedal around.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No structure group rides.

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:26,000
When did it become clear to you that you had a knack for this at the level of, I mean, was it that one race that everybody talks about where you were right at the front with Mark Allen and you're 15 years old.

208
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And at the time, you know, Mark Allen must've been one of the top three professional triathletes in the world.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, that was my first pro race.

210
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That was the president's triathlon in Dallas.

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That was 80.

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That would have been 87, 87, because I did the best I could.

213
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
87 87.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
87.

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Cause I did the presidents in 86, which is out at Lake Le Bon.

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It was a longer format or longer distance.

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And then they moved it over to Las Collinas where the old Cowboys facility was in 87 and they made it an Olympic distance.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I was trained with some guys and they said, well, you should just turn pro and go try it.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was 15 years old.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And so, but I was swimming my ass.

221
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I mean, I was a great swimmer.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I knew I was going to come out of the water with the leaders.

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So this is Olympic distance.

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So you're coming out of the water under 20 minutes.

225
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, easy. Yeah.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And then you hop on the bike.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hop on the bike.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're going under an hour.

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're going what?

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
55 minutes.

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, this is pre-Aero bars.

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Although actually that might've been the year Andrew McNaughton flew away on the bike.

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He had the bars, the original Scott Aero bars.

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And then I rode with Allen the whole time on the bike.

235
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And I'm sure he was, you know, those, they all race each other every week.

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And they know.

237
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Was Dave Scott there too?

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know if Dave was there.

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Mike Pig would have been there.

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Pig might've been there.

241
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The big Kiwi.

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Anyways, it was, it was like, I rode with Allen, but I'm sure he's looking at me going.

243
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Who the fuck is this person, this guy, this kid?

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And then, uh, you know, got like Mark Allen get off and run 32.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And you would run what?

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
36 after that?

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, no, probably more.

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Right.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
38 or 39.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And so I think I ended up fifth or sixth and, uh, that was, I was like, okay, I can do this.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Was the bike different compared to swimming and running for you?

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Like, was there a gear that you felt you had there that you didn't have in the other two?

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know about a gear, but it was the experience was certainly different.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I mean, how so?

255
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean, I know it is, but what did you feel that was different?

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, it's, it's just like I said at the top, you know, being outside, I mean, think about the life of a, of a full time, essentially professional swimmer you, you spend and I don't think people really appreciate how much time swimmers devote to their sport and how much distance they cover.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean, when we were 13, 14, 15, we were swimming.

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Um, you know, there'd be days we do swim 10 miles a day.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Like if somebody said they run 10 miles a day, I would say, you're a fucking badass swimming.

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's two days.

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So 5 30 a.m.

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Morning practice for an hour and two hours in the afternoon.

263
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're covering some ground and you're staring at a black line the whole time.

264
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's why swimmers are crazy.

265
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, and the funny thing is most people don't appreciate that the swim to run ratio is about four to one.

266
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So when you say somebody swims 10 miles a day, that's comparable metabolically to running 40 miles a day.

267
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I mean, it's the no impact.

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah, without the impact.

269
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What makes it a great sport for, you know, as you get to be my age or even older.

270
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I mean, the thing I love about swimming is you can swim your whole life.

271
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You can't necessarily ride your whole life.

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You certainly can't run your whole life.

273
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like swimming, if you put a gun in my head and said, okay, dude, you got one sport to choose for the rest of your life.

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There is no question it would be swimming.

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No question.

276
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So I've heard you say in a previous interview that triathlons were awesome, but at some point you got this desire to go to the Olympics.

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And you realize that what kid doesn't want to go to the Olympics?

278
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah. Well, at some point you realize, look, my quickest path there is probably going to be on the bike.

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yep.

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And I'm guessing that was the late eighties.

281
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You kind of had that realization.

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, I, yeah, I started to transition to full time cycling in 89, still doing trias.

283
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I did them also in 89 and 90, went to the junior world championships in Moscow in 1989.

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But in my mind, I just assumed triathlon would be an Olympic sport.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It is the ultimate.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, the best sports in the Olympics are swimming and cycling and running.

287
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Like, why wouldn't we combine them and make this an Olympic sport?

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, this is in the late eighties, early nineties.

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Right. It wouldn't be till 2000.

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
2000 in Sydney was the first time.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Nobody knew that.

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But, um, yeah, so I switched over basically full time in, uh, in, uh, 1991, 1990 or 91.

293
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Which is kind of amazing to now fast forward to 93.

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Um, what expectations did you have going into Oslo into that road race for the world championship?

295
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, the one thing that did happen is I, I.

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You went to the Olympics.

297
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Actually, you did go to Barcelona.

298
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You fulfilled that dream, going to the Barcelona games.

299
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You did road race or time trial?

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What did you do?

301
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Nope. They didn't have the time trial back then.

302
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
They had, uh, and I want to say, I think we had team time trial.

303
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I did the road race.

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't think I did the TTT.

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
How many cyclists went for the U S boy?

306
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're making me think a lot.

307
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I mean, this is a long time ago, Peter.

308
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is 30 years ago.

309
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So I don't know.

310
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Three or four.

311
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But this was back in the day when you couldn't, you didn't have pros there, right?

312
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No pros.

313
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

314
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They added the pros in 96.

315
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You have pro and that was the, so who were the best amateurs then Bobby Julek, you.

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah.

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And then, um, you know, the international guy, the Italians were amazing.

318
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Casa Tully, uh, who we lost a 95.

319
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He won.

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He won the games.

321
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
David, uh, Debbie de Rabeline was on the Italian team, but you know,

322
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
a lot of Eric Decker was on the Dutch teams.

323
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I was on the German team.

324
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So what was that like there competing against the best amateur cyclists in

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
the world?

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Um, it was, I mean, it was great.

327
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't, I didn't race very well.

328
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I didn't, um, tactically, tactically, I was still not, I was still trying to

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
figure out cycling.

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Um, I didn't know how to move through the Peloton and, and, and sort of gauge

331
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and judge the Peloton and the tactics and the flow of the race.

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Uh, then like,

333
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that's very hard for people who watch cycling to understand.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's funny.

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I mean, I, you take it for granted now.

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You could throw me in any bike race and I could absolutely find my way around.

337
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But that's not, I don't, nobody's born with that skill, right?

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I mean, that strikes me as fair.

339
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I mean, I'm sure there are some people who'd have a better feel for it than others.

340
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When they start young, I mean, you get, you know, Galli George, he started,

341
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
he was racing in central park against adult men when he was 12 years old.

342
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I mean,

343
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
but to go from, because in triathlon, you can't even, could you draft at the

344
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
time in 90, 91?

345
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
All right.

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So, so you go from a sport where bike should never be able to draft.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

348
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This pisses off all the, uh, yeah.

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
All the purists.

350
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, no, all the, you know, the, the, uh, sort of the ITU guys,

351
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
the, the Olympic guys, cause they, that's, you know, I got in a bunch of, uh,

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
a bunch of grief once because I called, you know, the, that kind, or that part of

353
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
triathlon, uh, a shampoo, a blow dry and a 10 K.

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I mean, it was, it was people.

355
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But anyways, I just, it's an individual sport.

356
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,920
But that's amazing that you basically,

357
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,600
your cycling career as a cyclist begins two years or a year,

358
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,000
two years before the Olympics,

359
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,880
because all of the stuff you're doing as a triathlete is preparing your

360
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,160
cardiovascular system and your fitness, but not your bike handling skills,

361
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,000
not your tactics, not any of those other things.

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,920
No, the handling I had down, I mean, it was,

363
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,880
I wrote enough that I was comfortable in the peloton,

364
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,120
but just understanding the movements of the race and, uh,

365
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,360
positioning and, you know, just the, the, the, you know, the peloton, it's a,

366
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,880
it's just a big organism and you've got to be at the right place at the right

367
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,320
time. And yeah, it took me a few years.

368
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
What metrics were you guys looking at then?

369
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
Were you mostly just relying on heart rate?

370
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,720
Not even, I mean, going back then we heart rate monitors and we were,

371
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,960
when I got on Motorola, we were sponsored by polar.

372
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
And so we had some of the earliest heart rate monitors. These things were as,

373
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,240
I mean, I'm sure you could still find them. I mean, they were massive.

374
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,120
These things, they look like bricks legitimately component.

375
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,600
And that was it. I mean, and that was sort of the first, yeah, obviously no power

376
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
meters, no, uh, no testing. I mean, we just, yeah,

377
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
he just looked at the heart rate.

378
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,520
So did you have any metrics or insights into your physiology being unique at the

379
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
time? I mean, did you figure out what your maximum heart rate was? I mean,

380
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,760
we'll get to it later, but I remember you telling me during,

381
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,120
I don't remember which time trial it was.

382
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
You were telling me about in one of the,

383
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
one of your tours that you were able to hold a heart rate of 200 beats per

384
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,080
minute for the entire TT.

385
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,880
Yeah, that was, that was later. Um, I think the first time I really,

386
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,160
um, thought I had an engine,

387
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,400
so to speak and maybe because they told me that as I, I,

388
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,360
they were doing a study at the Cooper clinic in Dallas. And of course I was

389
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,320
living in Plano. So I,

390
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,600
and it was a treadmill test and they wanted me to, and they were,

391
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,840
I forget what the original study was, but it's got a funny ending to the story.

392
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,600
It was all about core temp.

393
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,720
And so I went down and did a running VO two tests and the guy was like, Oh,

394
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,640
I mean, it was, I killed this thing. And then, then they, and, uh,

395
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,600
do you remember what your VO two max was now? No, no, but the guy was like, okay,

396
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,720
this, this kid's special. And, and then they said, well, look,

397
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,480
we'd like you to come back next week because we're doing this whole core temp

398
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,920
study. And this time you're going to have to do it with some sort of probe in the

399
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,640
exactly. And I'm 15.

400
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,800
And this guy says he's going to shove something up my ass and I am

401
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,880
terrified. I'm like, uh, I never went back.

402
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
So to that, uh, research to this day,

403
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,440
we have no idea what your core temperature response would have been under that

404
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,000
aerobic load. Well, you want to do that test. We can do it again.

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
You know, I know enough to know that I run hot, so that I'm going to leave it at

406
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,240
that. Um, so, so Motorola was 93.

407
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,360
I went, I went to Motorola in, uh, actually in 92.

408
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,280
I was the only amateur on the team. Steve Bauer was on that team.

409
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,120
Bauer was there Phil Anderson, Andy Hampson. So, so by the way,

410
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,240
Steve Bauer is why a kid growing up in Canada like me was obsessed with cycling

411
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,080
growing up. Right.

412
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,880
So I was one of like 12 people in North America that loved cycling followed it

413
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,520
because Bauer won a silver in 84 at the Olympics. So basically I'm 10,

414
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,400
11 years old that puts cycling on the map is something that's like awesome.

415
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,600
And, and then of course, LeMond was, I mean, forget about it.

416
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,280
Like the most exciting thing in all of sports in 1989 was the,

417
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,720
the 89 company is unbelievable. Uh,

418
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,320
some would argue the greatest ending to a tour.

419
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,080
You could argue maybe second greatest after what happened last year,

420
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,400
that let the scholars debate that. Um,

421
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,960
but I want to talk about the 93 season because you've got a

422
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,160
guy named Miguel Indran who's come along and dethroned. Um,

423
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,920
Greg who's dethroned Greg, right? And at this point,

424
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Indran is now won three consecutive tours. He,

425
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,120
there's no sign he's going to slow down, right? He wins 91 92 93.

426
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,160
He looks like an absolute machine.

427
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,560
This is one of the guys you're now racing against for the world championship in

428
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,200
the road race. What's your thought going into that race?

429
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,840
Um,

430
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,400
well the w the way the season was structured then, and I,

431
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,000
and I actually much preferred it. The worlds was much earlier was, you know,

432
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,880
four or five weeks after the tours, the guys, the Vuelta. Yep. Yep.

433
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,720
Well, no, the back then the Vuelta was in, uh, early in the season.

434
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,320
Wait, wait, the, the Vuelta was for the Giro. Yeah. Okay.

435
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,440
So you had, and the Vuelta was, was minimized, uh, which it should have been,

436
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,520
because it's, it's, it just anyways. Uh,

437
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,840
but we had a true world cup. So you had all of the monuments,

438
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,480
all the big spring classics. And then every week after the tour,

439
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,840
we went to St. Sebastian, we went Zurich, we went Leeds in England, but you know,

440
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,760
it was like boom, boom, boom. And so it was just this,

441
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,320
I loved the rhythm of that calendar. And I was after the tour, 93,

442
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,600
which you won a stage. I won a stage, uh, into Verdun, um,

443
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,880
in the national champions Jersey. And then, uh,

444
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,640
they pulled me out because I was young and,

445
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,320
but my form just kept coming up and up and up. And,

446
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,960
um, and all the world cups, and I was, I was, I was right there.

447
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,080
All the prep races I was, I knew I was going to be in the front group, but,

448
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,240
and I was, shit, I didn't care. I mean, I looked around in that group. I mean,

449
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,880
you had, you had Olaf Ludwig, you had Indira, you had Kia Pucci,

450
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,440
you had Schmeel, you had Museu, you had Reese. I mean,

451
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,680
I was looking around going, yeah, of course I'm here. And then of course,

452
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,200
it was absolutely pissing.

453
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,920
Worst day of ever. And people crashing. I mean, I crashed twice. Uh,

454
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,400
people crashing everywhere. How cold was it? Uh, it was, it's funny.

455
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,200
I never really felt that cold. It was, but it was cold.

456
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,840
It looked cold. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was, it was probably in the fifties.

457
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,560
I mean, Northern Europe with weather like that, it's going to be cold.

458
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
No matter what time you're here.

459
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,120
Explain to people what it means to win that race, to be the world champion.

460
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,960
What you know,

461
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,600
you get to wear a special Jersey that nobody else gets to wear for a year.

462
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,080
Yup. You wear the rainbow Jersey for a year. And then for the rest of your

463
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,360
career, you, you have some representation on your jerseys or shorts.

464
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,120
So rainbows on the sleeves, the collar. Uh, it's a, it's a cool one to win.

465
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,000
Thinking back to that year in the tour, we're going to talk a lot about,

466
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,960
obviously performance enhancing drugs. You've in the past said, you know,

467
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,560
that was in the era where you and your team were still in the low octane phase

468
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,880
of things, right? The, the cortisones, things like that.

469
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,360
But it was the pre EPO era, even though EPO was around, it was around. Yeah.

470
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,640
This was, but this was before the real shootout.

471
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,840
What were you aware of in that year's tour?

472
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,920
I mean, there was buzz of, of EPO, but it was not, um,

473
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,240
you know, it wasn't a dinner table conversation like it became. There was,

474
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,360
I mean, there was obviously speculation,

475
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,320
but there was scientific articles about it.

476
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,800
People knew that that, that substance, um,

477
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,000
as great as it is to treat certain disorders or issues.

478
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,240
It could also be hugely beneficial for endurance sport. Um,

479
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,800
but in, in 92 93, it was, it was not, it wasn't an obsession.

480
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,320
You know, at the time, obviously when I was just a kid following cycling,

481
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,040
I was always surprised in the 91 tour, how quickly Greg fell off. Um,

482
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,560
and years later, of course we would all speculate, was that the,

483
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,800
was that not just the passing of the torch between two great cyclists,

484
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,360
Lamond and Induran, but was it also the passing of the torch of an era? Right?

485
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,320
Was it, do you believe that that was when high octane products became the

486
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,840
mainstay in 91? Or do you think that no,

487
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,840
it would not be probably until either the end of Induran or because clearly by

488
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,760
the time Reese came along in 96, I mean, that might've been the most, um,

489
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,920
yeah, people, people most that really have a deep understanding will tell you

490
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,280
that it, I mean, it was in the Peloton in the late eighties. Um,

491
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,520
but that's really going far back and, and, and,

492
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,800
and nobody from back then is talking for sure. Um,

493
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,080
but honestly, yeah, Pedro Delgado, I think there, there were definitely rumors

494
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,600
that, that, um, cause he won in what didn't he win the year that Lamond was out,

495
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,360
which was 87.

496
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,600
You know way too much about the sport. Yeah. This is, you know, a lot more than me,

497
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,920
but I peg it to the jerseys I had as a kid and Greg, I had the PDK.

498
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,160
And honestly, Greg, Greg still could have,

499
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,720
he towards the end of his career and it was well documented. I'm not,

500
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,720
I'm not saying this as a, as a, uh, as a knock on him, but he's,

501
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,800
he was starting to let himself go in the off season. I mean,

502
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,640
he would show up to the earth season races and I mean, you could see it.

503
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,880
You're like, dude, is this guy been training or not? And, and,

504
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,200
and Indorine was a machine. Indorine was a beast. I mean,

505
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,520
this guy trained 365 days a year. So, um,

506
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,400
so it's not clear what that transition was. Yeah,

507
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,080
but Indorine was, he could do it all.

508
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,600
So I think another thing that most people don't understand about cycling is,

509
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,960
or certainly about the, about the tour is that because of how

510
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,640
grueling it is, which again, I can't tell you,

511
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,800
I understand because I've never done it,

512
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,280
but as much as somebody who's never understood it or has never done it,

513
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,560
I feel like I at least have some appreciation for it because I understand

514
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,920
physiology. There's nothing about it that's reasonable, right?

515
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,520
Like there's nothing about doing that, that is physiologically appropriate,

516
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,640
or in any way, shape or form promotes a person's health, right? Like a rider at

517
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,680
the end of the tour is probably the least healthy they could ever be. Um,

518
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,160
and as a result of that,

519
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,200
there's no era in the history of this bike race where cyclists haven't turned to

520
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,720
substances. Um, and,

521
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,920
and whether they're banned or not banned is really a semantic point, right?

522
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,720
But you know, in the earliest renditions of this race,

523
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,760
riders were using alcohol to numb pain or traditional painkillers, cocaine,

524
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,400
more sophisticated amphetamines, war hopping on trains.

525
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,600
Exactly. Grabbing cars, literally just getting yanked up mountains. Um,

526
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,840
what was the environment like? Not that you were there, but you wrote,

527
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,280
you overlapped with the guys that were there in the eighties.

528
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,480
Was there an environment of testing of anything?

529
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,160
Like were people looking at himatic rate to see if people like actually blood

530
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,040
doped, let alone using EPO,

531
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,080
were they testing for cortisone or testosterone or other hormones?

532
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Um, I don't have to go back. And I mean, like, for example,

533
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,920
in 93 when I won a stage in the tour, I won the world's, I was tested.

534
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,200
You were tested. Okay. Um, but that's not, you know,

535
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,680
you acknowledge that back then you were using things like cortisone.

536
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,520
Were you worried that those things would show up or were you just making sure

537
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,120
that they were out of your system by the time you were racing? Well, you know,

538
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,040
the, the, um, what the, what the, um,

539
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,640
the way to go about that in the day was just a TUE.

540
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,960
So a therapeutic use exemption and, and, you know,

541
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,160
a lot of these compounds come in different forms and different form factors and

542
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,720
different administrations. And so you, you know, you could say, well, you know,

543
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,280
I've got tendonitis in the knee. And so they, that's how they,

544
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,200
the TUE was sort of the, which I think they've cut back on a lot of that. Um,

545
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,560
but in competition testing for certainly for something like EPO,

546
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,040
which has a five hour half life. No way. Not going to work. Yeah. That's where,

547
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,960
that's where they, you know,

548
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,240
they started doing the out of competition testing and the whereabouts and the,

549
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,760
but you know, the,

550
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,800
the biggest hammers that have dropped in cycling in and around drugs like that

551
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,320
were not through testing. They were through the police. Like look at,

552
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,320
yeah, nobody got, nobody tested positive, positive in the Festina fair. Right.

553
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,800
Do the police shut up and raid them?

554
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,000
A dumbass one year across on a border gets pulled over low and behold a car full

555
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,840
of stuff. That's how that happened. Like the agencies had nothing to do with

556
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,660
that.

557
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,040
So coming into the 94 season, you've got to be optimistic, right? You've just won.

558
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,680
You're the world champion. Um, what,

559
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,520
do you remember what your expectations and your goals were for that season with

560
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,600
respect to either single day classics or grand tours?

561
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,120
Yeah. I mean, I thought, um, that,

562
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,720
that was an interesting period in time though, because that is when,

563
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,920
yeah, no, and I know you basically got your ass kicked out here,

564
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,120
but I want to know what you thought coming in.

565
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,640
Well, I thought I would, I mean, I thought I'd be, yeah,

566
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,720
competitive and every one day race I started.

567
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,040
And did you think like I'm going to be on the podium in the tour in the next

568
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,040
three years? No, no. At that time I was fully resigned or,

569
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,920
or committed to the fact that I was, I was a classic rider. I was one day,

570
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
right? What did you weigh at that point?

571
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,120
I probably weighed, I was big, you know, I was,

572
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,120
I was my whole career. I was big just cause I was as a swimmer, you, you never,

573
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,240
a swimmer never loses a swimmer's body. Uh, the back, the chest,

574
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,240
shoulders, I mean, you can lean it out, but you're going to be big.

575
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,320
So I was probably one 75. Yeah.

576
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,800
Which is tough to be a climber at one 75. But I was one,

577
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,120
when in the tours I was, you know, between one 61 65.

578
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,000
Still big. Yeah. I mean, race in Pantani was one 25.

579
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,840
So when do you realize in 94, like something's wrong?

580
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,800
Well, I, I, I think we realized that something had changed. Um,

581
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,680
and I mean, it was, it was overnight. I mean that, but that between 93 and 94,

582
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,800
even though I'm sure 93, there was, um,

583
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,320
and that's the great thing about a one day race is it is in a way,

584
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,720
a race, a chance you can play your cards, you can play tactics. You can,

585
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,800
you obviously have to be fitting up to be in the front group.

586
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,920
But when I made my move in 93, I mean, that was a, that was a bit of a hail Mary.

587
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,440
I went early. I got a gap. They were disorganized behind and,

588
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,480
and you stay away. So, you know, the big tours were, you know,

589
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,560
the race of truth in the time trial or the hardest climbs. Like there was no,

590
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,760
those are individual competitions. And so,

591
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,360
but there was a tectonic shift from 93 to 94.

592
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
And how long did it take you to understand this is exactly what's happening.

593
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,000
This is not about more cortisone. This is not about more testosterone.

594
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,720
It was all over. It was all over the press. I mean, you know, you had,

595
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,880
in 1994 you had in flesh for loan,

596
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,440
you had three go with riders go up the road and then the,

597
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,840
the press went crazy after that because you're having an Italian team.

598
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,880
Um, Ferrari's the trainer,

599
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,320
you know, the, the press also back then was more, uh,

600
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,600
they were more sort of beat riders. So they were friends with the riders.

601
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,760
They were, uh, they were beat right.

602
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,520
Ters and they were friends with the riders. They were friends with the directors.

603
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,960
So they were all kind of buddies and,

604
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,000
but they wouldn't write about what they would hear. Um,

605
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,200
until then, and then they started and then they got on it. And so,

606
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,600
uh, and then people got to Ferrari and, and he made, you know, of course,

607
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,920
the famous quote about trying to compare E-boat to orange juice.

608
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,080
And at least that's the way that it was printed. But after that,

609
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,280
every, yeah, it was everywhere in the press and in the belt.

610
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,960
Did you remind me what happened in the 94 tour for you?

611
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,520
94, I got sick halfway through and dropped out. Okay.

612
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,240
And then in the 95 tour finished,

613
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,800
you finished and that's a tragic tour, right? Yeah.

614
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,520
So Fabio is killed. Yep. Yep.

615
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,160
He was on our team. He was on your team.

616
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
The same guy that won the Olympics. He won the Olympics in 92. Is that,

617
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,840
is that a wake up call to you in any way?

618
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,040
Do you realize how dangerous your sport is when you watch your teammates head

619
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,920
smashed open on the side of the road? Yep. Yeah. That was, uh,

620
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,120
um, you know, of course the helmets were

621
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,640
not certainly not required and very few people wore them. Um,

622
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,640
I'm not sure what it helped Fabio. He hit really hit his face.

623
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,200
Um, and basically died right there, but, um,

624
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,360
and just surreal to, you know, it was a tough mountain day and,

625
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,240
and we were in the group petto and I mean, we were out there forever.

626
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,960
And we actually got news of his death, um, in the race.

627
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,960
And so it was just, you know,

628
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,600
that's so rare, but to have, so to have it happen to us on our team,

629
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,440
you know, you have breakfast with the guy, but he's not at the dinner table,

630
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,960
you know, and the whole, the, the, the, the, the, the,

631
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,200
the whole story is tragic, right? Young wife, new baby boy. I mean,

632
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,360
it, and he was, you know, Fabio was interesting.

633
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,360
He wasn't your normal Italian. He was, uh,

634
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,320
they were all super serious, not really jokesters.

635
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,760
He was a jokester like, and he came to our, uh,

636
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,560
he obviously had huge talent and potential won the Olympic gold. Um,

637
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,680
but he didn't, he wasn't adjusting to pro cycling.

638
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,120
And so we picked him up in 95. Um,

639
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,000
and ironically the, uh, the, the, the, the, for that last,

640
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,720
or for the ninth spot, it was down, uh, it was down to him and George.

641
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,760
And George was actually there at the start cause we would always take 10 guys.

642
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,400
And then literally the day before the team would decide who the ninth guy was and

643
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,240
they decide George was young, but they decided to take Casa Telly.

644
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,040
Um, you know, yeah, I was, it was, it was bad.

645
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,200
It was the 18th stage that you won in his honor. Three days later,

646
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,680
when did you realize you were going to win that race that stage rather?

647
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, you know, that's those, those stages at the end of the tour,

648
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,360
they're, they're, they're just custom made for breakaways, right?

649
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,840
The GC is set. It's, it's,

650
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,560
those days are for the opportunist and I went away in a group and it was a huge,

651
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,920
ironically, Johann Berniel was in that group too,

652
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,920
but it was a huge group and, and that group stays away.

653
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,960
They never get caught. And then, you know,

654
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,440
they basically race amongst ourselves and, and, and, uh, you know,

655
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,400
I just took a huge flyer. I think it was 30, 40 K to go. Just,

656
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,840
just went away and, and, you know, they'll let you go. Um, but you, you're playing,

657
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,800
you're betting that they, you know, like a lot of times they can't get organized.

658
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,320
And, but when I went, man, I was fucking,

659
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,960
flying moves. It was, I knew I was. I mean, in fact,

660
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
our director at the time, Henny Kiper, who was a legendary Dutch cyclist,

661
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,720
he kept coming up, you know, this is, uh,

662
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,560
he kept coming up and giving me time splits.

663
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,320
And you were gapping, you were gaining on the gap.

664
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,080
Yeah. And finally I said, Henny, don't come up here anymore.

665
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,680
I said, I'm not getting caught. Just stay back there. And I was,

666
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,800
I knew it and I was just, just flying.

667
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,080
And you, did you feel a sense of like this was for Fabio,

668
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
you felt a little extra strength that day. I mean, I've heard,

669
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,200
I've heard so many athletes talk about that when they're Damon Hill talking about

670
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,840
racing after Senna died later in that season, feeling like he, he couldn't do,

671
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,080
he couldn't just make that cargo fast enough.

672
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,360
And it's almost like he looked up to the skies and just asked for some bit of help

673
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,800
from him.

674
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,600
And just floating and, and, and, you know,

675
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,160
I don't want to oversell our relationship or our friendship because we,

676
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,400
I didn't really know Fabio. We were on our team together.

677
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,840
He didn't speak English. I didn't speak Italian. Um,

678
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,120
but it's nonetheless, I mean, he died in our colors and, and, uh,

679
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,440
you know, it's, it's, it just, it just doesn't happen. So for, I mean,

680
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,280
it's extraordinary that it, that it happened to us. And I mean,

681
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,400
at that day, I mean, I was just possessed.

682
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
So going into the 96 season,

683
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,120
that's the year you decided it was time to, to,

684
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,320
to start moving into the high octane world. Correct.

685
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,960
Actually, no, we, we, we, we made that decision. 95. Oh, you did. Yeah. Okay.

686
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,680
96. I was, I joined Ferrari. So that was,

687
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,160
so you, so in 95 you were sort of doing freestyle EPO,

688
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,280
managing it on your own.

689
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,920
Yeah. I mean the, the, we had, you know, there was,

690
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,680
there was medical care. There was guidance. I mean, this isn't, you know,

691
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,400
I think that would be a bad idea to just go off and do that on your own,

692
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,040
but there were, there was some oversight.

693
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,320
And would you manage it to a certain himatic, right?

694
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,760
Is that effectively what was being done? They weren't testing,

695
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,680
they didn't start testing for himatic, right? Until I want to say 98 or 90,

696
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,800
they started testing,

697
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,120
doing the sort of morning himatic tests while I was out of the sport.

698
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,360
So, but in 95 and 96, they didn't know, no,

699
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't mean the race organizers.

700
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,240
I mean where the doctor is using himatic, right? Oh yeah.

701
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,200
As we got get a guide, your EPO level and your, your.

702
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,480
And hemoglobin. Yeah. Yeah. So what is your normal hemoglobin? Like,

703
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,000
like what is it today? Low? Well, that's a good question.

704
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,480
Yeah. Uh, since we live in Aspen now, I'm sure it's, it's,

705
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,080
it's probably 45 or 46, but you know,

706
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,480
if I lived here in Austin, it would be in the low forties.

707
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,840
And so do you remember when you started doing EPO in 95,

708
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,440
presumably they gave you enough EPO to bring your himatic rate up to 50,

709
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,040
I would guess is where they kind of wanted you. Well, there was,

710
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,120
50 was not, um,

711
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,120
I know that there was no ceiling, right?

712
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,320
Did they have concern about blood clotting and things like that? Um,

713
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,240
not at 50 and maybe not even at 60.

714
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,600
And there are people on Everest that you know, you know,

715
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,160
better than me that have a himatic rate of 70.

716
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,480
So do you know how high they were pushing your crit back in 95?

717
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,360
Not specifically, not that it was, uh, the answer is no,

718
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,960
but I mean, it would, I would remember if it had been 60, you know,

719
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,960
sort of the stories you hear from, from some folks, but,

720
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,880
and, and also just, um, you know, enough is enough, right?

721
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,360
At some point you're, you're, you're competitive. You're at the front of the,

722
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,320
you know, you need to do more.

723
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,880
Did you feel a difference? Did you notice a difference from 94? Oh yeah.

724
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,960
I mean, let's not get ourselves. That's,

725
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,000
it's a very effective substance.

726
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,240
And do you have the sense that it was being used as

727
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,880
often in the one day races as it was in the grand tours? Absolutely. Yeah.

728
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,920
Again, there's no reason it wouldn't help you in Perry,

729
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,680
Roubaix just as much as it helps you on.

730
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,760
Absolutely. Watts or Watts. I mean,

731
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,880
if you're getting 10% more hemoglobin or hematocrit, whatever you want,

732
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,840
however you want to describe it, you are also getting at threshold,

733
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,120
10% more power. Do you, were you using a power meter yet at that point?

734
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,160
My, no, I didn't. I,

735
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,800
I 98 was when I first started using the SRM.

736
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,400
The SRM. Yeah. It was so good. Yeah. Well, I,

737
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,640
do you remember off the top of your head,

738
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,120
what your functional threshold power was in 98?

739
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,520
Um, I remember what it was in 99. What was it? I mean, in 99,

740
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,600
I could before the tour in 99, I tested on, uh, on the Madone.

741
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,080
And which was your go-to test. Yeah. It was, well, it was,

742
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,520
I wasn't the first to use it. Tony Romager used it. He,

743
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,440
he had the fastest time and you know, how many kilometers is Madone? It's, uh,

744
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,040
what's about 30 minutes,

745
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,120
30 minutes. And what's the grade? It's about 7, 8%.

746
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,200
So it's a straight in the saddle pound away for 30 minutes.

747
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,240
And what did you average for 30 minutes in 99? 500 Watts.

748
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,240
Are you freaking kidding me?

749
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,240
500 Watts for 30 minutes.

750
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,920
And at that point you were 165 pounds. Yep.

751
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah. Seven Watts kilo.

752
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,960
All right. We got it.

753
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,280
We got a few things to cover before we get the seven Watts per kilo. Um,

754
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,120
96, you should be in top form and you're sick as hell in the tour.

755
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,120
You pull out. Yep.

756
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,960
I thought I was just sick. Um, and I was certain,

757
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,440
and I was definitely sick of being there. It was just,

758
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,760
it was shit weather that year and I wasn't riding that well and I was ready to

759
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,600
go home.

760
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,960
When did you notice that testicular pain?

761
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,800
Certainly then. Um, but I just, you know, soreness, uh,

762
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,080
that was the first symptom, right? Just, just enlarged testicle sore.

763
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Um, but on every level, sore to the touch, sore to sit on a seat.

764
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,840
You know, if you crossed your legs in an awkward way, it would hurt.

765
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,560
And I just thought, I thought I'd had to do was sitting on a bike seat all the

766
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,600
time, which is, you know, I've heard you say that before.

767
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,920
And I've always thought it's kind of funny because you've been sitting on a bike

768
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,240
for 10 years at that point. I know. But then you also, I mean,

769
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,600
you're rationalizing it, right? And, and I, you know, nobody, I was growing up.

770
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,720
And just to even to this day, I just rarely get sick. Like I, you know, I,

771
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,320
I just didn't have,

772
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,560
and I certainly didn't think that I would ever be in that position, but, um,

773
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,760
and I just, it was ignore after ignore,

774
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,760
even as the symptoms sort of became more and more drastically significant.

775
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,840
I just, I just kept going. I had an excuse for all of,

776
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,880
did you have any headaches? I had one big episode, uh,

777
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,240
that was right before diagnosis. Yeah.

778
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,880
Massive headache, massive headache, massive. Any visual changes?

779
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,920
The next day. Yeah. So the visual, um, so I, I,

780
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,000
I was here in Austin actually. I used to have a venue, um,

781
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,920
South of town. Uh, what's it called?

782
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,840
I forget, but I went to a Jimmy Buffett concert and I got a huge headache at the

783
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,200
concert and, uh, next day woke up blurry vision.

784
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,200
And even then I'm pushing through it. I'm like, okay.

785
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Headache cause I was at a concert and maybe I had a couple of beers. Now,

786
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,160
you're not supposed to have the headache while you're having the beers.

787
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,560
It's supposed to be the next day and the blurry vision. Well, I'm, you know,

788
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,480
I might need to get some glasses. Uh,

789
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,440
and then probably a week after that was the, you know,

790
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,000
it was the one that sent me to the doc.

791
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Just coughing up blood everywhere. Everywhere.

792
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,880
That's October 2nd. That was, um, uh, no,

793
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,240
no, because the, the, um, I mean, it would have been,

794
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,320
maybe October 1st because the blood episode happened and you know,

795
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,160
coughing up the blood,

796
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,360
spitting it out and, and, um, called my buddy. He was a neighbor.

797
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,400
He's a doctor said, I don't know. We were coughing up blood.

798
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,680
Can you come look at it? And you know, um, cosmetic surgeon, not a,

799
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,800
I'm an oncologist, not a, you know,

800
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,600
sort of looked in my nose and my down my throat and you know,

801
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,440
he thought, and I had rinsed out the sink.

802
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,600
So he didn't see how much was in there.

803
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,320
He didn't see how much blood there was there. Did it scare you? Oh yeah.

804
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,760
Yeah.

805
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,240
And I obviously didn't do a good enough job telling him how much blood was in

806
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,080
the sink. Um, so he thought it was a sinus thing.

807
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,080
You're a sinus, you dry the crack, you cough up a little bit.

808
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,000
And you weren't putting two and two together. Of course,

809
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,640
this thing in my testes, the headache, the blood, there's no way in your mind.

810
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,480
These are all related.

811
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,360
Nope. And then, and then the next day, which was October 2nd,

812
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,560
I called him back because this pain at this point was so bad and the testicle

813
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,720
was so swollen. I said, listen,

814
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,600
there's just one other thing that that, you know, I just embarrassed or I just,

815
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,680
you know, I haven't talked about that this is going on.

816
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,280
And that's when he said, okay, this, we gotta get that checked out.

817
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,400
And then that's when I drove to Jim Reeves's office on the second.

818
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,240
What do you remember people talk often about when a diagnosis like this is

819
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,920
levied on them, they're not even able to process what's being said. Like,

820
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,720
you hear some things, but you don't hear other things. Like I,

821
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,960
I remember experiencing this as the one delivering this news where you sort of

822
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,720
try to talk as slowly as possible. You pause as much as possible,

823
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,720
but you realize at the end of that, they probably heard a 10th of what you said.

824
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,080
What is your recollection of the very first time this news was,

825
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,680
because by this point they probably had a chest X-ray.

826
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,320
Well, it was one of the first things Jim Reeves did.

827
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,840
They also did another little shot. I'll never forget this. They did, they,

828
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,600
they gave me a little shot under the skin where they were going to test a

829
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,480
reaction or so. So what's that? What are you doing? What's, what's this for?

830
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,560
And they said, Oh, we want to, um, we just want to rule out tuberculosis.

831
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,960
And I remember thinking, God, please give me tuberculosis.

832
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,600
And then he wanted a chest X-ray and I'm like, well, why are you,

833
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,960
what do you need a chest X-ray for?

834
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,880
And then they sent me to the ultrasound. Uh, and it took,

835
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,440
that they had a young lady in there. It was the text. She just took forever.

836
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,880
And I thought, does she not know what she's doing?

837
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,840
Then the actual doctor came in and repeated the test. Um,

838
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,120
this was an ultrasound of your testes and your abdomen. I'm guessing.

839
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,200
Yeah. And, um, and then, and then they walked in and they,

840
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,160
they handed me the, uh, the file, which, uh, had the chest X-ray,

841
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,640
they had the scan report and they said, you know,

842
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,360
go back to Dr. Reeves office. He's waiting for you. And at this point,

843
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,320
it's like, I dunno, six or 7 PM. I'm like, this is not good.

844
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,560
And so that's what, I mean, he didn't,

845
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,840
I can remember most of what he said cause he didn't say very much. I mean,

846
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,080
he just straight in.

847
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,040
Now at the time did they know that it was not seminomatous?

848
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,320
So they, there was still a window of opportunity that this was going to be a

849
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,280
very curable form of testicular cancer.

850
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,800
I think with the chest, I mean the chest X-ray was, was riddled. I mean,

851
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,320
it was, it was more white than it was gray.

852
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,960
So you had pretty good indication.

853
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,960
How long until you had the orchiectomy? How many days?

854
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,320
Nice morning. Yeah. Cause that's what I said to Reeves. I said,

855
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,560
I feel like I should get a second opinion. And he said,

856
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,440
you have surgery at seven AM tomorrow morning.

857
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,400
And you know, keep in mind, this is in 1996.

858
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,080
So this, the way people would process this news today, they would,

859
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,120
they would say, okay, I'm going to go home. I'm going to open my computer.

860
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,840
I'm going to, I'm going to Google everything I can about whatever my doctor just

861
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,160
told me.

862
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,680
And I'm going to start to learn and get a bunch of information and figure out

863
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,360
options. And none of that existed.

864
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,080
We did not have the internet in 1996.

865
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,040
When did you call your mom?

866
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,400
Oh, right away. Yeah. Right when I got home. How was she?

867
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,880
My mom's always, uh, you know, on this,

868
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,760
and this is, you know, I think what makes her great and strong,

869
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,840
if she would never show weakness. So it,

870
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,120
although I know she had moments where, um,

871
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,920
she would be sad and upset and worried, um,

872
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,640
on the surface, she just, she just had this shield. Like, let's,

873
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,440
let's fucking go. We got this. You could do this. Um,

874
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,960
so she, yeah, she would for anything that I ever saw,

875
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,720
she was totally confident.

876
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,880
Did you understand what the prognosis was at that time?

877
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,400
Um, not really. Uh,

878
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,900
and who does right? I mean, it's, it's, uh, I mean,

879
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,180
I know it was, it was as advanced as it was.

880
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,300
Well, it wasn't just that it was advanced, right? It was the histology of it.

881
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,180
It was not a seminomatous tumor, which is at that point,

882
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,260
really the only testicular cancer that's curable, right? You had,

883
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,780
you had a much more histologically advanced cancer that choreocarcinoma,

884
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:05,140
which was, which was wildly metastatic. What was your alpha-theta protein level?

885
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:10,380
Well, that was, that was elevated. The one we monitored, um,

886
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,540
the closest was, uh, beta-HGG.

887
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,900
How high was that?

888
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,740
A hundred thousand.

889
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,380
So you were pregnant.

890
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,620
I know. Well, anything, you know, it was very pregnant. Um,

891
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,380
yeah, that was, uh, you know, I mean,

892
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,180
if you come in with 500, you got a problem.

893
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,700
Anything above two, you have a problem.

894
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,340
So you had the orchiectomy. They also took out lymph nodes.

895
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,220
They didn't know. We didn't do any, no, didn't touch the lymph nodes.

896
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,940
Didn't touch the lungs.

897
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,900
When did you know you had brain meds? When did they do the CTs?

898
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,500
When I got to Indiana.

899
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,700
So you mean you went through all of this and they still didn't know you had

900
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,580
right? Metastatic disease.

901
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,460
I originally was treated, I did my first cycle of chemotherapy here in Austin.

902
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,980
What was the chemo you did here?

903
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,900
That was traditional BEP. So I did, I did do one. We were talking about it.

904
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,740
One with bleo.

905
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,380
Yeah. I did one cycle with bleo.

906
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,300
Could have won eight if I didn't do that one cycle.

907
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,180
Yeah. So bleomycin is a really, really toxic chemo.

908
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:19,180
And we'll talk about it in a second when we get to Indiana,

909
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,940
why they decided to have a little faith and play the long game.

910
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,940
What led you to Indiana? Because again, in a pre-internet era,

911
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,460
it wouldn't have been as clear that, um,

912
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,660
that that was a place that was really on the cusp of doing something.

913
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,860
Yeah. But even, even, I mean, they had done the work, right? Like the, the local,

914
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:42,420
my local oncologist knew, I mean, I may, maybe even, even pre-internet,

915
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,340
they, they still knew where the centers of excellence.

916
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,940
In other words, it came from the docs here.

917
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,660
You didn't have to go and make that decision.

918
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,700
Well, he, he had mentioned that,

919
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,460
that Dr. Larry Einhorn in Indianapolis was, uh, you know,

920
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,900
it was sort of the, um, the king when he came to testicular cancer. In fact,

921
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,220
a lot of his work really led to, um,

922
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:11,180
platinum based therapies really being as effective as they are. So I immediately,

923
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,900
and he was in Australia at the time, he was lecturing in Australia. And I, you know,

924
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,820
when I heard his name, I said, I gotta find this guy.

925
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,100
And then we tried to call him and he was off in Australia. Um,

926
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:27,220
but I did do that one that, that, you know, I did four cycles in total.

927
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:31,660
The first cycle was done here in Austin. Um, and then I had started, you go one

928
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,980
week on two weeks off, one week on two weeks. So I had two weeks.

929
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,340
And that's when I first went to Houston to visit MD Anderson.

930
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,180
And then I ended up,

931
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,580
did MD Anderson also recommend, uh, recommend Leo?

932
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,180
Well, they had a whole different approach and was a much more,

933
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,820
um,

934
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,380
it was, it was not traditional therapy, which is interesting. I mean, they,

935
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,340
they much more chemotherapy, a lot more compounds.

936
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,380
Um, I didn't, I did, it just didn't,

937
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,860
it didn't feel right. I left.

938
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,740
So when you got to Indiana, did they do the CT scan first?

939
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,100
They figure out you've got brain meds as well. Yeah.

940
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,140
Is that another, what the hell is going on here?

941
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,420
How much worse can this get moment?

942
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,300
Well, it was kind of a, I mean, yes, the answer is yes,

943
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,380
but also a bit of a relief. You're like, okay, that's,

944
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,060
this has got to be the worst part of it. So like now that this is my line in the

945
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,860
sand, I'm not, it's not getting worse.

946
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,620
It's really, really bad, but it's not going to get worse. Right.

947
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,180
So I'm just trying to understand Lance. Like at what point were you thinking I

948
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,140
might not live here?

949
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,780
Um,

950
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,580
God, I didn't, I didn't have,

951
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,940
I mean, certainly crossed my mind,

952
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:55,220
but I didn't have days where I would sit there and go, I am going to,

953
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,660
like I just kept, and we were doing so much, you know, with, with, with the blood

954
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,260
work on it, like we were measuring the HGG, it was coming down.

955
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,620
They, they expected, you know, I said, look, what, what do you want to see?

956
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:11,500
Like what's what's, what's this is the scoreboard. What's my metric? Yeah.

957
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,980
What is my metric that says I'm ahead in this game and they said a log drop off

958
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:19,460
every, every cycle and man, we were hitting it. Bam, bam.

959
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,940
It just kept coming down and I was like, I, I'm kicking this thing's ass.

960
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,340
Like yeah, I can turn around and the body can,

961
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,980
and the cancer can pivot and the chemo doesn't work. Whatever work,

962
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,180
whatever happens, but I just,

963
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:35,180
I just felt like I got on top of it and I didn't sit around with this other

964
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,380
protocol, right? They went with, they went with what? Yeah. Instead of, well,

965
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,340
that was first thing they asked me. They said, okay, you're a professional

966
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,460
cyclist. I said, do you ever want to race bikes again? I said, I mean,

967
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:51,060
if I can live, yeah, they prefer to live, but that's, that would be cool. Um,

968
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,980
and they said, well, you, we can't, you can't keep doing bleo. And so,

969
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,420
it's so pulmonary toxic. It's so cardio.

970
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,380
And people ask like, why,

971
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,780
why wouldn't everybody be treated the way you were treated with the protocol

972
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,580
called VIP, which is doesn't indicate that you're a VIP. It's just the,

973
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,140
yeah, it's been Christine and so spot and then and blah, blah, blah.

974
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:14,580
But the downside to being treated with VIP is you have to stay as an inpatient.

975
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,660
So bleo, you can go home,

976
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,460
like you go into the chemo clinic for three or four hours,

977
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,540
get your chemo and you go home. Uh, VIP, one of those, and I don't,

978
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,540
I forget which one is so toxic, not on the lungs,

979
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,980
but on the body that you have to have 24 seven hydration.

980
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,340
So you have to be in the hospital. And so they just, you know,

981
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,620
I just don't, people want to go home.

982
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,100
Kima was bad for you.

983
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,940
Kimo was bad at the end. Kimo is a,

984
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,220
and I still talk to people about this cause they, if they're going to be about to

985
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,300
start chemo, they asked me and you know, cycle one, I was like,

986
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,580
you sure you did this right? Like I don't feel anything.

987
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,180
Cycle two gets sick a few times. Like, Ooh, okay.

988
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,620
I think they got it right this time. Cycle three, just sick as shit.

989
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,900
Cycle four, you just, you just want to sleep. Like you just, it,

990
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:09,420
it just compounds and compounds. It got, it got much, much worse.

991
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,020
What was the recovery like from the neurosurgery?

992
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,140
Um, you know, that was, those were,

993
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:21,100
those were big cuts. I mean, they were, you know, they're probably,

994
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,580
you know, tennis ball size. Um, uh,

995
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:31,300
the easiest way to describe it for people listening or have never been there is

996
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,340
it's, it's, it's like, you know,

997
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,100
doing the pumpkin for Halloween. Like you literally just cut the hole,

998
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,380
pull off the thing,

999
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,620
dig out the seeds and put the thing back on it. Like that's what,

1000
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:48,420
and there were two of them. There was one on the top, one on the back, um,

1001
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,980
right on the surface. So Dr. Shapiro was my neurosurgeon.

1002
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:57,700
He saw him and he pulled that skull off and right there.

1003
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,220
And they were dead.

1004
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,900
Oh, this was done after most of the chemo. Uh, no,

1005
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,420
it was done before halfway. Wow. But you know,

1006
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,620
the response was amazing. I don't know how, you know, the,

1007
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,100
the blood brain barrier, you know,

1008
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,300
this barrier that prevents super toxic stuff from getting into the brain.

1009
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,020
They should not have been dead.

1010
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,340
That's why they go in there and take them out and sit, you know, they,

1011
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,620
and I'm not a surgeon or a scientist,

1012
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,220
but they take them out and they walk them over and you know,

1013
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,180
look at them immediately in the microscope and they were dead.

1014
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,020
At that point in time,

1015
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:40,340
is there anybody you remember meeting in the hospital that kind of made you feel

1016
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,580
like you were having a shared experience with another patient?

1017
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,780
Was there any patient that sticks out to you?

1018
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,660
No, I was kept pretty, uh, isolated. I did.

1019
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,740
I never shared a room. Um, I did chemo in my room. I didn't, you know,

1020
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,580
a lot of hospitals or, or centers, you know, it's like a,

1021
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,260
a big room with nice boys everywhere. And you sit beside the, you know,

1022
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,500
I'm Lance with testicular cancer and you're, you know,

1023
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,860
the Gina with breast cancer and Joe with colon and you're all just kind of

1024
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,860
talking, watching. I never, I was always alone in my room.

1025
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,660
Which is interesting because it seems like very early on you,

1026
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,820
you, you, you sort of latched onto an important idea, right? Which was, um,

1027
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,460
people need help navigating this system.

1028
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,780
And you obviously felt moved at a very early point in your disease and recovery

1029
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,900
to create a foundation that you ultimately would,

1030
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:41,620
what do you think was part of the impetus for that in your experience?

1031
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:45,580
It just, it just, you know,

1032
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,660
even as modest as the expectations were, it was like, let's just do like,

1033
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,500
and you can think about it a lot of different ways.

1034
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,380
It wasn't so much about navigation at the time. It was more about here.

1035
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,300
You have a disease or a type of cancer with a huge stigma around it.

1036
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,340
You have young men that like, you know, like me that are,

1037
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,460
if they have swelling or pain,

1038
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,260
they're not going to go out and like advertise that and seek,

1039
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,860
most likely not seek help until it's a problem. Um,

1040
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,340
so just trying to bring awareness to that. And you know, we thought we,

1041
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,500
we'd started a bike ride here in Austin.

1042
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,660
We thought we'd maybe get a few people out there, donate some money.

1043
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,060
We had no plan. I mean, it was,

1044
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,820
but it just felt like the time to do something.

1045
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,620
Was it sort of a pay it forward thing?

1046
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,460
Like you were just so happy to be alive that you were like,

1047
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,620
I just have to share some of this. Well, we start, yeah, well,

1048
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,260
we started it before and then we started, or I should say we started it during.

1049
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,540
So that wasn't entirely sure that there was going to be a forward, but

1050
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,820
it's interesting. Obviously the foundation would grow to over half a billion

1051
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,100
dollar in, um, in, in, in money raised.

1052
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,860
And I think what a lot of people don't appreciate, um,

1053
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,820
but I always appreciated was that that money was very specific and that it

1054
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,260
wasn't directed towards research. And you might say, well, God,

1055
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,460
that doesn't make sense. Shouldn't all money in cancer be towards research?

1056
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,260
But I always thought it was a really great thing that the money wasn't directed

1057
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:14,940
towards research because there are a lot of dollars directed towards research.

1058
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,700
And there are not a lot of dollars directed towards the other things.

1059
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,500
Research is imperative. It must be,

1060
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,060
and it should be by far the largest allocation of resources within a portfolio

1061
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,220
that's trying to address cancer. But it's this other stuff,

1062
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:33,220
this softer stuff of how do you help a family that can't afford the travel for,

1063
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,580
you know, the child with cancer? How do you provide the resources for somebody?

1064
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,980
And then of course there are, you know,

1065
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,020
you inspired a lot of other people like fertility hope and other people to come

1066
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,220
along and address other problems that, um,

1067
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,260
just probably didn't get enough attention.

1068
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,300
And on the advocacy side, I mean, on my answer to,

1069
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,220
I agree with everything you said. Uh, you have to raise,

1070
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,340
you know, billions and billions, maybe even trillions to, to properly,

1071
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,500
I mean, there's only one person that can fund that. And that's, you know,

1072
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,180
those are federal governments. And, um, and so,

1073
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:14,340
but on the advocacy side, because we ended up gaining so much power, uh,

1074
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,140
just with the story and the brand of Livestrong, I mean,

1075
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:22,060
we advocated here in the state of Texas for, for, uh, uh, uh,

1076
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,260
a bond initiative that, that created the, what we called Seaprot,

1077
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,580
the cancer prevention research Institute of Texas.

1078
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,380
It's a $3 billion bond initiative. We at the time,

1079
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,060
Livestrong spent about

1080
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:41,300
600 grand on that initiative. So picking the best lobbyists,

1081
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:46,060
you know, all the strategy, right? Well, you know, I,

1082
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,500
I see the 600, but I view that as we just funded.

1083
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,780
That's an Archimedes lever, right? Like,

1084
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:56,220
we funded $3 billion in, in, in research and prevention. So,

1085
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:00,740
otherwise you could never go out and you can't sell enough yellow bands to,

1086
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,700
to do that.

1087
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,820
So when did you decide? Yeah. Like not only am I well enough to,

1088
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,740
to come back, but, um, and remind me where, did you already,

1089
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:14,940
did you already have the contract with COFIDES prior to getting sick?

1090
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,900
Motorola had already. Motorola folded. Okay. So you're already,

1091
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,900
you're already officially on, on COFIDES and then you come back and

1092
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:28,740
what are they thinking? Well, they, they, they were, I mean,

1093
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,620
before the even, there was no company. I mean, they, they sent a representative

1094
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:37,220
over and it's crazy that they're still in the sport. Um,

1095
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,180
they sent somebody to, uh, to the U S to basically say, listen,

1096
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,220
this is probably best. He just,

1097
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,100
they sent somebody to evaluate you to come in, lay eyes on you,

1098
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,100
lay eyes on me, but then have a conversation with my agent and say, look,

1099
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,300
you know, we, we feel like we should probably just part ways.

1100
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,180
And your contract was a big contract, right? I mean,

1101
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,300
it was just like a million dollar contract. Yep. Yep. Yeah.

1102
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,620
We didn't let them part ways.

1103
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:06,780
So you, you, you were officially with, with that team for a year

1104
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:11,580
for, yeah. Yeah. So nine 97.

1105
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,780
Did you ride? Nope. Okay.

1106
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:18,700
So they don't renew your contract obviously at the end of 97. So,

1107
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,900
and I had the other interesting thing, which I don't think has been talked about

1108
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:26,540
much. I had a disability policy, which typically is for, you know, injuries,

1109
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:30,420
crashes, anything that makes you disabled enough.

1110
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,340
You can't turn the crank and, but cancer, you know,

1111
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,460
you know, in a way fell under that. So I,

1112
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,980
I took the disability policy or started to take it.

1113
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:46,140
And the deal was if you go back and race again, then it's not. Yeah.

1114
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:49,580
And so, and I think it was a three year payout and I thought, God,

1115
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:54,860
this might be a good off ramp, right? I'll just, and so, uh,

1116
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,900
until it wasn't until it wasn't, then I decided to stay on the highway. But,

1117
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,820
but it wasn't easy, right? Because it wasn't like anyone was clamoring at your

1118
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:07,940
door in 98. No, no, nobody was. Yeah. I mean, that,

1119
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,940
when we went back out to, uh, to sort of shop me to teams,

1120
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:19,660
um, zero, zero interest, right?

1121
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:24,300
Even not even, I mean, postal was really not that interested.

1122
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,380
What do you think changed their mind? Well, the only reason, I mean, I was,

1123
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,620
you have to go, you know, have to go back, follow it backwards. But I mean,

1124
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,260
postal, the team postal,

1125
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,980
which was owned by Tom Weisel had been around.

1126
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:43,060
I was on Weisel's team before Motorola. So I had history there.

1127
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:47,740
I had relationships. I had obviously a relationship with him. Um,

1128
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:52,020
so maybe it was that, but it wasn't, it wasn't a cold call.

1129
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,740
Like I was essentially going back to Weisel's team.

1130
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,980
Cause I left Subaru Montgomery to go to Motorola.

1131
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:04,860
No, you're you're, they gave you 200 K or something like that as a base.

1132
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,820
Yeah. I think that's, and then a bunch of performance bonuses, right? Well, I,

1133
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:12,380
uh, yeah, I negotiated like, uh,

1134
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,700
like a thousand bucks back then again, I loved the, and I really did.

1135
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:21,900
I loved the way the sport was structured, the world cups, UCI points,

1136
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,980
you had a number one ranked rider in the world. Like that's a fucking cool deal.

1137
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,020
Like when I watch golf or tennis or, you know, who's the best? Yeah. Wait,

1138
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:35,180
Djokovic is the number one player. Well, yeah, duh, you should have,

1139
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,940
who is the number, Lewis Hamilton is the number one driver in F1 because he has

1140
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,620
all the most points and wins it. No shit. We had that in cycle.

1141
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:48,660
They don't have that anymore. Um, so I, I, I, I, I, I pinned it to a thousand bucks

1142
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,380
per point and, and realistically back then,

1143
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,860
how many points would the top rider have thousands? Okay. So it's a million,

1144
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,940
millions of dollars potentially. And that's what I went out and did. Yeah.

1145
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:05,500
In 98 and 98 because you did perinies, right? Then I, then I quit,

1146
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,300
came home, said, fuck this. I'm out of here. I'm not cut out for this. I'm not.

1147
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,100
Yeah. I want to talk about that race. Yeah. Why? What went wrong? Oh, just,

1148
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,700
Terry, you know, the weather and, and I,

1149
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,500
and I sort of had this idea in my mind that if, okay, if I,

1150
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,860
I did the Olympics in 1996, I was, and I was,

1151
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,660
but you were, you didn't know it at the time, but you were riddled with tumors.

1152
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:32,700
One flesh for loan. And then looking back on, I was like, wait,

1153
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,300
if I was that good then and I was that sick,

1154
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,980
like all this shit's gone. Now I'm going to be like 10 times as strong,

1155
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,740
which I, of course I wasn't.

1156
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:48,060
I was strong and it was good to have it out of my body, but, um,

1157
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:53,620
you know, it just, and it just caught me on a day, man. It was fucking crosswind.

1158
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,140
It was freezing. I was, I got, I was in the back of the Peloton,

1159
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,780
Peloton split and I'm just like, I'm going home.

1160
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:06,140
Literally pulled over, got in the car, went to the hotel, called Kristen.

1161
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,340
I say, we're going home. What did she say?

1162
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,500
She, you know, she, she was supportive.

1163
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:19,300
Um, she, she didn't support it. She, she didn't necessarily agree,

1164
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:23,700
but she was supportive. It's, it's been so long since I read your book. I mean,

1165
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,300
I read it when it came out. It's not about the bike,

1166
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,300
which probably came out in 2000. So I vaguely remember in that era,

1167
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,260
you kind of vacillated back and forth between I want to ride. I don't want to

1168
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:39,260
ride. I want to sit around and eat tacos all day and text. And yet somewhere in

1169
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,060
there, didn't you, didn't you come in fourth in the Vuelta that year?

1170
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,500
Well, that was at the end of the year.

1171
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,980
So, so was the Tex-Mex beer drinking in the spring?

1172
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:52,020
That was, that would have been, you know, Perinises in March, um,

1173
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,220
April, that was probably, you know,

1174
01:12:55,220 --> 01:13:00,500
those six weeks around the April timeframe. Uh, and then, and then, and you know,

1175
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,540
it wasn't, it was almost like a, an intervention group of friends that were like,

1176
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:10,460
look, man, like I get it. Like you don't want to do it anymore, but just,

1177
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,940
just go back and finish the season. Like just start riding, start training.

1178
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:18,580
Just, just don't, don't go out like that. I just finished the season.

1179
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:24,420
I said, okay, I'll, uh, I'll do that. So I just started riding,

1180
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,660
but no, no, no, no structure. Just ride. I'd go out here in Austin. I just,

1181
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,940
and I rode a lot, like four or five, six hours every day. Just,

1182
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:37,580
just ride. No, this is the season. So what are your teammates doing at this point?

1183
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,820
They're out racing. They're racing. Yeah, they're racing.

1184
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:42,220
And the team doesn't care that you're not there because they're not paying you

1185
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:46,180
anything anyway, basically. Yeah. Yeah. And I, and I, I believe I went to,

1186
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,260
I went to the U S pro, uh, the core States and Philly.

1187
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:56,060
And then, uh, and then I flew to Europe and did my first race back was a tour

1188
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:00,700
Luxembourg. You win that one that now went to Germany,

1189
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:04,260
did another race and won that. These are stage races, short stage races.

1190
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,700
You've reintroduced EPO at this point. Yep. Do you, by the way,

1191
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:13,100
I forgot to ask you this post-orchectomy wouldn't you have needed a,

1192
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,820
wouldn't you have had a medical exemption for testosterone at that point?

1193
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,180
I don't think you can in any sport. Could you get that?

1194
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,500
Yeah, but I never, I never,

1195
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:26,740
but didn't you have to start taking more testosterone after you had your test

1196
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,580
school removed? Um, not necessarily.

1197
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,020
Do you know if you were producing normal amounts?

1198
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,660
Always, always on the lower end, but nothing that was,

1199
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,620
you know, problematic or something. And you said, listen,

1200
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,580
this is going to cause further issues down the line, but not certain. Yeah,

1201
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,260
obviously not on that. And the other thing I meant to ask you, Lance,

1202
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,860
did you at some point during the period of your cancer recovery,

1203
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:58,180
think, man, did that growth hormone amplify this in any way,

1204
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:01,500
shape or form or any of the other anabolic agents, particularly?

1205
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,020
There's no way EPO would have, but,

1206
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:06,860
but what was your thought on some of the other drugs you'd used? Um,

1207
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:12,740
well, you know, that certainly crosses your mind.

1208
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,620
And, and, uh, HGH, you know, there was just very,

1209
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,660
pre-diagnosis. There was very little of that anyways, only in 96,

1210
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,340
which is of course the year that I got sick, but.

1211
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,540
By the way, it seems to me the least performance enhancing drug for a site.

1212
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,940
We never went, we, and by the way, we never went back. I mean,

1213
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:34,620
Ferrari was like, don't need it. Yeah. Yeah. Never, never went back.

1214
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,700
So really the mainstay of drug when you came back was EPO. Yep. Um,

1215
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,780
and it's amazing that cortisone helped that much, huh? Um,

1216
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,820
yeah, you know, I'm surprised you haven't,

1217
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:55,740
it's, it's, it's how would you guys administer it? Intramuscularly?

1218
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:00,020
Yeah. It's helpful to shed weight primarily. And especially as a,

1219
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:03,660
as a, as a bulkier guy, um,

1220
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:07,300
trying to shed upper body muscle. Yeah. Very helpful.

1221
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,780
Unbelievable. Um,

1222
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:16,220
so 98 comes to an end. You, you finish unbelievably right.

1223
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:19,660
Fourth in the world. Fourth in everything. Fourth at the world,

1224
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:23,500
the fourth at the world's TT fourth at the world's road race.

1225
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,700
I just was like, shit, I'm fourth in everything.

1226
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:31,420
But I got a thousand plus UCI points that Tom Weisel had to pay. Well,

1227
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,100
not only that, but you've done it kind of not at your best, right?

1228
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,180
Like you're only, you know, you, you,

1229
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,300
you really only came back into shape for nine months.

1230
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:45,340
So you decide at the end of 98, no, I'm coming back in 99. Like now it's,

1231
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:48,420
I'm all in. Yep. At that point.

1232
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:53,340
I have Bernille. Okay. The big, that was, that was the big, you know,

1233
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,180
the team was, uh, who was the, uh, director of sport.

1234
01:16:56,180 --> 01:17:00,100
Johnny Welch was the director of sport chief in 98. And this Peter,

1235
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,460
when I say this team was unorganized, like you cannot,

1236
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:10,220
you cannot believe it. It was such a shit show.

1237
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:15,780
We remember 98. So I remember cause I was in my second year of medical school

1238
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,140
and I just remember there was a group of guys,

1239
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:21,060
we would go riding every Saturday and Sunday morning and we would, first of all,

1240
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,300
I was so excited that you were back,

1241
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:27,180
but we would joke about like go postal having the two meanings like you're

1242
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:31,060
cheering for postal team and you're going crazy cause it's just so disheveled.

1243
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,620
And yeah, well we had, and I'll never forget this. I mean,

1244
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,300
Johnny was so disorganized and he would like, you know,

1245
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:40,220
they wouldn't pay the swan years and then that,

1246
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:43,460
that Welter that I ended up getting forth and I'll walk down one day,

1247
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,580
a breakfast table and everybody's good. There's no, no swan years. I said,

1248
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,660
where's, I said, where's the fucking swan years? And I said, they walked out.

1249
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,020
I said, wait a minute. We were in the middle of a grand tour.

1250
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:01,700
We have to have mechanics. Swan years. Like what the fuck is going on?

1251
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,580
They just walked out cause we're getting paid so sketchy and I,

1252
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:10,820
and I'm sitting there going, okay, I think I'm back. I said,

1253
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,180
but I'm not going to put up with this shit. Like this is, this is ridiculous.

1254
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:20,180
This is just amateur hour and Johan was retiring and uh,

1255
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,660
I got his number. Uh, Marshall,

1256
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,980
Marcel Wustel German guy gave me his number.

1257
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,580
He wore the yellow Jersey for a day back in those trainers.

1258
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:34,100
They went in the early stages. They get the Jersey, but uh, I just called him.

1259
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,180
I said, what do you, it's funny. We, you know,

1260
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:40,180
we didn't really like each other when we raced. He was,

1261
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:45,140
we always just sort of butted heads and, but he was always at the front of the

1262
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:48,460
race. Like he fucking took going back to what I was saying earlier about knowing

1263
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,820
the race, like knowing where to be knowing, uh,

1264
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:56,820
just the energy of this thing. He knew it and he spoke all these languages and I

1265
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,940
thought that would be good. I just called him and I said, what do you,

1266
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,980
what are you going to do now? Now that you're retiring.

1267
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:07,340
And he was actually either wanting to start or somebody asked him to,

1268
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,180
to be a part of a cycling union, which he would have been,

1269
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,820
that would have been a great use of his time. And I said, listen, you know,

1270
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:18,700
I got an idea. Like, why don't you come be the director?

1271
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:24,380
He was like, are you kidding me? No. And I said,

1272
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,180
because the travel, like it's basically, it's not retiring.

1273
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:32,860
I mean, that's just not what he thought he would be doing. Um,

1274
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,700
but I convinced him.

1275
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:41,860
So people, this is a topic that gets, it's such a controversial topic,

1276
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,340
but I just, I really want to understand this, right? People consistently say,

1277
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,340
look, yes, we know everybody doped during that era,

1278
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,860
but us postal was different because they did it at an industrial level.

1279
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:58,340
It was much more systemic. Um, so let's,

1280
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,820
let's kind of unpack what that means. So this,

1281
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:05,740
so you had already been working with Ferrari and I've,

1282
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:06,580
I've never met Ferrari.

1283
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,980
He's actually a guy I would always want to meet because I think despite how much

1284
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:13,700
he's been demonized, I just think he's probably a very smart physiologic wizard.

1285
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,780
He's incredibly smart.

1286
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:20,220
And um, like how much of your training was he actually guiding?

1287
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,340
All of it.

1288
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,660
So did Carmichael who gained fame being associated with you and being your

1289
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,780
coach, did he do anything?

1290
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:31,780
He not, not at that stage. He was, you know, as an amateur, I mean,

1291
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:36,500
he was the Olympic coach in 92 and, and, but, but, but once I went to, you know,

1292
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,700
start seeing Ferrari, you know, Chris was just a, um, you know,

1293
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,980
advisor friend. Uh, no,

1294
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,940
but we are talking about two very different skill sets here. Yeah.

1295
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,500
And I'm not talking about doping. I mean, just in term, I mean,

1296
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,580
Michaela for, you can say what you want and you,

1297
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:59,580
you and I calling him intelligent or bright or smart or even

1298
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,500
genius, you know, just drives people crazy. No, but I,

1299
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:06,700
but I've heard him in interviews talk about the nuanced level of

1300
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:11,020
physiology. I mean, he's, he's top three of all time.

1301
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,900
And so, so we're talking about two different types of, yeah. Um,

1302
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:22,180
so you said earlier, look, you had no aspiration of winning the tour, right?

1303
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:26,260
Did that change when you placed fourth in the course? Was that the first aha

1304
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,820
moment that says I could win this thing?

1305
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:31,820
Yep. And that, and, and when Yohan finally decided to come,

1306
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,940
you know, take, take me up on my offer, he said it, he said, you're gonna,

1307
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,500
he, he, and I'll never forget, he said, you are going to finish on the podium.

1308
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,260
In 99 and 99.

1309
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,180
I said, if you are crazy, there's no way,

1310
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,540
you didn't think so with your confidence.

1311
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:54,460
Nah, I mean, that's the, first of all, the Welter is not the tour. I understand,

1312
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:58,300
but so getting forward to the Welter, yeah, to me,

1313
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,060
that that sort of equates to maybe top 10,

1314
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:04,420
which by the way would have been a great result. Um,

1315
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,620
but he was a hundred percent sure. He said, you're gonna,

1316
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,100
at that point in time. So in 98,

1317
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,180
Pantani had won in 97. Ulrich had won.

1318
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:16,220
How much time had you spent riding alongside those two?

1319
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:21,220
Well, in the grand scheme, not much.

1320
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,740
So did you have a sense of how you'd stack up against them?

1321
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:25,620
Um,

1322
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:33,700
no, because I didn't, uh, uh, I mean,

1323
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,660
I had never been in a grand tour at my peak form, their peak form.

1324
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,740
I mean, I was, you know, just guessing.

1325
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:44,540
And I don't remember why were they not there in 99?

1326
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,420
Well, Pantani had the thing that the Giro got,

1327
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,100
yeah, that's right.

1328
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,260
The dramatic retest. And, and I want to say Jan,

1329
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:59,060
he also had, of course, you and I offline have talked a lot about, uh,

1330
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,860
Jan Ulrich, but I think he had another thing, right?

1331
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,100
Maybe you tested positive for him. Something happened. Like he just,

1332
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,700
he wasn't there.

1333
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,900
So you show up at 99 and the two best tour riders are not there.

1334
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,860
That's right. The previous two winners.

1335
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,980
The previous two winners. I,

1336
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:22,540
I still remember my couch where I sat and watched the prologue.

1337
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:23,780
Yup.

1338
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,420
That July day.

1339
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,020
And explain to people why the prologue matters. Like it's not a long stage.

1340
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,500
Let's get an eight and a half kilometer time.

1341
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,700
Yeah, but you can, what's the, what's the importance of it?

1342
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:38,980
Well, it's a, it's, it's first and foremost it, it, and,

1343
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:42,020
and they don't always do it anymore, which I completely disagree with.

1344
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,580
I think it's the baddest thing in the world. Of course.

1345
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,060
It's the only way to start a tour. It allows the rider, especially the,

1346
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:52,380
the, the GC guys to really test their condition, not just their own,

1347
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,980
but against the other guys. And you can, you know, if it's,

1348
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:58,940
you put 30 seconds in a climber, 30 seconds to 30 seconds.

1349
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,140
So it's, it's, uh, and that was a tough one. I mean, that was,

1350
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:08,300
that was a not, uh, it had a, uh, a serious climb sort of halfway through.

1351
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:12,940
It was enough that you could make some separation. So, um,

1352
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,020
but it it's, there's,

1353
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,380
there's certain things that the Twitter France should always have.

1354
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,020
It should always have a prologue. It should always have a team time trial.

1355
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,140
It shows. And they really gone away from that for some reason, but

1356
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:29,380
thankfully not then you win the prologue, win the prologue.

1357
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:33,820
Your first yellow Jersey. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1358
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:39,140
never even, I mean, it was just, uh, I mean, we,

1359
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:43,060
we thought we were in a dream. Now remind me in that tour,

1360
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,460
you were not using blood transfusions. It was all EPO. Right.

1361
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:50,900
And it was, you didn't micro dose. You were just giving straight regular doses.

1362
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,220
You didn't, this is before they had a test for EPO. Yep. Starting to, yeah.

1363
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,940
The only thing they had was the hematocrit test.

1364
01:24:57,140 --> 01:25:00,340
And do you remember where you kept your hematocrit at that tour? Was that,

1365
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,660
this is when you were having to stay at about 50. No, 50'd be too close.

1366
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:10,020
Cause you had to stay around 46, 47. Cause if you don't,

1367
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,380
you know this, I mean, you get dehydrated,

1368
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:16,460
hydrated and, and, and, or you, or you get sick or,

1369
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:20,580
and they show up like you're, you're done. I don't think,

1370
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:25,060
so something people don't realize is in 1996,

1371
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:29,860
Reese won the tour. So finally unseeds Induran.

1372
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,660
His hematocrit was somewhere between 60 and 66 during that race.

1373
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:38,100
That's what they say. I mean, we weren't, we weren't there with the spinner,

1374
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,220
but, um, yeah, the nickname, Mr. 60%. Yeah. His nickname is Mr. 60.

1375
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,340
So what changed so much? Was it Festina in 98?

1376
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,300
Basically brought the hammer down and said,

1377
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,300
we're done with these guys walking around with hematocrits in the sixties. Yep.

1378
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,620
So is it that much of a difference if you're walking,

1379
01:25:55,620 --> 01:26:00,620
if you're walking around him out of crit is 42 44 and you're racing 46 47 or is

1380
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,500
it cause this has always been my take on it.

1381
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:06,580
It's not so much how you're functioning on the beginning of the tour.

1382
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,140
It's that at the end of the tour, you could keep your hematocrit there when

1383
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:14,020
ordinarily it would really start to dwindle as you break down. Yeah.

1384
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:16,860
But when, when the test came around, then yeah, you,

1385
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,900
you just knew that you would, you would drop.

1386
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:25,460
But obviously ever, ever, you know, the, the, the GC guys at least found ways

1387
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,940
around that and that's where, you know, the transfusions came in and which is

1388
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,020
effectively the same thing. Yeah. Right. Um,

1389
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:36,820
was there anybody on the postal team that year that was not doing EPO?

1390
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,340
Not that I'm aware of. And how,

1391
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,740
how much were you guys co-mingling information?

1392
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:48,100
So you were seeing Ferrari, but I assume everyone was seeing it.

1393
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,940
No, a lot of them were, a lot of them were. Um,

1394
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:56,780
but the team also had trainers and doctors and had its own set up.

1395
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:01,180
Was that the year moto man was going around? Yeah, it was 99. It was 99. Yeah.

1396
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:05,540
I thought that was a great idea. It's uh, and do you think it's back on it?

1397
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:09,540
It's like, it's just like, well, it's a movie. I mean, it's fucking crazy.

1398
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:13,620
Like what? Oh God.

1399
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:15,900
Yeah. That was 99.

1400
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:20,820
I don't know if this is still the case, but I believe at the time you won in 99,

1401
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:23,060
you were the only person to not only win the tour,

1402
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:27,180
but when each of the three individual time trial time trials as well. Yep.

1403
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,940
Well, you had the prologue and two log and then we had long time trials.

1404
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:35,060
Yeah. 60 K at least. Right. 55. Yeah. Yeah.

1405
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:38,460
And so if you're the best and it's that long, you're going to win.

1406
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,740
You win that year, you win that.

1407
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,300
That's that long. You're going to win. You win that year. Do you think to yourself?

1408
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:50,900
You know, Ulrich wasn't here. Pantani wasn't here. Can I win this thing when they're

1409
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,940
both there? And not to mention, I mean, it, it, it, um,

1410
01:27:55,980 --> 01:28:00,300
you know, would that big crash, uh, early in the race, I mean,

1411
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,580
Zula lost seven minutes. I mean, Zula was close in the race.

1412
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:09,660
If you, if you, if you back out that accident or the huge crash,

1413
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:14,620
he was within about a minute, right? Yeah, it would have been close. And he was a,

1414
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:18,540
I mean Zula's, I mean, even if by saying Pantani and Ulrich aren't there,

1415
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:23,060
I mean, you still had Zula, Escartin, Olano, uh, I mean,

1416
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,180
you had, you know, I can't minimize those guys.

1417
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,860
What was the, we almost take it for granted now, but at the time,

1418
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:35,260
how much scrutiny was there over your performance that year? A lot. Yeah.

1419
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:40,460
That was the year of the cortisone. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It started.

1420
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,580
And it was the year after Festina. I mean,

1421
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:46,220
so this was could have won the tour and they were to, they would have questioned

1422
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,060
it. Yeah. So what,

1423
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:53,820
you know, prior to this, you've never really been on the hot seat, right?

1424
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,580
So you'd been using the drug, but nobody really cared because you weren't winning

1425
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:59,220
the race. So now you're winning the race. I wasn't in the crosshairs.

1426
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:04,420
So where do you think the posture came of this is how my denial is going to be?

1427
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:10,060
And, and what in retrospect, was there another way to deny,

1428
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,260
without attacking? Cause I gotta be honest with you.

1429
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:16,220
I don't really remember what the attack mode was like in 99 versus Oh five.

1430
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,180
Like that's a, there's a spectrum of attack.

1431
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,740
You would have to be in the, you'd had to be in the, in the press conferences,

1432
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:26,980
you know, that you'd have questions about the race and questions about whatever.

1433
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,740
And then somebody in the corner would holler one of the interested, you know,

1434
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:36,380
they were just asking a question felt like an attack at the time,

1435
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:39,020
felt like an attack on me. I said,

1436
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,580
I said, excuse me, what the fuck are you talking about?

1437
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,620
I mean, literally like that. Like just let's go.

1438
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:52,060
Um, you know, if I had your teammates say, did anybody pull you aside and say,

1439
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:55,420
Lance, you gotta back this down, man. No, no, but they wouldn't have done that.

1440
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:58,660
It would, there, there are others and man, you know, maybe you know,

1441
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:05,980
Johan. No, no, but Johan's a he, he, we are, we are like brothers.

1442
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:10,140
I mean, he would answer, he would do the same thing. You know,

1443
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:12,620
it might've been better. Somebody, you know,

1444
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,780
here locally where my whole operation was run out of to go, you know what?

1445
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:20,420
It feels like we may want to back this down a little bit. Just,

1446
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,220
just let it go. And

1447
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,220
how many other people in your life knew at the time,

1448
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,700
obviously your wife must have known.

1449
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,660
Oh, I think, yeah, I think, uh, uh,

1450
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,700
that's a good question. I mean, it wasn't something that I offered up,

1451
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:42,500
but I mean, did your mom know? Nope. Did she ever ask? Nope.

1452
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:49,340
And what did, what did your wife say? Um, very little.

1453
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:52,780
I mean, I think she just assumed, I mean, look, it was,

1454
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:58,220
it that level of the sport and that level of, of doping,

1455
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,660
you, you cannot keep that. If you live with a person,

1456
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:03,340
that is not going to be a secret.

1457
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:07,860
But did she ever say something like Lance, is this worth it? You know,

1458
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:11,460
like if you're playing the long game, I've never had this conversation with her,

1459
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,420
but, um, I, I, and this is my point is that if you have

1460
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:20,580
no ability to keep this a secret from your spouse or whoever you're living with,

1461
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:25,500
um, we're in Europe. There's, I have my teammates,

1462
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:28,140
they have the wives clubs. I think, I think the wives,

1463
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,260
the conversation was like, this is just part of the job.

1464
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,500
Cause they certainly all knew.

1465
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:38,780
So in 2000, you come back. I want to ask you about Vantu.

1466
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:42,780
What was going on between you and Pentani there? Were you guys talking?

1467
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:46,500
What was, I was trying to tell him that he, yeah, I thought I was going to give

1468
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,380
him the win, which is one of the biggest regrets in my career. Why?

1469
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:55,140
Because you don't, uh, and it's, you know, not on the Vantu. And that's why,

1470
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:58,500
I mean, Merck's called me when I was on the car ride down, he said,

1471
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,380
you don't ever gift the Vantu ever.

1472
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,620
Why did you want to gift it to him?

1473
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,700
I was just, I mean, I was going to win the tour.

1474
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,620
I knew I was going to win the tour. I was just, you know,

1475
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:13,460
I was actually trying to be gracious and be sort of the,

1476
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,020
the Patron of the Peloton. Like, look, you know,

1477
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:18,940
I don't need to win everything here. You go win the Vantu and you go.

1478
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:24,260
And, but in hindsight, God, and may he rest in peace.

1479
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:26,620
I mean, I'm just not, I'm not talking about Pantani.

1480
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:31,420
I'm just talking about, um, I'm talking about the Vantu, right?

1481
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:34,220
Which is just, you just don't give that one away.

1482
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,820
And Merck's called you on the car ride down. Don't ever, you never,

1483
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:42,420
it's a huge mistake. You never gift the Vantu.

1484
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,380
Is Merck's the greatest cyclist of all time? Of course.

1485
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,100
If Merck's, different sport, different sport, different sport, but

1486
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:57,980
if Merck's were riding today with the sport being so much more specialized,

1487
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:02,700
where would he choose to focus his energy? Would he be on the grand tours? Yeah,

1488
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:07,420
for sure. Yeah. Very different sport now though. I mean,

1489
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:12,020
Half Man Half Bike is a biography of Merck's that I love. And you,

1490
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,700
you gave me one of the most amazing gifts ever,

1491
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:19,340
which is that book that's on my coffee table. I was psyched. I saw it.

1492
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:22,300
And I was like, oh, Peter has one of those too. And I was like, wait,

1493
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:26,020
you dumb ass, you, you gave it to him. Yeah, that's a cool book. It's,

1494
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,460
it's unbelievable. Um,

1495
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:31,540
I would recommend anybody who's interested in cycling reading Half Man Half Bike

1496
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:35,900
because you can't really understand what he did. Like,

1497
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:39,020
what does it mean to win five geros, five tours,

1498
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,980
every single day classic, the one hour record,

1499
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:46,060
like it just doesn't make any sense. And to, and yeah.

1500
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:50,500
So, um, now in that, who was, um,

1501
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:54,860
who was second that year? Was that Poloki was he, or was that Ulrich that year?

1502
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:57,900
No, in 2000, Jan, Jan got second, I believe.

1503
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:03,180
Is that when you guys began, you've said before that of all the guys you've ever

1504
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,300
raced, you've never respected anyone more than Jan.

1505
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,980
Obviously we're going to talk about Jan a little later.

1506
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:11,940
Your, your respect and your love for Jan post-cycling is he's a brother to you.

1507
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,180
Did it begin in that tour in 2000?

1508
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:20,020
It was more intense. I mean, he was, I didn't, you know, uh,

1509
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:25,220
I viewed him as a real enemy and a rival and, and fuck this guy. And I'm like,

1510
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,900
you know, but, and when I say, I mean,

1511
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:33,220
when I talk about Jan and what he, uh, drove in me was just,

1512
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:35,580
I had, um,

1513
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,980
I was fully convinced that he was the most talented,

1514
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:42,660
that he was the biggest fear that like, if,

1515
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,940
if anything, every morning got you up and it's pissing rain outside and you had

1516
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:49,300
five hours on the schedule, like you better get out there.

1517
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:53,380
It was Jan Orogtikami. None of these other guys, they're all good.

1518
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:56,700
They're all, I'm sure nice guys, but none of them inspired me like him.

1519
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,580
Yeah. You probably didn't know it at the time,

1520
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:03,700
but how much you guys had in common, right? In terms of your upbringing.

1521
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,180
Yeah. Yeah. Jan's had a complicated upbringing.

1522
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:11,540
What's your biggest memory from 01 and 02?

1523
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:16,540
Which was the year you began having suffered a broken collarbone, um, in,

1524
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,620
um, didn't you, didn't you fall in break?

1525
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:23,140
No, in Dolphini that was to 03. So going into 03,

1526
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:27,940
01 was, you know, 01 was probably physically my best tour. I mean, 01,

1527
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:32,180
it was, you know, that's, everybody refers to it as the look and, and, you know,

1528
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:36,500
what was your, um, what was your time or what was your wattage up Madone in 01?

1529
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,260
All those years were 500 Watts.

1530
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:42,300
500 Watts for 30 minutes.

1531
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,340
Yeah. And loving it.

1532
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:49,100
And what do you think your wattage would have been without EPO?

1533
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:52,100
Oh, it would have been 450. It's telling you it is 10%.

1534
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:55,300
You think it's a full 10%? Yeah. Yeah. 10%.

1535
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,260
Seven Watts per kilo.

1536
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,500
450 is still pretty good by the way.

1537
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:03,820
Yeah. I mean, look, Bradley Wiggins probably put out 450,

1538
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:09,020
440 to 450 during his one hour record, which that's more important. That's flat.

1539
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,980
Yeah. And you're kinked. Yeah.

1540
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,220
So it's really hard because you're bent over. Um,

1541
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,860
the look, yeah. How deliberate was that?

1542
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,300
I wasn't looking at young. What were you looking at?

1543
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,380
I was looking, I knew I was about to send it.

1544
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:30,300
And I thought, man, I feel good,

1545
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,980
but if this doesn't work, I'm going to need somebody to bail me out.

1546
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:38,020
So I'm going to need a teammate and Chechu was the last guy with me.

1547
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:42,060
And so I was looking back just to make sure that Chechu,

1548
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,500
and it was just the angle of the photo,

1549
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:46,420
but I was looking back to make sure that he was,

1550
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,340
that he was going to come with you. Well, that he was close. Yeah.

1551
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:53,580
That I could still, it still had him in sight. And so,

1552
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,780
but just the way the photo was captured,

1553
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:59,300
it looked like I was looking directly at Jan, which I wasn't.

1554
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,740
Um, oh three,

1555
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:06,180
you've got to be a little worried going into that, right? Cause you're,

1556
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,300
you're pretty depleted on red blood cells. Aren't you?

1557
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,420
Oh three was,

1558
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:12,660
that's when I had a pretty big crash in the dolphin right before.

1559
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,740
Huge crash actually.

1560
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:18,860
And that's when you couldn't just give yourself EPO willy nilly. Um,

1561
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:23,380
I think by then we had an EPO test, right? Yeah, but not, I mean,

1562
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,940
out of competition. You could,

1563
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:29,740
yes. But I think what was your himatic rate at the beginning of O three?

1564
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:32,380
Didn't you come in at like a 42 or something? 38.

1565
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:38,820
The start. So you came in, 38, 38.

1566
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:44,140
How many bags do we didn't do just, just, just so you know. And so we're clear.

1567
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:47,100
We didn't do after 99, we never did equal on the tour.

1568
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:51,180
NC. You mean you did it out of season. I mean, you did it out of competition.

1569
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:53,820
Still. And then just, and then we, then, you know,

1570
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,220
Ferrari had to switch to transfusion. Oh, I didn't realize that.

1571
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:00,460
I thought that happened in O two. So you're saying by from 2000 on,

1572
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:03,540
it was two bags during the race. No, 2000.

1573
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:06,700
First year was 2000. We did one bag, one bag at what stage?

1574
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:10,620
So that halfway through. So that first day at Hautacom were,

1575
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:15,540
that was with nothing. That was before the bag.

1576
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:19,820
How are they not catching the jump in himatic rate that comes?

1577
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,740
I don't know. You were not worried about, Hey, one day,

1578
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:27,100
my himatic rates 41 and the next day it's 47.

1579
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,500
Right. Yeah. Um,

1580
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:35,220
how close were you to understanding the UCI's algorithm for testing? I mean,

1581
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:37,380
at this point you're becoming, I mean,

1582
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,940
one of the things that people have always said is, Hey,

1583
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,820
Lance had the UCI in his pocket. But

1584
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:48,020
yeah, that's not, listen, we can go down all these rabbit holes,

1585
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:51,740
all the stuff that's, I mean, and I'm not, uh, uh,

1586
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:56,020
I'm sort of done with that part of my life where I have to contest every,

1587
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:59,660
it's like, but in, in its totality, if I, if,

1588
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:03,180
if we just put them all on a whiteboard and said they said this and this,

1589
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:06,260
and I mean, you cannot believe, and I'm not, and I,

1590
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:10,220
this is where I just don't need to go one by one.

1591
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:14,180
But if you look at it in total, you cannot believe how much bullshit was out

1592
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:18,900
there. I mean, yes, the, the, the pillars are true,

1593
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,900
but most of it is just total

1594
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:26,340
bullshit. I mean, I think the point is,

1595
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:28,780
by the way, it's turning a blind eye.

1596
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:31,060
By the way, Peter, a month ago,

1597
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:36,660
they had a 30 minute program on French TV convincing

1598
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:41,420
themselves that they had figured out that I had an engine in

1599
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,540
my bike and that they figured out this is, I'm not kidding.

1600
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:50,580
They figured out where the switch was. Are you joking?

1601
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:55,340
I'm not joking. I'm, I am dead serious. I'm like, what are you people,

1602
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:58,820
what are you doing? Like, and I don't know if you ever noticed this,

1603
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:02,260
but I would always sort of grab my chamois.

1604
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:05,660
Okay. Like I would always like kind of adjust it, adjust my chamois.

1605
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,180
I had this whole theory that, you know, the,

1606
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:12,260
that the ass and the chamois and the seat have to line up. That's peak power.

1607
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:16,660
Like it's perfect, perfect balance and all this shit. And so I would always,

1608
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:20,380
and I am, this is a network television.

1609
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:22,100
This was the, this, there's the switch.

1610
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,140
The switch was in the shorts. Of course. I mean, this is,

1611
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:28,700
but this is a really dumb example, although it's a true story that they,

1612
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:32,980
that they aired this. Um, but most of it just, I'm just like,

1613
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:37,420
and fortunately I've gotten myself to a point in life where it's like,

1614
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:42,380
so going into that last time trial in oh three,

1615
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:46,740
you and Jan were really close. Well, yeah. I mean, it was,

1616
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:50,260
you were not that far ahead of him, right? You were inside a minute, maybe.

1617
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:54,020
Yeah, inside a minute. Talk to me about that time truck. I've heard you talk

1618
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:57,340
about it less, but that wasn't the, the, the, the,

1619
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,660
the fear or the stress around it was not so much. No, it was the checkpoint,

1620
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:05,900
right? It was, he gained, how much did he take out of you? Well, but the bigger,

1621
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:09,300
the bigger stressor was how much he took out of me in the first time trial.

1622
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:13,100
I think he took two minutes out of me. So you're going, you're thinking, okay,

1623
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:18,460
you got 45 seconds. What stage was that? That was, uh, the first one. Yeah.

1624
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:20,900
I don't know. It was early. Captain Kuvera too. Right.

1625
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,340
So that's when you're himatic rates 38. Yeah. So you're, you're, you're, you're,

1626
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:26,340
you're going, well, you're got 45 second lead.

1627
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,940
He took two minutes out of you in the first, I mean, everybody said it's over.

1628
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:32,060
He's gonna, he's gonna catch him. I remember that like it was yesterday.

1629
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:36,220
And he put rain, he put six seconds on me in the first kilometer.

1630
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:40,940
How many K was the time trial? Long 50, 50 ish.

1631
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:43,940
So what went through your mind at that point? Yoan didn't tell me that.

1632
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:47,780
He didn't tell you how much, okay. Six seconds in one kilometer.

1633
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,460
Unbelievable. If I can get off the bike. Yeah. Like I'm done.

1634
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:54,180
He made you feel you were redlined. Oh yeah, that's terrible.

1635
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:58,500
And were you using your power meter at that point or mostly heart rate?

1636
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:04,300
But most of the, we didn't race with power meters train, you know,

1637
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:08,300
a hundred percent of the time with them, but not in the races. So it wasn't just

1638
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:12,180
heart rate. Yeah. Um, when did they tell you that he fell?

1639
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:17,740
Right away. I mean, Yoan's watching the race on TV in the car as he's driving.

1640
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:22,780
Um, yeah, right away. And then I knew,

1641
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:30,180
and it was over. The other thing about O three was, uh, was below key, right?

1642
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:35,660
Below key. I still don't, I still don't understand how you avoided that.

1643
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:39,580
Well, of all the things that ever happened to me in the tour,

1644
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,500
I get asked about that. I mean, it's, it's not even close. I mean, that,

1645
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,900
that the ride through the field, that's the one,

1646
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:50,220
I think every, even people that don't follow it, like, man,

1647
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:53,980
I remember that one time I keep fucking road across that field. I was like, yeah,

1648
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:58,700
I do remember, but you know, incredibly lucky. I mean,

1649
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:03,460
he very unlucky for, uh, Joseva, but, um, you know,

1650
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:08,580
if you go back and rewatch and it's of course there's a hundred versions of it

1651
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:13,260
on YouTube, but if you go back and rewatch exactly what happened, right?

1652
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:17,460
So he's leading flying downhill. It's a hundred degree day. It's a, you know,

1653
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:21,740
these, these bad roads with the, they would, you know,

1654
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:26,700
patch the whatever with tar. The tar was literally boiling and he just, you know,

1655
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,300
his tire caught some hot tar and just,

1656
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:34,180
he just high sided him and ruined his career and did his career. And I had,

1657
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:38,660
I mean, I had a choice. I said, I either lay this thing down, right?

1658
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,660
Or go left. How many miles an hour were you going? Oh,

1659
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,700
we were going 40 miles an hour.

1660
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:50,100
And I said, I'm going to go left. Well now, you know, keep in mind,

1661
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,100
the, the, the story ends with me not just riding through the field,

1662
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:56,740
but having to get off my bike and jump down on the road. Well,

1663
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:59,580
that whole field was, you can go back and watch it on YouTube.

1664
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:03,100
So there are massive ditches all this,

1665
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:07,900
the split second that I said, I'm going left. There was a path.

1666
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,620
What are the chances there was a path into the field where the farmer,

1667
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:15,660
would go in and out with his tractor? What are the chances? I mean,

1668
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:20,740
five feet to the right, five feet to the left at 40 miles an hour is like that.

1669
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:25,620
Yeah. And I go straight into the side of the ditch.

1670
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:29,780
So I mean, what are the chances that that path is there?

1671
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:35,260
And I get in this field and it just is dry. I don't know.

1672
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:39,860
I'm no farmer, but it was like dry crop, sharp. And I get,

1673
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:42,260
I was like, I was like, man, this shit is sharp. Like,

1674
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:47,300
I better not get a flat. And I'm just like looking down and going, come on, man.

1675
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:51,980
And I got to the other side and I could see that it was way down. I was like,

1676
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,980
I was like, I better get off this thing. And just,

1677
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:58,540
I was just, what are the chances?

1678
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:00,940
Well, the other one that you must get asked about a lot,

1679
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:03,380
and I don't remember which year it was, was when your handlebar got caught.

1680
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:07,820
Same year. Was that also 03? Yeah. Comedy of errors. I know.

1681
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:09,740
And by that point,

1682
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:13,100
clearly you and Jan had established an amazing respect because that's when he

1683
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:18,580
waited. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Jan is,

1684
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,700
you listen, Jan is a, he's a total gentleman.

1685
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:26,020
So yeah, that was, yeah. I hit the,

1686
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:31,140
you know, hit the guy, I hit the kids bag

1687
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:37,460
and just straight down bike was broken, which we didn't know at the time,

1688
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:39,900
but that's the whole

1689
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:45,100
chain stay was snapped. But yeah, Jan waited up.

1690
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:51,060
So let's fast forward to the end of 05, right? You've won seven. You,

1691
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:54,020
at the time said, look, I want to spend more time on the foundation.

1692
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,140
I want to spend more time with the family.

1693
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:58,940
I assume those were the real reasons you wanted to retire. I think that's right.

1694
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:01,980
Yeah. I mean, when you came back,

1695
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:07,980
the, was it LeBlanc wrote an open letter basically telling you not to, right?

1696
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:13,460
What was that about? He, uh, you know,

1697
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:18,340
um, Jean-Marie LeBlanc was, was an icon. I mean, he was, he was the,

1698
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:23,900
the, you know, the director, director general of the tour, all of the,

1699
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:27,540
you know, he was, I think, and, and,

1700
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:30,980
and he'll go down as being viewed as one of the greatest directors.

1701
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:36,580
Um, ever. And, and a very, very tough guy, you know,

1702
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:41,300
it was his way or the highway and you just, you just didn't cross Jean-Marie.

1703
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:47,060
And, and, but the sport had started to, uh, you know, I retire,

1704
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,300
Landis wins, Landis test positive.

1705
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:54,300
So it was a Festina esque moment in time and cycling and,

1706
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:58,620
and yet another shift to like guys looking around and going, wait a minute.

1707
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:03,420
All right. We might be extinct here if we don't fucking clean this up.

1708
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:08,860
And so the sport was, was shifting to a better place.

1709
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:13,740
Yeah. And Jan's, uh, Jean-Marie's point was, um, look,

1710
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:17,060
you, you are a bridge to the past, right?

1711
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:19,540
So the sport has evolved.

1712
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:24,420
You are part of the old culture and it's not good for this.

1713
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:27,380
And you know what? He's exactly right.

1714
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:31,060
So I remember, uh,

1715
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:34,500
I remember when he wrote it and I think they printed it and, uh,

1716
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,980
it was too big political papers or Le Monde de la Figaro.

1717
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:42,260
I think it was in a Figaro. And I just thought,

1718
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:47,260
and it was interesting cause I was in,

1719
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:51,380
I was in West Texas with Anna on a Marfa, one of my favorite places.

1720
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,300
And, uh,

1721
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:54,580
where you just went recently.

1722
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:57,020
Yep. And we had just gotten together.

1723
01:47:57,100 --> 01:48:00,860
She had just gotten, or she just got pregnant. We'd, you know, but she didn't,

1724
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:02,980
she wasn't with me when I raised before.

1725
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:07,100
And we were out there and we went to this car. This is so crazy.

1726
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:10,660
We were in Fort Davis outside of Marfa and went to this, uh, lunch spot.

1727
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:15,500
And I said, this is a mistake coming back. Yep. I said, I can't,

1728
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,220
I shouldn't do this. By the way,

1729
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:21,540
did Le Bonc actually call you as well to follow up? Not that I remember.

1730
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:24,060
Do you think he would have been more persuasive? No.

1731
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:26,740
So why did you, why did you do it?

1732
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:31,300
Well, it was, uh, you know, I mean it,

1733
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,300
it, the wheels were in motion. Like it was all,

1734
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:38,220
I felt a ton of, um,

1735
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,820
responsibility or, you know, to the foundation. Yeah. All of it. I mean,

1736
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:46,100
all the, all the sponsors were excited. The foundation was excited. The,

1737
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:51,100
that, that, that, and, you know, it would have been so easy to,

1738
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:56,140
and it felt like quitting. Like you can call me a lot of things.

1739
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:01,860
You cannot call me a quitter. I don't quit at anything. And, and,

1740
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:03,580
but it would have been easy to say, you know,

1741
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:08,220
the routine, he chatted on some bullshit and just got out and you would have been

1742
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:12,380
three days of press where it's like, Oh, what happened?

1743
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:15,700
And your view at that point is the sports clean. So yeah,

1744
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:19,540
there's no risk to me because I don't need to use anything because no one else

1745
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:24,580
is using anything. Was that kind of your view? Um, that, that was,

1746
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:28,300
uh, the best I could tell. Yeah. I mean, I knew I wasn't that.

1747
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:33,300
So that sort of phase two or phase, whatever the comeback years was clean.

1748
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:39,300
Absolutely. And ironically Ferrari was the one who was adamant.

1749
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:44,220
He's like, they are coming for you. And so he was, you know,

1750
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:45,580
we just didn't cross the line.

1751
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:50,820
So Oh nine is kind of close, right? Your third and then 10,

1752
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,380
it wasn't close. I mean, it wasn't even, it wasn't close at all,

1753
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:57,420
but third is, I mean, meaning you're on the podium. Yeah. Yeah.

1754
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:02,620
I remember reading an article in the fall of 2009 and I think it was like an ESPN

1755
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:07,620
magazine that was comparing your Oh nine tour to Jordan's come back.

1756
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:13,060
His second comeback, the year they didn't win, right?

1757
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:18,060
Cause remember he came back for the last part of the season in 95 and then

1758
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,820
they're like, well wait till you see Lance in 10,

1759
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,220
cause that's going to be the, like,

1760
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:26,420
that's going to be Jordan's 96 or whatever it was when they went. Um,

1761
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:30,300
so what did you think after 2009, do you ever think, you know what,

1762
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:35,020
I gave this a great go. It would be totally respectable to just retire right now.

1763
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:38,780
You know, to be off the sport for three years, four years, come back,

1764
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,420
be on the podium. Now I can retire. What made you come back in?

1765
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:45,100
What made you stay back, especially when it meant building a new team? Yeah.

1766
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,020
Well that was a, that was a big part of it. I mean,

1767
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:51,820
being able to not be on a team from Kazakhstan, literally team Borat.

1768
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:56,180
Yeah. And, and build a whole new team. I mean, that was,

1769
01:50:56,300 --> 01:51:00,260
but at this point, Lance, you're 30. Yeah. I'm old.

1770
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:04,940
I mean, I was old in your 30s. That was 34 years old when I won.

1771
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:09,060
Yeah. Like wasn't it getting a bit old in terms of training? But again,

1772
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:13,660
this machine was, was rolling. Like I wasn't going to be the guy to say,

1773
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,900
I'm getting off the wave here. Like I just,

1774
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,460
but what part of the machine at this point,

1775
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,540
because from a personal wealth standpoint at that point, you,

1776
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,780
you're going to get those sponsors even if you're not riding, aren't you?

1777
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:29,660
I don't know. I mean, it, it, it seems it's like how much of this,

1778
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:32,820
what I'm trying to get at is how much of this was filling a void that said,

1779
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:37,420
I don't like sitting around and not being an athlete. Right. But, but that's,

1780
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:41,340
that's not the point. The point is, I mean, every day of that comeback,

1781
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:44,540
I was like, what the fuck am I doing? Like it wasn't, I had,

1782
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,900
I had, and I had this conversation the other night. I was like,

1783
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:50,580
some, somebody asked or came up and I was like, God, it's like,

1784
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:52,340
I'm never in my life.

1785
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:55,100
I am never going back to that place where you're looking around going,

1786
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:57,580
what are you doing? Like, what are you doing?

1787
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,940
You're not going to win the tour and you're not like,

1788
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:04,300
what the fuck are you doing? And then as of course, as it led, you know,

1789
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:08,180
down all the investigations started and you're trying to do both,

1790
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:11,900
you're trying to defend your reputation, defend your livelihood,

1791
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:15,740
defend everything and having to do one of the hardest sports in the world.

1792
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:18,660
It was, I was just like, get me out of here.

1793
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:26,060
When did you realize that you had to tell the truth?

1794
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:31,220
Um, I think when I knew that, that they,

1795
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:35,500
they either interviewed George or George went to the grand jury.

1796
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:38,660
I knew that was so fall of 12, basically.

1797
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:46,620
It might've been earlier. Yeah. You know, it's funny. I,

1798
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,500
this is going to sound incredibly naive.

1799
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:54,340
I actually believed you guys were not on PEDs at the time.

1800
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:59,900
So my view was either you all are or you are not right. Like, you know,

1801
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:03,820
meaning the GC contenders, I don't necessarily mean everybody in the race,

1802
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:07,180
but my view was either all the GC contenders are or they are not.

1803
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:12,180
And I truly believed that post 98 that you guys were off.

1804
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:16,140
Right. Um, well you were wrong. I was absolutely wrong,

1805
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:19,940
but the moment I realized how wrong I was was not with Landis.

1806
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,340
It was actually with Tyler.

1807
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:26,460
Landis didn't come across as very believable. Tyler did.

1808
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:30,340
And so when did I'm trying, I've lost track of time,

1809
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:33,380
but Tyler's book that he wrote with Dan Coyle,

1810
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:35,940
did that come out in like 2011? Does that sound about right?

1811
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:41,260
I feel it's something, yeah, maybe 2010. Yeah. Yeah.

1812
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:44,580
It was when I read Tyler's book that I was like,

1813
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:47,620
this guy's way too freaking believable. Um,

1814
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:51,340
and if he's saying this and he's saying that this is what they were all doing,

1815
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:55,860
like I believe it now. Um, and then it was kind of a question.

1816
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:58,580
He had a different version in his deposition in the postal case, but,

1817
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:02,740
Oh, see, I don't, I don't know what his deposition said. Yeah. I mean, it was,

1818
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:06,660
it was, you know, when anybody's deposed and they've written a book, I mean,

1819
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:09,860
that they're just going to read you the book and go, did you say this?

1820
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:13,900
And did, is this true? Just read, they go page by page. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure.

1821
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:16,940
And, uh, you know, some of it was,

1822
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:23,300
he agreed. He said, he said, but then if he did, if it was in any way,

1823
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:26,100
sort of contradictory towards him or his,

1824
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:29,780
somebody cared about, and then he would blame Dan. I will never forget.

1825
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,740
Oh, that's right. Because you have to co-author. Yeah.

1826
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:34,220
He said that's a Danism. I was like, wait a minute.

1827
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,540
Anyways. So it's late. Yeah. It's late 11 or whatever.

1828
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:43,580
And you're basically like, I gotta come clean. Uh, yeah. 12, 11, 12.

1829
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:45,940
Or 12, 12. Yeah. Um,

1830
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:49,460
you've talked about your reasons for doing the interview with Oprah,

1831
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:52,180
which I think make a lot of sense, right?

1832
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:54,300
Which is if you're going to give a deposition, you might as well do it on your

1833
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,980
terms. Right. Yeah.

1834
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,940
And even that, I mean, looking back,

1835
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:05,860
well, you can look back all you want. Right. I did what I did.

1836
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:09,700
I was convinced that it was the right thing to do. The lawyers hated it. Um,

1837
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:13,420
you know, whether it was Oprah or, or,

1838
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:17,380
or Tom Brokaw, who was my other option,

1839
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:22,060
it wasn't gonna, wasn't gonna help.

1840
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:27,820
What was that period like when you went to think you went to Hawaii right after?

1841
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:31,700
Right. I went to, we still traveled a lot, um,

1842
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:33,940
just to kind of get away and.

1843
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:39,820
Did any of the sponsors call you to quietly thank you for what you had done

1844
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:43,620
over the past 15 years? No, I know they can't publicly, but did, you know,

1845
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:46,660
someone at Trek say, Hey, Lance, I hope you understand.

1846
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,380
We've got to dump you like a hot potato,

1847
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:51,540
but you did turn us into a billion dollar company. No.

1848
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:56,540
No, none of that. No sponsor in any one of your relationships ever thanked you

1849
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:00,900
for the, for what you'd done. Um, no.

1850
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:06,900
I mean, I mean, I think there is a, uh, a general, I mean, ironically,

1851
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:11,340
I mean, use tracks as an example. So the answer is no.

1852
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:16,620
But if you asked Mike Senniard from specialized, he would say, thank you.

1853
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,860
Cause you, you raise the time. All the ships rose.

1854
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:26,580
Um, Luke was obviously old enough to know what was going on with the twins.

1855
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:32,060
They were, yeah, they were, yeah. I mean, they were young, but they were,

1856
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:36,820
yeah. So what was the discussion like with them?

1857
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:42,740
Um, you know, I, I just took a, uh,

1858
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:48,540
my conversation was, I know, um,

1859
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:52,460
basically just an open door policy. If you ever, if it's certainly,

1860
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:53,580
if anything comes up at school,

1861
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:57,340
but if you ever have any questions about my life and the decisions I've made and

1862
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:01,620
are you hear something like the, we're not going to have one conversation about

1863
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:06,020
this. We're going to have as many as you want to have. Like it is just totally

1864
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:09,020
open door. And what have they asked you about?

1865
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:13,500
Not very much. Yeah. I mean,

1866
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:17,740
but they also, they're like, what are they going to ask? Like, uh,

1867
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:20,300
they're going to ask questions like you're asking,

1868
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:24,380
cause you'd know the sport so well and you're, you're, you know, the,

1869
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:29,180
the good, the bad, the ugly, right? They, they, they, you know,

1870
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:34,820
and, and, and I feel like, um, we stayed all of us and,

1871
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:40,300
and, you know, certainly, um, a lot of credit to Kristen as well.

1872
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:44,540
I mean, we've stayed very close as a family. When I say family, I mean, you know,

1873
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:49,900
myself, my kids, Anna and Kristen, and now Anna and I as kids,

1874
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:54,620
like it's, it is, if you can imagine that Brady Bunch set up,

1875
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,340
we are a very close family.

1876
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:02,540
So after the Oprah interview, which I guess is early 2013,

1877
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:06,220
who was the first person you reached out to apologize to?

1878
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:13,100
Well, there was some, well, I mean, I, actually before the interview was,

1879
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:16,500
you know, I reached out cause I knew that it would, it would, you know,

1880
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:21,500
they would see it, you know, so the Andreas Lamon and Kathy and Greg wouldn't,

1881
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:27,300
wouldn't take my call. Have they to this day? We did meet up,

1882
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:33,220
met with Greg and Kathy. Yep. How long ago? Oh God, it's been years.

1883
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:35,460
How did that, how was that meeting?

1884
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:40,660
I thought the meeting went, um,

1885
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:46,500
uh, I went better than I thought it would, would, uh, would go there.

1886
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:48,660
Their version of the, of the media. I mean, it's,

1887
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:54,100
we don't have enough time in this data. It was, you know,

1888
01:58:55,580 --> 01:58:58,820
I was sincere. I said, but I, I, I felt like I needed to say,

1889
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:02,220
they accepted the apology, but

1890
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:07,580
what about Emma? Emma, Emma,

1891
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:12,580
Emma and I met up in Florida. Emma's great, man.

1892
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,500
She's, you know, Emma's,

1893
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:18,540
Emma's mission all along was not to get me,

1894
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:22,020
her mission was to try to fix, to talk about the sport, fix the sport.

1895
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:26,300
Maybe not everybody listening knows who Emma is. Emma was our Swan year,

1896
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:30,060
was my Swan year 99, um,

1897
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:34,980
and left the team and, and, uh, you know, you know,

1898
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:37,940
was a person that I went after. Um,

1899
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:42,020
and she got mixed up in this because of the LA confidential book.

1900
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:45,220
She was quoted in it. As you said,

1901
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:48,380
it ended up being really about you, but the only reason I,

1902
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:52,300
my understanding is the reason she agreed to talk with David Walsh was really to

1903
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:54,780
make a broader statement about how corrupt the sport was.

1904
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:58,380
Yeah. And I tell you, we've, that's, that's, uh,

1905
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:03,340
I've enjoyed sort of reforming that friendship and

1906
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:08,420
I wrote the forward for her book and, uh, she's, she's a,

1907
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:09,420
she's a cool lady.

1908
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:16,100
What about any of your former teammates? Have you reconnected with Tyler?

1909
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,220
I know you have strong feelings about Floyd.

1910
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:26,180
No, no, I mean, it's, those are the two names that stick out.

1911
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:28,980
The reality is, uh,

1912
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:33,700
95% of that former, what was known as the blue train,

1913
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:37,340
we'd still all go. I mean, we'd go all jump back into war together.

1914
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:42,380
Like we fucking we're like, like brothers, um, Floyd and Tyler,

1915
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:46,060
they, they, they were never, they were never our brothers. Um,

1916
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:50,020
and so yeah, there won't be any, won't be any future,

1917
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,860
uh, dinners.

1918
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:54,140
You know, I remember a while ago,

1919
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:58,580
your Twitter bio was different than it is now. Do you remember what it used to say?

1920
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:01,100
No, what it's, I don't even know what it says now.

1921
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:05,260
Today it says like, I don't know, something boring, like everybody else's,

1922
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:07,460
but it used to say, um,

1923
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,860
there's a reason the, uh, the windshield's bigger than the rear view.

1924
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:17,260
Yeah. Um, I'll tell you, I've always found that,

1925
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:20,260
I don't know who that quote is attributed to. I'm sure it,

1926
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:22,540
I'm sure it appears in many formats,

1927
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:27,500
but I always found it to be very poignant because it's not saying you should

1928
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:30,860
only have a windshield and no rear view mirror. Right. Right.

1929
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:34,340
And it's not saying you should have no windshield and only a rear view mirror.

1930
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:37,100
It's saying you need both, but one's bigger than the other. Yeah.

1931
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:40,460
But in my own life, I've always felt like I have to have a rear view mirror.

1932
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:44,140
Yeah. Like I, I never want to lose sight of my sins. Right.

1933
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,700
Cause they kind of ground me. Of course. Um,

1934
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:50,740
when I think of all of the, again, you've lived, you've,

1935
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:55,260
you've had the both the luxury and the inconvenience

1936
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:58,940
of living all of your sins on the world's most public stage.

1937
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:03,020
So most of us make all of our mistakes behind closed doors and nobody really

1938
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:05,380
gets to see the horrible things we've done.

1939
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:11,140
I remember when I hit the one year anniversary of doing something so awful,

1940
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:12,980
I couldn't stand my existence for it.

1941
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:16,140
And I remember talking to my therapist about it and she said,

1942
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:20,900
I actually don't want you to ever forget this. Like I want you to remember what

1943
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:22,820
you did because this is,

1944
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:25,740
you have to remember that the monster that did that thing,

1945
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:30,820
he's never going to die. He'll sit in the corner. He'll be small,

1946
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:34,460
but he's never going to die. If you have the tools in place to keep him in the

1947
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:37,740
corner. Right. Are there moments that you look back at,

1948
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:42,740
like you look at that SCA deposition in October of a Oh five and think like,

1949
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:48,220
I need that video playing over and over again, just quietly.

1950
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:51,380
Yeah. It's totally embarrassing. I mean, a lot of that shit.

1951
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:55,660
And I was forced to rewatch a ton of that. Not, not, not,

1952
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:59,380
cause I wanted to, or I thought it would be a good idea, but I mean,

1953
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:02,260
in legal settings and depositions and trials and like,

1954
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:04,940
they just hammer you with this, but it's yeah,

1955
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:09,300
you look at that and you're like, that is, that is a pathetic person. Like that,

1956
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:13,060
I ain't never going back there. And, um,

1957
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:17,980
I mean those sort of things is unfortunate and as embarrassing and as tough as

1958
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:20,460
they are to watch. Actually for me, they're,

1959
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:24,820
those are, those are good. I mean, I don't want to do it every day,

1960
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:29,180
but it's like that guy needed to die. Right.

1961
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:33,740
And then, and a new guy needed to come around and, um,

1962
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:38,820
yeah, that's where you get stuck. You know, you say, uh,

1963
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:43,420
wouldn't change a thing and all these things that, that I would,

1964
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:46,500
I would say that would, yeah, actually, I mean, you would change things, right?

1965
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:47,420
I mean, you wouldn't,

1966
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:50,700
I mean, I love the spot that I've been able to get to.

1967
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:52,340
So you sort of think in your mind like, well,

1968
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:57,140
these were all events that shaped the person sitting here today, but

1969
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:00,700
there would have been a better way to go about it.

1970
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:07,260
Yeah, it's funny. I was watching a video of an interview you did a while ago and

1971
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:10,340
I normally don't read comments on YouTube because they're so incredibly

1972
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:14,340
uninteresting and ridiculous. And I don't know why, but for some reason,

1973
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:15,660
I read a couple and, and,

1974
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:17,820
and I came across one that I thought was so interesting.

1975
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:19,500
I actually copied it down. I want to read it to you.

1976
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:23,100
So it was an interview. I don't even remember what interview it was,

1977
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,060
but not surprisingly, a lot of the comments were like,

1978
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:29,820
this guy's a horrible human being like, you know, what a,

1979
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,540
what a ridiculous person. Oh, I know.

1980
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:33,820
It must've been the interview where you said,

1981
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:37,820
and you tried to offer a nuanced explanation for why

1982
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:41,860
you wish you didn't have to hurt people,

1983
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:45,300
but you also wouldn't have done it different in the sense that you needed to

1984
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:47,460
learn the lessons you learned. Do you remember this interview?

1985
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:48,380
This thing was on NBC.

1986
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:49,420
These were all the ones that.

1987
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:54,260
Yeah. So not surprisingly, every commenter is like ripping you apart.

1988
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:57,700
And this one guy writes something, I'm just going to read to you verbatim.

1989
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,180
And I was, I was, I was really moved by it. He says,

1990
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:05,100
I was not a good person and it took losing everything to realize it.

1991
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:08,740
I'm not yet at the point where I would not change a thing,

1992
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:11,940
but I do get the, I can't change a thing.

1993
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:15,420
So it's useless to feel as much regret and shame as I do.

1994
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:20,060
I really believe him when he says that he values the lessons he learned because I

1995
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:24,060
do too. I might not be a good person yet. I'm learning,

1996
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:25,980
but I'm no longer a bad one.

1997
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:31,020
Yeah. You know, those are few and far between. I mean,

1998
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:34,820
it takes a lot of, you know, most, yeah, I mean, it's amazing, but,

1999
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:38,420
you know, comment. I mean, I don't read comments.

2000
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:43,260
Yeah. I just can't mean it. And it's, and it's, you know,

2001
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:44,980
I used to read comments, but I don't.

2002
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:47,780
Something about the last line of this.

2003
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:51,140
I might not be a good person yet, but I'm no longer a bad one. I mean,

2004
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:55,740
I remember feeling like when I went through that transition of, okay,

2005
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:59,260
like you're not the worst human in the world. You're not perfect.

2006
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:01,540
And you're never going to be, but, um,

2007
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:07,260
I still don't understand a couple of things about the sport. Now we could,

2008
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:09,700
we could explain all day long why,

2009
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:14,300
why you ended up where you ended up, right? Everybody will say, well,

2010
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:18,740
it's not, you know, it went from, once it became clear how widespread EPO use

2011
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:21,100
was in the Peloton and blood transfusing and all that stuff,

2012
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,220
it became very difficult to say, well,

2013
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:27,500
Lance is a bad guy because he did these performance enhancing drugs because to a

2014
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:30,220
first order, you did them no more or no less than anybody else.

2015
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:31,260
So then it turned into, well,

2016
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:35,740
he treated people so badly and that's why Lance is the worst person.

2017
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:40,940
But that doesn't explain to me why, you know,

2018
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,660
oh,

2019
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:48,740
Yvonne Basso who did everything that Pantani did is loved and Pantani was

2020
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:53,940
completely vilified and I mean, effectively killed himself.

2021
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:57,660
It doesn't explain why, well,

2022
02:06:57,660 --> 02:07:02,860
pick your favorite German rider who's loved and, and Ulrich was rejected.

2023
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:08,060
Um, why Vauders is loved and you know,

2024
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:14,020
Tyler gets rejected or whomever, right? So,

2025
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,260
so if we're did you take Lance out of it for a moment, right? Cause you're,

2026
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:18,500
you know, you're radioactive.

2027
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,540
What explains that difference between those other guys?

2028
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:25,580
Cause Jan wasn't beating anybody up. Pantani wasn't screaming at anybody.

2029
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:28,940
But these, yeah, I mean they're, they're, they're, um,

2030
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:33,020
yeah. And say, and same in Spain with him in us, right? So you, you,

2031
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:36,860
you have a handful of examples here with, with,

2032
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:40,660
with characters who were, uh,

2033
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:46,700
had problems so they could not handle, you know, the, the, the, you know,

2034
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:51,380
this is, and I speak, I've talked about this before, but this, nothing,

2035
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:57,140
looking at the whole situation, nothing infuriates me more than that, right?

2036
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:59,820
If you've, and it's, it's,

2037
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:04,860
it has more to do with society and the press and just in,

2038
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:09,060
in the organizers and the politicians in the sport, how they will embrace,

2039
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:12,260
you know, Jan Ulrich is not welcome at the start of the tour. Meanwhile,

2040
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:16,140
Eric's Abba was up there shaking hands with the, the guy in the yellow chair.

2041
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:20,420
You know, it's like, wait a minute, like this is fucking stupid. I, I,

2042
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:21,740
I don't understand.

2043
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:24,500
Do you have any idea why that hypocrisy exists?

2044
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:26,260
Um,

2045
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,780
I mean, only then, you know, the ones,

2046
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:35,700
the ones who rose the highest, I mean, obviously, I mean,

2047
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:40,700
Pantani was the biggest athlete in Italy at the time. No soccer,

2048
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:45,700
whatever sport F1 Pantani was the biggest athlete in Italy.

2049
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:49,860
Jan was the biggest athlete in Germany. I was the biggest athlete here and,

2050
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:52,660
and you know, on and on. And so, you know,

2051
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:55,300
maybe it has to do with those heights and the only,

2052
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:57,620
the only place you can end up is,

2053
02:08:58,580 --> 02:09:03,700
is the complete opposite, like just at the bottom of the pool. Um,

2054
02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:08,500
but it doesn't, I don't think it excuses it. I thought that just, and,

2055
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:12,820
and we're talking about, we're not talking about me again, but with these

2056
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:14,380
stories, I mean, Pantani dead,

2057
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:20,020
Hemenez dead, uh, you know, Vanden Broek dead Belgium,

2058
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:23,780
um, Gomont dead in France. I mean,

2059
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:26,740
all guys that were at the top of the game and they just could,

2060
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:31,740
they couldn't handle this perp with their own demons.

2061
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:36,540
They couldn't handle that fall from grace. So they turned to other things.

2062
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:42,860
And, but nobody reached out, you know, you know, in many ways,

2063
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:45,900
the press just sort of chased that story. I mean, they'll get Vanden Broek.

2064
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:49,980
I mean, Frank Vanden Broek was arguably one of the most talented of all time.

2065
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:52,180
He was the next Mercs. He was the next, that, that, that, that.

2066
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,140
And the press just,

2067
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:59,460
just let it go and just hammered this guy and he died in the hotel room in

2068
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:02,620
Senegal. Pantani dies at a dirty hotel room in Milan.

2069
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:06,700
Jan almost dies. I mean, it's like, you know,

2070
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:09,780
when did you realize Jan was in trouble? I know it was,

2071
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:12,100
I remember you and I talking about this in the summer of 18.

2072
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:16,580
You sent me a picture and I'll never forget it. I was like, that can't be on.

2073
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:20,500
Well, you know, Jan was always,

2074
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:25,220
Jan was always like to have fun. I mean, we talked about it.

2075
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,220
Yeah, but this didn't look like having fun.

2076
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:33,220
No, no, no, this is, but you know, it, it, um, you know, I guess, uh, you know,

2077
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:37,660
cause the other interesting thing is, is, you know, one of Jan's closest

2078
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:42,100
lieutenants when, when we were competing head to head was, was Andreas Cloden.

2079
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:42,540
Yes.

2080
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:46,380
Who ended up being on Astana with us and Radio Shack. And, and so I,

2081
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:50,980
ended up getting to know Cloden and really, really getting to love him. Um,

2082
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:55,340
so I had heard that a lot of these guys, so Cloden, Sable, Daniel Hondo,

2083
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:58,540
they had tried to reach out to him and you know,

2084
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:00,740
and it was in the press. He got in a fight with his neighbor.

2085
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:05,300
Like these are no secrets. This shit was out there. Um,

2086
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:10,420
and then, uh, you know, he has, he has, uh, and he,

2087
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:15,300
but he, he turned everybody away and not just turned them away, but just,

2088
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:18,820
just flat out erased them from his life because he didn't want to hear it.

2089
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:23,140
But he had two guys, uh, Frank and Mike Baldinger. So the,

2090
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:27,780
the German brothers from, from where he's from, they're normal guys.

2091
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:31,020
Like they're not professional cyclists. They're not rich. They're not famous.

2092
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:35,580
They're just regular dudes. They're good dudes. And, uh,

2093
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:38,100
they contacted me and they said, we, we,

2094
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:43,060
he's told everybody else to just leave him alone. And then he's turned on.

2095
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:47,980
They said, you're our last call. Like you, and so,

2096
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:53,220
and I didn't know these guys. And so that's when I made the trip, um,

2097
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:57,500
to, uh, was it Switzerland or Germany place? And that was,

2098
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:01,500
you know, it was a mess.

2099
02:12:01,740 --> 02:12:03,620
Yeah. What was that like to see him like that?

2100
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:11,180
Unrecognizable. It was like an alien had entered his body. It was,

2101
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:15,260
it was, I've never, I have never, I've seen some crazy shit.

2102
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:19,340
I have never seen anything like this. Um,

2103
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:23,060
but you know, Jan, two years sober,

2104
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:28,420
he's got his kids back in his life. It's on the bike.

2105
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:31,940
If I can love that guy.

2106
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:38,540
It is amazing to me how our society summit we, we, again,

2107
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:39,780
I can't understand it.

2108
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:44,780
Why we sometimes lift people up and then find such joy in watching them crash.

2109
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:49,940
Yeah. We're not going to figure that out, you know,

2110
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:53,180
and I don't, I don't spend any time. I mean,

2111
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:57,100
I get very frustrated and straight up mad when I see,

2112
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:59,700
you know, the, the, the,

2113
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:04,740
the differences between Ulrich and Zabel and Pantani and Basso and on and on

2114
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:08,220
and on. But, you know,

2115
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:14,540
and, and guys that were just not equipped to handle that downfall,

2116
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:19,700
like it, I was the one, the man, I was the one thing I said to myself,

2117
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:23,380
I said, just whatever you do, just do not, I mean,

2118
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:25,100
you can go have fun and do some crazy,

2119
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:30,380
but don't you ever lose, lose contact with your health,

2120
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:33,660
your wellness, your fitness, your family. Like,

2121
02:13:34,580 --> 02:13:35,780
don't ever lose sight of that.

2122
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:41,260
Did you go through a period in 2013 where you were pretty reclusive?

2123
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:45,660
And so this is meeting right after kind of the whole confession. Um,

2124
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:50,540
cause you didn't try to think like, when did you start your podcast in 16,

2125
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:51,420
17?

2126
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:54,180
I'd have to go back and look, it's been, uh,

2127
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:57,220
like there was a period of time when you were really off the radar.

2128
02:13:57,220 --> 02:13:59,580
Yeah. I mean, you had, you know, no choice.

2129
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:04,260
Radar didn't pick you up either. I mean, there was no, nothing to do.

2130
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:08,100
What was it like when you walked into a restaurant? Did people, um,

2131
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:11,340
I mean, you've told one story a number of times about, you know,

2132
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:14,420
you walking across the street and a bunch of people in bars.

2133
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:19,100
Yeah. What was, what was the normal reaction like perfectly fine?

2134
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:20,500
Indifference. Yeah.

2135
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:26,180
Yeah. I mean, I, I people, people are, and again,

2136
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:28,460
he goes to this comment thing. Like I just think about,

2137
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:30,740
that's why I don't read comments because I walked through my day. You know,

2138
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:33,140
I see guys on the golf course. I see people on bike rides.

2139
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:37,780
I see people in restaurants. I see, you know, I go to meeting. Like it's,

2140
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:42,060
it's that is not a, a, a, a,

2141
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:46,060
an accurate snapshot of what my life is like

2142
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:50,820
at all. You know, even in 13. So because remember it,

2143
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:54,100
the other thing that was going on at that point in time is the foundation is

2144
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:58,340
crumbling and you're getting kicked out. Yep. And you know,

2145
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:02,700
you've told me before that that hurt as much as anything else. Yeah. I mean,

2146
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:08,020
it was, it was surreal and, and just sad.

2147
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:11,540
And what did the people to foundation tell you unofficially, not the,

2148
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:13,540
not the board, but the people who worked there,

2149
02:15:13,540 --> 02:15:17,460
the people who were doing the actual heavy lifting? Well, I mean,

2150
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:22,060
now those folks, I have a ton of, um,

2151
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:26,620
regret about because they, they, they were doing the Lord's work and they were

2152
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:28,140
not privy.

2153
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:31,300
Yeah. They weren't decision makers. Yeah.

2154
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:35,860
But the, and they believed the dream, they believed the story. And so that's,

2155
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:40,540
and as a byproduct of that, you know, they in many ways felt, uh,

2156
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:45,660
complicit in, in the scheme. And so for that,

2157
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:49,260
it that's, that's tough for me to hear and to,

2158
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:54,540
and I'll spend the rest of my days trying to make that okay for them. Um,

2159
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:59,060
you know, at the, at the top, you know, and I wasn't part of these discussions,

2160
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:03,460
so I don't know what the board room discussions were like or, or,

2161
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:07,620
or who, which consultants were hired or I don't know how it all went down,

2162
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:09,420
but, um,

2163
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:14,660
and I just knew it was the wrong thing. I knew it.

2164
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:17,940
I knew that that, that, that timeout, yes.

2165
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:24,060
Space, but some agreement here that we will both reemerge.

2166
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:28,060
That was the right thing to do. I mean,

2167
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,140
and I don't need somebody to sit here and say, well, you're right. Like,

2168
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:37,420
but if I look at where Livestrong has ultimately ended up and I look at,

2169
02:16:40,140 --> 02:16:43,540
you know, you've brought up a pie. I mean, if I look at my audience now,

2170
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:47,780
well, they're very different.

2171
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:53,300
And one of them is, is not doing very well. And the other one's is back,

2172
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:54,180
so to speak.

2173
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:57,260
What interaction do you have these days with a cancer community?

2174
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:01,900
Very little, just one, just one on one just would, and by the way,

2175
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:05,020
that's fine. Like I don't, you know,

2176
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:08,460
I don't need to be asked to speak at a gala or get some award or all the stuff I

2177
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:12,700
did in the past. Somebody's got a friend that's just been diagnosed and Hey,

2178
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:18,060
Lance, can you reach out to him? A hundred percent. Let's go right now. Um,

2179
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:21,140
and that's, that's enough for me.

2180
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:25,660
I don't know if you've been asked this question before.

2181
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:30,020
I'm sure you have. Um, and so I apologize in advance,

2182
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:34,100
but, um, when the story's done, what do you think your legacy is going to be?

2183
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,100
Well, you don't,

2184
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:41,460
there's, um, well,

2185
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:49,300
yeah, that that's, that's, that's harder to,

2186
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:51,780
what do I think it will be or what do I want it to be?

2187
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:52,980
Because you don't get to write your own.

2188
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:55,140
What do you think it's, um,

2189
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:00,500
too early to say too early. I mean, if, if,

2190
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,020
I know what it would have said in January of 2013, yeah.

2191
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:09,260
But you know, I don't, I don't, I don't like to brag about myself,

2192
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:11,060
but I gotta say I'm really fucking proud.

2193
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:15,460
What are you most proud of? Well, I'm, I'm,

2194
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:21,300
I am proud of the fact that I didn't quit.

2195
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,580
Which time? Because you had a number of times to do this.

2196
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:27,300
Just do this whole, do the whole thing that, that,

2197
02:18:27,300 --> 02:18:32,420
that I was able to keep it together and, uh, you know,

2198
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:37,860
without really any support and thank God we live in 2021,

2199
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:40,580
2020, whatever, where you can, people can re,

2200
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:43,460
that you can re reinvent yourself on your own.

2201
02:18:43,460 --> 02:18:47,460
You don't need network television. You don't need, you know, uh,

2202
02:18:48,140 --> 02:18:49,740
the New York times. You don't need any of that.

2203
02:18:50,660 --> 02:18:53,420
Like what we're doing right here right now, you did this on your own.

2204
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:56,460
You bought the cameras, you got the mics, you're asking the questions.

2205
02:18:56,460 --> 02:18:59,380
You're the smart guy. All the millions of people are listening.

2206
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:02,580
You did that on your own. You couldn't have done that 10 years ago,

2207
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:04,980
20 years ago. Right? So that's,

2208
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:10,300
I've chosen to go that path and, and, and, and I'm proud of that.

2209
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:15,580
Honestly. Um, so who knows what, what to, to,

2210
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:19,020
to your original question. Like I, I, um,

2211
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:23,140
I'm 50 years old. I think I'll have another

2212
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:30,900
40 or 50 years. So there's, uh,

2213
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:33,140
there's a lot left to be told.

2214
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:38,260
That's the amazing part here, right? Yeah. And I don't, I don't need, um,

2215
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:41,700
I don't, I don't, I don't need, uh, um,

2216
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:46,020
any more puff pieces in my life. Like, you know, I, I'm, I'm,

2217
02:19:46,060 --> 02:19:49,220
I'm really beholden to a few things. One, my family.

2218
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:54,100
So that's my, that's my first checkpoint.

2219
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:58,980
And that's amazing. Right. And then I really feel,

2220
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:02,940
uh, beholden and loyal to the audience of our podcasts.

2221
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:07,340
And then as a byproduct of the success of the podcast, the fund, right?

2222
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:12,140
So the LP base, the people that have entrusted me, right?

2223
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:15,380
That the guy that the whole world thought could never be trusted again,

2224
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:19,220
have trusted me with their hard earned money. Um,

2225
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:24,140
I'm beholden to them. And so those are all, and that's all I care about. Right?

2226
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:29,300
So that's, and if, uh, and you know, but I, again,

2227
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:32,980
I don't need a, I don't need to be on the cover of Forbes because our, you know,

2228
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:37,940
it's just, uh, I'm totally cool to keep that private. Um,

2229
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:44,020
but look, I mean, at the, also at the end of the day,

2230
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:50,020
it is going to contain a lot of the, of the rear view mirror.

2231
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:53,900
That's just, that's just the way that I'm okay with that.

2232
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:58,340
That's the way society is. That's the way legacies are mine, especially.

2233
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:00,380
It will, it will mostly be that.

2234
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:04,220
If you can go back in time to

2235
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:12,460
15 year old Lance, you've got, you've got a, you've got a week with him.

2236
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:16,500
Yeah. What kind of lessons would you try to impart on him?

2237
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:24,060
Um, you know, that's because 15 was a, uh, an interesting age.

2238
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:27,820
So, uh, there were, there would have been a lot. I mean, that was a very,

2239
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:32,900
yeah, you're good enough that you, you know, I, I picked 15 because you're a pro

2240
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:33,260
traffic.

2241
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:36,900
Well, I was a pro athlete and it was when my mom kicked out Terry Armstrong.

2242
02:21:37,380 --> 02:21:40,580
Okay. So I didn't know that was 15. Yeah, that was 15. So that was,

2243
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:44,100
that was a point in time where it was her and I against the world.

2244
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:49,020
Like fuck everybody else. We're going to, we're going to get these people.

2245
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:53,100
Like he's gone. We're together. Like let's go.

2246
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:57,380
And so that was a very important, um,

2247
02:21:57,460 --> 02:22:02,460
so the chip on your shoulder, which I'm guessing exists subconsciously now became

2248
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:06,420
pretty conscious. Yeah, absolutely.

2249
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:11,060
And that chip on your shoulder fit a lot of good for you and obviously a lot of

2250
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:16,100
bad for you. Yeah. So do you think that again, in this thought experiment,

2251
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:19,060
right, if you had a week to coach that kid,

2252
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:24,340
could you have figured out a way to extract the value from that complex and

2253
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:30,580
soften some of the damage that it was going to ultimately cause you via the

2254
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:31,940
damage it would cause to others?

2255
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:36,940
Yeah. I mean, I, I didn't really, you know, but maybe 15 year olds don't realize

2256
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:41,660
that, but, but the amount of trauma that, that I had already had in my life,

2257
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:46,100
which, you know, just got actually worse and worse and worse. I mean,

2258
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:50,940
cancer was hugely dramatic and then the fall was traumatic. Like there is,

2259
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:56,500
there is, there's a lot to unpack there. And so, and then, you know,

2260
02:22:56,540 --> 02:23:00,220
never meeting your father and having this way around, it was just,

2261
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:05,460
and never having that, that, that figure in your life.

2262
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:12,140
And the, and the figure that was there was wildly defective. You know,

2263
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:18,140
you, you, you, it would have been in and around that, you know,

2264
02:23:18,140 --> 02:23:22,180
whether that was through even therapy at the time, then, you know, I mean,

2265
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:25,820
it's always by the way, if, if somebody would have come up to me when I was 15

2266
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:29,140
and said, you know, I feel like you've had some crazy shit in your 15 years,

2267
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:32,460
you should just do a little bit at once a month, I would've said, you know what,

2268
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:35,460
why don't you go fuck yourself? I'm doing therapy for nothing.

2269
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:39,660
Like I embrace that stuff now, but, um,

2270
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:42,700
there would have been a lot of work to do even then.

2271
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:45,660
What could you have told him though? Like, again, if he's not willing to go to

2272
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:48,740
therapy, which I can understand, that's a pretty hard sell to a really,

2273
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:53,140
really cocky 15 year old, you know, what else can you tell him? I'm, I'm,

2274
02:23:53,180 --> 02:23:56,540
I'm just, or was he too far gone at that point? Like, you know, I,

2275
02:23:57,380 --> 02:24:02,380
it's one of the things I've learned about myself over time is that so many of the

2276
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:06,860
character traits that were both positive and negative, and they tend to go,

2277
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:09,980
they tend to cluster like right on top of each other, right? It's like,

2278
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:12,980
that it's like two genes that sit right next to each other in the chromosome.

2279
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:14,780
One good, one bad. Um,

2280
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:19,100
a lot of those traits come about long before we're consciously aware of what

2281
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:21,460
led to them. Yeah. And, um,

2282
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:25,220
I think your, your case is really obvious sometimes.

2283
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:29,980
Like some of those traumas are so obvious, right? Like the dad, the step dad,

2284
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:34,220
the growing up without this, the growing up in a place that like,

2285
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:37,940
and then of course that says nothing about cancer, which I don't know,

2286
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:42,980
like do you feel you've gone back and unpacked that PTSD through all of those

2287
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,380
layers now as an adult?

2288
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:49,980
Well, I don't know that we can ever, any of us can ever unpack it all,

2289
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:52,900
but I've in the last year,

2290
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:57,260
I've certainly done more unpacking than in the previous 49.

2291
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:03,380
Yeah. Yeah. Like way more, you know, and that's,

2292
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,460
but, uh, you know, and I should have done,

2293
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:15,500
I should have started that process a lot earlier. Um,

2294
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:22,100
but you know, I guess going back to the question though, on the, uh, you know,

2295
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:26,940
I was just every, you know, even then at 15, everything was, you know,

2296
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:31,260
I had drove a fast car and every, every green light was a competition and every,

2297
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:37,780
everything was like slow down kid. Like it was just, everything was,

2298
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:43,220
um, everything was a fight, not even a competition. It was a fight.

2299
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:44,820
I didn't just,

2300
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:50,100
but you said it, I mean, it would have been impossible to get through just like

2301
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:53,580
that 15 year old, the 25 year old, the 35 year old, even the 45 phone,

2302
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:54,940
you would not have gotten through.

2303
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:59,220
I think that's something that very few people can understand.

2304
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:03,060
I can relate to it Lance because I've had my own total,

2305
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:08,060
total destruction and I've, I've, I've played the game in my head a hundred

2306
02:26:08,060 --> 02:26:11,140
times. God, I just wish I could take that all back.

2307
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:14,340
I wish I could undo all of that stuff,

2308
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:17,820
but I realize if I were to undo all of that stuff,

2309
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:22,460
I wouldn't have fallen down. And if I didn't fall down and lose it all,

2310
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:26,100
but this is, we talked, this is when you say, well,

2311
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:31,260
I wouldn't change a thing because these series of events happened and boom,

2312
02:26:31,580 --> 02:26:33,340
it caused, you know,

2313
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:37,340
whether it's deep work or introspection or, or realignment,

2314
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:42,020
whatever you want to call it, then that wouldn't happen. Like that, that,

2315
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:46,020
that's that's just hard to, that's a hard answer. I mean,

2316
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:49,460
that, that, that answer has never worked for me, but because you know, people,

2317
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:52,860
well, but what, but they, they analyze so much of the stuff,

2318
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:54,700
but I mean, in many ways it's true.

2319
02:26:55,580 --> 02:26:59,780
Yeah. So how do you keep fit these days? I mean, you talked about swimming.

2320
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:00,940
Is that the mainstay of your training?

2321
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:03,060
No, I, I, I, well now we're in the summer.

2322
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:05,700
So now I get to Aspen is completely thought out.

2323
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:09,260
The mountain bike trails are open. What's your fastest time at Mount Evans?

2324
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:13,820
I've only done Mount Evans once like an 80,

2325
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:19,020
no, in 90. I did it in 1990. That's at your doorstep. No, no, that's,

2326
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:21,820
that's not that close. It's close to Aspen. Isn't it? It's like a couple hours away.

2327
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:24,100
Well, that's, that's not close. I brought, I,

2328
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:28,700
I don't get in a car to ride my bike. That's kind of a rule.

2329
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:31,820
All right. What was your fastest time at Palomar? Don't know.

2330
02:27:31,940 --> 02:27:35,300
That was a long time ago. Do you care anymore?

2331
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,780
Do you still care how fast you can ride up the mountain? No, I,

2332
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:42,340
I find myself being happier and happier just

2333
02:27:43,060 --> 02:27:47,660
riding. Do you use a power meter still? Nope. No heart rate, no power meter.

2334
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:49,900
None of that bullshit. Do you have any idea what you're,

2335
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:52,460
what you would ride up a Madone in today?

2336
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:54,980
How many Watts you could average if we stuck a power meter on you?

2337
02:27:56,100 --> 02:28:00,780
I have no idea. Like 350? No, I doubt I could do that.

2338
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:04,980
I bet you could. You give me, you give me a week or two to train. I could,

2339
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:09,420
I could, I don't know, but it's, I find myself just when I'm out,

2340
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:13,620
it's like I ride easier as opposed to harder. I mean, I,

2341
02:28:14,300 --> 02:28:17,660
do you enjoy a group ride or do you still enjoy just kind of going out on your

2342
02:28:17,660 --> 02:28:20,340
own, doing a four hour ride? I like it. I like being all alone.

2343
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:24,220
How much on the mountain bike versus road bike? Mostly mountain bike.

2344
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:28,900
Just cause of the risk of cars or cars. I like Stan. And it's where we live.

2345
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:32,500
You get out in the mountains on a mountain bike all by yourself. Come on.

2346
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:34,020
You're running much.

2347
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:39,660
I haven't run. I keep getting hurt. Run. I think I'm too old to run.

2348
02:28:41,180 --> 02:28:43,900
I don't, I don't do at this age, you know, if,

2349
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:47,860
if I did yoga three days a week or was serious about stretching and pliability

2350
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:51,060
and things that I should be thinking about at 50, I could run,

2351
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:55,220
but my dumb ass is just like, put the shoes on,

2352
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:59,740
don't stretch a bit. Let's go. Like that,

2353
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:01,420
that doesn't work when you're 50.

2354
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:05,580
And I mean, if, if I were to give you,

2355
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:08,260
what's the tightest interval you'd swim 10, 100 zone,

2356
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:11,100
what would be your touch and go interval for 10, 100?

2357
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:17,140
Uh, uh, C level. Like if I went right now.

2358
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:20,700
Yeah. Would you do, would you be 105 touch and go? No, I couldn't do that right

2359
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:23,500
now. I could do one to one 10 to one 10. I'd be,

2360
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:27,460
I'd be really touching and going at the end, but.

2361
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:30,540
So one 15, you could, you could bring a minute one 10. No problem. Yeah.

2362
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:32,580
So you're still a fit guy.

2363
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:38,140
I'm fitter than most 50. What's your, what's your biggest,

2364
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:42,220
what's the biggest liability to your fitness? What's your biggest vice food,

2365
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:46,380
alcohol, what gets in the way of, cause what do you weigh right now?

2366
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:50,740
180. Okay. So you're 15 pounds above your tour weight,

2367
02:29:50,740 --> 02:29:55,500
which is actually not a lot given the most retired cyclists. So is that,

2368
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:59,700
is that a struggle to maintain your weight? No, I don't try. I mean, I, I,

2369
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:04,700
I seem to have a balance between consumption and we,

2370
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:09,700
we, you go where whether you're consuming food or alcohol or, or whatever,

2371
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:14,660
that's consumption and, and, and exercise. I, I never,

2372
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:18,980
I have to exercise not, not because I want to stay a certain weight or I work in

2373
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:20,300
book. It's just, you need it for your mental health.

2374
02:30:20,300 --> 02:30:23,780
It is my own sanity. Like it's the only reason. Um,

2375
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:25,260
that's interesting by the way, isn't it?

2376
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:30,260
There are a lot of former pro athletes that I know who once it's no longer

2377
02:30:31,180 --> 02:30:33,820
their job, they just do not want to do it anymore.

2378
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:39,340
I will, I will ride for as long as this body will allow it to ride.

2379
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:41,540
Absolutely. Yeah.

2380
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:47,780
Well man, it has been, it has been great sitting down. Yeah. Um,

2381
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:50,100
been a long time coming. I know.

2382
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:54,740
And I've got an amazing salmon and okra dish waiting. Oh God.

2383
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:58,060
You gotta tell that story right quick. You can't tease them out with that.

2384
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:01,660
This is, I'll tell the story. I'll tell the story. So there's, there,

2385
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:04,100
and every people that like Anna who cooks from you all the time,

2386
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:08,220
she knows that I just, I don't like salmon and like growing up,

2387
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:12,340
we would eat okra and I just don't like okra. So I come over, this has been six,

2388
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:14,660
six, seven months ago and I walk in and I'm like,

2389
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:20,540
that smells like salmon. I'm like, Hey, what's for dinner? Peter? He's like,

2390
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:23,100
Oh, I got some grilling this amazing salmon. I was like,

2391
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:27,140
I was on the Traeger, my special marinade. I was like, Oh, okay.

2392
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:30,860
And then I was like, what do we have in with it? And you're like, Oh,

2393
02:31:30,860 --> 02:31:35,140
I got some fresh okra. And I was like, this is not,

2394
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:39,100
this isn't happening. This is a fucking joke. Like somebody's,

2395
02:31:39,460 --> 02:31:42,780
I'm getting punked. It's like Anna called me to tell me this before.

2396
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:46,140
And I was like sitting there just like getting to the meal and we were,

2397
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:49,060
we had a wonderful time. And then I, when I don't know why I was,

2398
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:51,060
when I was stepping out, I was like, I was like,

2399
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:52,220
I have to be honest with you guys.

2400
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:56,100
Like there are two things in this world that I just really can't stand to eat.

2401
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:58,180
Salmon and okra. It was,

2402
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:01,700
but you had a brave face, man. I wouldn't have known you. You put it down.

2403
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:06,740
As far as salmon and okra go, I hope it was good salmon and good okra.

2404
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:10,100
We had the Japanese whiskey too. Ah,

2405
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:14,860
that, that definitely lubricated it. All right, my friend.

2406
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:19,820
You ready to go get your butt kicked in the Sim? Yeah. Well,

2407
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:24,420
I wouldn't, you don't, you, you don't know that I'm going to get my butt kicked.

2408
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:27,900
So it's not fair for you to say that, but I'm ready to, uh,

2409
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:30,620
I'm ready to go see what happens. Okay. Very well.

2410
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:35,620
I can drive. I'm sure you can, but I just think,

2411
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:39,900
I'm excited to see this. Okay, good. Let's do it. Let's do it.
