00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,380
So good to sit down with you, brother. You too. Thanks for having me.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,200
So much to talk about, but I feel like I just want to start with kind of getting a sense

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,140
of the first time you heard about this. Was it a call from Darren? Like how did you even

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,640
get involved in this project?

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,960
Yeah, I had a call from Darren. It'd be going back on three years now. And he said, I want

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,640
to do this series, docu-series called Limitless on longevity. And he said, I know you're a

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,480
fit, healthy guy, but we want to dive into the science and put you in some pretty extreme,

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,160
intense, physical, emotional situations and see how you fare. And you can be the guinea

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,600
pig as far as the longevity science goes. And I said, why not? And initially, it was

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,560
supposed to be about a three week shoot. And I know you and I have talked about this a

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,200
lot. The once COVID hit, the show got spread out over two and a half years. And really,

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,600
it transformed in the best way possible. I think due to having a hell of a lot more time

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,880
than I think we'd first anticipated, we were able to flesh out each episode, explore the

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,600
science in greater detail. I was able to grow throughout the experience and have different

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,680
opinions on myself, different opinions on how I approached health and wellness. So yeah,

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm really proud of how it turned out. And I think it was a lot due to the time span we're

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,160
able to shoot it on. So kind of going back to this, first of all, I can't believe they

19
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,880
bait and switched you on three weeks of shooting because like, even before COVID, I was involved

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,840
in four weeks of shooting. So I don't know where, where anybody thought it was.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Initially, it was two and I was like, I can't fit that in my schedule. That was three and

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,600
two and a half years. And we joke about it, right? What do we call it? Relentless.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,800
We're going to do a title change. Limited. I was going to call it.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,560
So where were you in? Had you, you were done Avengers by that point?

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,880
Yeah, what did I, I done Avengers. I think I was doing the press tour about the time this came up

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:19,080
and you hadn't done Love and Thunder. So I remember three years ago, almost to the day

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,720
I was sitting in my apartment here in New York with Darren, Ruth, Arie, I mean, every, you know,

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,320
sort of like the core group from Newtopia and from Protozoa. And at that point, so call it November

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:40,200
of 2019, they had the idea for six episodes, it was still a bit foggy. And it's kind of amazing how

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,840
quickly they morphed that into that first shoot when we started in January. Was there anything

31
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,920
about it that you had apprehension about doing? I mean, besides the time, obviously time is an

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,040
issue based on your schedule, but, you know, were you nervous, worried, anxious about doing this?

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,920
Because this is not acting. Yeah, I was, to be honest. So I had never hosted anything before.

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,480
And it's one thing to, you know, hide behind the character and behind the mask of whatever

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,040
individual you're playing in a film setting. But then to be yourself, you know, I've done

36
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,000
obviously plenty of interviews and so on. But to be in a situation like this, where it was

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,640
not only looking into the science, but dissecting kind of my abilities and seeing what my limits

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:35,640
were in one regard. And, you know, there was a vulnerability that's required there. I had to be

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:44,680
authentic. So I, you know, didn't want to hold back. But it's, yeah, it was a little more of a

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,360
hesitation or a lot more sort of thinking about it as how I was going to come across and was it

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,560
going to be genuine? Was it going to be appreciated or not? Or, you know, all sorts of silly kind of

42
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,320
doubts and any questions start to creep in that I wasn't normally sort of thinking about.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,560
And then the thing transformed anyway, as far as my initial, was there any hesitation around taking

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,560
on the show? I don't think any of us knew what it was going to be. You know, the three or four weeks

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,960
that we'd talk about even when you're involved. And I spoke to Darren the last couple of days

46
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,800
about this. He said, yeah, it was a very different beast at the beginning. And due to the time, but

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,240
also, I think due to what I was willing to do and the commitment I had for it, it was allowed to

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,040
evolve and become something bigger. And as did the challenges, you know, there were discussions about

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,800
cold water immersion and we're going to do ice baths and so on. And then it was like, well,

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,480
let's go to Norway and let's, you know, swim in the Arctic Ocean. And it sort of

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,040
became more and more epic as it went on. It feels like you and I don't want to project this, but

52
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,320
so correct me if I'm wrong. But as I watched you, because, you know, one of the things about this

53
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,400
that was kind of a joy is how close we became as a group like you, your team, me, like the whole

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,160
group kind of coalesced. It's like you seem to trust the team even more and more as time went on

55
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,040
and gave more and more of yourself because again, you know, everybody sort of got involved in this

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,440
with the expectation this was going to be, you know, bracketed in terms of time and COVID in

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,600
part. But also I just think the, you know, the breadth of expectation of what this could be

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,520
expanded the scope so much. Do you get the sense that you were willing to give way more of yourself

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,720
as this thing went on that maybe you had committed to up front? Absolutely. And I think

60
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,920
due to what you're saying about there's a trust there with the people I was working with.

61
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,080
I knew on paper that these were the experts in their field and all of you were going to take care

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,160
of me and advise me in the right way. But it's like you're working with a director and each of

63
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,680
the experts in each of these series were kind of leading the way and they're at the helm. And I was

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,000
following and if I have a good relationship with my director and I trust them and that only comes

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,400
through experience and time spent, then I'm going to give more of myself and take more risks and

66
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,760
not feel like it's going to be exploited in any way. So the first episode that we filmed was the

67
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,680
fasting one. Look, I'm going to do it with you. Yeah. Yeah. It makes it a lot easier to go through

68
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,720
this with somebody else. So okay, good. We'll suffer together. We will. I've definitely gone

69
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:44,920
a day without food before. I think I get pretty cranky when I've missed a meal. Certainly

70
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:52,280
detrimental to my happiness. It's a pretty long time. Why four days? Why not? Why not longer?

71
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,760
I mean, what is the benefit with four days? Why that number? Three to four days is probably that

72
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:07,720
window at which we do enough to change how your body is interacting with the absence of nutrients

73
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,520
to basically do kind of a reboot on your system. Oh really? Do you think I'm going to be able to

74
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,720
hold them together? Do you reckon in your experience you see a lot of people the first time they do it

75
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,240
succeed? In the next four days there is no doubt in my mind there will be a period of time in which

76
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:32,120
you feel sluggish or tears. Yeah. Kind of grumpy, grouchy, whatever. But if you really stop to think

77
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,720
about it, this idea that we kind of live today where we're sort of surrounded by unlimited access

78
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,200
to food and we can eat three meals and snack in between them, that's a relatively recent addition

79
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,600
to our species. Right. And our ancestors would have gone days without food all the time and not

80
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,040
only did they have to do that, they had the ability to in a period of starvation actually go out and hunt.

81
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,160
I feel that I think that shows up third or fourth in the sequence. Yeah, it does. What did you know

82
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,840
going into that and what was your expectation? Just that I had never fasted before and I knew

83
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,760
that this was going to be a challenge. And I don't think you knew how long it was going to be or

84
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,160
anything like that. I mean, we sort of sprung that on you in real time over that dinner. We did. I

85
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,160
think the initial discussions were around like intermittent fasting and restricted sort of

86
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,240
feeding windows. And then it was like, oh, maybe we'll do a day or a couple of days. And you're

87
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,600
like, no, we're doing four days. And by the way, I suggested three. Did you? I did. And they said,

88
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,960
no, no, we're going to go one more because I said I wouldn't normally have a patient go more than

89
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:46,280
three days on the first one. And they pushed it to four. It was, yeah, I don't know. I mean,

90
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,440
as we talked about many times, my expectation or kind of thoughts around would I be able to do it

91
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,840
or not? I think we're in line with yours. I thought, look, we're going to commit. We're going to do it.

92
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,000
But we kept discussing, you know, you'll kick into ketosis on day two, you know, and maybe day

93
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,320
three and then come to like day four. And I'm like, no, I'm not feeling any of the sharpness or

94
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,680
alertness. And then right in the afternoon when we went spearfishing, probably at the right time,

95
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:22,280
it kept in and things started to sort of percolate. I remember saying to Tanya,

96
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,680
I think it was to Tanya, it might have been somebody else, but I think it was to Tanya as we

97
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:35,080
were getting ready to head out on the boat. That was the moment when I kind of realized how

98
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,840
sort of strong you were, because I felt like you didn't have that much time to prepare for that

99
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,800
exercise. And it wasn't under ideal circumstances. It's one thing to say, you're going to do your

100
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,280
first fast. It's going to be for four days. And it was hard enough. I mean, we worked out every day.

101
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,000
We had a bunch of other things that we had to do, but then learning an entirely new skill around

102
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,080
breath holding and spearfishing. I mean, I think we'll be challenging under any circumstance.

103
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,600
How much of that do you remember? You know, it's been almost three years since we filmed that,

104
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,560
but how much of that do you remember? And was there ever a moment when you thought,

105
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm not worried that something's going to happen to me, but I'm worried that I'm not going to be

106
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:19,720
successful. Yeah, I think that was most of the episodes. As I'd get to, you know, doing the Arctic

107
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,360
swim or doing the four day fast or climbing the rope, I kept thinking, if I don't complete this

108
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,720
exercise, it's not really an episode or it's pretty anticlimactic. And so there was definitely

109
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:42,600
a healthy amount of fear there kind of motivating me. But I don't know, it also coming back to

110
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,200
the why of it and why we're doing it and understanding the specific purpose of

111
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,960
each challenge was, you know, on one hand, looked like they were trying to kill me. But

112
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,280
on the other hand, was like, there was an incredible amount of information and knowledge

113
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,920
and support and science there that says you do this, you do this consistently, you work this

114
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,760
into your daily routine, then the benefits are exponential. So let's think about Norway,

115
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,680
because that was we filmed that in I think February, right? We went right from Australia,

116
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:18,520
maybe had two weeks off, and then we're all in Norway. My recollection of that was a beauty like

117
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,120
I couldn't imagine. So we were there to do this thing, but it was in this place that you would

118
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,800
normally never go to, I feel like we took like three flights to get there or something crazy.

119
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,920
So, again, Ross spoke about this a little bit last night, which was, it was another example of

120
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,680
you were being asked to do something much quicker than you would normally do. So,

121
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,600
right, I think you didn't how many was the first day you jumped in that water? Because it's different

122
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,520
than an ice bath. Like you can send an ice bath all you want. It's totally different experience

123
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,240
to jump in the ocean when it's 36 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes. Some of the episodes I was

124
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,440
able to train for specifically probably the strength episode that was on and off

125
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,600
of the course of six, seven months, and then I had injuries and so on. But the cold water immersion,

126
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,560
I mean, I did a couple of ice baths back in. We were doing some in Australia.

127
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,920
Back in Australia. And that was new to me. And then I was talking to Ross about it. And

128
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,640
the sort of overarching idea was that, you know, they were talking about developing brown fat,

129
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,960
you know, and we're going to monitor that. Ross is like, no, not in four days. This is going to

130
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:35,640
happen. And so it became as much adaptation around cold water immersion as much as it was

131
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:43,880
sort of a resilience test or just a grit head down go for it. Because the first time we jumped in the

132
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,760
water in Norway, and we were in there for four and a half minutes. And that was longer than any ice

133
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:57,720
bath I've had. But it was snowing. I'm breathing in, you know, freezing cold air. And windy. And

134
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm also moving, you know, you sit in an ice bath and there's a couple of mill of water that starts

135
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,720
to heat up. You stay still, you're trading water, then none of that's happening. So a lot of it was

136
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,320
trusting Ross and listening to Ross's voice and just kind of, again, back to what you said about

137
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,280
the trust. If I didn't have Ross there coaching me through it, having also done it and even to even

138
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:27,640
more extremes, I would have questioned it to no end. And in particular, on that actual, on the

139
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,520
actual swim itself, halfway through, I was like, every part of me was like, you're dying, get out

140
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,520
of the water. Yeah, explain to me and to folks watching and listening what it feels like, because

141
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,840
I have never been in water that cold. I've done long swims at about 49 degrees. And even at that

142
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,440
temperature, which seems balmy compared to 36, I mean, that's a big difference, right? It feels

143
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,160
like you're on fire. Oh, yeah. It actually feels like you're in boiling oil, which I think most

144
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,360
people wouldn't understand. How is that possible that you can get in something so cold and the

145
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,640
sensation is that of being lit on fire? And then the other thing that I think is, I'm curious to

146
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,920
whether you felt it as well is the breathlessness. Like it starts to take your breath away. Yeah,

147
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,240
it definitely, I mean, I'm not going to sound overly dramatic, but it was one of the most painful

148
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,720
things I've ever done. And again, the comparison to the ice bar is very different. The big thing

149
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,640
was putting my head underwater. Again, an ice bar. Remind me, did you have earplugs? I don't think I

150
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,600
did. No. And the big difference, by the way. Oh, yeah. But I was standing on the shore,

151
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,680
and all the training we'd done was treading water head above water. And Ross is like, let's go for

152
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,040
a proper swim tomorrow. And I was like, I don't, I just don't want to do it, mate. I'm just saving

153
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,720
it for the day. Or, you know, the afternoon when we actually shoot it, I'm just going to go for it.

154
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,520
Because if I experience, and I think in hindsight, if I had have experienced how painful it was,

155
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,120
I would have been even more doubtful. So I was standing on the edge and he said, we want to warm

156
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,080
up as much as possible before you get on and strip off and dive in. And he said, and then when you get

157
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,720
in, just take a second to try and adjust before you put your head under. And we did the warm up,

158
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,560
I walked down to the edge, and I didn't even know if they were rolling. And I was like, I'm out of

159
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,760
here. I'm in the water and I'm off. And Ross didn't even have time to jump onto the boat that

160
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,240
was chasing us along. I jumped in, just started going. And the first like, I don't know, maybe

161
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,520
25, 30, 40 meters, I was like, got this. You know what, I'm going all the way. I'm going,

162
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm coming back. I'm doing two laps. And out of nowhere, once the initial sort of adrenaline

163
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:41,880
went, I felt the most extreme headache, pain, right? To all through and to the back of my eyes,

164
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,840
the front of my head everywhere. And I started, I was looking at the bottom as I was swimming,

165
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,240
and I started getting really dizzy. And then I all of a sudden stopped and I was like, I'm going to

166
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,840
throw up like it was that painful. And I look and I've actually swum off course a bit. And I've

167
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,120
started swimming toward where the couple of the camera guys are. And they're like, the buoys that

168
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,960
way go that way. So I head down again. And the whole time I'm just like, nah, get out, get out,

169
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,720
get out. And then I have another voice in my head, I have Ross's voice there saying,

170
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,560
come on, fight, fight, dig in. And I just started going for it. But what starts to happen is your

171
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,160
arms and legs are just like lead balloons. Nothing works. And I didn't even, you know,

172
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,720
I felt like I was swimming like this, a little chicken. And you can't keep your fingers together.

173
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:32,120
So your fingers start to splay. You can't hold the water. And it's just like, it was gnarly.

174
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,280
And then I got to the buoy and they're all cheering and stuff. And, you know, Darren said,

175
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,040
I was waiting for a big celebration. I was like, I couldn't move. I was supposed to die. And then

176
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,120
the jet ski pulls up and he's like, well done, mate. And I'm like, I can't help me on, mate.

177
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,560
I can't lift my arms. And they drag me up onto it. And then the same thing would have

178
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,000
gone on the boat. Everyone's like cheering and Ross is like, get out of the way. And he came

179
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,520
in with a blanket and a little beanie and sort of started warming me up and so on.

180
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,400
Yeah, it was wild. But the, I've never felt the endorphin kick and the sort of elation

181
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,880
that I felt afterward. It was incredible. And I just remember this, the most serene, peaceful

182
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,960
state in awe of everything. And we are there in Norway. It's the most stunning backdrop. But

183
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,120
it's just this wonderful sense of calm and overwhelming sort of joy. And I think

184
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,920
it then it comes with anytime you achieve something that you think is impossible or

185
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,760
overcome some great challenge or, you know, in the face of diversity or whatever you have

186
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,400
overcome it. There is such a beautiful feeling. It made me think about people who, you know,

187
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,120
climb Everest and do extreme feats all the time. And the rest of us are wondering why the hell

188
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,000
would you do that? I believe it's for that moment. That post feeling was pretty special.

189
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I remember it for a long time. Well, I think there's actually something within that. It's

190
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,800
not just the accomplishing the feet. It's the temporal juxtaposition of being so low and so high.

191
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,200
Right. Right. Like I don't think, you know how we don't feel speed? Like if you're on an airplane,

192
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,680
you don't feel it. You feel acceleration. In other words, we're only wired, I think,

193
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,560
to feel a rate of change. Right. And I think that's true of emotion. Like if you're constantly

194
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,760
in a state of bliss, everything is going well all the time. I don't think you feel profound joy.

195
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,800
So I think the reason in part, I mean, I think there's a physiologic expectation for what you

196
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,400
experience. We'll talk about that in a sec. But I think what you're also experiencing is

197
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,800
four minutes earlier, I thought I was going to die. And even if the upper part of your brain

198
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,440
knew you weren't, the reptilian part of your brain absolutely believed it. You were dead.

199
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,240
And then four or five minutes later, you have this unbelievable surge of positive emotion.

200
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,480
I don't think you can find a period of time. And when just four minutes, you can go from your

201
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,040
absolute lowest to your absolute highest. I think that's the thing. That's the juice.

202
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:08,440
Yeah, absolutely. And with no negative, lasting injury, et cetera. Yeah, for sure.

203
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,920
I mean, of all the things in limitless, right, the strength stuff, the endurance stuff,

204
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,560
the mental challenges, all those things. The hardest one to make the case for,

205
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,560
this will make you live longer, is go and jump in the Arctic Ocean and swim. However,

206
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,000
I think about the benefits of cold water. I think that is something everybody should get used to

207
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,600
exposing. I mean, just this morning, right? Like, you and I had breakfast, had to really quickly go

208
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,120
up, shower, come get over here. I still made time to spend 30 seconds to a minute in the ice water

209
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,640
of the shower in the hotel. And I love that feeling of the first time you get into the ice water,

210
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,480
you feel that little thing. And I mean, there is really compelling evidence at what this does to

211
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,920
brain chemistry. And so that's the other thing that I think you're also experiencing, although

212
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,680
in your swim, it was to a much higher degree than just taking a cold shower and ice bath. But you

213
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,800
were, I think, probably being flooded with endorphins and neurotransmitters that are very

214
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,640
positive. Absolutely. And you still do this. I mean, this is still kind of a part of your routine.

215
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,040
You're constantly taking an ice bath. Yeah. And it's probably about exactly what you're saying,

216
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,200
like the endorphin kick, but also, every time we get in the ice bath, whether I'm somewhat used to

217
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,640
it, it's still brutal. But the moment you get out, it's like you say, you've gone from one extreme

218
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,720
to another. So it's an instant sort of kick of happiness. But I find even like, you know,

219
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,720
just from inflammation, repair, the general mood, my if I had, you know, wake up in the morning,

220
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,360
and I'm feeling off and I'm achy and I'm not in the space, I can have a hot shower and like,

221
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm still a bit doughy, but I jump in the cold and completely different. It's a game changer.

222
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,120
So does Elsa join you? Do your kids join you? One of my kids often tries to jump in for

223
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,120
not that long, but gives it a go. Yeah. Elsa does it too. We have a sauna and an ice bath set up at

224
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,200
home. And it's the best. It's the best rehab. I couldn't agree more. Single best investment

225
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,600
I've ever made was the sauna cold plunge at home. Yeah, definitely. So let's talk about strength.

226
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,760
So Chris, you obviously spend a lot of time working on your strength training. What type of

227
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,960
program do you do? I mean, I've over the years, training for different roles and for Thor,

228
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,320
in particular, it was about getting big and mass. I do shoulders one day, arms and other, back,

229
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,080
chest, legs. Got it. Okay. You're okay? Uh-huh.

230
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,640
Obviously, he's in amazing shape. Most of us would look at Chris and give anything to look like that.

231
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,840
But there's always room for improvement. There are more than 600 muscles in the human body.

232
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,720
And for longevity, you've got to make good use of as many as possible.

233
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,880
So when I assessed Chris's muscular power and efficiency, his flexibility and agility,

234
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,200
I found he could be working a wider range of those muscles.

235
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,880
And he could improve his stamina.

236
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:30,520
I think that was, I think, an awesome episode because I think, and this is a great example of

237
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:38,360
where COVID really benefited the series. Because the initial challenge for strength was

238
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,280
kind of an interesting challenge, but I think the one you ultimately ended up doing was better.

239
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Yeah. And my only view on this was from a scientific perspective, what can we say about

240
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,640
strength and longevity or fitness and longevity and really like kind of grip strength,

241
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,400
cardiorespiratory fitness would be top of the list. And that's why I think that that challenge

242
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,360
was a perfect challenge because it's grip strength, it's top end cardiorespiratory fitness.

243
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,240
Yeah. Initially, yeah, initially it was I was going to be in a harness and pulling a car across

244
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,120
a section of land. And Ross Edgley had done that, I think for 20 hours or something crazy. So he was

245
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,720
like, I'll try and get it to that. And we were doing it and I did like, I did a good month, like

246
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,760
pulling the sled in the backyard. I had a little Polaris doing buggy thing that I was pulling for

247
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:38,920
a bit. And it just started to like, aggravate my back and joints and everything. And then so we

248
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,760
transitioned then to the rope climb. And as you say, it was probably more on point as far as the

249
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,080
science around strength and longevity. And then I started training for the rope climb, I'd never

250
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,720
climbed the rope before. And Ross had also done a feat like that. And so it was, was training me.

251
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,640
He said to me, look, you want to be strong, but you don't want to be heavy. The heavier you are,

252
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,120
the harder it is to get up that rope. So I had a three meter rope in my house.

253
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,680
And that's 10 feet for the Americans. Yeah, 10 feet my house. And I was going kind of three

254
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,440
quarters the way up and just jumping off and back up and down and doing loops like that.

255
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,840
And one day I jumped down, blew my ankle out and I ruptured all the ligaments and tore ligaments.

256
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,040
What happened by the way? Like, was there anything different that day?

257
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,440
I literally just landed on the... The UFC was on, right? My mates were in the next room and I was

258
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,680
in the gym where my house set up. And they got quit starting. I'm like, I'm just getting in 15

259
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,560
minutes and I'm up and down. And it must have been like, you know, last one. And I just jumped off

260
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,800
and I had a mat there and it just, I just rolled my ankle. And it just blew out. And straight away

261
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,760
looked at it was ballooned and utopia and all the team from Nat Geo were in Australia ready to shoot.

262
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,880
I think it was next week. So, I called them up and said, this ain't going to happen. And I had a

263
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,560
doctor have a look and I said, yeah, this is not good. And that was the rope. That was the foot.

264
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,640
I was going to anchor off as I was pulling myself up. And for folks that have seen Thor,

265
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,400
you've got kind of different bodies in there. Obviously, I assume the biggest you were in

266
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,280
Thor was that scene when you were in front of Russell Crowe. Yeah. By the way, I was that size

267
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,400
for that afternoon and kind of fluctuate through the film. Obviously, you pick your windows and

268
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,840
doors of kind of, you know, where to be your biggest. And this was like, I had been training

269
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:31,000
with Ross prior to that, and quite intensely and learned some pretty unique special things and how

270
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,440
to just kind of blast the body and do the most effective, intense workouts and when and what to

271
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,080
eat and so on. So, I was schooled in that more so than I'd ever been before. So, I had an opportunity

272
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,960
to get stronger, bigger than I ever was. But the timing of it didn't line up with this event. And so

273
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,160
Ross turns up and I tried to, hadn't been using the rope at all because I'd been working and we

274
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,360
started doing it and I was just heavy. And I was getting like three, four pulls up and I was just

275
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,280
like, everything was tightening up and so on. So, we had about two weeks where I just stopped lifting

276
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,960
weights completely. And it's funny, I don't know, you know, every time if you've ever put on a big

277
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,840
amount of muscle that it doesn't take long for your body to go. Okay, this is, we can switch gears

278
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:24,440
now. And so, I started doing a lot more rope pulls and sled pulls and got down to the Blue Mountains

279
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,960
where we shot and there was a... And what was your weight doing during that period of time? How much

280
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,920
weight were you dropping? I mean, it was only a few weeks, a little bit. But I was still... Did you

281
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,240
make an effort to reduce your intake as well? Yeah. Because you were eating like crazy. Two and a half

282
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,400
weeks. I stopped lifting weights. I reduced my calories pretty dramatically and maybe lost a

283
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,240
couple of kilo. I don't know. It might have been like two or nine or something. But still heavier

284
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,080
than I should have been for it. Yeah. And we get to the Blue Mountains and it's the most beautiful

285
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,360
setting. And there's the cable cart across two mountains. There's a thousand foot off the ground.

286
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,400
And we go out onto this cart and they throw the rope out and it's 100 feet the rope, which is

287
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,520
three, four times longer than anything I've climbed in my training or anything.

288
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,560
So again, this became less about what you've trained for this and more about just, again,

289
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:22,680
grit and will and just get up there. And I just remember Ross kind of at the top of the cart going,

290
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,960
make it a fist fight. Make it a fight. Come on, big man.

291
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,160
Stand by for the doors opening.

292
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
Got the rope going out.

293
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,920
Oh, don't even look out there.

294
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,560
Why? That's all hits me.

295
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,560
And all the little voices of doubt that I've been pushing aside in my mind

296
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,040
start to get louder and louder.

297
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm looking down and I'm thinking that is not something I fancy doing.

298
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,040
But I cannot let Chris see any moment of doubt in my mind at all.

299
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,240
Oh.

300
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,200
Switch on. Switch on. Switch on. Yeah.

301
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,680
Ready?

302
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,160
So I'm getting winched down and it feels a lot longer than 100 feet.

303
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,880
I don't want to look back up because I'm like, this is so much further than I've ever climbed.

304
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,280
How long did it actually take start to finish?

305
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,160
Probably, I don't know, probably a couple of minutes. It's a long time to be, there's no,

306
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,560
there's a harness that will catch me if I fall, but none of it is helping me up the road.

307
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,840
And I was surprised the quad burn was one of the most gnarly things.

308
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,600
More than your hands, more than your forearms.

309
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,800
Both, biceps and forearms. I mean, when I got off, I had like claws. I couldn't extend my fingers.

310
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,760
They were locked. But my quads and especially my right leg kind of doing the push and the anchor.

311
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,600
So how do you feel physically now from a strength perspective in terms of like

312
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,080
how this has kind of morphed your training a little bit?

313
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:45,320
I feel it's more specific, my training now. I used to just sort of go in,

314
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,200
and I still do to an extent, like, and just start throwing weights around and go,

315
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,840
I get biceps, I go back and I get chest and shoulders and just as heavy as I could,

316
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,680
as much as I could. And when I was a bit younger, I could get away with doing that.

317
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,440
And then now it's like, oh, geez, I'm just not warming that up properly.

318
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,080
Or, you know, you're kind of hitting everything too many times. And so

319
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,240
just being smart about the training. And that came from working with Ross and

320
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,200
my trainer Luke Zocki as well. And we did, he just targeted much more targeted approach.

321
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,240
He has really interesting, intense ways to work out though. It's everything is about sort of

322
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:31,400
explosive energy, like light up your, was it your parasympathetic nervous system and just

323
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,600
switch on sympathetic. Yeah. So what are you guys? Simultaneous? Sorry. Yeah.

324
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,160
And fire up and just explosive up and then slow negatives. That made dramatic differences. I got

325
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,840
far more gains than I had previously training like that. Now you actually, I don't think I've

326
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,720
told you this by the way, but you know, in the process of kind of going through a lot of your

327
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,160
genetic stuff, which we're doing now, right? Like, so kind of, we'll talk about this in a second,

328
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:59,880
but kind of doing this, you know, we actually found that you have a very favorable gene around

329
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,120
muscle fibers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I think that, you know, we were going to talk a second

330
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,360
about kind of like a gene you have that, that we wish we could erase, but on the flip side,

331
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,840
you got it. You've got a pretty favorable gene around a fast twitch muscle fibers. Yeah. So I

332
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,440
think, you know, you sort of have a genetic predisposition to be muscular and to be strong

333
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,280
and to be explosive. It's, I've always, even I was lean when I was younger, but as soon as I started

334
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,840
even when I was playing footy, you know, I was 17 doing more pushups, whatever I would, I would

335
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:38,200
grow. And it's, you know, I've always had to work my ass off in that space, but it, yeah, I do feel

336
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:46,040
I've had some, some benefits there. It's a, it's a great variant of a gene to have as you age,

337
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,640
because one of the hallmarks of aging is actually atrophy shrinkage of these fast twitch muscle

338
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,520
fibers. So shrinkage in Norway, definitely. Different type. Different type, but yes, yes,

339
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,880
yes. So as we get older, these slow twitch muscle fibers are shrinking in everybody. And that's why

340
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,520
people are losing strength and power and explosiveness most rapidly as they age,

341
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,560
much more than they're losing endurance, slow fiber, right? So, you know, one of the things

342
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,280
we always talk about with our patients is, Hey, we need you lifting weights all the time. Yeah.

343
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,240
You start early and you never stop lifting weights. And the heaviest you can lift is the

344
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,560
better because it's only through lifting heavy weights that you can really get those fast twitch

345
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,440
type two muscle fibers firing. So the fact that you kind of have a genetic predisposition to have

346
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,960
more of them is a good thing, which then brings us to kind of like some of the other stuff we talked

347
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:45,400
about. So, you know, one of my earliest memories of this whole experience was in December of 2019,

348
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,840
we took advantage of the fact that you were in LA to get some blood work done. And, you know,

349
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,200
Darren said, look, here's the deal. You and Chris are going to sit down in January in Australia to

350
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,400
kick off the first bit of shooting. And I want you to walk Chris through his blood work, just as you

351
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,160
would do with a patient the very first time. And I said, okay, great. So we get the, I get the blood

352
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,720
test back about two weeks before I'm supposed to go out to Australia. And I see something in it that

353
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,000
you know, I say, Darren, I can't walk him through this for the first time on camera.

354
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,160
It's not, that's not fair to him. And I know you guys would like, I mean, I know that that's what

355
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,640
sort of the drama is, but this is a bit too much. But I can't tell you, Darren, what it is. So

356
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,840
without telling you, you need to trust me that this can't be done on camera for the first time.

357
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,280
This one thing, you can do the whole lab, but this one thing. So I asked him to sort of trust me and

358
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,240
he did. And then that, and then we connected. So he called me first. Yeah. He caught him in a

359
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,200
panic and was like, you've got to call Peter Attia, something's come up. And, but I don't know what

360
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:58,680
it is. And I was like, how long have I got left? And, and so I was kind of rattled before we even

361
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:05,800
got on the phone. We did sort of the million dollar work up on you. We've got every blood test one can

362
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:12,360
get. And I've looked at every gene in your body six ways to Sunday. And overall, your labs look

363
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,040
fantastic. And I think looking at you from the outside, it's clear how much you take care of

364
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,240
yourself. But we did find a couple of things that are a cause for concern. Some of the genetic

365
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:34,440
testing that we did looked at a gene for a protein called ApoE. You have a very rare combination,

366
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,440
which is you have two copies of ApoE4, a set from your mom and a set from your dad.

367
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,000
And what does that mean exactly? That means you have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.

368
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,640
How much higher? Probably somewhere between eight and 10 times higher than that of someone in the

369
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:06,680
general population. You're right. Okay. You know, you're, I don't know, you're constantly thinking

370
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,280
you're going to live forever, especially as a young individual. And then to all of a sudden be

371
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,360
told all this may be the thing that might take you out was like, whoa, kind of floored me for a minute.

372
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:31,800
You know, it's hard to imagine, but it's my belief that if we take every step possible,

373
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,080
we can reduce your risk to that of anyone else. Sure. In fact, I don't think you'll believe me

374
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,760
when I say this, but I think you will in time. You having this gene is probably a blessing.

375
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,280
Because of the motivation that will get me to. Yeah. Yeah. This is going to motivate you to take

376
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,360
steps today that most people your age would never think about until there's their fifties or sixties.

377
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:04,520
Sure. I hadn't had too many patients that had this combination of ApoE4, four. It's not a very

378
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,360
common genotype. It's only about 1% of the population. So I've probably only at that time

379
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,760
had maybe three patients that had it. And truthfully, two of the three of them

380
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,600
kind of suspected it before the blood test based on their family history. In one case,

381
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:29,320
about a 40 year old woman, total shocker. And so I remember just sort of trying to say, look,

382
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,000
this is a gene that really increases risk of Alzheimer's disease, but it's not a deterministic

383
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,480
gene. And that's, I think just something someone like me can take for granted because I'm sort of

384
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,040
in this space. I understand that, but I think that's a hard concept to explain to somebody

385
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,720
who doesn't eat, sleep and breathe genetics, which is you have this gene and it doesn't guarantee

386
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,840
this thing is going to happen. And there are some genes that do, by the way, there were certain

387
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,280
genes that if you have the gene, if the gene for Huntington's disease, you're going to get

388
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,840
Huntington's disease. This isn't that kind of gene, but it's increasing your odds. And that's the bad

389
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,880
news. And then the good news is the earlier you know this, the more you can do to mitigate risk.

390
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,560
So that's sort of, that was my message, but what did you hear? I mean, how much do you think back

391
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:24,120
to that day? Again, I knew nothing about the science or the sort of the markers and so on

392
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,880
outside of that one conversation. And so I hung up and I was trying to explain it to my wife and

393
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,800
I was like, yeah, I'm not really sure what he just said, but I think I, you know, I'm more

394
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,920
vulnerable to Alzheimer's. And then we had another conversation. And I wish we'd had more

395
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,400
conversations immediately after because I did spend sort of a week going, what does this mean?

396
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,920
And I'm trying to talk to my parents about it. And they didn't know much about it either.

397
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:01,880
My grandfather has Alzheimer's and it's been very tragic to watch. And so they were aware of it,

398
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,320
but didn't know in any great detail about the gene combination we're talking about.

399
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,560
But as you say, it was just a good sort of kick in the ass and a reminder to, you know, do what I

400
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,160
can, whatever's within my control and within my power to give myself the best fighting chance.

401
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,240
And, you know, whatever work I'm doing for brain health benefits the rest of my body and the rest

402
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,320
of my life anyway. So, yeah, we turned it into a positive. You know, one of the things that was

403
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,320
sort of interesting about filming this is we obviously came out, we filmed it and we did

404
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,840
everything in duplicate for those episodes, right? We did it where we did everything. We talked about

405
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,760
all this and we went through all this stuff. And then of course, it was also done, which is, hey,

406
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,840
there's a really good chance that we're not going to want to talk about this particular aspect of

407
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,320
Chris's health publicly. So let's redo that whole thing, but without that. And I think for about

408
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,640
two years, it was, we didn't know which version of this was going to happen. Obviously, the decision

409
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,640
was a hundred percent yours. Why, when and why did you decide that you wanted to be public with

410
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:18,120
something so personal? Once I understood more about it, but also the same reason it's motivated me to

411
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,120
make positive changes, I thought, well, that's a great opportunity for anyone else out there

412
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,920
who may be in the same situation to either go and get checked or to understand more about brain

413
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:33,080
health and see what they have within their power to make that change. So I thought, oh, it's a,

414
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:41,160
I don't know, it's a missed opportunity to motivate others to do the same if I don't talk about it.

415
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,440
And then they cut together two versions of the episode. And the other one was just kind of fell

416
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:54,440
flat. So this had, there was no, it didn't over dramatize or exploit or anything. I think what

417
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,160
they did a great job at was it just became relatable. It became, and this is what most

418
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,360
of the series was like, look, he's a human being, like you or I, and you know, the sort of superhero

419
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:13,240
costume aside, this is an individual who has many of the same challenges and is up against the same

420
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,480
things that all of us. So even though you have two copies of the APO-E4 gene, which is a very

421
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,720
rare combination, you know, 20 to 25% of the population has at least one copy of the E4 gene.

422
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,480
And even though that doesn't increase their risk as much as the increase that you experience,

423
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,920
it still does. In fact, even though it's only 20 to 25% of the population that has that gene,

424
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,720
that group of people makes up about two thirds of cases of Alzheimer's disease. So I do think,

425
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,040
you know, I applaud you for doing it. And I'm really glad you did decide to do this because I,

426
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,320
I've always said I really wish every single person would know their APO-E genotype early in life.

427
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,320
And there, and there's a lot of resistance in the medical community to this truthfully. There are a

428
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,760
lot of physicians who would say, look, no one should know that. There's nothing that can be

429
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,240
done about it. Why would you burden somebody with that knowledge? And people like me and Richard

430
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,320
Isaacson, Kellyanne Neotis, you know, people I work with, I mean, we fundamentally disagree

431
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,720
with that, Chris. We think that is complete nonsense. And we think that this is absolutely

432
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,000
a condition through which you have an enormous lever arm to mitigate risk. And if that's true,

433
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,560
which I wholeheartedly believe it is, then not knowing that information early is criminal.

434
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,400
Yeah. Well, and also as we're saying that whatever I do in regards to, you know,

435
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,920
protection and arming myself with, you know, the sort of tools to have the best chance,

436
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,000
it benefits everything else anyway. You know, we talked about, you know, reducing stress levels,

437
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,960
more mindfulness practices, the certain training I do, nutrition, my sleep habits,

438
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,120
all those things about a dramatic difference in every other part of my life too. So,

439
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,400
you know, one of the things I'll talk about is sauna, right?

440
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,320
But Peter's convinced that regular saunas can boost my long-term health.

441
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,880
You know, now that we just got in here, Chris, let's take your pulse.

442
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:16,440
Yeah. You're about 64 beats per minute, but we've got this temperature cranked up to about 195

443
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,120
degree Fahrenheit. So let's see where you are in a couple of minutes.

444
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,640
I guess I got to get used to this hate. Yeah. We're uncomfortable right now because we're hot.

445
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,960
And in response to that, our body is trying to cool us off. And so it's pumping harder so that

446
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,640
your heart can quickly get the blood to the outside of your body. And just as exercise is known to help

447
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,560
with cardiovascular disease, I think sauna has a number of those benefits as well.

448
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,000
How much of a fan were you of sauna before we shot that series in Norway and then really kind

449
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,200
of got into the science of why it's likely, it hasn't been proven yet to the same extent that

450
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,200
some things have because so much of the data is observational, but it's so overwhelmingly

451
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,040
positive in the same direction with every single study. And I think we're quite confident it is.

452
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,000
You know, I know you've always enjoyed it, but has that taken on kind of a more urgent role?

453
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,160
Yeah, definitely. I mean, definitely during having shot the show, it's made it,

454
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,640
or it's become a bigger part of my daily routine, often after a workout. And again,

455
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,800
I don't know what the science says, but I know I feel great after doing it. Same with an ice bath.

456
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,560
And so if sort of mood elevation was the only thing, then I'm all about it.

457
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,960
Well, I would say even if, you know, the emphasis and the benefit of the heat shock proteins is less

458
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,240
than what we think, I agree with you. I think just the psychological benefit and the sleep benefit.

459
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,160
I mean, the difference in my sleep between when I sauna and when I don't is so noticeable that,

460
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,000
and we, you know, then again, are we going to question the benefits of sleep? I don't think so.

461
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,440
I mean, there is no doubt, even with if I've been training a lot and I wake up achy in particular,

462
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,560
you know, like I've had issues with my back over the years, if I wake up and I get in the sauna in

463
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:09,000
the morning and I do an ice bath or either or like, I feel 50, 60 percent better. And the sort of,

464
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,600
you know, that's the thing you lie in bed all night and you're in that position and

465
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,920
everything starts to kind of, I don't know, lies dormant and becomes, I don't know, there's no

466
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,360
fluidity there, you know what I mean? You wake up and you're stiff and sore and then you get into

467
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,400
one of those spaces, the hot, the cold or the hot. And instantly I feel like everything's just kind of

468
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,920
lit up and awakened. So when we think about kind of the last episode, which is the one that we saw

469
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:45,480
in the premiere, we were talking about this over breakfast today, but that episode maybe more than

470
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,840
any other really reaped the benefit of COVID because it had so much more time to flesh out.

471
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,320
You know, when I think about what the first version of the final episode was supposed to look

472
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,360
like, if this was kind of blasted through in 2020, I won't restate what that episode was supposed to

473
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,680
be, but it was kind of gimmicky. It didn't work. I didn't think it would work. And then what it became

474
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,560
is unbelievable. What was, in your mind, how was the evolution of that episode? Because I,

475
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,480
did you have much of a hand in the creative side of that or were you kind of just a passenger?

476
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,640
I was a passenger and I was kept in the dark intentionally. Darren didn't want me to know

477
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:30,600
much about it. It was an immersive theater experience and I'm glad I didn't know it because

478
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,640
I feel like I would have had preconceived sort of ideas and then expectations and I wouldn't,

479
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,240
you know, couldn't have helped acting a certain way or reacting a certain way based on that. So

480
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:46,760
to go into it blind and just open and ready for whatever they were going to throw at me or throw

481
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,560
me into was exciting and different to the other episodes. Everything else was about being prepped

482
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:57,080
in some way and learning and understanding some of the science prior to shooting, whereas this,

483
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,080
it was about all I knew was it was about the acceptance of death.

484
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,040
All I've been told is that I'm about to jump forward 50 years into the future

485
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,960
and spend the next three days living the life of an octogenarian.

486
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,200
The architect of this strange challenge is Dr. PJ Miller, a world-renowned pallet

487
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:37,880
of care physician. His work centers on unlocking the transformative power of accepting aging

488
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,880
and death. Dying offers us something but we can change how we see it, what we do with it,

489
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,680
how we play with it. Chris is about to take part in a truly unique experiment.

490
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,560
Ready my old man? Uh, don't know. I mean ask me in three days time, baby.

491
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:05,400
What did that suit feel like? Uh, just uncomfortable and incredibly restrictive.

492
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:13,720
And I talk about this in the episode, the way people then spoke to me because I knew I couldn't

493
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,360
hear properly and you know there was all this condescending sort of patronizing tone of,

494
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:24,360
you know, how you hear people and some of the time talk to the elderly, you know.

495
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:31,640
And it may be immediately going, oh my god, I hope I don't do that. But incredibly isolating too,

496
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:40,520
visions diminished and as I said you can't hear restricted so everything is, has been,

497
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,120
has been pulled away. All the sort of your abilities that were there the hour before I put

498
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,400
it on. And also not having 50 years to transition into that. Yeah, overnight. One extreme to the

499
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,800
other in the opposite direction to what we've told them before. There are so many things about

500
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,440
that episode that are beyond beautiful. One of them to me, it's just a very subtle thing is that

501
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,480
all of the residents of that place were not actors. Yeah. And what was it like kind of

502
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,320
interacting with them? Because you know you watch the episode, it's like a, you know,

503
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,960
slightly over an hour long episode, but I assume shooting it was days, at minimum three days.

504
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:21,800
Yeah. So you have a lot of time on that set. I reckon some of those folks didn't necessarily

505
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,800
know who you were prior to that episode. I don't think I'm down to be honest. Which must have been

506
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,240
a great relief, wasn't it? It was, it was really nice. It was, it was unique and different on so

507
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:41,320
many levels that that episode. But to be in a retirement village with elderly folks who,

508
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,600
you know, were there for the fun of the episode, but were just genuine and truthful and honest and

509
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,520
didn't hold back with anything that we're thinking. And there was sort of the no filter

510
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,960
approach to things was, it was great. It was refreshing, you know, I think being in a sort of

511
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,280
industry where a lot of people do know who you are. And a lot of the time you're sort of

512
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,440
supporting what you're doing and everything's kind of tried to, you know, be made or be

513
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:17,560
accommodating as possible. That was like, no, you're one of us now. And it was fantastic. It

514
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:25,160
brought me straight back to Earth, if I'd drifted previously. Well, having known you for many years

515
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:31,640
now, you're pretty down to Earth. But I still think that that must have been even another level

516
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:38,120
because you're so far out of your comfort zone. This wasn't the, there's no superhero component

517
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,320
to this. No. I was a lot more nervous about that episode than anything else. Because it wasn't

518
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,840
something I could fight or muscle through or just put my head down, you know, grip my teeth and go

519
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:58,120
for it. I had to be completely open and vulnerable and accessible and confront things that I had

520
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,920
never really thought about that much and interact with people who were at the end of their days,

521
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:14,360
or who had dealt with death in very extreme ways or come close to death. And so to go from sort of

522
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:20,600
one environment of physical sort of challenges and feats and then go into this emotional state

523
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:28,920
was a real shock and an adjustment. And I'm so proud of what the episode is and became because

524
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,680
it's unlike anything I've certainly ever done, but unlike anything I think that I've seen before in

525
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,280
the doc space. Several moments that really stood out to me. I'm guessing you didn't know

526
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,640
B.J. Miller's story before that episode. No, I didn't. Because it came across as

527
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,200
really genuine when you're hearing it for the first time on camera. It looked to me as though

528
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,160
that was the first time you were hearing. It was. Do you recall what that felt like? Because it

529
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,960
seemed like you got quite emotional. And I'm curious as to what was more emotional. Was it

530
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:08,360
the tragedy of his story or was it more how moved you were by his resilience and how he overcame it

531
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:15,160
to do what he's doing? A combination of things. He's one of the most unique individuals I've ever

532
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,320
met. This is something saintly and otherworldly about him. He is such a beautiful individual.

533
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:32,440
Certainly his story shook me. And also the strength now that in which he reflects upon it

534
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:41,080
and his attitude toward what happened to him was so inspiring. It made me, you know, I was in a,

535
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,080
I was really exhausted coming into that episode. I was at the end of a, you know,

536
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,840
felt like a five year run of different films and work and we're shooting this series throughout.

537
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:58,440
And I was, I think I was more vulnerable than I'd been in a long time, just out of exhaustion,

538
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,560
but also out of the questions that were starting to circulate through my head. And a lot of them

539
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:12,360
were to do with, you know, this point in my life and, and, um, am I proud of what I've done? Am I,

540
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:21,480
you know, what's next? Um, and all I kept thinking was I have been sprinting through life and the

541
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,880
moments and opportunities and I'm grateful for them, but I've been very quickly going to the

542
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:36,920
next one, the next one, next one. And I was in a, in a bit of a state of, um, what's next and,

543
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,160
and what's the point and who am I and all of these kind of, uh, questions that I hadn't sort of

544
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:49,400
been able to analyze, but were there in the back of my head. And my mum had said something to me

545
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,880
a few days before that she'd, she'd had this experience where she came pretty close to what

546
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,680
she thought was going to be her death in a very instant sort of moment. Um, and she's fine now,

547
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:05,400
but said, Oh, you know, I wasn't at all afraid to go because I realized I'm so thankful for my life

548
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,160
and I'm so happy that everything I've had and all the experiences I have. And I thought, well,

549
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,200
what a beautiful feeling. And then in that moment, I think I was talking to BJ about it and I got

550
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,600
really emotional because I realized that I just, well, I'm not ready yet. You know, I, I have all

551
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,160
these beautiful things around me and family and friends, but I can't go yet. This is not,

552
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,600
this is not my time. And, and, and it was strange because we're manipulating

553
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,880
everything in that space to make me feel like I'm going to die. And I'm asked to think about my

554
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,320
death, what, how I would want it to be. And so on. But I had this, this sort of sense of urgency

555
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,000
just, I'm not ready. And it made me think about my kids and how they're growing up and things are

556
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,640
changing so dramatically. And like, oh, I just want, I want to sit, I want to, I want to soak it

557
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,720
in. I don't want to be in a sprint anymore. I want to be more present. I want to be right here and

558
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:04,920
appreciate everything that's in front of me. And, and again, I, it, I tried to articulate that a few

559
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:12,680
times and, and I, I feel, I don't know if I've hit the nail on the head is exactly why it's something

560
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:24,120
in me sort of felt so fragile at that point. But yeah, it, that whole experience sort of

561
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:32,680
shook me to my core and made me want to slow down and just race home to my family and my kids and

562
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,040
not jump on another plane and travel and work and do anything else. You know, it was, it was, we in

563
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:46,120
in the best way. I think the time when you were sitting on the bench next to Natalie was sort of

564
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:51,320
equally profound. At least it appeared that way as an observer. I assume it's the same. You weren't

565
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,840
aware of Natalie's story and you're probably sitting there thinking, why are they having me

566
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,600
sit and talk to a 27 year old, very normal, healthy appearing woman? Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

567
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:12,040
Okay. Again, just such a, again, that what she said particularly was there's an urgency from her

568
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:18,680
to shake people and say, wake up. It doesn't last forever. You know, it could, you're, the end could

569
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:24,600
come at any moment. So make the most of it and love and laugh and live with a sense of gratitude and

570
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:33,160
joy and incredibly inspiring and heartbreaking hearing what she's been facing at such a young

571
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:41,160
age too. And I'm really thankful that I had those conversations and I was forced to think this way

572
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,960
and had this realization now, not when I'm 80, you know, I'm glad I'm not sitting on my deathbed

573
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,840
going, ah, damn, I should have done this. I could have done this. I found out I've done that. So,

574
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,600
I don't know. I feel like there's just sort of an awakening or sort of shake up or whatever you

575
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:05,880
want to call it, um, came at the perfect time for me. You and I talked about this at like last month,

576
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,360
I think, but you haven't had more than two months off in about 10 years, right? Yeah, pretty much.

577
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,880
So we've had, you know, during COVID, but even then I was still working or prepping things.

578
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:28,200
So how, how do you reconcile the fact that you work so hard and you've been so successful

579
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,520
and with that success has come so many wonderful things, right? It's,

580
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,200
you've got wealth, you've got fame, you've got a platform, right? We're sitting here talking about

581
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,440
more people are going to know what the Apo E4 gene is and why they need to be tested and what

582
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,400
they can do about it because of this episode, because of this series than anything else that

583
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,080
would have ever come out of the scientific literature ever. And all of that is attributed

584
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,600
to the fact that you have a platform to do this. So there's all of these amazing things,

585
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,040
both to you personally and to society at large that come from this, but at the same time,

586
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:07,400
that's not sustainable. Um, you once told me a story about something your daughter said

587
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:12,920
when you kind of half jokingly suggested to her, you might retire. Do you remember what that was?

588
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,520
Yeah. Um, yeah, I was talking to her and as I've done, feel like I've been doing for a long time,

589
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,520
my kids and like, you know, every time I've left to go on another trip, I'm going to work. I'm like,

590
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,440
it's not long, you know, and soon I'm going to take some downtime. And I think, you know,

591
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,880
my daughter sort of rolls her eyes at times these days and says, yeah, sure. And I, um, I said,

592
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:37,000
and then this time I said, look, you know, when I've done this tour, I'm, I'm having a big chunk

593
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,880
of time at home and she goes, oh, great. Awesome. Be fun. And, and I said, yeah. And maybe, maybe I'll

594
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,720
just, maybe I'll just retire. Maybe, maybe this is it. Maybe I'll stay home with you forever now.

595
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:51,640
And she's like, no, dad, you can't. And I was like, why aren't you guys kids love seeing you play

596
00:57:51,640 --> 00:58:00,120
Thor. And it was just beautiful kind of moment of like, oh yeah, maybe it does. There is a purpose

597
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,640
to it. You know, I think for me, it's, I've been chasing my career and, and I've been doing it

598
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:12,040
for a number of reasons, but you know, it's been my journey and there's a sense of sort of guilt

599
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,920
that comes with that of sort of chasing down my dreams all the time. And when you have kids, it's

600
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,360
not about your dreams anymore. It's about theirs and I have a family to take care of. And, um,

601
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,480
I was really sort of questioning kind of what I've contributed or done. And hearing her say that was

602
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:35,560
like a, you know, beautiful little moment. And so I don't want to retire and, and, you know,

603
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:44,200
for a number of reasons, but, um, I certainly want to replenish and, you know, fill up my cup again.

604
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:51,960
I feel like it's, uh, it's just been sort of flat stick for so long now. Um, and I've loved it.

605
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,360
And I'm very thankful for it, but I need to have, you know, a chunk of time at home now and sort of,

606
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,120
yeah, I get re-inspired, I guess.

607
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:07,880
Yes. How was your sleep now compared to three years ago? Because I remember when you struggled,

608
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,520
you had a, you had a very restless mind. You would, you would wake up a lot in the middle of the night

609
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:18,360
and you'd have a thought and you'd fixate on it. And sometimes it was a very rational thought. Like,

610
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,600
you know, I'm worried about the success of this film. I'm worried about my relationship with my

611
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:27,480
wife. I'm worried about like, these were all very normal things to be, uh, concerned with, but, but

612
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,880
they would wake you up, right? And you wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. And then sometimes

613
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,320
they were things that maybe seemed less rational. Um, which by the way, I'm not being critical of

614
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,960
you because every one of us has those very irrational thoughts. Mostly irrational.

615
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:50,120
It's a dress. It definitely affects my sleep. And this is just going back a few years, you know,

616
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,760
this is not such a big issue these days, but, um, actually it's not true. It is.

617
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:05,640
Yeah. Like I'll go to sleep fine. And then at two 30, there's a shot of adrenaline and my brain will

618
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,760
just start going through a checklist of things. We'll like, does that bother me? Does that bother

619
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,400
all that one? Yeah, good. Let's think about that. Let's tear that apart.

620
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:21,240
Are you getting nervous a bit now? A little wave of nausea.

621
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,800
Sometimes I don't even know why. And I wish I could deal with that stress better.

622
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:43,240
Just got a whole lot really different. Not just because it sucks.

623
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,680
But also it could be killing me.

624
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,160
How, how has that changed? And has this, has this series given you a different perspective

625
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:06,360
on anything that has, has given you more peace? Yeah, definitely. Um, I think generally I'm

626
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:12,840
sleeping better than, than I was back then. Uh, I think just running in a state of fight or flight

627
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,840
constantly. And you know what, but that was required for me to become an actor, you know,

628
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,400
to, to, for me to leave Australia with, you know, not a whole lot of money in the bank and

629
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,440
live on people's couches and audition and audition and, you know,

630
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,200
do it, go, go through that sort of grind and be told no a million times and still, you know,

631
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:43,960
obsessively be pushing forward requires a huge amount of compulsive, obsessive sort of, you know,

632
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:50,600
self-motivated drive. And then the problem is you then start to achieve those things.

633
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:57,720
And I'm no longer in the same sort of fight that I was, but I'm still acting like I am. My internal

634
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,360
sort of environment is still thinking it's, you know, running away from the dinosaurs or whatever,

635
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:09,480
you know, goes back to, sort of, to our sort of ancestral, you know, makeup. And so,

636
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:16,520
you know, my, the more comfortable I get, the more I sort of rationally talk myself through,

637
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,240
hey, it's all okay now, you know, like you're, you know, we can afford to do this and this and

638
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:30,040
this and you don't have to worry so much about it not working out. Some of that dissipates, but

639
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:37,400
it's there all the time, you know, and I'd be lying if I said that I had a complete handle on it.

640
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:44,360
But again, I don't want to kind of dismiss it too much because it's what got me here. And it's a

641
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:51,800
tool that I will still need to use at certain times. It's just monitoring that. And I don't know,

642
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:57,080
I hear a lot of people talk about that, though, you know, people in the sort of friends of mine,

643
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:02,360
sports players and so on with that, what's required to get them to that place. It's a blessing and a

644
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:09,240
curse, you know, and it's a hard thing to switch on, switch off, sorry, once you've opened the gates.

645
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:15,880
Yeah, I think that's a very common thread for people who have achieved great success. And

646
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,040
when you think about your motivation, right, when you think about

647
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:34,920
the love you have for your craft, is there a way to use excitement more than fear? Like how,

648
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,760
you know, because I think back to, you know, your beginning, right, as you talked about,

649
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,920
you know, you've spoken a lot about, and I think you even did in some of the episodes, you spoke

650
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:48,360
about how, you know, one day you found out your father, you know, like wasn't going to be paying

651
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:53,480
off the mortgage anytime soon. Like you sort of had this realization of the fact that your parents

652
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:59,480
have done so much for you and your brothers with the means that they had. But you wanted more for

653
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:05,160
them. And so part of your fuel for success was like, I want to take care of my family as well,

654
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,720
not just the kids that I'm going to have, which you didn't yet have, but like, these people who

655
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:16,600
you love so much. And there's a bit of fear in that, right? There's a bit of like, do or die.

656
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,360
But at the same time, there's also a real passion you have for what you do.

657
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:28,360
You're, in other words, you're an artist, right? And so artists enjoy making art.

658
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,880
Is it about shifting the balance of what's the fire? Like, where's the fire coming from? Is the

659
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,120
fire coming from a place of fear? Is the fire coming from a place of love? I mean, do those do

660
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,200
those go back and forth for you from time to time in different seasons? Yeah, I used to get, I had,

661
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:52,280
excuse me, very intense, like, performance anxiety when I was first acting. And I would, it was

662
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,360
debilitating, I would go to auditions, and I'd want to throw up, but it'd be shaking. And then

663
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,920
even when I got jobs, and I don't know how I was getting jobs based on how nervous I was in those

664
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:06,120
auditions, but I was then be on a set. And it was like, I couldn't think or see, you know, I felt

665
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:13,320
I was gonna pass out like, and I had, I was fighting that for years. And you talk about fear

666
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:19,800
or excitement. And I remember reading something that took a series of tests with athletes,

667
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:28,360
performers, musicians, actors, whatever, anyone in a sort of adrenaline fueled sort of space.

668
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,880
And they said, Okay, before the event, are you nervous or excited? And some of them said they

669
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,160
were scared out of their mind. Some of them said they were pumped. The interesting thing was they

670
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:45,320
all had the same physical response, yeah, elevated heart, pulse, etc. Clammy hands, shorter breath,

671
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,720
all the only difference was how they labeled that feeling. And so for me, that was a real light bulb

672
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:58,440
moment. And I thought, Oh, okay, so when this feeling comes out, I've been about to walk onto a

673
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:05,080
set. And what and you know, I programmed myself to say, Oh, this is bad fear, this is fear, this is

674
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:10,840
a negative. Yeah. I then went, Nope, this is this is a positive. I'm getting my spidey senses right

675
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,880
now. I'm going to be able to think faster, react quicker, I'm going to see clearer, I'm going to,

676
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,760
you know, my vision will be sharp. And it was and that was all it was was a decision then to see it

677
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:28,520
differently. Then sort of, you know, as time goes on, I think the fear does have its place though,

678
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,240
you know, I think you sort of would have heard people talking that the fear pushes you, your

679
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:40,360
purpose pulls you. And both of them need to have equal sort of relevance in the conversation. And

680
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:47,400
it's a bloody good motivator to, you know, the half of these challenges, my fear of looking ridiculous

681
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,880
if I didn't complete this task, or the fact that the episode wouldn't have worked, you know,

682
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,080
they kept me going. But also the sort of purpose and why I was doing it kept me going. So I think

683
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:03,640
that both deserve conversation, just it's about balance. And if and if either of them get too much

684
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:09,240
attention, then you know, you have too much of my purpose and my thing, it can be like a humility

685
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:17,720
there, you know, the fear I fear I fear has I feel has allowed me to have more of a self deprecating

686
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,000
sort of sense of humor about myself, and the world and the work and hopefully kept me humble to.

687
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:31,960
What was the first role you had where you allowed yourself to think, I'm gonna make it?

688
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:40,520
Well, it's interesting, the first Thor film, I thought, great, this is, I mean, the game, certainly.

689
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,160
But what you would hear was the first Thor film.

690
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:52,120
Oh, God, was it 2010? Yeah, yeah. I thought this is good. I'm kind of in the mix. But I didn't know

691
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,640
if the film was going to work. I didn't know if we're going to do an Avengers film. And you weren't

692
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,480
the first choice? Or were you? Wasn't there something funny in the audition there? Yeah,

693
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:05,640
there was I auditioned initially, that didn't get a callback. It got some pretty bad feedback.

694
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:15,560
And what was the feedback? Just no good. Just really direct feedback, really like minimal feedback,

695
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,680
which is like, you're not even we're not even gonna give you any sort of, you know, constructive

696
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,480
criticism or anything. It was just kind of minimal and nothing. And, and I was shooting a film in

697
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,680
Vancouver. And my little brother calls me up and said, Oh, they're gonna fly me out from Australia

698
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,240
to LA for this film Thor. And I was like, What? And he was like, Yeah, I don't know, I sent an

699
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:38,280
audition on a tape and going over and like, Oh, that's awesome, man. Congrats. Wow. What do you

700
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,240
know? And then the trades, I think variety or deadline come out and had like the six final

701
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:49,800
guys for Thor and Liam was one of those people. And it was with Josh Whedon and Drew Goddard on

702
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,960
his cabin in the woods. And they both said, What the hell's going on here? Is this your brother?

703
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,160
And I go, Yeah, and he goes, Why are you in the mix? You should be Thor. And I was like,

704
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:03,560
I didn't get a call back. So none of them ended up getting it. They reopened the casting. And I got

705
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:10,520
a chance to do an audition and I sent in a tape. And I was called back in to meet with Ken Branner

706
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,880
and do the audition. And I just had a very different attitude about it. I didn't put anyone

707
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:19,480
at pedal store like I did the first time I had like, there was a little little shift off. Yeah,

708
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:25,640
my brother had gotten there and I hadn't and it was a good motivation. And and it was about

709
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:30,920
perspective, you know, and then I was able to walk in that room and give the best version of

710
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,800
whatever I had to offer, as opposed to people pleasing and going and going, Is this what you

711
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,840
want? Or is it this this way? And then, you know, there's nothing. There's a lack of strength there,

712
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,840
I think that needed the character to be assertive. And so I had a lot more sort of

713
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:51,080
presence in that space. And I did the first time around. And then, then got the part.

714
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:56,600
How long does an audition take? Well, I mean, usually you have a few days to learn it. Sometimes

715
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:02,200
you have a call you at lunchtime and they say, come in this afternoon and read. And but when

716
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:08,120
you're actually there in front of them, it can be, again, depending on how well or bad it goes,

717
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:13,560
it could be five minutes, it could be two minutes, it could be an hour. And I've had I've had both.

718
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:17,480
I've had like people answer the phone midway through my audition when I first got the town

719
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:22,200
and just be like, Yeah, yeah, cool. Yeah, yeah. And I'm like, I'm supposed to be still going. And

720
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,600
just like, Yep, that's great. Thank you very much. We'll call you. And you're like, Oh, my God,

721
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:31,720
it's good. Brutal. You get enough of them and it's you either become numb to it or it destroys you.

722
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,040
How'd you hear about Rush?

723
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,720
So Ron Howard was making the film. I didn't know anything about Formula One.

724
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,720
Because you didn't know me.

725
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:47,160
I didn't know you. I didn't know you. And, and I said, my agent had called me and said, Oh,

726
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:51,960
you should do an audition. And Ron said, Oh, look, I've seen Floyd. He's great, but he's not right

727
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,240
for the character. You know, he won't fit in the Formula One car. And I said, I said, Well,

728
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,560
I'm not that size. And he said, Yeah, it's okay. And I said, I'm doing it and doing an audition.

729
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,240
And I watched an interview with James Hunt. And my hair was kind of long enough that I could kind

730
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:11,560
of style it exactly how his was. And I had, you know, been practicing the accent and didn't

731
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:17,800
audition and he saw it and went, Okay, cool. He already picked Daniel for Nicky. I think he had.

732
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:23,400
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, my feelings on that film. Yeah. Like, if you were able,

733
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:29,720
if you were getting a dollar for every time that film got watched by me, I would, you'd be even

734
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:38,280
more wealthy. Yeah, mate. I'm, I'm, I'm so thankful. It's such a good movie. You would know it better

735
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:43,800
than I do at this point. I haven't seen it since, since the premiere. Are you kidding me? It's hard

736
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:50,760
to watch yourself, you know, it's, um, so you don't take your kids to Thor and they don't watch it

737
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,200
around the house. I know you take them to the premiere, but like, yeah, um, no, I'll take them

738
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:59,640
to a cave. Well, that was the first premiere I took them to, but, um, I'll watch it once or twice,

739
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:04,600
or if I'm producing it, then I'm, I have to, you know, stick through it a bit more, but, um,

740
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,000
it's, you know, and it should be uncomfortable, I think. Yeah. This is something Gnostos says,

741
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,200
think about enjoying it too much. So if we're sitting here in five years and your life is better

742
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:21,720
than it is today, especially in accordance with the final episode of Limitless, right? Meaning

743
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:32,280
you're running less. Um, the balance between purpose and fear is more in favor of purpose than

744
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:41,320
fear. You feel more connected to your kids, your family. What has to be true? What are you doing?

745
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,400
Look, I don't think it's, um, this is another thing that came up in the episode. I just want

746
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:53,480
to sort of clarify. I don't feel like I've been doing anything wrong as much as I've just been

747
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:58,680
in the storm of it. Yeah. And I have a beautiful relationship with my kids and my wife and my

748
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:04,840
family. It's, and I'll be there with them, but my brain is pulled in and in other places. And so

749
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,880
for things to be even better, um, would just be about, like, is it just about a state of mind or

750
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:20,280
does it mean it's both? Because in the episode I was talking about this and I said, I was being

751
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:26,040
asked to imagine what my death would look like. And if this was my final moment, who would I have

752
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:31,240
around me? Where would I be? And I realized it's in the living room with my family and friends. And

753
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:38,520
that's every other weekend. Yeah, I have it. So it was as much a moment of it's already right here in

754
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:46,840
front of you, change your attitude. And also in addition to that was, okay, I want to do this even

755
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:52,440
more now. And I have an opportunity to do that because I'm not in the fight or the sprint anymore.

756
01:13:52,440 --> 01:14:00,520
And so it would be to be more curated with my choices and have more time pre and post the film

757
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:06,920
to prepare and decompress as opposed to just piling one after the other. Does that mean more

758
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:12,520
directing, you know, shifting the balance a little bit? I think it's who the directors are, you know,

759
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,720
I think working with people that are at the top of their game and I've been so lucky to work with

760
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:24,120
some wonderful people. But to continue just work with George Miller, and to continue to work with

761
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:30,360
individuals like that, where I'm learning from them, it's a collaboration, but they're at the helm,

762
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,280
they're steering the ship, I don't have to feel like I got to police anyone else there, you know,

763
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,600
is the dream. And then you're inspired by those people. And you're doing it for the right reasons.

764
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:46,840
It's from an artistic space and an expression as opposed to, you know, a financial one. Oh,

765
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,560
that's a good payday. Script sucks, but I get paid well, you know, so I've done a few times,

766
01:14:51,560 --> 01:15:00,440
you know. And so, yeah, to be more curated in my choices and, you know, have more stillness and

767
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:06,440
more calm either side of it. Chris, I think, you know, I think about the last three years and I

768
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,400
think about the when we started this thing in January, for me, one of the most unexpected

769
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,400
joys of this because I, you know, I really only did this because of Darren, you know, Darren and I

770
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:20,280
were and remain such good friends and the chance to do something fun like this with him was the

771
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:26,280
motivation. But I think, you know, a very pleasant surprise for me has been meeting you and meeting

772
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:32,200
all the people around you. And it gives me great comfort as now someone who's become a close friend

773
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:37,960
of yours to know that you are surrounded by these amazing people, you know, like Ben and Aaron and

774
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,560
Zock and your family and your parents and your brothers. I mean, you are rich, Chris, you are

775
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:50,760
rich in people. And I suspect that's actually probably your greatest asset. So it's been a real

776
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,720
privilege to be a part of that. Well, it's been wonderful getting to know you too, mate. It's

777
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,440
been the biggest joys that people have met through this experience and the knowledge, one thing with

778
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,280
the friendships that are most important. So thank you, buddy. Thanks for sitting down with me.

779
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,040
Bye.
