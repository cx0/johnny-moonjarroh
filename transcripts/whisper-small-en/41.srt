00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,200
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,560
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,800
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,080
for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,200
back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,920
notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,000
of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,440
getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,040
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,560
consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr.

46
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Jake Kushner, a close friend and a pediatric endocrinologist who specializes in helping manage

47
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,480
people with type 1 diabetes. In this episode, we go into great detail about type 1 diabetes. Probably

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,840
the biggest takeaway from this episode is that diet can help people not only with type 2 diabetes,

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,680
but also type 1. Jake discusses some of the recent findings in an approach that one of the pioneers

50
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,640
in this field, Dr. Richard Bernstein, championed for several decades now, managing carbohydrates

51
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,760
and protein to manage insulin and glucose. And if you're thinking, well, I don't have type 1 diabetes,

52
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,200
why does this matter to me? The answer is anybody with a pancreas is going to benefit from this.

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,920
And obviously those without a pancreas, which is effectively what is happening in type 1 diabetes.

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,720
We also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exogenous

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,360
insulin are at substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,000
levels of insulin. This concept also has implications for everyone else, as I said,

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,280
because the word exogenous and endogenous can be interchanged quite easily when it comes to insulin.

58
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,760
We cover some of the basics, the history, the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes,

59
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,320
and more importantly, what we can do to help kids with this disease and their families and the non

60
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,680
diabetics out there learn from them and their disease. So without further delay, here's my

61
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,680
conversation with Jake Kushner. Hey Jake, thanks for coming over, man. Hey Peter, thanks for having

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,800
me. It's a pleasure. What do you think is the probability we will get through this

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,080
discussion today without one of my kids barreling into this room? Absolutely zero, especially given

64
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,480
that I met both of them and they're incredibly rambunctious and cute. Well, you met two boys,

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,800
but there's a girl too. She's much more well behaved. So you're in town, I guess we can't

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,760
talk about it, it's black ops mission, right? No, it's actually, so I'm an advisory council

67
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,160
for Sanofi and I've been an advisor about this drug, Sotycophilosin, which is part of a new

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,840
class of drugs that will hopefully benefit people with type 1 diabetes, these adjuvant therapies,

69
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,720
molecules that you take in addition to insulin. I've been involved in this program now for close

70
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,440
to seven years. And I know off mic, we've spoken a little bit about some of those compounds. They're

71
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,840
super interesting, not just for type 1 diabetes, but potentially type 2 diabetes. And frankly,

72
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,440
if you subscribe to the idea that lower levels of glucose and insulin are just better overall,

73
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,840
there may even be other applications. So before we get into that, we met, it's been three or four

74
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,320
years now, right? We met in Houston over dinner one night. And I gave you credit for this recently

75
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,680
on a podcast that hasn't yet released, but it will release. It was actually you who first told me

76
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,720
about CGM, although it was officially Kevin Sayre at Dexcom that got me fully hooked. So,

77
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,240
whenever I'm talking to somebody and they ask me about a question that has to do with type 1

78
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,120
diabetes, I generally say, I know very little about this condition, but you should meet

79
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,520
Jay Kushner because not only does he get it, but I think his outcomes are pretty unique. I think

80
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,760
we're seeing more people move towards the realization that you and people who think like you have.

81
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,600
So you're a pediatric endocrinologist. Did you always know you wanted to do that?

82
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Well, I was trying to decide in between being a pediatrician and being a molecular biologist.

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,440
And my parents are basic scientists. And there was a well-worn path in between

84
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,760
molecular biology and endocrinology. So that was a really typical thing back in the mid 80s.

85
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,280
And I thought I would do that. And the classical path as an endocrinologist is to go and find a

86
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,640
rare disorder and discover the molecular basis for it and find some unique product that you could

87
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,840
then replace and provide it. And then you're good to go. And there's a lot of endocrinologists who

88
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,960
made quite a bit of hay on that paradigm. And so I was also interested in pediatrics. I was trying

89
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,280
to decide between all these things when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley and working pretty much

90
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,040
continuously in basic science research labs all the way through Berkeley and then for several years

91
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,560
afterwards as a research technician, first at UCSF and then Oregon. So I applied to medical school

92
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,000
and I get in and I think I'm going to be a pediatrician. And my mother was greatly disappointed

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,280
that I didn't become a basic scientist. She viewed science as much more compelling than

94
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,880
becoming a pediatrician. Or any doctor for that matter, right? I mean, there could be no greater

95
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,280
letdown to scientific parents that you would show something as low as medicine. And I was literally

96
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,320
the only kid in medical school whose mother was disappointed that I didn't end up going

97
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,880
to graduate school. It makes you feel any better. My dad was very disappointed that I went to medical

98
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,320
school too. I found myself there. I thought I was going to be a pediatrician. I did my clinical

99
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,560
rotations and it totally reinforced it. And I just love being on the wards and interacting with kids.

100
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,840
And then ended up as a pediatric resident at Brown and had again, I worked in molecular

101
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,720
endocrinology as a researcher before I went to medical school and was enamored by endocrinology

102
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,840
in general. And I applied and got into this program at Boston Children. So there I was in

103
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,320
this incredibly busy, rigorous, unbelievably complicated place. And that's when this crazy

104
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,320
thing happened in my life. And so I thought I was going to find some esoteric metabolic disease to

105
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,640
work on. And you were at the right place to do it because for the folks listening who might not know

106
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,960
this, there are probably what four major pediatric centers in North America, Boston Children's,

107
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,880
obviously in Boston, SickKids in Toronto, CHOP in Philly, and maybe Texas Children's. Would that

108
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,640
be in the top four? Yeah, and UCSF. That's right. Would UCSF actually make the top five? At the

109
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,320
time it did. Okay. Incredibly strong. So I sort of thought I would do this and I'd find some

110
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,160
esoteric disease, like maybe work on calcium or, you know, but as a first year endocrine fellow,

111
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,320
we're running around an incredibly busy service and we're interacting with families of children

112
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,560
who are newly diagnosed. And it's such a compelling with type one diabetes and it's so compelling. So

113
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,080
we would take call, the ER would call us, oh, there's a child who's been diagnosed. We come

114
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,600
in the next morning and meet these families. And, you know, there's a tearful, exhausted,

115
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,280
overwhelmed mother. There's a kid who literally looks like she's been like shot out of a cannon,

116
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,000
you know, with multiple IVs and scars in her, in her arms from blown IVs. And

117
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,680
we'd have to try to work through this idea that they were going to be insulin dependent for life.

118
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,960
And I just thought, wow, this is really an amazing and challenging problem. And it has so many aspects

119
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,960
of medicine that I appreciate as most importantly, human elements, but there's also basic science.

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,680
The diagnosis is, I mean, I had one experience with this before I got to medical school, which

121
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,400
was in college. I had a really good friend. I guess I won't use her name just in case I need

122
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,560
to protect her identity. And she was amazing. She was my lab partner. We're just great, great

123
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,920
buddies. She was a stud athlete. She was on the rowing team. She was like the perfect physical

124
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,280
specimen of, you know, and we used to sit together and we were in two classes together. And she

125
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,400
was like maybe four or five months into that school year and she couldn't stay awake anymore.

126
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,240
She was like falling asleep in class constantly. And I remember sort of nudging her and being like,

127
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,120
hey, you're burning it too much. Like the practices are killing you and the labs and blah,

128
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,280
blah, blah, blah. Like you got to get this shit under control. And she's like, no, no, no, I'm

129
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,640
fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. And she just couldn't stay awake to save her life. And she was losing

130
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,800
weight like crazy and she was lean to begin with. So she was, you know, probably six feet tall

131
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,000
and might've weighed 140 was her fighting weight. And, you know, she was now down to 125 or something

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,240
like that. And of course she was going to the bathroom all the time. And of course I'm just a

133
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,520
dumb engineer. I don't know anything. I don't realize this is such an obvious, you know, sign

134
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,920
of somebody who's going to be in a medical school and you can't die. But it's really difficult for

135
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,280
everybody. This was an undergrad before I even knew I wanted to go into medicine. But yeah, sure

136
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,800
enough, she comes back one day with, and she's like, Oh my God, you're not going to believe this.

137
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,840
I finally went to the doctor and all of a sudden for the rest of school, she takes insulin. And for

138
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,920
the rest of her life. And these are previously healthy people. They're cruising around,

139
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,600
living their lives. There's nothing obvious that contributes to the risk. And then they start

140
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,760
drinking a lot and peeing a lot and they lose weight. And they essentially are in a state of

141
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,080
profound catabolism and their bodies waste away because insulin is such a really pivotal signal

142
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:58,040
for directionality on metabolism. And they decide to break it down. And it's amazing. It beguiles

143
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,600
everyone who's up there close, there are so many misdiagnoses around type one diabetes,

144
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,160
about 30% of children still present with DKA. That is to say they've had prolonged illness and

145
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,800
no one's thought that they could actually be quite ill. So when, to be clear, when they present with

146
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,800
diabetic ketoacidosis, it means that they have somehow managed to slip through the cracks.

147
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,040
Nobody's figured out that their glucose level is through the roof or that they're becoming

148
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,960
acidotic or any of these other things. And what actually brings them into the hospital is a

149
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,080
septic like situation where their blood pressure is falling and they're becoming unresponsive.

150
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,040
They hit the metabolic wall. And at that point, they're only on this earth for a matter of days

151
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,760
or a week or two without insulin. And it's quite common for very young children to present in DKA.

152
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,280
It's less common in older people. They typically have more compensatory reserves. So they have

153
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,560
the autoimmunity proceeds at a slower rate as you get older. And so the diagnosis becomes more and

154
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,480
more confusing the older the onset of the disease. And this phenomenon actually progresses into

155
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,040
adulthood to the point where there are people our age who are diagnosed with diabetes,

156
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,760
not otherwise specified, who think they have type two and they're skinny, but in fact have

157
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,120
cryptic type one diabetes. They probably have autoimmune antibodies and they have some degree

158
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,280
of a loss of beta cells. And this phenomenon explains some of the adult onset diabetes that

159
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,480
you just don't quite understand. How is this person diabetic? And so fast forward a few years

160
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,640
from where I am and I want to come back to where you were, but by the time I'm in medical school,

161
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I had only been exposed to people who had type one diabetes, which is ironic given the prevalence

162
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,600
difference between type one and type two. And I remember in a pathology class in my first year,

163
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,000
they said, well, you know, I forget what the number was at the time, but they said about 95%

164
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,560
of the cases of diabetes are what we call type two or adult onset diabetes. And I remember

165
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,040
thinking to myself, the professor must have made a mistake. I've never seen this type two diabetes

166
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,040
thing they talk about, but I've seen a lot of people, not just that friend in school, but I

167
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,560
went on to see other people and knew of other people though I didn't watch them through the

168
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,560
diagnosis. So what is the prevalence today? Notwithstanding this late onset type one diabetes

169
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,120
that we'll come and talk about later, but just directionally, how many people in the United

170
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,560
States have type one versus type two or indeterminate? Okay. So type one is approximately one

171
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:33,720
in 300 people in the typical age of onset is around nine and they live into adulthood and,

172
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,960
and many survive into their eighties or even nineties. They have, of course, reduced survival

173
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,600
because of complications, but it's an incredibly common illness. It's the most common life

174
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,720
threatening medication requiring illness of childhood. Yeah. Which is amazing when you go

175
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,280
back to where you were at Boston children's hospital. I'm sure for any pediatric endocrinologist

176
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,720
to be working on glycogen storage diseases or inborn areas of metabolism is interesting

177
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,040
intellectually, but the scale upon which those diseases afflict children is trivial compared

178
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,760
to what you just described. And when you're working in a fancy medical school, it's quite

179
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,760
sort of tempting to focus on a rare, unique condition that most people don't get a lot of

180
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,840
exposure to and sort of bypass the really common things. But for me, type one diabetes was the

181
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,880
elephant in the room. It was just so compelling. And I ended up being the first clinical fellow

182
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,480
at Boston children's in 10 years to go into type one diabetes. Were any of your mentors there

183
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,560
disappointed in the way that your mom was that you were sort of, and I want to say slumming it,

184
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,440
because I don't mean to suggest that that's what it was, but that you were stepping off the pedestal

185
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,800
of the esteemed academic institution. No, I ended up working on type one diabetes at the

186
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,360
Jawsland Diabetes Center, which was an amazing place. And there was also in Boston, also in

187
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,400
Boston. There was a long August tradition of academics there. They were a little surprised

188
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,200
that I was interested in going after such a tough problem. And again, clinically, type one diabetes

189
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,120
is an immense problem as we'll get into because the clinical treatments are just so difficult and

190
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,360
ineffective and variable in their response. So let's talk a little bit about the pathophysiology

191
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,120
of this. Presumably people listening to this who already know everything about it and want to get

192
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,840
to the fun stuff, we'll skip this. We'll timestamp it so they can jump ahead. But I think it is worth

193
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,320
understanding because there's definitely some confusion. You obviously alluded to the fact that

194
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,280
this has an autoimmune component, if not the main component. So what based on everything we know today

195
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,000
is the pathophysiology of this condition? Okay. Well, I guess we could say just from a very high

196
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,760
level, there are clearly genetic as well as environmental contributors. And so we know that

197
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,880
it runs in families and we know that certain regions or certain behaviors predispose. But

198
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,520
if you actually get down to the molecular pathophysiology, what you see is that it's an

199
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,240
autoimmune condition, largely driven by T cells. But there is also a contribution of B cells. And

200
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,520
because of that, you can detect antibodies in the serum that indicate autoimmunity. And so we

201
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,320
generally believe what happens is by some combination of bad luck and possibly genetics and

202
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:21,080
possibly the foods you eat to a very, very modest degree, this stochastic phenomenon begins to move

203
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,320
forward whereby the beta cell, which secretes insulin, begins to dump off antigens and the

204
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,440
antigens begin to provoke the immune system locally. And some of those immune cells start

205
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,080
to destroy beta cells and dump out more antigens. So let me take a step back for the listener. The

206
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:45,400
pancreas of course is this gland that sits in the retroperitoneum. So it's not in the abdomen proper,

207
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:53,160
but it's behind the stomach. And about 95% of the pancreas by mass serves this exocrine function,

208
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,960
which is it's mostly there for local digestion. It puts enzymes into the biliary stream that

209
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,560
ultimately aid in the proximate digestion of things coming out of the stomach. However,

210
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,200
about 5% of the pancreas by mass, including these cells called beta cells, but presumably you'll

211
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,320
tell us a little bit about alpha and delta cells. It's an endocrine organ versus an exocrine organ,

212
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,960
which means it's secreting systemic hormones into the system. So I remember learning that in medical

213
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,400
school and being surprised because I'd heard so much about beta cells. And I was like, wait,

214
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,080
they only make up 5% of this pancreas? Like there are relatively small contribution to this enormous

215
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,960
organ, right? And essentially insulin is only made there, except perhaps in tiny quantities in the

216
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:41,240
brain. And so the, yes, these islands of cells, these islets of Langerhans exist floating in a sea of

217
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,640
the acinar or exocrine component. And they make insulin uniquely unlike any other tissue. And

218
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,760
perhaps because they make these unique antigens or these unique cellular products like insulin

219
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,600
and some of the other apparatus that are required for glucose stimulated insulin secretion,

220
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,800
when they begin to dump off their antigens and provoke autoimmunity, you can get this sort of

221
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:13,000
death spiral where ultimately the end result is a progressive autoimmunity where you lose beta cells

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,200
over time. And I don't think that there's any one single, for instance, virus that can be

223
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,520
conclusively ascribed to autoimmunity and type one diabetes. It's clearly not related to,

224
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,440
directly related to your BMI or your body mass index or your body weight, though it's certainly

225
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,400
a contributor and also genetics. Which way does it seem to contribute, high or low?

226
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,640
In populations, again, it doesn't hold up in individuals very well, but in populations,

227
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,240
the heavier you are, the more likely you are to have type one, which implies either that the work

228
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,480
of the beta cells contributing to the autoimmunity or alternatively, the work of the beta cell and

229
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,880
the relative beta cell insufficiency reveals this autoimmunity that otherwise would have been cryptic.

230
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,560
We've seen a rise in the incidence and of course, then the prevalence of type two diabetes. That's

231
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,520
very difficult to ignore and I've written about that in other places and you can chase that all

232
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,520
the way back to the late 1800s and it tracks pretty well. What has been the relative change

233
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,960
in the incidence of type one diabetes? It's doubled since 1960 and it appears to be continuing to

234
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,360
increase. And so one possibility is that there are these environmental factors that are increasing,

235
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,720
for instance, obesity. Alternatively, there could be viruses or other things that we're exposed to

236
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,000
and another possibility is that we're simply better at diagnosing it. So we know for a fact

237
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,320
that some infants that are diagnosed now with nuance at diabetes would have been the kids who

238
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,000
you thought had died of sepsis back when you were in medical school. So we have a greater awareness

239
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,840
that this autoimmunity can happen to kids as early as five or six months of life. And at that point,

240
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,920
they don't present with the classical signs and symptoms. It's really incredibly aggressive.

241
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,680
They look like they have gastroenteritis and weight loss. And if nobody bothers to check a serum

242
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,880
glucose, you might never know that they in fact have life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and

243
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,280
nuance at type one diabetes. It's a disaster. I suspect it was because I knew we were going to

244
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,280
be speaking today, but last night when I was putting my littlest guy to bed who's about 16,

245
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,720
17 months old, I remember I was looking at him and I was playing with him and I'm biased. So I

246
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,000
think he's as cute as all hell. And I remember thinking, what would happen if this guy got type

247
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,680
one diabetes? How would we figure it out? How long would it take us to figure out, oh my God,

248
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,720
check his glucose? And it scared me actually, because it's like, I think about this stuff

249
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,360
night and day. And I realized it would easily escape me for a long time. And to your point,

250
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,400
they don't have the reserve. They don't have the physiologic reserve, which is just doctors speak

251
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,960
for they don't have the buffer between life and death that you or I would have.

252
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,400
And actually might have much more aggressive autoimmunity.

253
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Meaning it comes on quicker. The rate of decline of endogenous insulin production is much faster.

254
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,680
Yeah. They might present with 90% of their beta cells gone because the autoimmune destruction

255
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,400
from 100% of their beta cell capacity to 10% could occur in a matter of months. Almost by

256
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,400
definition must in a kid who's six months old. But if I'm 53, if I got type one diabetes,

257
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:43,640
I could smolder along for years. And again, I have a friend who's my age, who is essentially

258
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,480
my height and weight. And he has new onset diabetes. And we think he actually has cryptic

259
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,600
type one and it's slowly smoldering. It seems to be slowly progressing. It's been very difficult

260
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,520
to precisely make the diagnosis. And I want to come back to that in time for at least one reason,

261
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,960
which is for people out there listening, there are people getting caught between these crosshairs

262
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,680
that are potentially being misdiagnosed outside of the intellectual exercise of getting it right,

263
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,440
which we love to do as doctors. Are there treatment implications that are more relevant? In other

264
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,280
words, if you have someone who's walking around with quote unquote type two diabetes, but they're

265
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,600
really late onset type one, are we also potentially caring for them incorrectly? So I'll park that

266
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,840
because there's so much I want to go back to in type one, but between the two of us, let's try

267
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,040
to remember to come back to that. So I didn't actually realize the B cells played a big role,

268
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,920
but I guess that makes sense. So I thought it was just a CD4, CD8, CD25 problem, but it's beyond that.

269
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,080
Yeah, there's this idea of an antigenic spread. So again, if the beta cells make very unique things,

270
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,040
and when you break them open and destroy them, you begin to dump them out. There is both a B

271
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,880
and a T cell response. And we know this because we can test for antibodies in the serum of people

272
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,360
with type one diabetes, and they make unique antibodies against insulin and GAD, glutamic

273
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,840
acid decarboxylase, as well as a protein tyrosine phosphatase called ICA-512. And so

274
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,360
those antibodies are commonly used in the diagnosis of type one diabetes, which we believe

275
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,600
to be a T cell disease. But again, that doesn't make any sense because antibodies are made by B

276
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,360
cells. So there must be some contribution in the definitive proof of that was in a New England

277
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,480
Journal article that was done by my friend, Mark Peskowitz. And he used in a huge clinical trial,

278
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:47,080
Rituximab, which alters B cell function, alters the ability of the B cells to make antibodies,

279
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,760
and they were able to delay the course of type one diabetes. So they were able to intervene in

280
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,800
a subset of patients that were progressing slowly enough. They presented with positive GAD antibodies,

281
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,680
but they still had beta cell production. You whack them with Rituximab, you at least take

282
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,400
the B cell component out of this. And if the control patient isn't having that, you now create

283
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,280
a Kaplan-Meier curve for a beta cell. That's right. That's right. And so they were only temporarily

284
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,960
able to alter. How much did they delay the onset? So Rituximab is quite potent. So the circulating

285
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,640
antibodies were reduced dramatically. They only gave a single set of infusions. And if I understand

286
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,480
remember this study correctly, they got a response, but it was not statistically significant at a year.

287
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,200
Based on one single dose. I'm not sure about that.

288
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,400
We'll pull it up. Yeah. Okay. Are there any other autoimmune diseases that share this phenomenon

289
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,200
that you're aware of where you have this B cell T cell component? Well, I think it's true of a

290
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,240
bunch of the other autoimmune endocrine disorders, such as, for instance, autoimmune thyroid disease,

291
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,760
where you can get thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. And again, we largely

292
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,400
think that that's a T cell mediated disease. And by the way, autoimmune thyroid disease is

293
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,240
associated with type 1 diabetes or vice versa. Meaning patients who will go on earlier in life

294
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,400
to develop type 1 diabetes would be much more likely than patients without it to go on to get

295
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,640
Graves disease or some of the other autoimmune thyroid disorders. Yeah. Typically type 1 would

296
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,560
present first and then they can get autoimmune thyroid disease, but they can also get adrenal

297
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,640
disease. And we also see, for instance, rarely, sialitis, which is autoimmune disease of the

298
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,920
salivary gland and even rarely autoimmune oophritis of the ovaries, as well as pernicious

299
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,600
anemia, the ability to produce B12. And so that's presumably an autoimmune disease of the cells that

300
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,880
make B12. Wow. I didn't actually realize that there was so much overlap between these. Let's

301
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,720
clarify one other thing that I'm sure someone's wondering. One thing that parents I think are

302
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,680
pretty mindful of is what do we have to feed our kids to minimize the risk of them getting

303
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,000
anaphylactic reactions to nuts or things like that, given the consequences of such things.

304
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,360
Not to get off into the weeds, but it's probably worth explaining why that's a completely different

305
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,920
process than what we're talking about with the autoimmunity with respect to the endocrine. So

306
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,400
not to put you on the spot and I'm happy to fill in the gaps, but what is it about a kid when they

307
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,080
eat a peanut that leads to an anaphylactic reaction? And why is that a totally different

308
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,720
type of immune response? Well, I should just say in terms of anaphylactic reactions for peanuts,

309
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,320
it turns out that you probably want to eat peanuts to avoid the anaphylactic reaction.

310
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,840
That is certainly what we believe now. I think the literature has become crystal clear that early

311
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,240
exposure is better. But again, that's a very different type of immune response, isn't it?

312
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,520
Yes. That's mediated by IgE. That's a hypersensitivity more than an autoimmune

313
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:40,360
response, is that correct? Yeah. So borrowing from that though, do we believe that there are any

314
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,720
exposures that are withheld from kids that may be predisposing them to beta cell destruction? Or do

315
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,120
we think it has much more to do with these diffuse genetic issues, which I want to come back to,

316
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,280
these quote unquote environmental issues. And then of course, what seems to be the majority of it

317
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,200
seems to be stochastic. So there's no one precise thing. And moreover, I don't believe that parents

318
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,560
who are listening to this could say, okay, I want to make sure that my kid doesn't get type one

319
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,520
diabetes, so we're not going to eat any enriched carbohydrate and then we'll mitigate that risk

320
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:17,800
completely. However, that said, in populations, you can see these very subtle differences in

321
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,720
type one diabetes risk depending upon the body weight of children, which implies that the

322
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,640
standard American diet may be predisposing the population in aggregate ever so slightly

323
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,520
towards more type one diabetes, which is a scary thought. Yeah. The challenge of course,

324
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,480
is because the environmental contribution is so much smaller here than it is in type two diabetes,

325
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,400
we don't know if we could be looking at genetic differences that could explain that. In other

326
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,440
words, we can't do the experiment as easily the epidemiologic comparison, I guess, to be more

327
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,840
rigorous in my terminology of comparing a US population to pick a completely different

328
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,880
population that is genetically completely distinct and environmentally distinct. We could get fooled

329
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,080
by that, right? Yeah, but there is a pretty nice study using the T1D exchange data, which is a large

330
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,320
consortia of clinics around the United States. In fact, there's a paper that was published by Maria

331
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,680
Redondo and several other friends of mine describing explicitly these relationships in between

332
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,600
body weight and the potential risk for type one. Do you remember just directionally when a child

333
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,680
goes, I don't even know kid body BMIs. My little guy who you just saw who's like 97th percentile in

334
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,760
height weight and 95th percentile in head circumference, I was looking at his little

335
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,800
pediatric sheet the other day because he went to the doctor and he was like BMI of 19.4.

336
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,800
Kid BMIs mean, I don't know how to think in those BMIs, but I was going to say, what's the difference

337
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:52,920
between a BMI 16 and a BMI 20? How much of an increase in relative risk do you see? Pediatricians

338
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,360
like me never are able to memorize these things. You've got to put it on it. We have to plot it on

339
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,200
a chart. There's growth curves for both height and weight and head circumference and weight versus

340
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,480
height or also body mass index. It's just so complicated and there's different curves for

341
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,920
boys and girls. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Question one out of the way is, is there anything I can do or a

342
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:22,440
parent can do to reduce the risk of our kids getting type one diabetes? The answer is probably

343
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,240
not other than if you want the wind a little bit at your back as opposed to a little bit in your

344
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,400
face, if your kids can be closer to normal BMI than not. Being aware that it is a possibility

345
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:40,120
and being able to inform yourself and your neighbors and your school teacher undiagnosed

346
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,280
type one diabetes is very dangerous for children and we need to do a better job of detecting it

347
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:51,720
early. Yeah, with one in 300 kids getting it, that means in any given school, one to three

348
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,000
kids are being diagnosed a year. Which is interesting because I just don't have that

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,120
recollection, but it may speak to this issue you've talked about, which is we just underdiagnosed it.

350
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,720
We've talked briefly about genes, but obviously this is not going to fall in the category of

351
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,360
single gene mutations like the glycogen storage diseases or some of the other errors of inborn

352
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:18,200
metabolism. Do we have even a quasi sense of how heavy the genetic contribution is and what those

353
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,160
genes may actually do from a functional standpoint? We understand it pretty well,

354
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,000
and though there's still a lot to be learned. It's complicated in that there's essentially

355
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,360
two different themes of the genetics of type one diabetes. One are these HLA alleles, like this is

356
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,040
the human histocompatibility locus. There's certain alleles that are quite common in the

357
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:49,720
population that when combined place people at higher risk. There's something called HLA DR3

358
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:58,200
and DR4. These alleles tend to run quite frequently in the US population. As a result, people who

359
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,680
have type one diabetes typically will have about a tenfold risk of having a child with type one

360
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,320
diabetes relative to the general population. To be clear, is that assuming they inherit the

361
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,280
same HLA type or independent of the inherited pattern of their HLA? Because if you are HLA

362
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:23,320
to DR, is that a co-dominant inheritance? Is your kid 50% likely to get that assuming your

363
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,640
wife doesn't have that? Yeah, but what happens is it's so common that your wife may have that.

364
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,960
So just statistically, because children end up having it, the people who have type one diabetes

365
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,880
often have these alleles and also these other minor alleles that contribute each very small

366
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,120
amount, but in aggregate quite a bit. So the analogy I use is it's sort of like, let's play

367
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,440
a poker game, if you will. We're going to play a poker game where on your left hand, we're going

368
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,800
to play 21. And on the right hand, we're going to play five card stud. Okay? And so when you deal me,

369
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,880
and by the way, the winner is the one- So when you say 21, you mean Blackjack on the

370
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,080
right hand? Exactly. Blackjack on my left hand and five card stud on the right. And when you're

371
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,200
dealt the cards, you have the HLA alleles, which is Blackjack, because there's only a few and they

372
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,480
sort out however they sort out. And the right hand, you're playing five card stud. And in fact,

373
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,000
there's a huge number of combinations that could come in five card stud, but together, those two

374
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,720
hands determine the risk. And so it's quite complicated because you can't draw a direct line

375
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,680
in between one gene or a group of genes. But in aggregate, the statisticians think that

376
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:39,800
people are approximately six to tenfold at greater risk if you have somebody who has type one to have

377
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,440
a direct relative. And so if you're someone with type one, that's still not a reason to get

378
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,520
completely panicked because that means it's still unlikely your kid is going to get type one diabetes.

379
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,120
If you have a disease that's hitting one in 300 and you have a tenfold increase,

380
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,360
it's going to hit one in 30. There's still a 97% chance your child is not going to have type one

381
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:06,200
diabetes if you do, but it would have been a 99.7% chance hopefully if you hadn't if I'm doing my

382
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,160
math right. But there are these families, I've met them, you know, I met one family where all

383
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,760
three sons had type one diabetes. Oh, God. And was the age of onset comparable in each of these

384
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,800
children? It doesn't necessarily align. That's kind of an interesting and surprising element.

385
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,800
And actually, at one point cared for identical twins who were discordant for type one diabetes.

386
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,840
Well, I was going to ask you that. What is the twin concordance? Identical versus fraternal.

387
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,960
So identical twin concordance within the first few years is only around 50 or 60%.

388
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,120
By adulthood, what is it?

389
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,920
By adulthood, it's approaching 80%. So there's a big cohort that Dr. George Isenbroug studied

390
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,680
many years ago. So over time, those are the people that discordant genetically identical

391
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,560
twins are probably the people who would have, they have diabetes not otherwise specified,

392
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,120
but in fact, they have type one that's, that's cryptic.

393
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,280
And the fraternal twins, which would at least allow you to hopefully as much as possible,

394
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,040
normalize the environmental similarities, but somewhat reduce the genetic variability or the

395
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,720
genetic similarity. Do you have a rough sense of what the concordance is for those by adulthood?

396
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,760
I don't know the exact number, but again, I think it's they're approximately 10 fold relative to

397
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
the general population.

398
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:30,760
Got it. Wow. So let's fast forward a little bit and get back to what we talked about over dinner

399
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,600
in Houston a few years ago. Again, it was either three or four years ago, but it was the fall.

400
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,560
I remember it was definitely a fall. At that point in time, I had spent very little mental

401
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,400
energy thinking about type one diabetes because obviously I'm not going to take care of somebody

402
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,600
with type one diabetes. It's so far outside of my skillset. And so I sort of remembered a few

403
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,440
things because in residency, two of my co-residents had type one diabetes, which is, wow, that's

404
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,640
pretty unusual in a cohort because the categorical residents in general surgery for our year at Hopkins,

405
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,120
there were only seven of us. Right. And two of the seven had type one diabetes. And I, you know,

406
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,520
I talked to them a lot about it and I sort of remember directionally their target was a

407
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,840
hemoglobin A1c of about 7.5. And they lived on crackers and orange juice where they're sort of

408
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,880
staple foods to manage these bouts of hypoglycemia. And I certainly remember one of my buddies,

409
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,360
it wasn't uncommon if in the middle of an operation, one of the OR nurses would have to

410
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,280
come and put a little straw behind his mask and he would have to drink some orange juice

411
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,920
to sort of, you know, manage his glucose levels. And then when you and I sat down for dinner,

412
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,480
you said, you know, your average patient is walking around at something like 5.7, 5.8, 5.9

413
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,360
hemoglobin A1c. And that immediately caught me off guard because I was like, oh, that seems very

414
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,320
different from what I sort of remember. So how did you get from wherever presumably you finished

415
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,920
your training and entered your practice? I'm guessing that was sometime in the late eighties,

416
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:05,000
early nineties. I graduated from fellowship in 2000. Oh, okay. So over the last call it 15,

417
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,440
18 years, how did you evolve your thinking around targets for where the hemoglobin A1c,

418
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,440
and I guess I should take a step back and also explain for someone what the hemoglobin A1c is

419
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,000
since I'm so critical of it in general, by the way, you've probably heard me rail on the futility

420
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,360
of it. The hemoglobin A1c of course measures the amount of glycosylation or how much glucose is

421
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:30,760
sticking to hemoglobin. And if we take the assumption that hemoglobin has a relatively finite,

422
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,640
fixed, predictable life before the red blood cells themselves get broken down, we can measure the

423
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,880
hemoglobin A1c and then impute the average blood glucose. And that's of course the exact opposite

424
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,200
of what we would do with CGM where you are actually measuring the average blood glucose

425
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:55,960
and imputing what the hemoglobin A1c would be. So the diagnosis of type two diabetes is made today

426
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:04,040
solely on the hemoglobin A1c being greater than 6.5%. It no longer relies on the insulin or glucose

427
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,880
level during an oral glucose challenge. Remind me a hemoglobin A1c of 7.5 corresponds to an

428
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,400
average blood glucose of approximately what, 160? Yeah, I think that's right. We'll post the table

429
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,520
to it. It could be 150, but it's directionally in that ballpark, right? Right. So for someone

430
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,880
listening to this thinking, God, that seems a little high. Why was that chosen as such a goal?

431
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,160
Okay. So we should first just talk about the DCCT, which is the so-called diabetes control

432
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:38,600
complication trial, which after the discovery of insulin by Banting and Best in 1922 in Toronto,

433
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,200
in Toronto. That's right. So we're coming up on the 100th anniversary of the DCCT.

434
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,280
Of the discovery of insulin. Can we detour for two seconds and explain how Banting and Best did this?

435
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,440
Because it's really one of those beautiful stories in medicine. Yeah, it's so amazing. And there's a

436
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,720
book, by the way, which is by Michael Bliss called The Discovery of Insulin. And if anybody has a vague

437
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,800
interest in type one diabetes, they should run and buy this because it's just so amazing and

438
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,960
bring tears to your eyes. Prior to Banting and Best, what happened to children with type one

439
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,920
diabetes? Children or adults. So at least in the 19th century, nothing. So these people would

440
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,160
present with weight loss and history drinking and urinating quite a bit. And over time, they had to

441
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,080
manage their expectations and then they would expire. And it was, I assume, usually from

442
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,640
complications of diabetic ketoacidosis. That's right. Yeah. And so it would happen in a matter

443
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:37,240
of weeks, some cases days and some cases months. Then along came Alan and Alan created this amazing

444
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:45,640
so-called Alan diet. And that was essentially a low calorie, high fat nutritional regimen

445
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,920
that had almost no enriched carbohydrates. And if you use that approach, they were able to extend

446
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:58,680
life to a few months, in some cases a few years, but it required incredible precision. And Dr.

447
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:04,440
Jonslin and others had adopted this approach in a desperate attempt to extend life. But other than

448
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,160
that, there was nothing you could do when people just wasted away. So it was one of these things

449
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,360
that people feared greatly because if your kid got type one diabetes, that was it. You were going

450
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,320
to watch them disappear. And you said this earlier and I didn't interject, but it's probably worth

451
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,840
reiterating. You talked about how important insulin is. You use the term catabolic, but

452
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,280
in contrast to its role, which is as such an anabolic gatekeeper. And therefore in the absence

453
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,120
of it, you enter this catabolic state. So talk to me about what you mean by the anabolism of insulin.

454
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,720
Ultimately, insulin is a key factor that's regulating virtually every cell in the body.

455
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:49,720
And it's essentially deciding whether a cell is in a state of feast or famine. And so if you're in

456
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,840
feast, it's time to take nutrients and park them in the cell. And if it's famine, hey, let's mobilize

457
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,760
some nutrients and make them available to keep the organism alive. And so it's a master regulator of

458
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,480
your state of metabolism. And so if you take a normal non-diabetic human and you fast them for

459
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,400
24 hours, you discover that they're circulating insulin values, especially if a healthy young

460
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,080
adult are exquisitely low. But if you then take that same person, you give them a 75 gram

461
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:22,440
glucola challenge, you can get their insulin values to exquisitely high levels. So it's a

462
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,280
dynamic hormone. It's changing rapidly in response to meals and everything else. And it's helping you

463
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,240
to sort of take these nutrients and park them away. Now in the fat cell, I think most people

464
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,520
have a vague notion of what's going on. There's basically one door into a fat cell of

465
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,400
esterification or reesterification. And then there's the door out, which is lipolysis.

466
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,440
And insulin acts very prominently at both of those. So free fatty acids and triglycerides

467
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,360
are highly regulated by insulin at both ends of that adipose cell. What is insulin doing at a

468
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,360
muscle cell? It's promoting glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. And it's a dynamic process that

469
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,720
involves glute for these glucose transporters. And essentially the glucose transport is normally

470
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,320
sitting in the cytosol and they translocate to the cell wall. And now all of a sudden the muscle cell

471
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,240
becomes permeable to glucose and glucose is pumped in. So glute four is a passive transporter.

472
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,000
As long as it's going across the cell membrane, glucose enters freely. The active part of that

473
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,040
is the insulin signal that tells the glute transporter to go from the cytosol across the

474
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,000
membrane. Right. And then so taking the other extreme of that, which is when someone is

475
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,680
fasting or starving, which is effectively what's happening in type one diabetes at the cellular

476
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,440
level, they don't have insulin. How does the lack of insulin promote the breakdown of actual muscle?

477
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,000
So this negative nitrogen balance could be because I'm assuming that while a lot of that muscle that

478
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,680
breaks down is used for gluconeogenesis, wouldn't that patient, if you're measuring urinary nitrogen

479
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,960
levels also be in a profound negative nitrogen balance? Yeah. Every step of protein metabolism

480
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,600
is, I mean, many of the major steps are influenced by insulin as well. So you're either making

481
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,120
proteins or you're breaking them down. It also influences the glycogen that's in skeletal muscle

482
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,400
and heart and kidney. So in the presence of insulin, you're putting more glycogen into

483
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,320
skeletal muscle or in the absence you're going to break it down or also with just work. Boy,

484
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,600
it's a thin razor's edge, that hormone. Exactly. Too much of it, really bad stuff. Too little of it,

485
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,600
really bad stuff. As long as you can control it, it's a pretty wonderful hormone. And because it's

486
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,440
so fundamental to eukaryotic cells, it seems to also influence things you would never even imagine,

487
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,240
like for instance, lifespan and aging. And so it's really a deep and fundamental signal around

488
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,480
where cells are. Do you have a great sense of how insulin relates to IGF? It certainly plays a role

489
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,240
in the inverse relationship between some of the binding proteins. So we know that as insulin level

490
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,280
goes up, sex hormone binding globular goes down and therefore high levels of insulin will all

491
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,000
things equal reduce the level of circulating androgens because more of them are being bound up.

492
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,920
What's the relationship between insulin and the binding protein for IGF? IGF binding proteins two,

493
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,880
three, et cetera? I'll probably get this wrong, but I think it's IGF-1 can go down in the presence

494
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,920
of high levels of circulating insulin acutely. And it's one way to be able to diagnose a very

495
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,280
short term hyperinsulinemia. This is something that we often struggle with in pediatrics. We

496
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,560
bizarrely even have some people who will take away too much insulin trying to pretend that they have

497
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,720
hypoglycemia by some measure. And then we go and measure in the blood and you can actually measure

498
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:49,960
for IGF-BP1 and it can be down. So the BP-1 goes down. So in many ways IGF would go up then. If the

499
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,200
binding protein goes down, the free IGF should be going up with insulin, right? Assuming I remember

500
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,080
this correctly. It's been a while. Well, that's sort of what I see clinically, right? The more

501
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,400
hyperinsulinemia make a patient is all things equal the higher you tend to see their IGF. And

502
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,440
that's always been my assumption as to why just based on the parallel analogy with the, I'm

503
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,680
ashamed to say I'm too lazy to have like spent the time looking this up. Well, the other thing I

504
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,840
would just point out is that insulin and IGF-1 really are intensely overlapping in the way they

505
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:23,160
work. And insulin does not bind as a monomeric hormone. It's actually a dimer and it can be a

506
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,320
heterodimer. So you can have two insulins or you can have an insulin in IGF-1 or you can have two

507
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,040
IGF-1s and they can bind to receptors and there are even hetero receptors where it's an insulin

508
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,880
receptor and an IGF-1 receptor each bound by their cognate ligands. Derek LaRoytha at Mount

509
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,840
Sinai has done this kind of work for years. And when you block these heterodimeric receptors,

510
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:51,720
you can completely alter metabolism implying that the role of IGF-1 on glucose homeostasis

511
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,840
is really quite powerful. Yeah. And we probably won't get to it today, but there's also an

512
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,320
IGF and its relationship to growth hormone is actually quite interesting when it comes to

513
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,160
diseases because it seems to have very different effects on different diseases. There are certain

514
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,600
diseases that seem to go up in risk as IGF goes up and there are others that seem to go down.

515
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,840
Whereas insulin seems a little less confusing, but we'll obviously come to that.

516
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,880
So in the late 1910s when Banting and Bester working with dogs, do they know that they're

517
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,480
trying to isolate? Like do they have a sense of where to look for this hormone?

518
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,320
Yeah. So Banting has an idea. Actually, the story of how he comes up with the idea is amazing and

519
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,840
really surprising. So he's a surgeon in a dead end practice in London and...

520
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,800
This is London, Ontario.

521
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:43,800
London and Ontario. And he can't make his mortgage. He's a veteran of the world war.

522
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,840
At that time, there had only been one. And he's trying to get this general surgery practice going,

523
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,320
but he's bored and he doesn't have that many patients. And so he's a reader and he's thinking

524
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:59,800
about ways to try to contribute. And he reads in this journal article, which describes how

525
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:08,680
people who have stones in the pancreas end up with these strange islet like structures or islands of

526
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,520
cells. And so essentially what happens is the pancreas, for whatever reason, if it's obstructed

527
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,720
by a stone and it has a blockage, what you end up with in the residual after the pancreatitis

528
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:28,040
occurs are these weird round cellular structures. And so it had been known from a couple other

529
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,800
scientists that there might be something in there that was involved in diabetes. So he comes up with

530
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:40,040
the idea of, wow, maybe what I could do is block the outflow of the exocrine pancreas, which makes

531
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:46,680
these digestive enzymes, force the pancreas to eat itself alive. And then I will take this residual

532
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:52,680
muck that comes from the pancreas and try to purify whatever is within it to see if that

533
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,000
is some sort of medicine that might be useful for type 1 diabetes. It's a genius moment that

534
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,880
comes to him in the middle of the night. He writes it down. Michael Bliss actually found the

535
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,760
notebook page from his bedstand where he wrote this. And so then he goes to Uvresa, Toronto,

536
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,200
which is this very sophisticated place. And he meets and he knocks on doors and he finds this

537
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,320
guy who's a famous professor of metabolism. And he says, I got this incredible idea. I want to

538
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,760
isolate this thing that must be in the pancreas. That would be the treatment for type 1 diabetes.

539
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,760
And the guy's like, you're out of your mind. He's like, no, no, no, it's a really cool idea.

540
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,280
Let me tell you about it. And what happened is this professor is about to go on break for the

541
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:44,920
summer and to go off to Scotland. And so he leaves Banting with a very short lease. He says, look,

542
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,120
I'll allow you to do a few experiments and I can give you a few resources, but you basically got

543
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,920
to finish your experiments by the end of the summer. And so Banting is there. And then he

544
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,960
essentially gets a medical student who has the dumb luck to draw this crazy experiment with

545
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:09,560
Banting. And that's Charles Best. So there they are in this cramped, hot laboratory in Toronto.

546
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:15,960
And amazingly, they are able to isolate the substance that has the ability to lower blood

547
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,640
glucose in dogs. And they're doing this in dogs as well? Yes, that's right. So what they do is they

548
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,920
carry out this intervention. The pancreas eats itself alive. They get this this muck and they

549
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,640
are able to isolate some crude extract and then take it and put it back into a dog that they've

550
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,920
removed the entire pancreas of and lower the blood glucose. It's like this incredible moment.

551
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:43,480
I mean, and this is 1922. What's even more extraordinary is that they're able to take

552
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,800
this observation and then they eventually fairly quickly do an experiment where they lower the

553
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,880
blood glucose of a medical student who has type 1 diabetes with this super crude extract. So

554
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,400
they're able to prove that it works in man. And so then they write the paper and the paper gets

555
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:08,760
rejected. And then they're able to submit it to a Canadian journal and it gets accepted.

556
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,800
That low Canadian bar. I love it, man. That's the secret to any success I've had.

557
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:19,400
And they ultimately won the Nobel Prize. It's amazing. And if you think about 1922-

558
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,600
By the way, it's sort of one of like every year there is a Nobel Prize awarded in medicine or

559
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,600
physiology, I believe is the designation. There are a handful of them that stand out in a way that

560
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,160
can't be described. And this is one of them. The Banting and Best Nobel Prize is

561
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:43,160
one of a handful of places where the trajectory of clinical practice was altered dramatically.

562
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,880
Yeah. No, I think just by virtue of the fact that we're both physicians, we can be,

563
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,240
we can feel proud by association that our profession was able to do something so remarkable.

564
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:59,400
How long was it before recombinant insulin was used? Because after Banting and Best,

565
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,480
they were still using insulin from animals.

566
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,480
Yeah, purified from pigs. It's amazing. It went on for years and years and they would take these

567
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,440
giant vats and it was either from beef or from pigs.

568
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,400
It wasn't until the 80s, if I recall, that they figured out how to make insulin inside of E. coli

569
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:20,120
once Paul Berg. Genentech. Yeah. So there's an amazing article about the molecular biology

570
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,880
of modern insulin. And that was basically a race and it was a bunch of-

571
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,800
It really was. It's a biotech arms race to figure out. And it's some of the greatest stories in

572
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,400
science are of that arms race of the 80s. They knew that human insulin could be incredibly

573
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,000
useful for this population. And part of the reason is if you're taking a foreign product like pig

574
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,360
insulin, you can develop antibodies. And in some cases, those antibodies can be blocking to the

575
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,560
point where insulin, you start to have to increase the doses greater and greater. So human insulin

576
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,440
was known to be a goal and they were eventually able to produce it. Genentech did this, they sold

577
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,680
the rights and now there are multiple modern human insulins on the market.

578
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,600
Not to get into a controversial topic, but can somebody explain to me and you can opt out of

579
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,760
this question if it's too politically sensitive, but can somebody explain to me why the hell

580
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,080
recombinant insulin is still so expensive? Well, what's interesting about recombinant insulin is

581
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:22,200
it used to be cheap. So back when I was a fellow, a vial of insulin, which is a thousand units,

582
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:28,520
cost about 25 bucks. And that could last a well-managed patient for a month. A month or more.

583
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:34,920
Right. And today, what is a thousand units of recombinant insulin? 300 plus, maybe $400 US.

584
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,320
Right. Now, I don't know a lot about economics and I kind of forgot my tables of inflation,

585
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,680
but I feel like that has outpaced inflation a little bit. So how is it that we have more

586
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:53,160
competitors in the space, better technology today, and we've watched a log fold increase

587
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,280
in the price of this stuff that must be driving a lot of people nuts, including those who can't,

588
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,600
who don't have insurance. And frankly, the insurance companies themselves that have to pay this.

589
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,840
It's a disaster on many levels. It's really a disaster for people who are on the margins of

590
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:16,200
society, but want modern care and are willing to pay for it, but they can't get insulin at the same

591
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,240
price that, for instance, you could if you walked into a pharmacy in Spain, you could buy a vial

592
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:27,800
of insulin for 25 bucks there. It's three or $400 here. The difference, unfortunately, is that the

593
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:35,320
federal government is, how shall I say, a promiscuous customer. So they are, thus far, have not been able

594
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:42,360
to drive the price down because they're willing to essentially pay whatever the sellers charge.

595
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,560
And that's a big problem. And it speaks to the lack of market influence in things like insulin.

596
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,920
So now let's go back to where I distracted you from a long time ago, which is you finish your

597
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:59,800
fellowship. You're a card carrying pediatric endocrinologist who knows how to target high-ish

598
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:05,800
levels. And we were about to talk about the trial that explained the complications that

599
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,840
basically led to the why we care about this. Okay. So if the discovery of insulin is like the

600
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:18,280
first real modern chapter in type 1 diabetes, then the diabetes control complication trial is

601
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:24,680
chapter 2. And it's based on a brilliant and very clear idea, which goes, if people with type 1

602
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,680
diabetes are at risk for terrible complications, and we haven't really said this, but they're at

603
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:34,600
risk for all the complications that people with type 2 diabetes get. Cardiovascular disease and

604
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:41,000
kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy and blindness and limb amputations.

605
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,240
Well, actually, I'm glad you brought that up because I've been a little delinquent in my job

606
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:51,960
as host and taking things for granted. Can you explain why people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes

607
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,640
have so many of these complications that we refer to, I guess, loosely as microvascular complications

608
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,480
and we'll get to the macrovascular, of course, but just start with those ones you mentioned.

609
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:07,160
Why the amputations? Why the blindness? The blindness is from abnormal vessel growth. And

610
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:13,320
it appears that there are these weird glycations that can occur. And there's a series of damages

611
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,280
that happen in the vascular endothelium. And then there's new vessels that are created and the new

612
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:25,160
vessels are fragile and they can ultimately break and bleed. And the kidney, it's a very different

613
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:31,240
set of mechanisms, but basically very high glucose can alter the epithelia of the kidney

614
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,280
that's involved in filtering blood and making urine. And then why the amputations of toes and

615
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,520
things like that? Yeah, so that's altered healing from a couple of things. So one is that there's

616
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:46,520
something called diabetic neuropathy where the nerves simply don't work well and exposed to high

617
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:53,880
glucose, they lose their responsiveness. And so sometimes people will, for instance, have a wound

618
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,360
in their foot, but they're not able to actually realize that they have that wound. And so then

619
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:04,200
they also have abnormal healing because the microvascular isn't behaving appropriately.

620
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,720
And the sum total can be very bad diabetic wounds that fail to get better with antibiotics and

621
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,720
ultimately result in amputation. And this is the most common cause of preventable amputation in

622
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:20,920
the United States. It's also the most common cause of preventable blindness in the United States

623
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,480
and probably also renal failure. I was just about to say it's got to be the leading cause of kidney

624
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:32,280
disease. So the relationship between the average blood glucose, which we proxy by this hemoglobin

625
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:39,160
A1C, and these complications you mentioned, that's a monotonically increasing relationship, correct?

626
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:45,480
Pretty much, yes. So the DCCT really figured this out. So at the time they designed this trial,

627
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,160
they're thinking, well, all this terrible stuff is happening to these people with type 1 diabetes.

628
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,320
And so there was a group of people who thought, well, it's just genetics.

629
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,040
You know, it's obvious because we have two patients and one who has

630
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,800
pretty good control. The other one has pretty good control, but one gets complications.

631
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,200
What were the years of enrollment in the DCCT?

632
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,360
So this is in the late 80s, actually mid 80s, and it was reported out of the New England Journal,

633
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:13,080
I believe in 1993. And prior to that, you're saying it wasn't obvious that the differences

634
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,080
in these complications could be explained by the differences in their average blood glucose.

635
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:22,040
That's right. And there were endocrinologists who believed quite strongly that it was foolish

636
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:28,760
and perhaps even dangerous to carry out a clinical trial to test the basic idea. So the core idea is,

637
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:36,200
does tight control, i.e. near-normal blood glucose, confer protection from diabetes complications?

638
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,880
And the primary outcome measure was, were microvascular. It was kidney and eye.

639
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,840
And the reason that these physicians who we can look back at now, and obviously with the

640
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,240
benefit of so much hindsight, sort of consider that their views were silly, they weren't bad

641
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,520
doctors, right? They had something to be afraid of on the other end of this, right?

642
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,200
They were concerned about hypoglycemia.

643
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,360
So let's talk about that for a moment. That's it. Because there's got to be a really bad bogeyman

644
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,240
on the other side of this for people to be so worked up about letting glucose get really high.

645
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,240
So the issue with hypo-one diabetes is we think that hypo-glucosis are conferring

646
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,360
risk of complications, but the problem is you can't just throw in a bunch of insulin

647
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,560
and then normalize glucose because you will cause somebody to go low.

648
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,920
And with type 1 diabetes, the crux of the problem is the volatility in blood glucose.

649
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,520
So it's not just so simple that you can figure out the amount of carbohydrates you're going to eat

650
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,960
and take some insulin and your blood sugar is going to be normal.

651
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,600
Because even if you eat the exact same thing every single day, as anyone knows who has type 1

652
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,760
diabetes, and I only know this because of friends who have it, your level of stress,

653
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,480
how much sleep you had last night, how much exercise you've done or not done,

654
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,560
can even in the presence of the identical food stuff produce completely different insulin

655
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:57,160
requirements. And the other things in food like fat and protein also alter gastric emptying,

656
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,480
and the end result is a tremendous amount of slop and variance in the system.

657
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:08,520
And so we in the medical field often have this fantasy that, well, we can just come up with some

658
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:14,920
sort of formula for here's your insulin to carb ratio. And so I tell you that and then you're

659
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,760
supposed to follow it. And then if you come back and your blood glucose is aren't exactly perfect,

660
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,320
I, the physician would say, well, you obviously didn't follow it. You're, you know, they use this

661
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:29,880
terrible term of medicine, noncompliant, which means you didn't comply with what I told you to do.

662
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:36,440
It's grotesque. And no format or no arena is it more ridiculous than this one when you realize how

663
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,960
difficult this is. And as I learned from a patient of mine, actually, this was actually

664
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,600
probably the first person I was ever involved in the care of as a medical student. And we became

665
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:52,440
very good friends. He ultimately died from colon cancer, but he was a pilot. And after during one

666
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:58,520
of his bouts of, you know, sort of remission, he took me flying and he actually let me fly. Once

667
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,840
we got up, he, you know, he would, he took his hands off the stick. I had a stick and I was flying.

668
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,520
And he said, you got to look at the horizon. Don't look at the instruments. Because if you look at

669
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,200
the instruments, you're going to constantly be chasing them and you're getting into this

670
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:15,160
pilot induced oscillation. And obviously that's called instrument flying, which you learn to do

671
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:20,040
way down the line. But as a total rookie, you have to be able to fly off the horizon. And it was

672
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,960
amazing to me how much easier it was to fly that way. And in some ways that's what happens

673
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,960
when patients or physicians would get frustrated with this inability to manage this is you, you

674
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,320
tend to go too high, then too low, then too high, then too low. And then you are

675
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:38,760
vacillating wildly in these glucose levels. And again, yeah, you see these huge sine wave

676
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,880
excursions and, and some of them can be incredibly volatile. So I'm going to go back to the DCCT. So

677
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,400
they have this idea that they're going to somehow normalize blood glucose, but then there are some

678
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,600
people, physicians who say, well, that's a terrible idea because you can't actually normalize blood

679
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,720
glucose because you're going to make a bunch of people hypoglycemic. So there's a group of people

680
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,840
who are arguing against the DCCT. There's another people, including Elliott Joslin, are saying,

681
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:06,360
no, we need to understand if we can reduce the risk of long-term complications. So they carry

682
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:13,080
out this trial. It's intended to be a 10 year clinical trial. And they, it's 1441 patients,

683
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:20,600
they're relatively recent onset type one diabetes, they're largely late teen and adults. And it's a

684
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,320
very difficult trial to do because there were no established best practices to achieve neuro-normal

685
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:30,200
blood glucose at the time. So the average hemoglobin A1c for the population is around

686
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,600
9% at the time. That was just what, where they were. That's the lowest glucose you could have

687
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,800
to not have hypoglycemic events, right? Yeah. And sort of, that's where people were in order to not

688
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,080
dump massive amounts of glucose in their urine and sort of look okay. And in some cases, people

689
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:50,120
were taking insulin once a day. Quite often people were taking insulin once a day. And someone who's

690
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,840
got a hemoglobin A1c of 9% is not going to live a normal life. Their life expectancy is

691
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,120
truncated dramatically and their quality of life is going to be,

692
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,480
even by their forties, they're going to be quite compromised.

693
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:08,360
Yeah. So we know now from Swedish studies that somebody with an average hemoglobin A1c has about a-

694
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,400
Of what? Of 9?

695
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:17,640
Of 9% has approximately a six-fold increased risk of death and a six-fold risk, increased risk of

696
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,160
cardiovascular disease. And so that's shocking. And again, these are healthy people who are doing

697
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:28,440
their best, but the system just didn't work. So in the DCCT, they say, well, we want to normalize

698
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,640
blood glucose in the population and try to get them from nine all the way down to the non-diabetic

699
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,920
range, somewhere under six. And they put together all of these centers. And what they did was they

700
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:44,520
mandated conference calls. And on the conference calls, they shared best practices. They crowd-sourced

701
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,320
it, if you will. And so they didn't have any idea how they were going to achieve their goals,

702
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:56,120
but they ended up ultimately learning how to do it. And it involved phone calls and it involved

703
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:02,760
frequent visits and cajoling. And they're able to reduce the A1c from 9% to 7% in the population.

704
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,840
They intend to do this for a decade. There's a safety and monitoring board that's following

705
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:14,440
the curves. The primary outcome measure is diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy.

706
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,440
And the safety and monitoring board sees a huge difference in between the control and the

707
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:26,200
intervention group. And they stop the trial. And the reason is they felt that this was seven years

708
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:31,720
in and they felt that they- It was now unethical in the reverse. Yes. It was unethical to deprive

709
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:37,880
the general population of what they have learned. So they stopped the trial. There's a giant talk

710
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,280
at the American Diabetes Association that describes these immense differences. There's a paper that's

711
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:48,200
in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's an amazing, wonderful paper. And it changes type

712
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:55,560
one diabetes forever because it says that we can begin to reduce complications. And the work that

713
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:01,240
we do is incredibly important for this patient population. In some ways, it makes the field of

714
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:07,000
modern type one diabetes care because it says there really is something you can do other than

715
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,520
hold somebody's hand and look for complications. But on the other hand, it actually breaks the

716
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,440
field because we don't have the apparatus to routinely achieve the kinds of outcomes that the

717
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,920
NIH was able to do because they had near infinite resources. They spent over a hundred million

718
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,560
dollars for a relatively small number of patients. A hundred million dollars for 1400 patients over

719
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,680
seven years? Yeah. That's a staggering sum of money. Where did it go? I mean, and I'm not being

720
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,640
critical of that. I'm just saying like, what was so expensive about that study? Coordinating centers

721
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,200
and buying people's time to be able to care for them, to call them, to cajole them. There's a

722
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:48,440
lot of work that was done. Wow. I did not realize it was that expensive. And that's 30 years ago's

723
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,000
dollars. Yeah. I could have it wrong. We'll have to look this up. Okay. Yeah. We've got the team to

724
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,080
look that up, but I'm guessing directionally you're right that it was a costly study. It was a vast

725
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:02,760
amount of money. Yeah. Was there a sizable or noticeable increase in the hypoglycemic events

726
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,640
with that tighter control from nine to seven? Yes. There are many more hypoglycemic events and

727
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,360
there was weight gain. And so when they jack up the insulin, people found themselves eating more

728
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,240
carbs and eating out of the hole. And over time. Was that actually the case that they know that

729
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:23,960
the people who gained more weight consumed more of one type of food than another? No, not necessarily,

730
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,200
but practically if your blood glucose is low, the only thing that's going to get your glucose back

731
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:33,240
up is carbohydrates. Oh, so I see. So it's they were chasing carbs when they were overshooting

732
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,400
on insulin. Right. And this is one of the continual problems with type one diabetes is if

733
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:42,760
you jack up the insulin and your blood glucose is low, there's only one thing you can do to get your

734
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,400
glucose back up. I guess you could go out and you could exercise intensely, but it won't happen fast

735
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,920
enough. So acute carbohydrate is essential. So we don't really know not to get off on a tangent. We

736
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:59,960
don't know if those patients gained weight because of the hyperinsulinemia per se as a primary driver

737
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:06,600
or if it was sort of not necessarily a root cause, but more of a tangential driver that ultimately

738
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,480
forced more of this sort of hyperphasic response indirectly to compensate. You're asking a really

739
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:18,280
important question, which is, is the weight gain in type one diabetes absolutely obligate? Is it

740
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:24,520
coincident with tight control? And it was argued by many that the only way towards tight control

741
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,960
would be weight gain. And by the way, in the years since the DCCT, what we've seen is a huge

742
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,200
number of people with type one diabetes have gained weight and some cases uncontrollably.

743
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:41,720
And that is a really serious problem. And moreover, in the people who have gained the most weight have

744
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:46,360
had poor cardiovascular outcomes. There's a weak association. So I'm going to just talk about the

745
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:52,840
bigger picture of the DCCT so that the trial only happened for seven years. And then the cohorts

746
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,680
merged back to the same blood glucose and now they're followed for 25, 30 years. Wait a second.

747
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,880
When they merged, did they merge to seven or merge to nine? Yeah, they merged to eight. So what

748
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,040
happened was the people who had hemoglobin A1Cs of nine learned the benefits of tighter control and

749
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:16,680
they did their best. And the people at seven no longer under the grip of the best in class care

750
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,480
drifted up to eight. That's right. That became where people landed. Eight became the new normal

751
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:27,000
with a significant standard deviation within it. Some people just did better, worse. And then you

752
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,080
follow these people over the subsequent 23 plus years. And it turns out that there are immense

753
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:40,280
differences in major kidney disease and in cardiovascular disease and even death.

754
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:45,960
So the people who at least for seven years had tighter control versus less tight control, but

755
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,960
then for 23 years were identical to their peers still retained some benefit from the seven years,

756
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:57,320
30 years earlier. In cardiovascular disease, which is amazing and death. So that-

757
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:02,120
What kind of hazard ratios do you recall? I'm not sure I'll be able to remember it off the top of

758
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,080
my head. We'll link to all of this stuff of course. At least in the primary outcome measure for the

759
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:13,080
cardiovascular trial, it's approximately a third less of the primary outcome measure. So that's

760
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,880
really exciting. And it suggests that if you were able to routinely achieve blood glucoses in the

761
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:22,440
near normal range, you could drop your risk of cardiovascular disease accordingly to something

762
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:27,400
that was approaching a normal healthy non-diabetic person. That's pretty amazing, but it also puts a

763
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:34,360
lot of pressure on us as a field. So if you were to have a device, a magical device that could

764
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:40,600
measure someone's glucose in real time, and you were to put this on somebody 30 years ago back

765
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,360
when the standard of care was minimize the hypoglycemic events, we're going to tolerate

766
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:52,040
a hemoglobin A1C of 9%. Can you estimate what the standard deviation of glucose would have been

767
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,800
on that measurement? Do you have a sense of how high that could have been? Yeah, because I put

768
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,280
continuous glucose monitors on teenagers who don't listen to me. Okay, so talk to me about some of

769
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:06,920
those numbers. Yeah, so you might see blood glucoses of around, in some cases, 180 or 200 with a

770
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:12,200
standard deviation of 100. And so again, poorly controlled type of- You know my standard for

771
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:19,560
myself, right? Which is- Under 20? 90 plus or minus, if I'm fasting or on a sort of ketogenic

772
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,120
diet, I'd like to see it plus or minus less than 10. And when I'm just eating ad libitum, it's sort

773
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,240
of less than 15. Yeah. A hundred's amazing. A hundred means you're bouncing around nonstop,

774
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:34,760
which you're never normal. And you feel so bad for these patients because even if they intermittently

775
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,160
decide, okay, today's the day I want to get this right, like you just can't chase that down. That

776
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:43,320
is so difficult. I don't even know. It's hard for me to physiologically even think about what's

777
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,120
happening in those patients. And so that kind of volatility has driven everybody insane because

778
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,320
they think like, there's got to be a better way. There's got to be a better way. And you know,

779
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,040
anybody who lives with type 1 diabetes, they're constantly being asked, okay, well, what about a

780
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:02,040
cure? I hesitate to even use that word, but like some sort of definitive biological therapy. And

781
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:09,160
we've heard all along about the possibility of stem cells or some sort of maybe an auto loop

782
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,440
pancreas that would measure your glucose and administer insulin, or maybe some sort of beta

783
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:19,880
cell regenerative therapy or something combined with something that shuts down the autoimmune

784
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:26,600
system. So those three concepts are constantly trotted out as potential avenues. But from what

785
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,240
I can tell as a scientist, many of those things are years and years and years away, decades,

786
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,600
maybe even centuries. And so the problem was like, what do you do now to support people who

787
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,800
live with type 1 diabetes? How do you reduce that volatility? So I remember reading a paper a few

788
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,120
years ago, it was actually right after you and I met that I got more curious about this. And

789
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,840
especially then once I started wearing a CGM, which was shortly after that, and I've basically

790
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:56,440
never taken it off, I started to figure, I started to think, okay, well, from my angle,

791
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:02,040
it's how do you use these in people who don't have diabetes to drive better health? Right?

792
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,360
And one of the questions I wanted to understand was, was there any evidence that variability in

793
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,320
blood glucose per se beyond the average? So if you have someone whose average blood glucose is 100,

794
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:17,320
plus or minus 10 or 15 versus someone who's 100 plus or minus 30, is there a difference? Well,

795
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,400
the hemoglobin A1C would give you the same answer, and even the average glucose does.

796
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:27,240
And I believe I found some data that suggested that cognition was impaired during developmental

797
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:32,760
years by higher variability. Yes. And I think it was even independent of absolute glucose level.

798
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,000
And that was very frightening to me, not individually, because I was out of that loop,

799
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
but thinking about kids with type 1 diabetes, who now have yet another complication to be concerned

800
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,480
with, which is cognitive impairment, if the variability of glucose is too great.

801
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:53,560
It's well known that diabetes complications are increased with increasing A1Cs. A kind of

802
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:00,520
surprising piece of this is very short exposures to high blood sugars can completely change gene

803
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,880
expression in a whole bunch of genes, like endothelial cells. So there's a school of thought

804
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:12,920
that says that diabetes complications are really around the exposures to these weird toxic levels

805
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,960
of blood glucose that can occur. And what do you think toxic is? How high? Well, they always do it

806
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:23,800
experimentally by turning everything up to 11. So you never really know. But what you can say is

807
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:30,840
it is surprising and weird that a short, almost evanescent exposure to a very high blood glucose

808
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:39,400
could change the way genes behave in cells in a dish. And so that suggests to me that diabetes

809
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:46,520
complications may not be so simple as a sort of on off in between glucose and hemoglobin or glucose

810
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,920
and some other protein. You could have permanent profound changes in the way a cell behaves based

811
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:58,360
on intermittent exposures to very high blood glucose. So whether that's volatility or it's

812
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:04,440
an absolute level, we don't know. But it still puts it. That's just like nature to fuck with us like

813
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:09,880
that. I mean, you have to deal with some epigenetic change in response to a glucose. I mean, that's so

814
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,320
unfair. But in the end, it shows you that we had a very superficial understanding of diabetes

815
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:20,520
complications years ago. And again, now there's a whole rich field that's devoted to this idea of

816
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:27,000
these windows of hyperglycemia permanently altering these important cells that ultimately contribute

817
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,600
to diabetes complications. You're making me question my elaborate cheat meals sometimes.

818
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:39,000
Just admit this now to you and everybody else. A couple of days ago, I was like, you know,

819
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,800
I've been so good for so long. I've been doing my this and anything. And like there are just a

820
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,680
handful of junk foods I can't get enough of. And one of them is mini wheats. So I decided to have

821
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:54,280
a box of mini wheats. That's not a typo. It's not a bowl of mini wheats, a box of mini wheats.

822
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,800
Meaning if you have a big enough bowl, you can put the box in the bowl. So I had a box of mini

823
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:05,400
wheats in a bowl. And boy, if you really want to know why that's not a good idea, just wear a CGM.

824
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,880
And not to mention the splitting headache I had like an hour and later. Yeah, I get headaches.

825
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:15,080
I mean, I thought I was going to die. I'd feel better if I had six drinks, I think my head would

826
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:21,400
have hurt less. My blood glucose hit like 170. Now, again, that's in the grand scheme of things,

827
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,960
probably not that high for someone who's got type two diabetes or type one diabetes. But for someone

828
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,680
who's not diabetic, that's a pretty staggeringly high. I haven't seen a level that high in years.

829
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,880
And you think like, hey, these mini wheats are promoted as like part of a healthy breakfast.

830
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,000
And so imagine now-

831
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,760
Of course, no one's eating a box.

832
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,240
Box.

833
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:39,880
But yeah.

834
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,680
But if you think about this in the context of your kids, imagine dropping your kid off,

835
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,720
if your kid has type one diabetes, you drop them off at a birthday party and there's cake and there's-

836
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,760
Capri Sun.

837
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,400
Capri Sun.

838
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:01,480
And there's Cheetos and all this stuff is essentially carbohydrate. And if your child is-

839
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,160
And none of them are real carbohydrates. That's the problem, right? It's all like these fake

840
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:10,360
carbohydrates. It's one thing if they were like, all right, we're going to grind up some wheat and

841
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,280
you're going to have a piece of bread, which has its own issues. But yeah, these things that you've

842
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,920
described are basically IV infusions of glucose.

843
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,960
Let's imagine you drop your five year old off at a birthday party and you know they have

844
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,360
diabetes and you give them and they're wearing an insulin pump and everyone knows what they're

845
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:35,320
wanting, what they're supposed to do. And out of sight of all the adults, the kid eats two cupcakes.

846
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,480
That's the equivalent of the box of wheat thins. Is that what you're-

847
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,080
No, but it's funny you bring up wheat thins. That's one of my kids favorite things is he

848
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,080
calls them wheethens, but no, it's mini wheats.

849
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:45,320
Mini wheats.

850
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:45,800
Mini wheats.

851
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,080
Yes, it's just nonsense. It's basically breakfast dessert.

852
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:52,520
So again, this thing was really perplexing for me. And part of,

853
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:58,280
you know, when I really understood how challenging it all was, was spending time with people who

854
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:04,280
live with type 1 diabetes and looking and seeing what they do. And I didn't really get this as an

855
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:09,320
endocrine fellow. And we had this standards feel about, okay, you're going to check your blood

856
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:14,280
sugar before each meal and at bedtime. And then you're going to eat certain number of meals that

857
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:20,280
involve certain number of carbohydrates. And we had this fantasy that we're just going to sort of

858
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:27,240
make people live in what I call the diabetes ICU, which is a prescribed number of carbohydrates

859
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,880
and timing. And then we're going to sort of work towards making sure that everything was

860
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,120
very predictable and then bug glucoses would be near normal much of the time.

861
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:43,320
And I lived in that fantasy world, unperturbed by reality, until I became close friends with

862
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:48,840
several people who have type 1. And then I began to see what they do. So for instance,

863
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:55,080
my friend Marianne is a pediatric endocrinologist who works at Boston Children's. And one time we

864
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:03,400
were at this restaurant and we were at Bertucci's, you know, so pizza place. And she has type 1

865
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:09,000
diabetes and she's eating a Caesar salad. And I see her picking the croutons out. I'm like,

866
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,640
what are you doing? And she goes, oh, Jake, I can't eat these things. I'm like, what are you

867
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,760
talking about? She's like, if I eat those, these carbs, my blood sugar will just go loopy. So what

868
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,200
I discovered, and let's pause for a moment. You know, all of the molecular biology, you know,

869
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,960
how many grams of carbs are in that, right? You've been managing patients through their food with

870
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:35,480
insulin. And now you're watching one of your peers pull out what's probably 15 to 20 grams

871
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:41,320
of croutons. Like it's virtually like it's something that wouldn't even alter your blood

872
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:48,200
glucose. And yet she's saying to you, if I eat these things now, I'm really going to be chasing

873
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,320
this for a while. And she said, and I won't be able to figure out the right dose of insulin because

874
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:58,120
of all the fat that's in the salad dressing. She goes, I've just found that it's easier for me to

875
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,840
not eat this stuff. So I looked at that and I realized like, this is the ultimate hack. This

876
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,480
is somebody who figured out like the ultimate biohack. She's trying to make her blood sugars

877
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,880
near normal all the time. She discovered a group of foods that she needs to avoid. And so she

878
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:16,120
avoids them. And what did she figure out? I mean, presumably most of what she needed to avoid was

879
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:21,560
carbohydrates, but were there some that she found and I assume she did not have a CGM at this point

880
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:26,440
in time. That's right. So this is all on finger sticks. Yeah. This is doing it the really hard

881
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:31,960
way. She's testing 10 times a day or something. What did her, did they even have feeling left

882
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:37,880
in their fingers at this point? Quite often they won't. So they go after, people use finger stick

883
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,120
testing and will use one spot over and over again and it becomes numb. And that's a way to be able

884
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:47,480
to do it without pain. And I just know from when I'm doing a lot of finger sticking, like the bruising

885
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:53,160
and the discoloration and the discomfort. And I think to myself, it's one thing when I'm doing

886
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:58,680
this as a grownup who's choosing to do this, it's quite another thing for a kid who never signed up

887
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:05,000
for this to be going through this amount of pain. Yeah. And for their parents and for the parents

888
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,400
to think about all the other things that could happen. Like for instance, we, unfortunately,

889
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:15,960
we have kids who disappear. So we have teenagers who go off to college and they party with their

890
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,520
friends and potentially take the same dose of insulin that they would have taken and they have

891
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:26,120
fatal hypoglycemic episodes. And that doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's devastating.

892
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:33,080
It's really awful. And that sits in the back of parents' minds. And that kind of anxiety means

893
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:39,400
that nobody ever really just gets to be a parent or a kid because there's this constant fear of

894
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:46,440
what's my blood sugar? Is it high or low? And I think of it as a cognitive load. It's the burden

895
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:51,400
of having to think nonstop about your diabetes. And if you can imagine that volatility, the

896
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,800
rollercoaster blood sugars that are going up and down, you're going to have to think about it

897
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:03,480
nonstop. And I think that the cognitive load in some ways is probably a really pivotal factor

898
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:09,640
in the anxiety and depression that's associated with type 1 diabetes. So there's a whole category

899
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:16,280
of a very complicated mental illness that people with type 1 diabetes have, approximately 45 or 50

900
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:22,840
will have depression or anxiety. And it can be really debilitating. And of course, we don't really

901
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:29,480
have any way of knowing is what percentage or what amount or proportion of that debilitating

902
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:36,760
mental illness is resulting from the physiology of the hyperglycemia, the glucose fluctuations,

903
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:42,920
and the hyperinsulinemia or the relative hyperinsulinemia versus this much more difficult

904
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:48,200
to track metric of the cortisol levels that accompany the stress or other things that we

905
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,200
couldn't even measure if we wanted to that accompany that, as you put it, I like that phrase,

906
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,280
cognitive load. I mean, what's the current thinking on that? I didn't realize that the,

907
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,760
did you say 40% depression? That seems almost impossible to believe.

908
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:08,520
Well, imagine, let's imagine you have type 1 diabetes and you've lived with it for 20 or 25

909
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:13,640
years. And right now you're a little bit hungry and you're trying to figure out what your blood

910
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,240
sugar is going to be. And you look down at your CGM and you get a number and you're thinking,

911
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:21,880
well, like, what do I have to do? And when do I have to time the dose of insulin and will I get

912
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:27,480
it right? And think about the last time I gave insulin and I didn't give it right. And I had that

913
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:35,160
hypoglycemic episode and it was embarrassing. And so I mean, it's a big, really serious challenge

914
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:42,120
in that I try to quantify what I call the cognitive load using a diabetes distress scale. And it's an

915
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:47,480
adaptation of a published distress scale. And I basically say to people, okay, I want to talk to

916
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:55,480
you using a Likert scale, a 1 to 10 scale about your diabetes related distress. And so it's on

917
01:22:55,480 --> 01:23:01,400
a 1 to 10 scale. And 1 means you know you have diabetes, but it's not holding you back at all.

918
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:06,280
It's there. It's in the back of your mind. It's not bothering you. You get to do what you want to do.

919
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:10,680
And a 10 means you have diabetes and you can't think about anything else. And it's pretty much

920
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:15,400
omnipresent and it alters your ability to carry out the things you want to do.

921
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:22,920
So if this is on a 1 to 10 scale. So what's the median score for a teenager who has had this

922
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:29,640
disease for five years or more? Who's on a high carb diet, seven or eight. And I've seen people

923
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:35,400
who have hemoglobin A1c's that are approaching 14 who are doing basically nothing to care for their

924
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:41,880
diabetes, teenagers who are really struggling. And when I described this to them, their answer

925
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:48,600
is tears pour out of their eyes. And because no one has ever actually asked them how do they feel

926
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:56,920
and they will say a 10. But they can't even admit it because no one has ever considered that they

927
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:02,520
have this terrible burden. What they think is, you know, this kid doesn't do what everybody wants

928
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,880
him to do. You know, he has got a hard head. He's not listening to us. But in fact, the kid is not

929
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:14,360
doing anything, is thinking about it nonstop and is wracked with guilt and shame. And this is not

930
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:18,840
just true of teenagers, it's true of adults because the adults want to do a better job,

931
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:24,280
but they lack the tools and the support to be able to carry it out and they blame themselves.

932
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:29,960
So this endless cycle of blame and shame and negativity is unfortunately in many cases

933
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:34,520
reinforced by the medical establishment because now you come in, you get a hemoglobin A1c of 14.

934
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:39,800
And what do you get? He gets panked. Yeah, you get a lecture about how you need to do a better

935
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:45,560
job. You're told you're not compliant. You might even be threatened with being fired by your doctor

936
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,680
unless you do a better job. You know, you might not be able to make appointments here. This is a

937
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:58,360
privilege to come and see the endocrinologist. And so people end up in this weird cycle of antagonism

938
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:03,400
towards the medical establishment who apparently don't know that much about type 1 diabetes and

939
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,760
certainly aren't empathetic about it. And then their loved ones who are like, well, why can't he

940
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:14,680
or she do a better job failing to understand who really complicated it is? And there's no well-worn

941
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:22,600
path in the general populace on how to get to a better spot. And so one of the really crucial

942
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:29,160
elements of this, which is so bizarre is that this diabetes distress or this anxiety or whatever it is,

943
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:37,560
is egosyntonic. And so it doesn't feel foreign. People are depressed or anxious. And they just

944
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:42,040
think that this is the way life is going to be forever. They can't imagine another world

945
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:48,280
where they would feel better. They just think that life sucks. And when you get them, I've

946
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:53,800
worked with people where I've actually had the privilege of working with a few people who have

947
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:00,040
dropped their hemoglobin A1Cs in half. And the experience changed my life. You can get somebody

948
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:06,920
from an A1C of greater than 14 down to under seven. And when they talk about it, they're astounded by

949
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:13,960
the changes in their ability to think and feel and see the world around them and the love that

950
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,760
all these people who were trying to help them have that they couldn't even recognize.

951
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:23,720
Yeah, that's very powerful. I don't have anything that I could even think to add to that.

952
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:28,040
Let's go back to the pizza store, Pizza Shop. You're watching your colleague, what was her name?

953
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,040
Maryann Quinn.

954
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:35,400
You're watching Maryann pull the croutons out of the Caesar salad and it plants a bug in your

955
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,280
mind, right?

956
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,080
Right.

957
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:42,680
So how long from then until you've discovered this continuous glucose monitor little contraption?

958
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,360
So only about four or five years. I was a fellow at Boston Children's and I worked in a

959
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,600
basic science research lab studying insulin signaling with Morris White. And then I go off

960
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:58,760
and I get my first job as an assistant professor at UPenn and I'm there and I set up.

961
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,600
So, okay. So you're a chop actually, right?

962
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:00,760
Right.

963
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,240
So you're bouncing around between the biggest children's hospitals in the world.

964
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:11,000
And I set up a lab studying beta cells. And my idea was that I was going to use basic science to

965
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,600
advance outcomes for people with type one. And I have this background and

966
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,160
a bunch of passion in trying to figure out ways to grow new beta cells. And the hope is we'll be

967
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:25,320
able to find some way to do that safely and reliably. And I also have a clinical practice

968
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:31,160
that's focused on type one and other endocrine disorders. And along the way, I become very close

969
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:37,800
friends with people who live with type one and I start to talk to them and follow them. And I

970
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,840
start to meet some of the reps, that is the sales representatives for various companies,

971
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:49,880
including one who herself has type one diabetes. This is Natalie Bellini. So she's an amazing

972
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:56,920
person who has type one and she's wearing this device, which is this black hockey puck. It's this

973
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,040
Dexcom thingy.

974
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,320
What generation was that?

975
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,280
It was the very first.

976
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:01,880
Wow.

977
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:11,320
And so this is approximately 2000, maybe seven. And I thought, well, this is amazing because it's

978
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,120
obviously a consumer device. It's approved and then you could give it to patients and they could

979
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:21,640
wear this thing and then they could figure out ways to improve their glucose excursions. And

980
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:27,160
actually several of my friends went on them and what they discovered was the devices were

981
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:34,840
incredibly frustrating because if you just wear the device and again, a Dexcom or is just one

982
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:39,320
that's a company that's making a continuous glucose monitor. And what they do is they take

983
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:45,880
a probe that goes into your interstitial space, say in your belly. It's a very small needle and

984
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,880
it sits in the space. And what it's doing is it's sampling the interstitial fluid, which is the

985
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:55,560
clear fluid that exists in between cells, which roughly correlates to blood glucose, but is

986
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:01,400
delayed by about eight or 10 minutes. And so the device essentially has glucose oxidase,

987
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:09,240
which is an enzyme and it's stuck onto this platinum wire. It's basically an enzyme on a stick

988
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:14,360
and so when glucose comes by and it does the enzymatic conversion, it generates a charge,

989
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:20,120
which is transmitted down the wire and the change in the wire charges is transmitted to this hockey

990
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,120
puck like device that tells you your glucose. So that's pretty cool. And it blows my mind when I

991
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:29,240
see it working regularly for patients. And my thought is, okay, so we're going to prescribe

992
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,880
these for all of our patients and then they're going to figure out how to make their blood

993
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:38,600
glucose is better. But as it turns out, the first generation of CGM was a dismal failure and the

994
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:43,480
uptake was incredibly, incredibly small in the population of people with type 1 diabetes. And

995
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:48,200
part of the issue is we didn't really know what to do. So when we looked in the toolbox of trying to

996
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:53,000
help people so they could live with type 1 diabetes, we didn't find much other than badgering

997
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,880
them to do a better job. You know, oh, you need to check your blood glucose 20 minutes before the

998
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,960
meal and give yourself insulin 20 minutes before the meal and do that in a very reliable way so

999
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:10,280
that your blood glucose is normal. But that's not realistic. And for that matter, no one really

1000
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:15,880
knows that they're going to eat. So there's a major problem in that we live in this fantasy

1001
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,720
world in medicine, where we think people just need to carry out their lives with more precision. And

1002
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:24,520
that will be the answer. But the reality is variance is contained in human behavior. It's

1003
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:31,160
just what we do. So that idea of badgering people doesn't work. And then maybe it's exercise. So,

1004
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:35,080
okay, as it turns out, if you're a marathon runner, and you have type 1 diabetes,

1005
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:41,400
your diabetes control is much, much better. And part of the mechanism is via this insulin

1006
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:46,600
independent glucose uptake into skeletal muscle via AMP kinase. So there's a whole there's two

1007
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:51,080
different pathways whereby glucose gets into skeletal muscle. One is via the insulin dependent

1008
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:57,320
pathway. We've spoke about that before, that goes to glute for the insulin independent pathway is

1009
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:04,440
working through exercise and work of muscle. And AMP kinase is this amazing enzyme that is sensing

1010
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:09,640
the energy status of the cell. And if you if you alter the energy status of the cell through a

1011
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:17,160
tremendous amount of work, you can basically drive a bunch of signals that go to tell the glute four

1012
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:22,200
to translocate to the membrane and skeletal muscle. So now you get insulin independent glucose

1013
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,600
uptake in the skeletal muscle. So it's still through glute four, right? But it comes from

1014
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:33,800
inside the cell activation, I assume, yes, MPK activating AMP, K sends the glute for transporter

1015
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:40,760
up. And in a non athlete, what is the relative difference between insulin dependent and the AMP

1016
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:48,680
K driven glucose disposal in the muscle? I'm not exactly sure. But I can say that if, for instance,

1017
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:55,080
I take a kid who has type one diabetes, and we have stable insulin doses, and then they go on like

1018
01:31:55,080 --> 01:32:00,680
a ski vacation with their parents, and the kids are, you know, mostly playing video games and

1019
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:06,520
hanging out, and then they get they go off to veil and they ski for six hours a day. Those kids can

1020
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,720
can require nonstop carbohydrates until their parents figure out that they have a problem. And

1021
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:18,200
then they end up on insulin doses that are reduced by two thirds. So the effect can be dramatic.

1022
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:23,640
In normal non exercise associated glucose homoestasis, I think a lot of it is insulin driven.

1023
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:28,920
And so as you carry out more and more exercise, you invoke this pathway more and more.

1024
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:33,160
Yeah, it's so interesting. I need to look into this more because I've never I can't believe it

1025
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:37,240
didn't occur to me to look at the patients with type one diabetes to answer this question. I've

1026
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:42,520
always wondered what the relative difference is in, you know, like if you're taking metformin,

1027
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:48,200
which is activating AMPK, and if you're exercising like crazy, you should be able to dispose of

1028
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,520
glucose with lower and lower insulin levels. Right. And so we can obviously measure this.

1029
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:52,920
That's right.

1030
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:59,240
In a oral glucose tolerance test. The problem is we don't know why. We don't know what it is.

1031
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:04,600
That's is that they're more sensitive to insulin, which is that's a two hour discussion on end of

1032
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:09,240
itself, which you and I'll have over dinner right after this. Or is it that no, they're

1033
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:15,000
each unit of or heterodimer of insulin produces the same magnitude of glute four translocation,

1034
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:22,920
but they're experiencing a benefit of this AMPK version. In other words, how much of the insulin

1035
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:28,360
sensitivity is really less about insulin and more about AMPK. I think for people who are very

1036
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,960
athletic and who are focused on trying to reduce their body fat, it can probably be a huge

1037
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:39,160
contribution. And we have these adults who have type one diabetes who are down to 20 units of

1038
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:44,760
insulin and a normal 70 kilogram person would be on 60 or 70 units of insulin. So the marathon

1039
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,360
runners who are thin, of course they have very thin body habitus, but many of those people are

1040
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:56,200
putting in 60, 70, 80 miles a week or on tiny doses of insulin. So again, so we got, I have a patient

1041
01:33:56,200 --> 01:34:03,640
by the way, with type one diabetes who uses five units of insulin a day. Wow. He walks six miles

1042
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:10,680
a day minimum, sometimes 10. And he does not really consume carbohydrates outside of vegetables.

1043
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,720
And how much body fat?

1044
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:18,600
I've never seen a higher adiponectin and lower leptin in a human I've ever measured. He is a

1045
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:25,400
lean, mean machine. Yeah. So those people are just my heroes. It's so, I'm thrilled to hear about this.

1046
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,560
So if we're looking in the toolbox, we find like badgering people to do a better job,

1047
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:35,400
maybe exercise, and then like, what else do you got? And so I'm looking around and I'm looking at

1048
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,120
this and I'm trying to... So we're going back to the exercise thing for a moment. Do you see a

1049
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:43,640
difference in, I don't like the term aerobic, but people know what I mean by aerobic exercise versus

1050
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:51,560
strength training. Yeah. I think that people who are doing distance, who are, that they actually have

1051
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:57,560
more contribution of this AMPK pathway and Lori Goodyear has studied this for years and years.

1052
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:05,080
She's at the Jozlyn. And again, this AMPK exercise associated pathway is incredibly potent,

1053
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,960
but it's all distance. I don't think it's strength. And then do you think there's a difference between

1054
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:16,120
going out and running 10 quarter mile repeats at staggering intensity where you're burning through

1055
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:22,040
glycogen in the muscle versus, so that would only be what, a total of two and a half miles of running

1056
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,800
versus going out and running six or seven miles at a much lower intensity. Do you think there's

1057
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,640
a difference between those two? Yeah, I think there's a huge difference, but what I hear over

1058
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:34,760
and over again is the people who are the distance athletes or the people who are able to dramatically

1059
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:40,840
reduce their total amount of insulin. But again, there's relative debate and this is not well

1060
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,640
studied. So you'd like to really carry out a proper study with high intensity exercise versus

1061
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:52,840
very slow long duration exercise. But this idea of trying to sort of hack the system

1062
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:59,800
to reduce the total exposure to insulin and therefore reduce the volatility and the hyperglycemic

1063
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:06,600
excursions, that's really exciting. And I suspect that the people like your patient who have, you

1064
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,960
know, down to eight units of insulin, these people have really cracked the code. So when did the

1065
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:18,520
Dexcom for you, was it around gen four that it really started to become a real impact? Yeah,

1066
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:24,200
the G4 was a special device. So for me, it wasn't just that we replaced the hockey puck,

1067
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:29,160
at least in my life that the transformative thing was learning about Dr. Richard Bernstein

1068
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,760
in his book. And do you know Richard? Well, I only talked to him on a teleconference. I'm on a

1069
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:40,120
low carb physician teleconference that happens once a month and I talked to him regularly then.

1070
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:44,600
You got to get me on this. How am I not on this? I'd be very curious to just be a fly on the wall.

1071
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,960
Is there any chance I can get invited? Yeah. So it's run by Virta Health and it's focused on type one.

1072
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:56,840
It's on Virta. How did I not know about this? So it's low carb and type one and it's physicians

1073
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:02,680
who are very much interested in the intersection of type one and low carb. It's really cool.

1074
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:07,000
I've never met Dr. Bernstein, but I've read his book and I've spoken on the telephone with him.

1075
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,400
He's very graciously extended an offer for me to come out to his clinic and spend time. And I

1076
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:16,280
would give anything to be able to make that time. I just haven't been able to. But it's safe to say

1077
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:21,480
he's kind of the guy who's spent more time doing this and has more clinical experience in this

1078
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:27,080
than probably anyone else. And because he did it with himself, right? It's amazing. He actually got

1079
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:36,840
a YSI blood glucose tester and has been using it at home forever. So he's been blood glucose testing

1080
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:43,720
before anybody else did. And he had this essential core idea, which was carbohydrates

1081
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:49,160
caused blood glucose excursions and that he has the so-called rule of small numbers, which says

1082
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:54,360
that if you consume more carbs, you need more insulin and therefore there's a greater opportunity

1083
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:59,560
to make a mistake. And so if you consume fewer carbs, you will consume less insulin and you'll

1084
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:05,800
have fewer mistakes. It's a very simple idea. It's laid out along with a ton of practical tips in his

1085
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:11,240
book. He's incredible. He figured this out. And we'll link to his book, but it's called the Dr.

1086
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:17,480
Bernstein's diabetes solution. Yeah, it's a Bible. It's like it's a tome. And it's for type one and

1087
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:22,520
type two. And it includes all sorts of pearls, not just on straight diabetes, but also diabetes

1088
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:27,960
complications. It's really shocking. And he had, and again, this is like the 11th or 12th edition.

1089
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,320
He's been doing this for years and years. So he has a private practice. He's in his 80s. He lives

1090
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:40,440
in Westchester County, New York, and is working out and incredibly healthy. So he figured out that

1091
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:46,760
if you avoid carbohydrates and if you give medium and long acting insulin to cover protein and fat

1092
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:52,440
and basal metabolic requirements, that you could get blood glucose is very, very close to normal.

1093
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,680
And he typically prescribes a low carb high protein diet. It's not low carb high fat. It's

1094
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:02,840
not ketogenic. What have we learned from Bernstein's experience on how

1095
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,440
insulin genic protein is? Cause that's somewhat debatable, right? I mean,

1096
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:13,800
clearly protein stimulates some insulin and certain in vitro studies suggest it can be

1097
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:18,040
very insulin genic. What does the real world experience tell us about that?

1098
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:22,680
In my patients with type one diabetes who consume protein and don't cover it with insulin, they can

1099
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,080
get these massive glucose excursions. And we think in general, there's a ratio of around

1100
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:35,080
10 grams of protein end up being six grams of carbohydrate. But the problem is the kinetics

1101
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:41,080
are not immediate. So you don't get gluconeogenesis in a matter of seconds. It's delayed over hours.

1102
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:47,080
And doesn't it also depend on their nitrogen requirement? So in other words, you could have,

1103
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:52,600
which is obviously true with glucose, but you could have two individuals who are similar

1104
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:59,480
at the crude metrics. Say each of them gets 40 grams of protein, but one of them has just finished

1105
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,720
exercising or lifting weights and the other one hasn't. And you're going to presumably see very

1106
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:08,440
different glucose responses, correct? But the vast majority of humans were at homeostasis.

1107
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:14,360
And overall, if you look at the USDA requirements, this is a suggestion we need to consume 56 grams

1108
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:21,960
of protein. And then, and the net result of that is approximately six grams of protein that go into

1109
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:29,880
metabolism. So excuse me, seven grams. So there's a net excess that's 49 grams that ends up being

1110
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:34,600
approximately, what is that? 30 grams of carbohydrate. But on the other hand, if you're consuming high

1111
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:42,200
protein, if you sit down to a 12 ounce rib eye, and it also has fat, which will delay the absorption,

1112
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:49,640
the sum total of that could be 80, 100 grams of protein that turns into glucose. That is this

1113
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:56,440
massive slow wave that rises and stays high for much of the evening after you eat it, which could

1114
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:01,080
be very frustrating. So a lot of people who have type 1 diabetes think, well, okay, I'm going to do

1115
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:08,440
this sort of low carb thing. So instead of eating the pasta, I'm going to have a piece of fish and

1116
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:14,200
some vegetables, but there's no carbohydrate. Cool. I don't need to take any insulin. But then you get

1117
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:19,720
this weird glucose excursion that comes from the protein. And the essence of the Bernstein method,

1118
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:26,200
if you read his book, is to try to cover protein with insulin. And he uses regular insulin, not

1119
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:32,760
short acting, hemalog or novalog. And the idea is the regular insulin was a, which is human insulin,

1120
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:41,080
has a peak of onset within approximately an hour or two, and it lasts for six to eight hours.

1121
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:46,360
And so it roughly, very roughly corresponds with the kinetics of what protein will do to your glucose.

1122
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,680
So what's unique about Bernstein is he's using this ancient form of insulin,

1123
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:58,440
regular human insulin, instead of these very rapid acting analogs, because the protein is absorbed

1124
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:03,080
and turns into glucose in a delayed fashion. I've never really understood these rapid onset

1125
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:09,400
insulins because they seem to get back to this oscillation problem of, I mean, so the first

1126
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:14,040
observation of Bernstein is more carbohydrate means more insulin, more insulin means more

1127
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:20,120
vacillation. But now you're introducing another effect, which is short acting insulin causes more

1128
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:27,720
rapid changes in the glucose, which can more easily result in you making another decision after that

1129
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:33,240
amplifies the signal instead of dulls the signal. Right. So to go back to your analogy of the plane,

1130
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:39,240
potentially what it means is a plane that can much more rapidly gain or lose. Yeah. And you can get

1131
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:44,920
into a lot of trouble. And unfortunately, the insulin pump companies and even the insulin

1132
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:49,640
companies have advocated an approach that says, look, people who live with type one diabetes

1133
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:54,040
have tough lives. We need to support them and they should be allowed to eat what they want

1134
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:58,920
and they should just cover for it. And the problem is you end up with these crazy oscillations

1135
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:02,920
and the oscillations are associated again with a tremendous burden of illness and this cognitive

1136
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:08,440
load and this fear and this anxiety. And you'll have to forgive my sort of snarky-ism, but that's

1137
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:13,160
a really wonderful business model if you want to sell more insulin too. Yeah, exactly. Because

1138
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:18,280
you consume, well, first of all, everybody gets a pump and then they're told that this is the way

1139
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:23,640
to feel normal. You run shots, you go to pump and then you can just eat what you want. And then

1140
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:27,480
then of course you consume insulin and you gain weight and you need more insulin.

1141
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:35,160
So, yeah, and I'm not, I am so not the conspiracy guy, but I also believe it's important to

1142
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:41,160
understand incentives and I don't think pharma is evil. I think far more good has come from the

1143
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:45,640
ability of being able to sell insulin and sell insulin pumps and all these things. I really do

1144
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:52,040
think these are a net positive, but I also think we have to keep in mind there are modifications

1145
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:59,560
that you can make and obviously you live this with your patients that can give you 80% maybe of the

1146
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:04,200
joy that comes from eating. I mean, let's be honest. I think to eat a restricted diet, to eat a diet

1147
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:09,480
that is far fewer in carbohydrates, you're giving up some pleasure. There's just no doubt about it.

1148
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:15,080
But if you could give up 20% of the pleasure of eating and get 80% more benefit in your health,

1149
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:21,560
those are the kind of asymmetric benefits that I think in the long run probably pay off, but

1150
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:26,440
it's still not easy. I had to figure this out for myself and I had seen people do low carbon. I

1151
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:32,760
didn't really understand it and I just started doing it myself. So I gradually cut back carbohydrates

1152
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:38,920
until approximately four years ago when we went low carb as a family and my wife cleared out the

1153
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:43,720
pantry. There were no more enriched carbohydrates in our house, but we had teenage girls who were,

1154
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:50,760
one was in college and one was going off to college and I can remember the day. I had wanted

1155
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:56,520
to do it, she wanted to do it. We just decided to try it. So we went low carb as a family and then

1156
01:44:56,520 --> 01:45:01,880
we've stayed on it ever since. So actually these days I'm probably ketotic. I wouldn't be surprised

1157
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:08,520
if my beta hydroxybutyrate is well above one right now. So when did you start to, I mean,

1158
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:13,320
I guess now that I'm thinking about it, it was, we were probably at the G5 by the time you and I met

1159
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:18,120
and I remember you showing me data and I really think at the time your patients averaged about

1160
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:24,920
5.7 and their hemoglobin A1C, which is as normal as normal gets. Yeah. And part of it, it took me

1161
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,160
a while to understand the power of this. And you also noted by the way that they had fewer

1162
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:33,960
hypoglycemic events than patients who were walking around at seven. Yeah. The incredible

1163
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:38,920
thing is that you can reduce the excursions and people have very few lows. And again,

1164
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:45,480
I read Bernstein and I also learned of a recent Facebook group, which is called type one grit.

1165
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:53,000
T-Y-P-E-O-N-E-G-R-I-T. And so that's a group of people who are followers of the Bernstein method.

1166
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,360
And it's an amazing group of people who are supporting each other and you see

1167
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:03,800
CGM tracings and you see foods that they eat and you see happy kids or adults. And you might see

1168
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,480
somebody complaining about their healthcare provider who didn't have a clue about low carb.

1169
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:13,560
And it's just sort of a conversation that happens in private amongst people who live with type one

1170
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:19,320
or those who have a loved one. And there's also healthcare providers like me who are part of it.

1171
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:23,960
And again, so it took me a while to understand it and to understand its nuance and to start

1172
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:31,640
to iterate it. But for me, the real turning point was changing the way I practiced medicine. So the

1173
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:37,560
problem with endocrinology is the schedules were so tight and the only way I could see patients was

1174
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:43,320
every 20 minutes or 30 minutes. And to try to talk to somebody about something as complicated as

1175
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:48,840
living with type one three or four times a year and also renew their prescriptions and go through

1176
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:55,560
their labs and document and all this stuff was impossible. And I just decided for my own sanity

1177
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:01,400
that I needed to change my practice. And so at the time I had a very small amount of clinical

1178
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,800
responsibility because I was mostly in the research lab and I also had administrative responsibility.

1179
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:12,200
So what I decided to do was to make sure that when I saw patients, I only saw them at the end of the

1180
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:18,840
day. And the idea was I'd see them starting at 4.30 and that we would just spend as much time as it

1181
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:26,360
took. And then I added on other patients. But for instance, some endocrinologists will run from room

1182
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:31,960
to room to room to room. I only need one room because I'm going to see a patient for an hour.

1183
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:36,840
And then when we're done, they leave and the new one comes in. I don't need to run back and forth.

1184
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:42,360
There's nobody else. So I made a conscious decision that I was going to be more inefficient,

1185
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:46,440
that I was going to spend more time with people. It's possible I was going to spend much more time

1186
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:51,880
doing clinical work for the few patients that I saw. But I wanted to carry out experiments just

1187
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:58,680
to try to determine what sort of impact I could have. And the crux of the idea was if you have

1188
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:06,200
limitless resources that you make available to a patient and you really try to listen and understand

1189
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:12,280
and support people, could you have transformative outcomes? And fast forward several years,

1190
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:16,680
what I've discovered is that some people who medicine is essentially given up on,

1191
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:23,480
these teenage kids who have hemoglobin A1c's of 10 or 12 or 14, who are basically on a super

1192
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:27,480
high-weighted death. These are the people who are going to have their first-heart attacks when they're

1193
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:35,960
35. That you can do a lot and help them. And they feel paralyzed and they're looking for somebody who

1194
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:42,120
can really understand how difficult it is and to provide a level of comfort and compassion. And

1195
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:46,680
sometimes the first five visits, you end up talking about almost nothing at all. But you're

1196
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,000
establishing a rapport and they get that you're going to be in a different mold than maybe the

1197
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,880
other endocrinologist they've seen. And so I try my hardest, and this is really hard for me because

1198
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:01,480
I love to talk, but I try my hardest not to talk and to just ask open-ended questions and to be

1199
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:08,920
there. And in general, I found that if I'm asking questions and allowing them to have the space,

1200
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:15,720
that we can open up. And ultimately they can begin to acknowledge that it's really difficult.

1201
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:21,320
They're looking for new ways. They're eager to try it, but they are distrustful of this idea that

1202
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:26,920
I'm just going to give them a short list, like a recipe, and then run away and expect them to do it.

1203
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:33,000
So it requires patients, and this is especially true of teenagers, who that feedback loop of

1204
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:38,280
giving them information and seeing them act on it is delayed by all their growth and development

1205
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:44,600
and everything else. And especially with teenagers, it's so important to suspend disbelief and to be

1206
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:50,840
there for them in a patient and loving way, even if they can't immediately respond in the way you

1207
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:56,840
want. So we now have in the toolkit of treating patients with type 1 diabetes, we've got exercise,

1208
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:03,400
we've got continuous glucose monitoring, we've got carbohydrate restriction.

1209
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:11,000
Are there any other apps or technologies or things that you think are paramount to helping,

1210
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,600
or foods for that matter, meaning packaged foods that are particularly useful? In other words,

1211
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,880
if you're a parent and you're listening to this, or if you're a person and you're listening to this

1212
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:24,360
who has type 1 diabetes, and you just, this is all news to you, you're listening to this and this is

1213
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:30,280
totally blowing your mind, what do you need to go out and get to get started? Well, I mean, CGM is

1214
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:35,720
essential. And I'm assuming, are there any insurance companies that are not covering CGM for type 1?

1215
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:41,320
Plenty. And... Jesus Christ, seriously? Yeah, well, part of it is a huge fraction of people in our

1216
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:46,200
country now have these high deductible plans. So they're on the hook for their healthcare expenses,

1217
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:49,560
and when their kid is healthy and everyone's healthy, they're good, and all of a sudden,

1218
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:55,080
kid gets diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and it's like $10,000 a year? Yeah, $10,000 a year.

1219
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,880
Right, the insulin cost alone can just kill these families.

1220
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:05,640
But CGM is really important. And then in the toolbox, there's a few other key things, but the

1221
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:11,000
most important thing is information. So you've got to have Bernstein's book. You should be following

1222
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,640
type 1 grit, which is this Facebook group, which again, which is a wonderful place to learn about

1223
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:23,160
low carb. There are wonderful podcasts and also some terrific YouTube videos talking about the

1224
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:28,680
intersection between low carb and type 1. I want to put in a plug for an organization called Low

1225
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:34,440
Carb Down Under, which is really a wonderful group of people. Dr. Rod Taylor in Australia.

1226
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:39,480
In Australia. Yeah, Dr. Rod Taylor is an amazing character. He's an anesthesiologist in Melbourne,

1227
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:47,320
and a passionate advocate and supporter of all things low carb. And his organization

1228
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:53,880
goes around the world doing AV capture of low carb talks. And so on YouTube, they have a YouTube

1229
01:51:53,880 --> 01:52:00,600
channel with over eight million views on various low carb things, including some terrific talks on

1230
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:06,360
low carb by, for instance, Dr. Troy Stapleton, who's a radiologist who got type 1 diabetes himself

1231
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:12,280
and figured out how to hack it using low carb. Where does he live? He is in Brisbane. Oh, okay.

1232
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:18,840
He's an amazing person. Very nice. So there's this growing community of low carb nerds who are trying

1233
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,000
to help people with type 1. And again, there's a bunch of different places where it's happening.

1234
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:29,640
Another really nice resource is Adam Brown's book, which is called Bright Spots and Landmines. And

1235
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:36,200
he works for Close Concerns. And he wrote this book essentially as the manual for diabetes that

1236
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:42,760
he wished he had been given. And it contains lots of tips and tricks about how to think about living

1237
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:51,720
with type 1. And it's from wellness and to exercise, to sleep, all the way to very practical tips around

1238
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:56,920
low carb and nutrition and type 1. How careful does someone with type 1 diabetes need to be if they

1239
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:03,400
go on a ketogenic diet? Obviously, in patients with a normal pancreas, even those who are somewhat

1240
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:09,960
compromised by type 2 diabetes, I'm not aware of any case of ketoacidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis.

1241
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:14,280
But in patients with type 1 who have no insulin production, that would have to be a real concern,

1242
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:19,640
wouldn't it? Well, I think that there are some interesting intersections in between a hardcore,

1243
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:24,440
I'm not talking about generic low carb or low carb high protein, all of the Bernstein method.

1244
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:30,280
But let's talk about the people who were trying to get into nutritional ketosis with a beta-hydroxy

1245
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:36,200
butyrate that hovers around 1 to 2. Well, those people have a couple of unique problems. And one

1246
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:41,640
is diabetic ketoacidosis, as you mentioned. Again, for the folks to understand why that's the case,

1247
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:47,800
and you or me, even when I'm fasting and I fast for a week at a time, my beta-hydroxybutyrate

1248
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:53,080
level will reach 6 or 7 millimolar. But it's not going to reach 10 millimolar. It's certainly not

1249
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:59,400
going to reach 12 or 14, which is where we start to see the acidotic changes. Because eventually,

1250
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:05,000
that ketone is going to elicit some response from insulin. Right. In the person who has

1251
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,480
no beta cell reserve, that ketone can go unabated. So prolonged fasting in a person

1252
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:15,960
who lives with type 1 diabetes is probably a bad idea because you could get your beta-hydroxybutyrate

1253
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:22,760
to 6 or 8 or 10, and you could start to feel sick. Another issue is it's a new phenomenon called

1254
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:31,560
euglycemic DKA, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. And we're seeing this in these sodium glucose

1255
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:39,000
cotransporter inhibitors, these SGLT2 inhibitors. And it's a very bizarre phenomenon, but in people

1256
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,720
with type 1 diabetes who go on these sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors, they can get

1257
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:52,760
a strange form of DKA where their glucose is not elevated. And it has confounded the field,

1258
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:56,680
and there have even been deaths associated with this. There's currently clinical trials,

1259
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:02,280
and full disclosure, I've been a consultant on one of these programs. Does this only occur

1260
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:07,720
in patients with type 1 diabetes or can patients with type 2 diabetes who are the predominant users

1261
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:14,040
of the SGLT2 inhibitors also get this euglycemic ketoacidosis? We think it's mostly type 1s,

1262
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:19,640
but it may also be type 2s. And the problem, I think it's probably mostly type 1s. And here's

1263
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:28,600
the issue, like how do you get this? Patients with type 2 can get DKA, but largely it's at onset.

1264
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:33,560
It's not established disease. The people who have type 1 who've decided to take these drugs,

1265
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:37,800
by the way, this is all off-label, and I'm not at all advocating it. There are clinical trials,

1266
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:43,240
and we're trying to develop appropriate safety and monitoring for this. Listeners shouldn't be

1267
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:46,920
given free license to go on these things. So this is really complicated. But again,

1268
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:53,960
if you're on a really potent glucose lowering agent, which is what these SGLT2 inhibitors are,

1269
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:59,400
and you have type 1 diabetes and your insulin is infusing from your insulin pump into your belly,

1270
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:05,240
and the catheter plugs and it stops infusing insulin, then normally you'd look at your CGM

1271
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:10,200
and you'd see, okay, my glucose is rising. I must have a problem. But if the glucose lowering

1272
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:17,160
agent is essentially dragging all that glucose out into your urine, essentially what it does

1273
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:23,480
is it's dragging away glucose, which is the primary biomarker of life-threatening insulin deficiency.

1274
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:28,040
Elevated blood glucose is the primary biomarker of life-threatening insulin deficiency for people

1275
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:33,800
who live with type 1. So when you look at your glucose and you see that it's normal and you're

1276
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:39,400
on an SGLT2 inhibitor, it creates a situation of what I would call cognitive dissonance,

1277
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:43,080
where people just don't understand that they're in trouble. And there may be a delay

1278
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:49,480
in between when they had the plug in their catheter or some other interruption of insulin

1279
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:54,280
infusion and when they actually end up recognizing it. And so I think that they end up receiving

1280
01:56:54,280 --> 01:57:00,600
medical care way later. It's also possible that they have elevations in ketones from these SGLT2

1281
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:08,280
inhibitors. The beta-hydroxybutyr is a little bit higher in the SGLT2-treated population compared

1282
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:16,360
to the controls. Okay. So that phenomenon of euglycemic DKA might also extend in rare cases

1283
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:21,240
to people with type 1 diabetes who are on nutritional ketosis. And the way I think of it

1284
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:26,440
is some of them may have depleted glycogen because they're not fully fat adapted. And many of them

1285
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:29,880
will have very little carbohydrate in their intestines because they just don't consume that

1286
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:37,960
much carbohydrate. So those people, if they have a plug in their catheter, might not see the same

1287
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:43,400
sharp rise in blood glucose that you normally would and they might have a delay. So this is

1288
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:47,640
all associated with pump use. In other words, we don't see this in people who are not using a pump.

1289
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:52,600
Well, we also see it in people who forget to take their shots. And oddly enough, people with type

1290
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:58,840
1 diabetes do forget shots on occasion, especially the teenage kids that I've cared for. So, God,

1291
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:02,520
there's so many more things I want to talk about. Well, one thing I want to just mention is the

1292
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:07,800
intersection of nutritional ketosis and hypoglycemic awareness. So there are people who are in

1293
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:14,360
hardcore ketosis who have circulated beta-hydroxyburetor 1 or 2 who become completely

1294
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:20,920
immune to low blood glucose. And I had a patient call me up and he goes, Dr. Jake,

1295
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:28,280
guess what my blood sugar is? I said, what? He goes, 25. I said, why are you calling me and not

1296
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:35,480
taking carbohydrate? He goes, I feel fine. So he- What was his BHB? Oh, like 2 or 3. So he'd done

1297
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:40,520
the George Cahill experiment where he had- Except Cahill subjects were like 6 millimolar,

1298
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:47,880
7 millimolar. 2 or 3 is relatively low to be thriving at 25 milligrams per deciliter. That's

1299
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:53,720
barely over 1 millimolar. And so he has hypoglycemic awareness. And so to quote Peter Thiel, like,

1300
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:59,640
is this a feature or a bug? If it's a feature, well, he's hypoglycemic unaware, but he's fine.

1301
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:05,080
He's cruising around and he had the gumption to call me up. If it's a bug, well, maybe the delta

1302
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:10,680
in between his blood glucose when he called me up with a blood glucose at 25 and a fatal low

1303
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:16,280
might be relatively small. I have no idea. There are many other things I want to chat about,

1304
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:21,800
but based on some time constraints, I know we need to wrap this up. So maybe we'll have to come back

1305
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:26,280
and do a discussion about two other things I wanted to get into, which is sort of the future of this.

1306
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:31,240
I certainly remember being involved in the care of patients who got pancreatic transplants.

1307
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:36,520
That's obviously a transient solution that often comes accompanied with a kidney transplant.

1308
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:40,280
There are certainly beta cell transplants, which have really not been that successful,

1309
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:44,440
though it's always one of those things where it seems like it's just a year away from being

1310
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:49,720
perfect. There's xenotransplantations of beta cells when you take the beta cells from another

1311
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:54,920
animal or something that's non-human. That has all of its own problems associated with the immune

1312
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:59,400
response. You talked a little bit about stem cells. And then of course we've alluded to

1313
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:05,000
fully implantable or even non-implantable, but fully autonomous pancreases.

1314
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:08,840
So that's a whole other topic that would be great to come back and talk about.

1315
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:13,880
But I'd like to close on one other question, which is if you were to reflect on everything

1316
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:24,120
you've learned in caring for patients with type 2 diabetes, what are the most important

1317
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:28,520
lessons that would extrapolate to the non-diabetic population?

1318
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:33,880
When I look at the cardiovascular outcomes and the weight gain associated with hyperinsulinemia

1319
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:39,640
in type 1, I'm really shocked. And again, I think you have this unique population where you see

1320
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:43,800
the insulin that goes into them and you see its direct impact on weight gain.

1321
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:49,320
So we know that people consume very high carbohydrate diets and gain a bunch of weight

1322
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:54,440
in type 1 diabetes. They're at risk for cardiovascular illness. And to me, that just

1323
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:59,640
says that there's something about the standard American diet that's making us sick. And

1324
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:05,320
ultimately we will be at risk for cardiovascular disease. That's the primary thing that humans

1325
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:10,840
will die from. What do you think it is about hyperinsulinemia that seems to drive this? Because

1326
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:15,720
this is the thing that I've always found fascinating is that... So when you look at

1327
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:19,880
something like... So let's look at the type 2 diabetic cohorts. When you have patients

1328
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:25,160
who are using drugs like metformin, which are lowering glucose to achieve better outcomes,

1329
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:33,000
versus drugs that raise insulin, because the patients with type 2 diabetes still have the

1330
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,520
ability to make insulin, you can, in both of those examples, get the same glucose level,

1331
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:44,440
but in one patient there's a higher insulin level. Those patients have equal microvascular

1332
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:50,360
outcomes, but they have different macrovascular outcomes. That's right. Which is a sort of natural

1333
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:56,200
experiment to suggest that the insulin is playing a bigger role on the macrovascular disease. The

1334
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:02,440
glucose is playing the role in the microvascular disease. Yeah. And in the case of these SGLT

1335
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,880
inhibitors, they're the first drugs that have really shown a profound impact on cardiovascular

1336
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:14,600
outcomes. This is secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease in people who have

1337
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:22,120
already had an event, who also have type 2 diabetes. So, EmpicoFlows is an amazing drug when

1338
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:28,600
reduced the cardiovascular complications by 40%. And the drug essentially drags glucose into the

1339
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:35,160
urine, and it suggests that circulating insulin values themselves might be in some way contributing

1340
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:39,400
to cardiovascular disease. The simple answer is, I don't know, there's a lot, there's a rich debate

1341
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:44,040
in the mechanism. Yeah. I mean, do you think it is due to endothelial injury? Some people claim

1342
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:49,400
it's all about the kidney and fluid and the amount of salt retention and something else.

1343
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:56,200
But to me, as a basic scientist who grew up idolizing Dr. Cynthia Kenyon and the amazing

1344
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:03,000
work that she did in C. elegans from the Daft-Dauer complex, those papers suggest that when you make

1345
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,920
a modest alteration in insulin signaling, the worm lives twice as long. And that fundamental

1346
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:15,000
observation has now been borne out in organism after model organism. But she did that, I mean,

1347
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:19,880
it's tough to, I mean, I'm so familiar with Cynthia's work, so I don't want to bore people

1348
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:26,200
with all of my nuanced thinking on this, but it's hard to make that exact comparison to us,

1349
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:31,880
right? Because that was a modulation of Daft-2 and Daft-16. So, they were, she was upping

1350
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:39,000
Foxo effectively and downing IGF and to get the real step function change in longevity,

1351
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,400
she had to calorie restrict the worms as well. So, there are so many moving pieces in those

1352
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:50,520
models that I guess, well, if you don't know the answer, that means we've still got some thinking

1353
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:55,000
to do on this. But I want to go back to your patient, the one you told me about who's super

1354
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,920
healthy, who's on six units of insulin. Yeah. I think that those people may be telling us something.

1355
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:06,760
He's thin, he's active, he's on very little insulin, and he's quite vigorous. And I just

1356
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:12,920
wonder whether carrying out these tricks to try to reduce your circulating insulin could be

1357
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:20,120
incredibly beneficial. Well, part of the reason I love the CGM is it's the best proxy I have for

1358
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:24,680
what I don't have, which is an area under the curve of insulin. I'd love to, people ask me

1359
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:28,200
sometimes if you could wave a magic wand and have something that doesn't exist, what would it be? And

1360
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:33,960
my first answer is a metabolic signature for autophagy. My second answer would be every

1361
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:38,680
night I'd like to go to bed and have a little readout that says, this is the total amount

1362
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:44,200
of insulin your pancreas made in the last 24 hours. Can you imagine adding that to the list

1363
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:50,680
of my aura ring, the CGM, all the other things I think are really, really driving benefit in terms

1364
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:55,000
of health, but to be able to actually know the AUC, the area under the curve of insulin produced

1365
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:00,760
every day would be remarkable. And amazingly, someone with type 1 diabetes gets that for free.

1366
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:05,720
They just have to look at the syringe and know what they injected. So if there's one thing

1367
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:09,960
that that patient with type 1 diabetes has over the rest of us that don't, it's that they can

1368
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:15,800
know at the end of the day exactly what their AUC of insulin is. Well, we can only estimate it

1369
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:20,680
tangentially by looking at the things we look at, which are, you know, meaning someone like me can

1370
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:25,320
look at average glucose and standard deviation of glucose and just try to minimize those as an

1371
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:31,400
indirect proxy for that AUC of insulin. These people are really amazing and the most successful

1372
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:37,000
are so dialed into their physiology. They're doing quantified self before it was even a term.

1373
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:44,840
Yeah, exactly. Well, on that note, Jake, I know you're super busy here in San Diego today. And so

1374
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:49,240
I really appreciate you making the time to come over here and share a little bit of your wisdom

1375
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:52,520
and your insights. We'll have to do this again at some point, because as I said, there's so many of

1376
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,640
the things that I want to talk about and I'm sure there are other people listening to this who do as

1377
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:00,360
well. So with that said, until next time. And thank you. It's an honor. I really love your show.
