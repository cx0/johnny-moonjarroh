Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,380
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,520
today's episode. Welcome to a special episode of The Drive. Now that we've released over 200

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,040
episodes, we realized we've covered a lot of stuff across various topics and in a lot of detail

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,520
that I think frankly for people can be very difficult if you're not someone who started

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,160
listening four years ago. I think even if you were listening from the very beginning,

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,840
it can be really hard at times to kind of piece together all of the information. So,

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,120
we thought about trying an experiment for today's episode. We've decided to pull a variety of clips

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,880
from previous podcasts, but around a given theme. In this episode, we're going to focus

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,520
on clips that discuss exercise and my framework for it. So, we put these clips in order of what

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,360
we think is the best way to listen from top to bottom. So, think of this as kind of a mashup

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,360
of a whole bunch of things on exercise, but they're organized in a way that I think should

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,800
make frankly a lot of sense and hopefully provide even more value than if you were to listen to

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,240
each of these podcasts in their completeness. So, the hope here of course is that this is going

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,480
to allow you to understand this topic better, but also to identify some previous episodes if you

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,240
now want to go back and dive really deep into those. First set of clips we're going to look at

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,120
is what I'm optimizing for with my exercise and why I think training for the centenarian Olympics

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,720
or centenarian decathlon as I more commonly refer to it these days is so important. The last thing

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,720
to note here is that some of these clips are actually from AMAs. So, if you're not a subscriber,

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
hopefully this gives you a sense of what lives behind that paywall and why we think there's a

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,520
lot of value there. Additionally, for the stability and DNS content clips in our episode

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,600
with Beth Lewis and Michael Rintala, we actually filmed a lot of instructional videos of them

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,120
showing us how to do these exercises. I recommend you spend the time to go and look at those videos

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,920
because I think seeing here is probably better than just hearing. So, this is the first time

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,520
we're doing this, so we'd love your feedback. So, tell us what you think about this and tell

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,040
us if this is the kind of thing you'd like to see more of and tell us if you think it sucks

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,960
because it's a lot of work to do this and if you think it sucks, I'd be happy to not do this anymore.

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,880
So, without further delay, I hope you enjoy this special episode of The Drive.

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:06,160
Everything we're talking about Bob right now is based on longevity and that's very different

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,920
than if you were asking this question through the lens of performance. Does that point kind

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,320
of make sense or should I expand on that a bit? Yeah, I think you should expand a little bit.

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,680
Maybe on the performance, health and longevity, particularly performance and longevity and the

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,160
possible trade-off between the two. If someone said to me, Peter, my goal is to break two hours

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,480
and 40 minutes on the Chicago Marathon next year, I would be talking about this in a totally

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,840
different manner. That is a very difficult performance goal and that requires training

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,240
at an energy system that I'm not even really going to talk about in the context of longevity.

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,160
If someone says, I want to break 10 hours on the Ironman, if someone says, I want a deadlift

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,080
three and a half times my body weight. If you start to really look into the far recesses of

45
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,960
amazing physical performance, everything I'm saying needs to be modified and I'm not going

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,760
to talk about what those things look like. What I will say is they are generally not

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,160
collinear with longevity and at times they can be outright orthogonal. I realize as that's coming

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,840
out of my mouth, it sounds pretty freaking stupid if you're not a math person. Let me explain what

49
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,760
that means in English. Something is collinear when it's directly in line with. Something is

50
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:33,880
orthogonal when it is completely at odds with or at 90 degrees to. Trying to run the fastest 10K

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:43,360
is training at an energy system that is very demanding of the cardiovascular system. It is

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:52,000
pretty much maximum cardiac output just beneath VO2 max above functional threshold. It puts an

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,280
amazing strain on the body and frankly while doing that is better than sitting on a couch all day,

54
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:08,000
that is generally past the point of optimizing longevity returns and it actually comes at some

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,840
longevity cost relative to something more at a slightly lower energy system. Everything I'm

56
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,240
talking about is geared towards this centenarian Olympics, which we've talked about in the past,

57
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:31,760
this idea of being the most kick-ass 90 year old possible. That's really based on two energy

58
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,720
systems. It's got the stability and the strength piece we talked about and then it's got this low

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,040
end aerobic energy system, which is zone two that we'll talk about in a second. Then I think it's

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,440
punctuated with brief bursts of generally zone five. The reason I think those two matter is

61
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,400
that's generally where life takes place. Life is zone one, zone two, and zone five. By training

62
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,280
zone two and zone five, obviously much more in zone two than zone five, we're really teeing

63
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:12,080
ourselves up metabolically and also structurally to do these things. Based on what you know today,

64
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,080
what do you wish you would have implemented when it comes to physical conditioning slash

65
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,360
training when you were at the age of 25? To make the question more general, what do you believe is

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,680
typically overlooked in this realm among very active 25 year olds who wish to be in the race

67
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,360
for the gold medals in the centenarian Olympics? Mm-hmm. Well, that's a question from my heart.

68
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,080
Have I spoken publicly about the centenarian decathlon in the centenarian Olympics? I didn't

69
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,160
realize I had, but obviously I have given this question. I think there's a number of questions

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
that talk about the centenarian Olympics. Unless there's a centenarian Olympics, I don't. I honestly

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,200
don't remember talking about this, but I did. Let me restate what I'm talking about and that will

72
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,920
put this question in context. About, I don't know, nine months ago, maybe a year ago, I just sort of

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,320
had this epiphany, which was that the system's going to fail first in body for most people,

74
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,000
which isn't to say always, right? So some people just die suddenly. Their mind and their body are

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,240
fine, but they get struck with a disease and they die. For another subset of people, unfortunately,

76
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,160
not that small, their mind is taken from them first. So cognition gets robbed of them and then

77
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,680
eventually either they die or their body also breaks down and away they go. But as I really

78
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:38,640
reflected on what's going on, I think that for most people, the decline of mind, body, and then

79
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,440
the burden of disease seems to be one by one in the wrong way, meaning body seems to fail first.

80
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,440
So it got me thinking that at least for me, how would I mitigate that? So I came up with this

81
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,200
idea of backcasting instead of forecasting what I want to do in the end. And I borrow that term

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,080
backcasting from Annie Duke who wrote Thinking in Bets, a book that I love. And Annie will also be

83
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,720
a guest on the podcast soon, I hope. So the idea of backcasting is instead of trying to say, well,

84
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,400
if I'm 25, what do I need to be doing tomorrow when I'm 26? And then what do I need to be doing

85
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,120
when I'm 30? And what am I doing before I? An easier way to do it is say, what do I need to be

86
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,760
doing when I'm a hundred? And then how do I work backwards from that? And so for me as a ripe old

87
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,400
46 year old, 45 year old, when I started thinking about this, the question was, okay, well, if I

88
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,480
want to live to a hundred and again, genetically speaking, I probably won't because I don't have

89
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,360
the genes to get there. But let's assume that I can eke my way out to a hundred. That's 55 years

90
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,640
away. What do I have to physically be able to do to be satisfied with my life? So as I went

91
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,760
through that exercise, the way I did it was doing it through the lens of my kids. So I took the ages

92
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,440
of my kids and I projected them forward to how old will they be when I'm a hundred? And that's an

93
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,680
easy calculation to do. Obviously anybody can do that for themselves. And then I said, well,

94
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,680
probabilistically how old will their kids be? So I said, well, you know, my kids are this,

95
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
this, this, their kids will be approximately this range. And then you realize, wow, their kids are

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,080
going to have kids by the time I'm a hundred. So by the time I'm a hundred, I'm going to have great

97
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:25,800
grandchildren that will likely be between like one and seven or eight. That's basically my calculation.

98
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,760
Okay. So then I thought, okay, well, what are the things I'm going to want to be able to do when I'm

99
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,040
a hundred to just be happy? So it goes without saying, I would love to not be, you know, bedridden

100
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,920
with disease per se. It also goes without saying that I would love to have the cognitive faculties

101
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,640
that I have, or at least a high enough amount of them that I'm able to sort of have the executive

102
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,600
function processing speed and you know, memory that's necessary to sort of function. But then

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
I really kind of double clicked on the physical part of this. So there are a bunch of activities

104
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,080
that I want to be able to do. I still want to be able to shoot a bow and arrow. I still want to be

105
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,360
able to actually exercise. Like I do enjoy, you know, some people exercise because they have to,

106
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I think there are a number of us who exercise because we actually enjoy it and it's fortuitous

107
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,480
that it provides benefit. But the one I really focused on was the real simple stuff, the activities

108
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,080
of daily living and among them is like playing with kids, right? So I started thinking about, well,

109
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,880
what would I want to be able to do with great grandkids when I'm a hundred and they're three,

110
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:29,400
four, five? And in going through that, I made a list and there were 18 things on my list and I just

111
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,880
began to refer to that as my centenarian decathlon, which is problematic because the decathlon has 10

112
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
things and my list has 18 things, but not with sending that tiny little detail. What's the Latin

113
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,480
origin of 18? I assume deca is Latin for 10 of something, right? Anyway, well, whatever. Okay,

114
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,560
so we'll come up with a fancier term for it or I'll figure out a way to consolidate. Nick, let us know.

115
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,680
So my centenarian decathlon has these 18 things that I want to be able to do when I'm a hundred

116
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,640
and some of them seem so trivial that you'd be like, how is that even on your list? Like for

117
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,920
example, I want to be able to get up off the floor with a single point of support, which means I want

118
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,520
to be able to using just one arm, get up off the floor. Now it's not that it's the end of the world

119
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:16,120
if I need to use two arms, but like I want to hold myself to that standard. I want to be able to drop

120
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,080
into a squat position and pick up a child that weighs 30 pounds. I want to be able to lift

121
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,000
something that weighs 30 pounds over my head because that's about the weight of my little roller

122
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,480
board suitcase and I would really be bummed if I couldn't put that in the overhead compartment of

123
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,760
an airplane. Presumably I'll still be flying on airplanes and those will still exist.

124
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,640
You'll be flying yourself probably. Yeah, right. We'll all have little jet packs or something.

125
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,920
I want to be able to get myself out of a pool without a ladder. Simple, right? Again, how

126
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,400
trivial is that to do today where you have four inches between the concrete and the water and how

127
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
easy is it for us to just pull ourselves out today without the ladder? You're seeing the guys that

128
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,600
can jump without support. They can jump out of a pool. Just jump out of a pool onto the platform.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,640
No. Yeah, I think there's some videos for that. Nice. Yeah. So when I go through that whole thing,

130
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:18,400
I then say, okay, what are physical tasks that would approximate those things? So for example,

131
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,760
like picking up the 30 pound kid who comes running at you could be approximated by a 30 pound goblet

132
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,760
squat. Lifting 30 pounds above your head in the form of a suitcase is also pretty easy to

133
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,000
approximate with these things. Goblet squat just for the uninitiated. I usually think of it as like

134
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,720
a kettlebell, but almost like you're holding a goblet in front of you. It's like a front squat.

135
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,120
That's right. If you're going down, coming up. That's right. Imagine picking up a child.

136
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Then I've just been working backwards from there, which saying, well, if I want to be able to do

137
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
these things at a hundred, there's going to be a decline. I have to be able to do these things at

138
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,160
80. I'm going to need to be able to do it at this level at 60. And I need to be able to do it at this

139
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,360
level today. Again, given the inevitable decline. So most of my training today, in fact, I would

140
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:12,760
argue all of my training today centers around that. I no longer train for anything that's not

141
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,800
related to that. So I don't do any training that's related to racing or competing in anything,

142
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,920
which is not to say it's bad to do those things. I'm just saying that that's the point I'm at in

143
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,000
my life. So this is kind of a long winded answer to what I think is a great question, which is a

144
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,120
25 year old who's frankly thinking of something that I most 25 year olds I can't imagine would

145
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,560
be thinking of. Certainly I wasn't thinking of this at 25. I mean at 25 you're sort of immortal,

146
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,600
but whoever asked this question is presumably realizing that, Hey, in 75 years, the world's

147
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,160
going to look different and I want to be able to do X, Y, and Z. So I don't know the answer because

148
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,520
I don't know what that person's limitations are today. So rather I would just say, what is the

149
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,880
framework? And my framework for thinking about this is four components of exercise. One is stability

150
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,480
the second is strength. The third is aerobic performance. The fourth is anaerobic output.

151
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,800
And I didn't go through all of my 18, but each of my 18 touch at least one of those and many touch

152
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,440
more than one. For example, the goblet squat requires both strength and stability. Walking up,

153
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,400
one of mine is being able to walk up three flights of stairs with 10 pounds of groceries in each hand.

154
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,320
Okay. You and I could do that today blindfolded and backwards. That starts to become harder when

155
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,880
you get older. Well, that's got a little bit of aerobic. That's on the threshold of aerobic and

156
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,320
aerobic and it's also got strength. So what I would be looking to do is say, how well am I doing on

157
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,240
each of those things? Now that said, in my experience, the one where most people start to

158
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,040
fail first is stability. Because as a species, we usually begin to fail that once we enter school.

159
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,400
And I think I've talked about this before and I've certainly posted pictures of like my youngest son

160
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,000
squatting. It's just incredible. Like the way that they can do this is so beautiful. You don't

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,520
have to be a kinesiologist to look at them and go, wow, they're so natural when it comes to these

162
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,560
movements, everything they do. And the field of dynamic neuromuscular stabilization is in fact

163
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
built on this principle, which is, you know, there are about 13 or 14 movements that are

164
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,760
completely innate to us. And by the time we're a year and a half older, so we do them all perfectly.

165
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,120
And then it's basically all downhill from there accelerated significantly by school. Once you start

166
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,600
sitting, that's when we lose so much of that stability and we lose the ability to maintain

167
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,440
tension through our pelvic floor and throughout the entire, I hate the term core, but core,

168
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,360
of course, describing the diaphragm, the obliques, the transversalis fascia and the entire pelvic

169
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:53,160
floor. So my two cents would be spend as much time as possible working on dynamic stability,

170
00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:00,640
static stability, static first, then dynamic. And as long as you incorporate those principles

171
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:08,080
into what you were doing strength wise, that's great because at the age of 25, you can do a lot

172
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,800
of dumb things and get away with it incorrectly. I think I've always squatted and deadlifted

173
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,760
somewhat incorrectly. I don't think I've ever fully engaged. In fact, I know I've never fully

174
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,960
engaged my pelvic floor doing those. And I think I got away with murder for a long time, though I

175
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,600
now realize the damage that's occurred as a result of it. Do you want to talk about your,

176
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,680
I think it was your squat routine. I think you mentioned this to me one time way back when.

177
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,040
Oh, my high school. Yeah. Yeah. The breathing squats. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing routine. I don't

178
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,200
recommend this, but again, it was once a week. So we lifted six days a week in high school,

179
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:50,080
three hours a day. I mean, we just lived in the gym. And on Fridays, we would do this routine of

180
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:57,720
breathing squats, which was you took your best 10 rep weight. So a weight that you were going to

181
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,480
absolutely fail at 10 reps with, you loaded it on your back and you do a rep and that the,

182
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,280
so you go down and up at your normal cadence at the top, you took three of the deepest breaths

183
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,920
you could take each breath taking 10 seconds. So that takes 30 seconds. So it's a five in,

184
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:27,520
five out, three of those, and then do another rep and you do 20 reps. So the set takes 10 minutes.

185
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,440
And by the end, it's the only thing I've ever done since that rivals that degree of discomfort

186
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,160
is like an air bike Tabata. And this was like one of these knucklehead things we got out of like our

187
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,360
bodybuilding magazines for power lifting magazines. And the idea was like nothing will stimulate more

188
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,640
strength and growth than that activity. And the reality of it is it worked. I mean, in the course

189
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,640
of one year of doing that, I added over 100 pounds to my squat. And that was starting at a level where

190
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,800
I was already pretty strong and just, but you know, it's so funny about it. It's like, it was so

191
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,720
painful that on Thursdays I'd start getting uptight. Like knowing that we were going to do this the

192
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,600
next day, it was just, you just dreaded this pain so much. Yeah, we might get into this too. There's

193
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,520
it's called super slow or slow training. Doug McGuff is one of the guys at Body by Science,

194
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,720
is one of the proponents. And he talks about lifting slow and basically accumulating time

195
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,040
under tension of maybe 90 seconds, which I don't think people realize is like an eternity. And

196
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,200
you're talking about what you're talking about, that if you actually calculate when you lift,

197
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,800
if you're bench pressing or squatting or something like that, if you ever timed yourself and realize

198
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,640
when you're working out like that and you're lifting weights, how actually little the time

199
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,600
is that is spent under tension. And then you compare it to that, which is pretty stark.

200
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,840
In that 10 minutes, I'm not under the same tension the whole time. When you're standing,

201
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,880
you're under much less tension. I mean, in many ways, my recollection of that was your upper body

202
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,640
hurt as much as your lower body. Again, fortunately it's been so long since I've done it. But honestly,

203
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,800
I think that your traps, your lats, because when you're squatting, you're really trying to

204
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,480
wrap the bar around your neck. You have to engage your lats to squat. So the fatigue here,

205
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,760
the fatigue there, I mean, the whole thing's a mess. But your legs are getting a bit of a break

206
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,280
during that period of time because you're locked out. So yeah, I mean, 90 seconds of totally being

207
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,800
under tension is an eternity if the weight is heavy enough, which is the principle behind that whole

208
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,640
lift.

209
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah. And on the note of a centenarian decathlon.

210
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,520
We should call it the Olympics since there's 18 events. Yeah.

211
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,320
Yeah. I was thinking about it. And I think one thing too is that if you're thinking about doing

212
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,080
a goblet squat, it's almost like a checklist of things that you want to be able to achieve. So

213
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,560
it's not necessarily like going to the CrossFit Games and you're going to see how many goblet

214
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,800
squats you can do for time compared to other centenarians. You're basically checking something

215
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,600
off that you would hope to do. And one thing that I think once this is refined down to maybe less

216
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,080
than 18 or maybe it's 18 events is maybe put it in front of there's a lot of ongoing centenarian

217
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,320
studies. There's the New York, the Einstein one, which is the Ashkenazi Jews, long lived

218
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,680
centenarian study. I got that wrong. But there's the Thomas Pearls where I think they actually have

219
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,480
in aggregate Italian centenarians, the Okinawans and things like that. And I wonder how many of

220
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,080
those centenarians, you give the list to near Barcelona or Tom Pearls. My guess is none of them

221
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,480
could do it. None of them. Yeah. And here's the reason. This is why I think this is different.

222
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,320
Anyone who's a centenarian today, I'm willing to make an extreme statement, which I know is a dumb

223
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,120
thing to do. Anybody who's a centenarian today is a centenarian because of their exceptional genes.

224
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,560
They haven't hacked their way there. What we're talking about, people our age is we're talking

225
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,680
about hacking our way into being centenarians. So that is going to be very deliberate. Now,

226
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,600
again, I'm not taking away from the odd centenarian who's also lived like a monk,

227
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,040
but we know this really well because we've done all this research on it for the book. Most

228
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,000
centenarians, I mean, they haven't done anything necessarily better than or worse than their peers.

229
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,600
In fact, on average, they tend to smoke more, exercise less, and eat worse. So what we're

230
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,840
really talking about is a completely new model, which is actually forcing your way to become a

231
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,840
centenarian rather than just sort of gliding your way into it. And therefore, I think it's going to

232
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,120
require much more deliberate attention around what your mind and body are doing at that point.

233
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Now that we've set the stage for what we're optimizing for with our exercise,

234
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,960
these next two clips are going to focus on strength. One of the pillars in my framework

235
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,560
for exercise. The first clip is from a recent AMA on the importance of preserving strength

236
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,680
and muscle mass as we age. And the second is from an older episode where I speak about the

237
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,000
importance of deadlifts and why I think they're so beneficial to our longevity,

238
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
if we're able to do them safely.

239
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Let's kind of just put some numbers to this. So what does it mean? How much lean mass and

240
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,960
strength are people losing by time? Because I think this is another thing I try to communicate

241
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,840
to patients a lot, which is it goes back to that idea of what I said about the gravity of aging.

242
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,080
What is aging kind of robbing you of as time goes on? And you have got to fight like hell to avoid

243
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:47,040
it. But basically you look at multiple studies, they're going to say the lowest rate of decline

244
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,880
that I could see is 1% per year. Another study, and we can post these studies in the show notes,

245
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:04,640
1.3% per year. Others are sort of putting it 1% to 2% per year after 50, 35 to 40% between age 20

246
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:12,120
and 80. And the strength losses might even be greater. We're talking about two to three,

247
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:21,200
some studies even showing 4% strength loss per year. It's very difficult to put that in context

248
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,280
when you understand what compounding does. It gives you a sense of what it means to sort of be

249
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:39,400
average when you're 50. If you have the aspiration of kind of kicking ass when you're 85, you can't

250
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,200
afford to be average when you're 50. And that's just the bottom line. There's no other way to

251
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,640
describe that either through cardio, respiratory fitness, strength, or probably even muscle mass

252
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,520
to some extent given its association with strength. So I know it sounds like we're kind of harping

253
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,640
on this point, right? That you've got to be strong. You've got to have muscle mass to accompany

254
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,000
that strength probably because at some point when you lose enough of it, you lose the strength

255
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,200
and you've got to have the cardio respiratory fitness. So there was another study that we

256
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,160
looked at, Bob, that had the, I think it went out 10 years on the Kaplan-Meier curves, didn't it?

257
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,280
Yes. Let me see if I can pull that up. Okay. Yeah, this is the one. I thought this was a

258
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,080
very interesting study. So you'll have to refresh my memory, but I'm pretty sure this is the one

259
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:33,160
where they looked at men and women, leg strength versus grip strength. They measured these in

260
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,720
Newton meters doing, I think, a leg extension and a grip exercise, correct? Correct. The leg

261
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,000
strength they did in Newton meters, which I know those are the units that you like to use in your

262
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,040
workouts. And then the grip strength is in kilograms. Okay. So men here average age about

263
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:59,800
54 women about the same, I think 53. So you evaluate people in their sixth decade of life,

264
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,480
and then they were followed prospectively for five to six years. Now, remember, this is all

265
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,240
cause mortality. So looking at the men's strength, leg strength specifically, it's definitely not

266
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,040
subtle, right? So obviously with time, every Kaplan-Meier curve moves down as you go to the

267
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:28,200
right, but the weaker you are, the quicker it goes down. What this analysis showed for the men,

268
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:38,280
if you look at quad strength, basically for every point two unit reduction in quad strength,

269
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,520
and they normalize this for muscle size, it's important to point that out here, I think,

270
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,320
is that they took their strength metric and they normalized it by muscle size. And they did it in

271
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,040
two ways, which I think made this study a little more complicated than I would like, because you

272
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,120
get the same answer both ways, I think, but I guess it speaks to the rigor of it. They used

273
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,280
actually CT cross-sectional area and then they use DEXA. But when you take that normalized unit of

274
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,960
strength per CT area and you reduce that by 0.2 units, which can seem somewhat, I think for the

275
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,120
listener, that's not the important point or DEXA reduced by 0.34 units, you're seeing this increase

276
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,200
in mortality, a 26% or a 39% increase in mortality. And with reduction in grip strength,

277
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,240
which was normalized by DEXA arm measurement, it's a 23%. All of these were statistically

278
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,160
significant. Now for women, it's worth noting that they were statistically significant,

279
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,800
but they had a basically a higher confidence interval or a larger confidence interval,

280
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,160
meaning they came close to crossing unity. In fact, Bob, I think it's probably worth

281
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,160
including table four in the show notes because frankly, I find the table to be an easier way

282
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,840
to appreciate the statistical relevance of this. So I think the figure is great because the figure

283
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,000
shows you the magnitude of the gaps between it, but nobody can look at these figures and tell

284
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,720
what's statistically significant and what is not. But again, I think the point of this is

285
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,640
using a pretty rigorous way to quantify strength, normalizing strength by size of muscle

286
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,800
and prospectively following people, we again see this trend. And I think that this

287
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,520
goes hand in hand with the previous analysis, which showed us that strength is the more

288
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,240
important parameter, which again, I don't think we're going to be able to say that enough today.

289
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:45,440
The importance of deadlifts as an adult, how has your thinking changed on this? I like your history

290
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,760
on this one. So maybe even take it back to in school when you were doing powerlifting

291
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,800
before it might've been in vogue. Yeah, yeah. Long before it was in vogue, one of my best

292
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,560
friends in high school who was also involved in boxing and martial arts, we would go to

293
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,800
the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto every day and lift weights. And it was,

294
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,880
it's still one of the fondest memories I have of what a gym could be like. It would certainly be

295
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,760
the, it was certainly not the sunny, warm golds in Venice, but it had some of those features,

296
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,920
which was old school, lots of iron, nothing fancy. Of course, unlike a nice gym, this was like two

297
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,760
stories below ground, so there were no windows, poorly ventilated. So in the summer, it was

298
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,200
staggeringly hot. In the winter, it was so cold, you felt like you were getting frostbitten by

299
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,440
touching the iron. And aside from me and my friend, there were no kids there. We were 14,

300
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,360
15, 16 years old, and it was this group of men who to this day I think back and like can't believe

301
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,480
how strong they were. And most of them competed in powerlifting. And so that sort of got us

302
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,960
interested in powerlifting. And that's how we sort of started putzing around with it. And as

303
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,800
most people know who are listening, or I guess people who might know who are listening,

304
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,000
powerlifting is different from Olympic lifting. Powerlifting is three lifts, the deadlift,

305
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,440
the squat, and the bench press. And so yeah, make it long, short, grew up doing a lot of deadlifting,

306
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
a lot of squatting, a lot of bench pressing. It was always very horrible at bench press,

307
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,000
much better at squatting and deadlifting. Fast forward to, I don't know, a few years ago,

308
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,680
maybe three years ago, I had an injury where I kind of tore or partially tore one of my obliques.

309
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't even remember how I did it. I remember it was very stupid, whatever I did.

310
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,400
And everything- Tearing a phone book.

311
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
That would be great. Possible.

312
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,080
But everything went kind of sideways after that. And I really was never able to fully

313
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:03,360
deadlift again without some discomfort. And so again, this is now take it back to maybe 2016,

314
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:12,320
I sort of decided, you know what, maybe the deadlift has reached its point of futility and maybe

315
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,320
I've extracted all I'm going to out of that. And there's no denying what a wonderful movement it

316
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,600
is in terms of being a total hip hinge compound movement. But I was like, look, I could probably

317
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,400
get most of the benefits of a deadlift doing things that place me under less load. And also,

318
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,720
again, in the spirit of thinking about longevity, I thought, why does one need to subject themselves

319
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,400
to twice their body weight or more in an axial load? So I sort of got away from it. And then I

320
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,400
think all that kind of changed when I started DNS, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization, which I

321
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,920
started about 18 months ago. And we're going to have a podcast on this topic because it's just,

322
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,720
there's so much I want to talk about here. And so actually, I think today we got an email about

323
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,960
how we're trying to make some time for this podcast. So we'll definitely, if you're listening

324
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,040
to this and you don't know what DNS is dynamic neuromuscular stabilization, by all means, you

325
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,600
should go read about it, but we're going to have at least one solid podcast on this. But it was

326
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,720
through that process that I realized, actually, the deadlift for me was going to be beneficial,

327
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,960
not because of the metabolic benefits. I was not going to be doing Tabata deadlifts like I used to,

328
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,560
or even by trying to set records for how much I could lift or anything like that, but rather

329
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:35,280
because it becomes a beautiful audit for everything working perfectly. So I deadlifted this morning.

330
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,560
So today's a Monday. I deadlifted on Saturday. I deadlifted a few days before that. I deadlift

331
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,800
at least twice a week, often three times a week, both straight bar and trap bar. And Bob,

332
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,080
I don't go that heavy. I don't know the last time. Maybe I've had 400 pounds on one of those,

333
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:00,880
on the trap bar in the past year, but I usually sort of stop at about 350 to 375. On the straight

334
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:11,680
bar, I'm even lighter, maybe 185. I do a lot of slow eccentrics. I film every single rep of every

335
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:23,280
single set. And I study it and I send it to Beth Lewis, who is my coach. And we do so much around

336
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,920
making this deadlift perfect. And I'd rather take a lightweight and deadlift it perfectly,

337
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,640
several times a week. And I'm not doing killing crusher sets. Today was four sets of 10,

338
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,280
five sets of 10 maybe. And at no point was I past my limit. So again, I can push myself harder

339
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,600
doing other things, but what I could get out of doing that deadlift perfectly is, do I have just

340
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,000
the right amount of thoracic extension? Do I have just the right curvature in the lumbar spine?

341
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,280
Am I activating my glutes? Am I activating my hamstrings? Am I pulling back instead of pulling

342
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:10,640
up? Am I wedging correctly? All of this little stuff translates biomechanically to the activities

343
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,240
of daily living that matter to me, like getting up off the floor, picking up one of my kids,

344
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,880
lifting a piece of luggage or something like that. And so if I can do the deadlift and it feels

345
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,440
right, then I know I'm ready to do everything correctly. And when I'm deadlifting and I feel

346
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
like, Hey, this isn't correct. This doesn't feel right. Well, first of all, now I've really learned

347
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,920
what that feeling is. And secondly, I've now learned the steps that I can go back and reconstruct

348
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,560
what needs to be done. And so one of the things I definitely want to do is actually put together

349
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,840
kind of a video on deadlift and deadlift preparation, because I think that there are

350
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,240
probably 10 exercises that I do as a way to get ready to deadlift. And they don't take long. My

351
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,400
deadlift checklist is like 10 to 15 minutes. So it's not so onerous. It's almost like ketosis,

352
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,560
the way we were talking about it in the past, right? Which is, it's not even clear if it's

353
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,200
the ketones themselves that can sometimes be the benefit versus the metabolic conditions that allow

354
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,560
you to make them, right? In other words, I'm not even sure how much of the benefit is the actual

355
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,720
deadlift versus all of the things you have to do to do the deadlift correctly. And one of the most

356
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,360
exciting things just on this last thing I say on this is it never occurred to me up until a year

357
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,800
and a half ago that you could actually deadlift in a way that puts your spine under traction.

358
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,760
That's very counterintuitive. You would think that anytime you're lifting under an axial load,

359
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,600
your spine is under compression. But it turns out when you learn the right positioning and you

360
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,720
understand how to create intra-abdominal pressure and you know how to elongate your spine,

361
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,000
you can actually deadlift and create traction in the spine actively. And that's why deadlifting is

362
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,560
the most important thing I do before I get on an airplane. Because when you're on an airplane and

363
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,440
you're sitting there for five or six hours, what you really want to do is not let your spine be

364
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,960
compressed. And the deadlift primes me to then go and sort of maintain that activated form of

365
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,680
traction. Yeah, it's a significant investment, but I would say it's worth it that you'll bring

366
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,000
your hex bar to the gate before your flight and pump yourself up and then bang out a few sets.

367
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,920
I mean, I don't know what it is about the TSA guys. They get so wigged out when you have your

368
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,280
hex bar there at the gate. Put that overhead? Yeah. If you're TSA pre, they don't mind as much.

369
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,360
But if you're not TSA pre, they just lose it. Sticklers. They're sticklers.

370
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,360
The next set of clips is from a topic that we've covered on a lot of episodes. And of course,

371
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,680
is a very important pillar in this framework of exercise. This is aerobic training and specifically

372
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,560
looking at low end aerobic efficiency or zone two training. This was most recently covered again

373
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,400
in our second episode with In You Go San Milan. This is a training zone I spend a reasonable

374
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,720
amount of time in, not as much as I used to when I was a cyclist. And I probably spent,

375
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,240
I don't know, 10 to 12 hours a week in this zone. Today I spend three or four hours a week in this

376
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,360
zone, but I still believe this is incredibly important and I want to make sure that you

377
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:30,800
understand this. All I'm doing is swimming. I'm not doing workouts. I'm not looking at the pace

378
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,360
clock. I'm not doing intervals. I literally just get in the water with no agenda other than to

379
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,240
get wet and hear the sound of water going by my ears. Probably I'm not even swimming hard

380
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,320
enough to get into zone two truthfully. I doubt my heart rates above 120.

381
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,400
That's the next topic. That's where I think this is a good segue. I think this is that.

382
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Very well.

383
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,200
If you think about it, you can talk about it, but I think that's one of the things is a governor

384
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,480
putting a rate limiter on your performance when you do zone two. That it's almost like,

385
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,680
for a lot of people it is, for me, doing this reminds me of stillness. Although I might read

386
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,840
on the bike or things like that, but can you talk about zone two importance and how you're

387
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,200
thinking has changed on that?

388
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,960
Yeah. When I stopped riding a bike with a purpose, which was for me a time trial,

389
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:25,920
so that would have been late 2014, early 2015, I really just stopped doing any low intensity

390
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,040
aerobic training. Anyone who does ride a bike or swims a lot has plenty of that activity in them.

391
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,160
Even if you're training for the 200 meter individual medley, which is a race that's

392
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,320
very short, very quick and very painful, you still put in hours and hours a week of aerobic

393
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,960
based training. Similarly, if you're training for a one hour all out time trial, you still put in

394
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,440
hours a week of low end aerobic based training. When I stopped doing that, I was like, well,

395
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:05,600
I don't need to do this anymore. I went from cycling to rowing and running. I was obsessed

396
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:12,400
with just being as efficient as possible. Everything was all out. If I was running,

397
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,640
it was going to be a six minute mile. It wasn't going to be a nine minute mile. I think,

398
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:24,560
especially through the interactions that I had with Inigo, who I met about a year before I had

399
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,920
him on the podcast, which was just recently, it was meeting him and going back through the

400
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,320
literature on that type of training and the benefits that it could have, both from the

401
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,000
standpoint of metabolic benefits such as glucose, insulin dependent and insulin dependent glucose,

402
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,880
mediated disposal, looking at just mitochondrial function, mitochondrial health density,

403
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,000
and then looking at the neuro-tropic factors, the BDNF secretion that can come from this type

404
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,200
of activity. All of these things were just pointing towards, this was a glaring hole in my training

405
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,320
that I needed to get back. That has been great. Like you said, one of the things about zone two

406
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:16,400
that I really enjoy is it's just not that hard. Frankly, sometimes it's just nice to get on the

407
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,200
bike and I probably spend three or four hours a week doing it. That is my time to listen to

408
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,960
podcasts and audio books. I really enjoy it. I can't wait to get on that bike. As boring as it

409
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,240
seems to be sitting on a stationary bike for that long, there's never been a day when I've been like,

410
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,400
I don't feel like doing this. I always look forward to it. I think in large part it's because

411
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,440
I also get to combine it with learning, which you wouldn't be doing if you're out there crushing

412
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,040
intervals. Not that there's something wrong with that. I think each of these things has this time

413
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,040
and a place, but I think that we can do zone two our entire lives. We can do it safely and it just

414
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:03,600
yields enormous dividends. Your question, if I recall, was if you want to do your zone two training

415
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,320
at home, what's the best type of device to do it on? I don't think there's a best device, but I

416
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:17,120
would say it's one where it's very easy to reproducibly produce the same output. I am hugely

417
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:24,240
fond of a bicycle because it has a very clear metric that I can adjust, which is the wattage.

418
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,560
Watts are super easy to track. I'm riding on a bike that is an ergometer. I put my road bike

419
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,920
on a device called a Wahoo KICKR and it is hooked up to a computer where I'm telling it the numbers

420
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,560
of watts that I want. It's putting that resistance into me and I generate it. Now, my wife conversely

421
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,680
likes to ride a peloton. I don't know why. I think it's the worst bike on the face of the earth,

422
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,040
but on the peloton it works a little bit different, which is she goes into a mode where she's not

423
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:06,560
doing a class, but she basically sets the resistance with a little knob and then the amount

424
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,400
of RPMs that she can put to it spits out a wattage. It's actually, in my mind, a little harder because

425
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,560
she has to be titrating her cadence to stay the same so that she can hit a wattage number.

426
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,680
It's the difference between being an erg mode and spin mode, but the point is regardless of how you

427
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,120
do it on a bike, wattage becomes the metric that matters. We, of course, are always measuring

428
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,200
heart rate as well and we'll talk about this in a second in terms of how you tweak it.

429
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,320
Treadmills are also a great way to do this. In my experience, unless you are a really good runner,

430
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:49,200
which is to say you're very efficient at running, for most people, running gets them out of zone two

431
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,720
a little too quickly. For treadmill with our patients, we prefer brisk incline walking.

432
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:05,120
Most treadmills will go up to 15 degrees and we generally start people between 10 and 15 degrees,

433
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,720
somewhere between two and a half and three miles per hour, maybe less. Again, it's very empirical.

434
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,840
It's sort of how quickly can you figure out where somebody is. By those two metrics, I have a very

435
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,600
clear sense of my zone two. I know exactly how many watts my zone two is. I also know what heart

436
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,960
rate I should expect to see and if I'm vastly outside of that, there's usually a physiologic

437
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,000
reason and I have to make an adjustment on the wattage. So if my heart rate is significantly

438
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,560
higher than that, it might mean I'm a little bit sick, dehydrated, something else is going on and

439
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,560
I might have to back off to get the heart rate down, even if it means bringing the wattage a little

440
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,120
bit below. I'm checking my lactate every single time I do this and I do it four times a week,

441
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,080
we'll discuss frequency. Same thing on treadmill. I know on a treadmill exactly what incline,

442
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,560
exactly what speed and what heart rate and it's a comparable heart rate too on the bike. That's

443
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,760
an easy way to sort of make that happen. The other thing my wife loves is a rowing machine.

444
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,720
Now, I'm not fond of the rowing machine for zone two. I like the rowing machine for zone five,

445
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,960
but that's because I'm not a very good rower. So again, my wife's a better rower than me

446
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,280
and she has better form than me. Someone like Beth Lewis, we've had on the podcast who's an

447
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,560
amazing rower, she's more efficient. She can get his own two workout on the rowing machine.

448
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,120
I love rowing, but it's just cycling for me is second nature.

449
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,880
Cycling is a very efficient thing for me to do. I'm not hugely fond of ellipticals personally,

450
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,040
but again, if you have one that works for you where you're able to get your heart rate high

451
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:48,960
enough and you're able to move quick enough, then great. The key is how much energy do you have to

452
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,280
put into maintaining a sustained dose? And that's the biggest challenge Bob with zone two is you

453
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,360
don't want it to be vacillating. And that's why ultimately I love being on an erg mode of a bike,

454
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,320
which is I don't actually have to think about it. It's putting 200 Watts to my wheel, no matter what

455
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,680
I do. Even if I slow down or speed up, it's just always keeping the Watts the same. Frankly,

456
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,520
I can just tune out and listen to podcasts and audio books, which is what zone two is for.

457
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,720
The next set of clips look at another pillar in my framework of exercise, which is now that upper

458
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,280
end aerobic verging on anaerobic exercise. So we sometimes talk about this as zone five,

459
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,840
but again, I would be less concerned with the terminology. The zones really are a function of

460
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,240
the underlying system that you're referring to, whether you're talking about a heart rate based

461
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,840
training or a power based training. I think of zone five as basically your VO two max training.

462
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,280
And I think a lot of people sometimes spend too little or too much time in this zone. And we want

463
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,160
to kind of help you understand what that sweet spot might look like. Assuming that you're not

464
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,400
training specifically for athletic events that require unusual levels of fitness around that

465
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,560
energy system. But again, if you're really just talking about being the fittest, healthiest person

466
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,000
you need to be, to be kind of a kick ass 90 year old, then I think we don't need to be spending

467
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,640
quite as much time there as you might think to harness the benefits. So in these clips,

468
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm going to talk about how I train there and how I think about VO two max. Now we talk about VO two

469
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,880
max in AMA 27. And that's where we're going to talk about how the benefits appear to comparing

470
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,000
someone of low fitness to elite fitness with respect to these metrics. And it's kind of

471
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,440
staggering. The difference between someone at the bottom 25% of VO two max versus someone at the top

472
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,080
two and a half percent is about a five fold difference. So this shows the importance of

473
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,880
VO two max and why I think you ought to be spending more time there.

474
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:04,240
We've got a zone, zone, wait for it. Five question, not two. What is Peter's approach to

475
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,520
zone five training? What about other anaerobic training protocols?

476
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:15,200
I love this. So my zone five is mostly done on my stair master, which is my absolute favorite

477
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,840
piece of equipment. That's not a bicycle. Other than the elliptical. Yeah, I can't stand the

478
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:27,840
elliptical. So basically my zone five workout, which I really only do once a week is three

479
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:35,600
minutes of zone two with one minute at VO two max, because I know what my VO two max is. I know how to

480
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,680
convert it into Mets, which is VO two max divided by 3.5. And the stair master allows you to work in

481
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,880
Watts and Mets. So basically I'm doing three minutes at my zone two. And then I go one minute

482
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,640
at what my VO two max is, which truthfully is quite difficult to hold your VO two max for one

483
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,360
minute. And then right back to three, my recovery is then the three minutes at zone two. And so that

484
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:08,560
four minute pattern, I just repeat for 20 to 30 minutes. And I usually do that on the tail end of

485
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:15,840
a zone two workout. So that's kind of my longer aerobic day. Other workouts that I liked when I'm

486
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,760
outdoors on my bike, I also like doing kind of a more VO two max training type ride, which would

487
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:30,640
be kind of like a four minutes at call it 125% of FTP functional threshold power, followed by

488
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,240
four minutes recovery. So one to one work rest, but obviously at a lower intensity than the three

489
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,640
to one rest to work that I just described. So yeah, there's lots of ways to hit zone five.

490
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,800
And it's a very important zone as well. My view is most people spend too much time there and not

491
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,360
enough time in zone two though. I've got a few follow up questions, which it'll give you more

492
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,880
time to on this. I went almost to my two minutes on that one. I was like staring at my clock.

493
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,360
One's I think simple. So the stair master, is it a stair master? Or is it, I don't know if it's

494
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,840
called a stair climber. Do you have the one where it's like literally you're going up steps or is

495
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,320
it the one where you just have like two levers and you're pushing them back and forth?

496
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,400
Oh, sorry. No, mine is like the fancy gym one where it's like an S later.

497
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,280
Is that what it's called?

498
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,760
No, no, no, no, no. It's not a Jacob's ladder. It's a series of eight inch steps that

499
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,960
roll up and down a machine. So the higher the intensity you set it, the less resistance is

500
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,720
in those steps and the faster you have to go to not fall off the back. So if I set it to like

501
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,000
eight Mets, it's moving quite, there's actually quite a bit of resistance. So I can step quite

502
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,960
slowly without falling off. When I set it to like 20 Mets, it feels like there's no resistance and

503
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,240
I'm running up the stairs to not get thrown off the back.

504
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,520
I think we could do a podcast on a lot of this stuff, VO2 and all that other stuff. But one of

505
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,720
the things that sticks out to me, because you got like a coach or anybody and they want you

506
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,160
to give 110% and you think like, what the hell is this? I can give 100% maybe. But when you're

507
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,920
talking about your VO2 max and you're saying, I'm going at 100%, I think some people might just

508
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,080
think like, oh, you must be going all like balls to the wall, all out.

509
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,280
No, definitely not.

510
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,600
When you're looking at like, what's my workload to my VO2 max, you can actually,

511
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,000
you can exceed 100% of your VO2 max in terms of the work you're doing, right?

512
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,080
Right. And Alex Hutchinson, who is going to be on the podcast very soon,

513
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:36,240
writes about this very elegantly in his book, Endure. Basically the limits of human performance

514
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,400
in terms of quote unquote, going all out is about 10 seconds. So really no human has the potential

515
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
to go all out for 10 seconds. You might think you are, but you're not.

516
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I take spin class. I've taken spin classes before and I'm going all out

517
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,360
for like 80% of it, or at least the instructor wants me to go all out.

518
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,080
Sure, sure. Yeah.

519
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,040
For about 80%.

520
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,120
The instructor is playing games with your mind and if that helps you, so be it. But

521
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,440
look, you only need to look at the difference between a 100 meter and a 200 meter sprint.

522
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:13,760
So take the best explosive athletes on the planet and even by the time Usain Bolt is running the

523
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,680
200, he is slowing down in the second half of that race. The force with which he's able to hit

524
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,000
the ground in the second half of that race is slower. He can go faster in the second half

525
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,840
because he gets a flying start. But the 100 meter, which is basically a 10 second race,

526
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:36,080
is about the true limit of what all out means. So I even find this interesting when you consider two

527
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:43,680
variants of Tabata. As you know, there's the 2010 Tabata and the 1020 Tabata. And you and I both have

528
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:51,200
air bikes, which are great tools for doing that. When I go through cycles of Tabata, which these

529
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,720
days I'm not, I'm focusing much more on zone five workouts on both the rowing machine, which I didn't

530
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,440
get into and also in the stair machine. But sometimes I just do like a couple of Tabata's a week.

531
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,320
I mean, anybody who's tried both knows you can go so much harder for the 1020 than the 2010.

532
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,680
The 2010 is generally favored because that's the one that was studied by Ursaula and Tabata. Fun fact,

533
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,160
by the way, Tabata's are not named after the guy who developed the protocol. He was the guy that

534
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,840
wrote the paper. Ursaula developed the protocol. They should be called Ursaula's. So the problem

535
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,480
with a quote unquote 2010 Tabata is whether consciously or subconsciously you're actually

536
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,920
pacing yourself to complete it, which is what it is. But I think it actually poses a little bit of

537
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,560
difficulty. Okay. I'm surprised you don't actually just say I do Ursaula's and then have people.

538
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,720
Have people look it up. Look at you. Dude, Mondays and Fridays. Mondays and Fridays is

539
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,040
I just do Ursaula's. Yeah. Some people nodding their heads.

540
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,960
So with that, let's just start with sort of something you've already alluded to. Let's explain

541
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,280
what it is. Talk about how much it matters and then kind of get into some examples. So let's

542
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,280
start with a term that many people have heard before, but I don't think most people understand

543
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,520
what VO two max really means. And eventually we're going to talk about running efficiency and

544
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,360
lactate threshold. And we're going to get into all this stuff, but let's, let's make sure people

545
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,720
understand what VO two max is both in an absolute term and then in a manner that we normalize it by

546
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,880
weight and what it is and what it isn't, how it's measured, how it matters. And maybe we'll even

547
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,960
talk about some notable exceptions. So VO two max is the one physiological parameter that anyone

548
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,320
who's involved in endurance has heard of and has some sense of the first order analogy is it's kind

549
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:49,920
of the size of your engine. Physiologically VO two max is telling you how quickly you can take oxygen

550
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,640
from the air into your lungs, get it into your blood, pump it to your muscles, and then have your

551
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,480
muscles use it in the metabolic processes that will provide energy to move you to do whatever you

552
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:08,240
want to do. So it's a rate. It's how much oxygen per unit time can you process absolutely flat out.

553
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:15,360
Now the sort of backstory here is it was first sort of discussed or measured in the 1920s by a

554
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,160
guy named Av Hill, who was actually a very good runner. The observation that he made is if you

555
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,920
have someone, you ask someone to go out and run at a gentle pace, they'll consume, let's say,

556
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,720
two liters of oxygen per minute. Then you tell them to speed up. Now they're doing three liters

557
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,680
of oxygen per minute. Tell them to speed up again, and now they're going pretty much, maybe not as

558
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,360
fast as they can, but they're going fast and they're using four liters of oxygen per minute.

559
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,680
So you tell them to speed up again and you measure it and they're like, oh, they're only using four

560
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,760
liters of oxygen a minute, just like last time. They'll speed up again. And they're still just

561
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,440
using four liters of oxygen a minute. There's a plateau, there's a point at which even though

562
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,120
you're working harder, you're not using any more oxygen. And so this plateau looks like it's a

563
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,480
physiological limitation and it probably is in some sense, it's a controversial thing, but basically

564
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,720
you've reached a point where no matter how hard you push yourself, you can't get more oxygen.

565
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,240
And so you can still go faster because you're starting to use other forms of energy,

566
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,440
but this is the limits of your aerobic system. This tells you what it tells you we can get into.

567
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,200
It's not clear what it tells you. It tells you exactly what I just said. It tells you how much

568
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,120
oxygen you can use. Does that tell you exactly how fast you can run? No, there are a lot of other

569
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,840
factors, but that tells you what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with.

570
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,720
I remember in high school, I mean, we would sort of talk about, well, which athletes have the

571
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,680
highest VO2 max? Is it the Norwegian cross country skiers? Is it the professional runners and

572
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,040
cyclists and things like that? But people are usually used to hearing these numbers reported,

573
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:52,160
not in liters per minute, but in milliliters per minute per kilogram. So give an example,

574
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:58,080
so people understand those differences because we usually talk about the outliers as a number

575
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,160
that's a bigger number than two liters or five liters. It would be sort of 75, 80 milliliters.

576
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,080
You just explain to people how those are different. Sure. So I'll use my own numbers.

577
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,520
Typically when I was tested, I could get about a little bit more than five liters per minute.

578
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,840
So 5.1, 5.2, if I remember correctly. Now, if you compared me to a rower, the rower would

579
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:27,280
make me look pathetic because the rower would be using seven liters a minute or more, but the rower

580
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:34,000
is also huge, twice my size or whatever. And so that doesn't necessarily mean that that rower is

581
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,280
better at using oxygen for me because the rower has way more muscle. And so the rower is the amount

582
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:46,640
of oxygen reaching any given muscle cell may be lower. So if you want to compare apples to apples

583
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,480
between athletes of different sizes, you divide, at least for a crude approximation, you just divide

584
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,400
by weight. And so the numbers we usually hear are rather than liters of oxygen per minute,

585
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,960
it's milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight. So for me, five liters

586
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:13,360
of oxygen per minute works out to something like 80 milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram

587
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:19,200
of body weight. There's a whole rabbit hole to go into is to say, well, why are we dividing by whole

588
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,720
body weight? Because there's a bunch of things like skeleton and organs and stuff that don't scale.

589
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,880
The adipose tissue doesn't matter. I mean, you could argue a better comparison would be

590
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,800
total liters per minute divided by lean mass divided by time or normalized to time. And then

591
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,560
you're at least getting the metabolically active tissue, presumably.

592
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,840
Yeah. And there's papers where they do things like let's divide by weight to the power of 0.68

593
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,320
or 0.7, which is another way of getting it. Effectively, it's a way of approximating

594
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,640
just the lean mass, the metabolically active tissue. And you can go down that rabbit hole,

595
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,640
but I suspect you'll want to get to is like at a certain point, it doesn't matter that much.

596
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,320
Anyway, so you can't just measure someone's VO2 max and know how fast they're going to race.

597
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:11,440
So it's useful, but especially for comparing between people. Now comparing within yourself,

598
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,840
it tells you something if you've increased or if your VO2 max has decreased. But in that sense,

599
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,240
it doesn't matter what you're dividing by. I remember there was a guy that I used to ride

600
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,920
with and this was not that long ago, maybe five or six years ago when I was still somewhat

601
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,000
competitive, at least with myself. Actually, it's funny. My number was just like yours except

602
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,360
I was heavier. So I was about 5.1 to 5.2 liters, but I weighed more. So that worked out to about

603
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:45,520
70 mils per MiG per KIG was my VO2 max. His was 55 to 60, but there was never a day that I could

604
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,120
ride faster than him, not one. There's simply, and I always felt like, although we did the test so

605
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:57,120
many times, I kept feeling like the machine must have been broken on him. I knew my 70 was about

606
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,520
right because I'd been tested so much and that was lower than it had been when I was younger,

607
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,800
so it seemed appropriate. But I was always convinced that there's no way he's only 55.

608
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:12,320
The reality of it is he may well have been and he may have simply been a far more efficient

609
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,680
athlete, which we're going to get into. Before we get to the story of Oscar Svensson,

610
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,560
let's talk a little bit about historically what people have believed the limits are of VO2 max.

611
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,760
We don't even have to go very far historically to get into a whole

612
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:33,200
mudslide of confusion and debate and disagreement. There's a lot of places along the way that could,

613
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,120
in some circumstances, be the bottleneck. Normally, people tend to assume that what is it that causes

614
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,280
VO2 max to plateau is essentially what I think what we're talking about. Just one thing I should

615
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,920
add here, it's like, why is that interesting? It's because you think, well, if you want to measure

616
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,320
endurance, just have someone run a mile or whatever as hard as they can. But any test like

617
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,200
that depends on motivation, depends on whether you pace it right. There's all these factors that

618
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,640
come into it. The nice thing about VO2 max is that in theory, it's independent of motivation.

619
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,520
That's why scientists like it because it doesn't matter if the subject doesn't really care about

620
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,200
the study. If you see a plateau, you know that's a property of their body and not a product of what

621
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,520
they were excited about the study. The question is, this plateau, what is it that causes it?

622
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,480
It could be in the lungs, it could be the heart, it could be the circulation, it could be the

623
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,960
muscle's ability to extract it. I don't want to pretend that I know the answer because it's still

624
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:36,160
controversial. The picture that emerges is that almost every part along this cascade is engineered

625
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,320
more or less to what it needs to be. If you perturb any of those

626
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,920
elements, you can get limitations. For example, the conventional wisdom is that your lungs are

627
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,280
not a limitation. You can always breathe enough in. Then the question is, can you diffuse enough

628
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,400
oxygen from your lungs into your bloodstream and so on and so forth? There are situations where,

629
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,840
and for decades, it's been conventional wisdom that the lungs don't respond to training because

630
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,440
they're overbuilt. There was just a paper published, a big review in the last month or two,

631
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,240
arguing that in some cases, the lungs aren't overbuilt and one of the situations is highly

632
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:16,160
trained endurance athletes. They can be limited by their ability to get enough oxygen in. You can

633
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,960
also run into situations where an athlete is so fit, their heart is so strong, it pumps blood past

634
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,640
your lungs so quickly that it doesn't have time to fully stock up on oxygen. You get something

635
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:33,280
called exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia. This is usually an issue at altitude, but in elite

636
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,920
endurance athletes, actually about half of them exhibited even at sea level. They're already

637
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,840
running into a limitation just in getting oxygen from their lungs to their bloodstream.

638
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,360
At every stage of the way, there can be limitations if anything is knocked off kilter

639
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,680
and certainly right down to the ability of the muscles to first extract the oxygen from the

640
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,440
bloodstream and then to make use of it metabolically in the mitochondria. There isn't one single

641
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,040
answer, which is why you get these debates because everyone is going, I have evidence that this is

642
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,480
the limit. It's like, yeah, but I have evidence that this is the limit and that's the limit and

643
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,480
they're all the limit. I've always wanted to see the experiment where you took a group of athletes,

644
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:14,960
maybe this has been done. You run them all to max and then you reduce the FiO2 of the

645
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,640
incoming oxygen. Normally, we do it with room air. The fractional inhalation of oxygen is 21%.

646
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,880
The way, of course, just for the listener, the way these things work is the way they're

647
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,920
calculating how much oxygen is being consumed is they're measuring the concentration of oxygen on

648
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,080
the way out. You're calculating the delta. I've always thought, well, wouldn't it be

649
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:41,840
interesting to start selectively dropping FiO2, 21%, 20%, 19%, 18%. Now, presumably,

650
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,720
if the lungs aren't the limitation, you should still see the same absolute delta and you could

651
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:56,800
at least start to eliminate one of those variables, which would be FiO2 and capillary exchange. Then

652
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,720
you start pointing to some of these other variables. Again, I'm sure somebody has done

653
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,360
this experiment, but I don't know what it yielded. Probably not with the fine tooth comb that you're

654
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:11,440
suggesting. People have compared 21% to 10% or whatever and 15%. It's interesting when you go

655
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,120
to altitude or the equivalent when you reduce the amount of oxygen, funny things happen. The first

656
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,400
thing you would think would happen is you can't get enough oxygen, so you're going to go anaerobic

657
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,160
sooner, you're going to produce more lactate. Yet the opposite happens. There's something called

658
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:29,520
the lactate paradox. If you try and exercise to exhaustion at lower levels of altitude, you

659
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,160
actually give up when your lactate levels are lower than you would at sea level. There's debate

660
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,640
about what causes this and even whether it's a real thing. But the picture that makes sense to

661
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,800
me is that these things are not just about how much oxygen is making it to the muscle. It's also

662
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,120
like what is your brain oxygen level? You're getting these other circuit breakers that are

663
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:54,960
starting to come down. They aren't even on this path from mouth to lungs to blood to muscle.

664
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,640
There's other factors that are saying, whoa, wait a second. Oxygen is getting a little low,

665
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,880
so we're going to actually cut off the supply to the muscles or reduce it in order to make sure

666
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:12,560
that we don't get stupid. This next clip is going to focus on stability. As I mentioned at the

667
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,320
outset with Beth Lewis and Michael Runtales, we filmed a bunch of instructional videos to go with

668
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:20,960
this. I can't recommend them enough. It's one thing to hear us talk about these things. It's

669
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,760
quite another thing to see the exercises and be able to do them yourself.

670
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,440
Stability is the cornerstone upon which you do everything. It is the cornerstone upon which your

671
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,120
strength is delivered, your aerobic performance is delivered, and your anaerobic performance

672
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:47,840
is delivered. It's the way that you do so safely. Stability is a way that we transmit force from

673
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,680
the body to the outside world and vice versa, from the outside world to the body, in the safest

674
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,080
manner possible across the muscles which are designed to carry that load, as opposed to seeing

675
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:08,720
the dissipation of force across joints that are not fit to do so. For example, when you're picking

676
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,280
something up, let's say you have to pick up something and it weighs 60 pounds. Well, you have

677
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,000
to exert 60 pounds of force on the world around you. Newton's laws tell us that that's what it

678
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,360
means to pick up 60 pounds. The idea is you want all of that 60 pounds to be transmitted from your

679
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:30,800
muscles to the ground, lifting this thing up, and you don't want anything dissipating out your back,

680
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:37,520
out your knees, out your hips. While most of us are born with the ability to do that naturally,

681
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:44,320
it generally gets lost by the time we're in grade school in response to many things, but probably

682
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:52,960
chief among them is a relative lack of activity and a relative abundance of sitting. When I look

683
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:02,560
at my two and a half year old move, it's a perfect clinic in forced transmission safely across the

684
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:10,800
body. When you look at me move prior to becoming obsessed with and schooled in these disciplines

685
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,080
of, as you mentioned, one of them, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization or DNS, it's always

686
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:23,200
a little bit of an inefficient way to get things done and it results in a lot of force leakage or

687
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:30,800
seeping out around my scapula, my elbow, my knee, my back, my hips. This is one of the root causes

688
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:38,640
of a lot of the chronic injuries a lot of us have. Stability then is probably what I think of

689
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:44,320
as the foundation upon which everything should be done vis-a-vis exercise. Just yesterday, I was

690
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:52,960
actually talking to a patient and she was asking me if she needed to do DNS or if she could continue

691
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,360
to work on the Pilates that she has been doing for many years. My response was that I think a great

692
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:05,520
Pilates teacher is already teaching many of these principles. I think this is somewhat discipline

693
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:11,440
agnostic, but it's heavily dependent on the practitioner and the student. I've seen really

694
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,920
good Pilates teachers who even though they're using a very different vocabulary than the one

695
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,960
that I use or that the DNS practitioners use, the results speak for themselves and those patients

696
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:30,960
do have the correct patterns of movement. They are able to get air fully into their lungs. They're

697
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:38,480
able to get their diaphragm low into their abdomen. They're able to flatten out their pelvic floor,

698
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:45,440
generate concentric, robust intra-abdominal pressure that stabilizes every aspect of them.

699
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,080
There are other people who either the teacher doesn't have the skill to do that or the teacher

700
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,560
does, but it's just not being presented in a way that the student can understand it. This is also

701
01:06:54,560 --> 01:07:00,160
one of those things that's iterative and I think one should always be searching for this. Postural

702
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:07,360
restoration, PRI, DNS, Pilates, these are all different ways that one can come about trying to

703
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,920
learn these principles. I think unfortunately of the four pieces of exercise we're going to talk

704
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,920
about, this is the one that probably will take the most tinkering for people to find the right type

705
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,160
of practitioners. Probably sometime next year, Bob, as you know, we are going to start to put

706
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:30,960
together some material on this for people outside of our practice. Currently all of the work we do

707
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,160
on this front, we've put together many video courses. Those are exclusively for our patients at

708
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:42,240
this point, but as our knowledge expands and our footprint in this space expands, my hope is that

709
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:48,000
we are able to start to create digital curriculum on this type of stuff that can help people who,

710
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:58,000
again, don't have access to somebody. We'll end this week's episode with a clip from one of our

711
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,520
recent AMAs. I believe episode 32 where I talk about the macro structure of my current training

712
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,000
routine. As we come to this end, I want to mention in the intro, it's the first time we've done this,

713
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,480
so we'd really like to hear your feedback, positive and negative. Is this something you

714
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,520
want to see us do again with other topics? If so, maybe even suggest some of the topics you'd like

715
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,680
to hear. If not, please be honest with us and tell us not. As I said, it's a lot of work to do this

716
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,640
and we only want to do this if people find this valuable. Thanks so much.

717
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,400
I thought it might be helpful for people before we get into some of those specifics. Just

718
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,520
what is your current exercise routine look like each week? I know it's always changing,

719
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,920
but if you can give people a rough overview, I think that will be helpful as we get into some

720
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,480
of these other questions. Yeah. The actual macro structure of what I do has not changed much in

721
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:55,120
the last year. The micro structure has changed a lot, meaning the exercises have changed a lot,

722
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:02,480
but the macro structure is that on, let's see, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday are cardio

723
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:13,600
days. So Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday are zone two. Saturday is either a zone two followed by a zone

724
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,040
five. That's a separate workout. Each of those are 45 minute zone twos and then a 30 minute zone

725
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,600
five is a separate workout that's done almost immediately after. Basically getting out of bike

726
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,360
close and putting on stair climbing clothes. Alternatively, I might just do a longer bike ride

727
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:37,040
on Saturday and make it more of an anaerobic workout. Then from a lifting standpoint,

728
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:45,040
it's Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday is lifting. About, I don't know, nine months ago, I switched

729
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:51,680
to an upper body, lower body split. I used to lift three days a week and do upper body, lower body

730
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:58,400
every day. Each day I was doing pushing, pulling, and hip hinging. Now the lower body component,

731
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:05,600
I think is Monday, Friday. The upper body is Wednesday, Sunday. I always lift after doing

732
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,320
cardio because I think the reverse has been demonstrated to erode strength training gains.

733
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,040
Peter, what happens if you miss a day? Because I noticed you didn't say day one, day two,

734
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,360
day three. You were very distinct on the days of the week. I know you typically don't miss a day,

735
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:24,400
but if you miss Wednesday, do you just scrap those exercises and then just continue with

736
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,240
your program or are you trying to make up in the interim? No. Like yesterday, Sunday would have

737
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:36,960
been a ride followed by lift day, but I was on the track the whole day and I knew that in advance.

738
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,320
I just ended up doing that lift on Saturday, but obviously was short changed on the zone two for

739
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:49,120
yesterday. I pretty much will never compromise a lift. I will always get those four lifts in during

740
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:55,200
the week no matter what. Sometimes it just means moving the days around or doubling up on a different

741
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:01,120
day. What about timing? Do you have a preference morning, afternoon, evening? Is that flexible as

742
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,920
well within your schedule? A little more flexible on weekends, but Monday through Friday and pretty

743
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,360
much no flexibility. Those lifts have to be done first thing in the morning and not first thing in

744
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:15,040
the morning. So morning routine is more about the kids and stuff like that, but once they're out the

745
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:20,640
door to school, it's around 7.15, 7.30, that's when I'll typically lift. Thank you for listening
