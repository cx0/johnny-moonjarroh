00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,200
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,960
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,400
you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple.

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,080
It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back

32
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:59,080
more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,520
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,040
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. Welcome back to the final installment, part three

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,760
of three of the Matthew Walker series on sleep. If for some reason you haven't yet listened to the

47
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,840
first two episodes, I'd recommend going back and listening to those prior to listening to this one.

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,800
My guest this week is Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
of California, Berkeley, and the founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science.

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,320
Matthew earned his undergraduate degree and PhD in neurophysiology in London and subsequently became

51
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,240
a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School before moving to Berkeley. His research

52
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,280
examines the impact of sleep on human brain function in healthy and diseased populations.

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,520
To date, he has published over a hundred scientific studies. He has received numerous

54
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
funding awards from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health,

55
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,520
and he's a fellow with the National Academy of Sciences. He's the author of the international

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,760
bestseller, Why We Sleep, which also happens to be the favorite book of my not yet two-year-old son.

57
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,560
He holds many patents covering various consumer-based sleep recordings, sleep tracking,

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,280
and sleep simulation. He's a sleep scientist at Google where he helps the scientific exploration

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,040
of sleep in health and disease. He is also an enormous fan of Formula One and my hero,

60
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,400
Ira Thunsena. In the final part of this series, we discuss the role of sleep and my weight gain,

61
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,200
presumably that of others, sleep and blood sugar, sleep's effect on genes,

62
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,320
sleep's effect on the food you eat, the effect of sleep on people's productivity,

63
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,400
the relationship between alcohol, caffeine, THC, CBD, and sleep, and that's not all combined,

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,120
of course, what Matthew is doing today at Berkeley at the Center for Human Sleep Science and other

65
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,920
startup projects he's working on. And we close this out with a discussion of Formula One,

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,640
our mutual favorite thing, driving and sleep. As a reminder, at the end of this series,

67
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,640
we're going to take questions for a follow-up AMA with Matthew. Asking questions on the AMA forum

68
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,720
and listening to the AMA podcast with Matthew along with all AMAs will only be available to

69
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,240
subscribers. So if you haven't signed up yet, you can do so now at peteratiamd.com forward slash

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,120
subscribe. So without further delay, here is the finale with Professor Matthew Walker.

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,720
I want to talk about another several topics on here, but I want to go back to something that

72
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,480
you and I have spoken about before, but I think it's so important. I want to make sure we've got

73
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:34,280
it for all the listeners. One of the most compelling things I ever read, I mean, I think

74
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,400
there were several moments in my journey and in the sort of world of sleep that really shook me.

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,080
One of them was reading this paper out of the University of Chicago, and I believe it was

76
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,200
Eve Van Kutter, but it might not have been. It took a group of subjects and it was a very small

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,320
study, but it was so well controlled because they sleep deprived these and well, they did

78
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,160
euglycemic clamps on, you know, day zero. So for the listener, that's a really rigorous test

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,800
where you inject glucose and insulin into the patient and you keep the glucose level steady

80
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,840
by titrating the insulin level. And this is an elegant way to measure one of the most important

81
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,400
features of metabolism, which is how well you dispose of glucose primarily into the muscle.

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,400
And I believe the subjects were restricted to four hours of sleep a night for two weeks.

83
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,920
Yeah. So, you know, about.

84
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,120
And it's been replicated for four, five and six hours for one week.

85
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Okay. At the end of that period of time, they repeated the euglycemic clamp, again, the gold

86
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,400
standard for measuring insulin resistance. And these patients suffered a 50% reduction in their

87
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:55,400
ability to put glucose into their muscle, which again, would certainly rank among the five most

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,480
important physiologic things to do. Again, to put this in perspective, a normal blood sugar might

89
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,480
be a hundred milligrams per deciliter or roughly five millimolar for a normal sized individual that

90
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,360
represents five grams of glucose. I'm going to let this iron go by here.

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,360
Yeah. It may actually be immigration coming to get me finally, insulin deporting me back to the

92
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,120
United Kingdom. But sorry. Yeah.

93
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,200
So you've got five grams of glucose in the bloodstream, which is one teaspoon.

94
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:35,400
Frank diabetes would be 200 milligrams per deciliter, 10 to 11 millimolar, two teaspoons

95
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:42,920
of sugar. So the amount of glucose you have in your bloodstream is trivial compared to what's

96
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:50,120
in the muscles and in the liver. So imagine losing the ability to put that away by 50%.

97
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,880
And as I look back at how metabolically deranged I was at the end of my residency,

98
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,960
I can't help but realize something that I think alluded me for a great number of years, which is

99
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,240
the role that sleep deprivation played in my weight gain, my insulin resistance,

100
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,200
my hypogonadism. I know you and I have joked about it, but I think at the end of residency,

101
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,000
my testosterone was about 200 to 220 nanograms per deciliter on a scale where two standard

102
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,640
deviations below the mean is about 350. So, you know, about twice that of a female in terms of

103
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,040
testosterone. I now realize that was the sleep deprivation. That wasn't just the cafeteria food.

104
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,000
And by the way, it certainly wasn't a lack of exercise. Amazingly throughout residency,

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,560
I still managed to figure out a way to exercise like crazy.

106
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,520
And you know, the point there is despite all of that exercise, despite the power

107
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,640
that that should have had on your metabolic system, my guess is that if we'd done that

108
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,720
same glucose tolerance test, it would have been way down. And when you think about, you know,

109
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,080
that's essentially taking healthy individuals who show no signs of diabetes, limiting them to an

110
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,440
anemic diet of sleep, you know, four or five hours for one week now we've seen. And you can get them

111
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,440
into a state where someone like you, if you just read their readings at the end of the week and you

112
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,080
not think about the experiment, you would probably argue that they may be in a pre-diabetic state at

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,360
that stage. Sure. You're writing the metformin prescription. How is this happening, Matt? What

114
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,320
is the mechanism by which something so profound, so fundamental and important to our survival is

115
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,560
going so awry in such a short period of time? We know the evidence. We've unpacked this mechanism

116
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,280
now. So the way that you regulate your glucose, the way that you sort of have glucose homeostasis

117
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,360
is that there are at least two major parts of this equation. The first is that cells in your

118
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,840
pancreas called beta cells need to sense the spike in blood sugar and then they need to release

119
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:09,400
insulin. And then when that insulin is released, it actually tells the cells of the body to reach out

120
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,800
and absorb the blood glucose, the blood sugar, and that prevents you from an otherwise dangerous

121
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,800
spike in blood sugar. So these two things need to happen. Your beta cells in your pancreas need to

122
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:29,480
release insulin and then the cells of the body need to be sensitive to that insulin to be then

123
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:38,120
instructed to essentially suck in that blood glucose from the bloodstream. Now, what can happen

124
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,400
is that if you have a deficit in one and I think pregnancy may be a good demonstration of this

125
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:51,640
where sometimes the cells of the body become less sensitive to that insulin. But what's nice

126
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,840
is that the beta cells in the pancreas, they understand that the cells aren't sucking in the

127
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,600
glucose that they need. So they just release some more insulin and your insulin homeostasis

128
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,480
remains in balance. So this is what we call the disposition index. How good are you at disposing

129
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,960
of glucose? And can you manage that disposition index? So what happens with insufficient sleep

130
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,560
is unfortunately bad on both sides of those equations. So firstly, we know that when you

131
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,160
are under slept, the beta cells of your pancreas become insensitive to the spike in blood sugar

132
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:38,520
glucose. In other words, your body stops releasing enough insulin to deal with the food that you've

133
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:45,560
just eaten. So you're down on insulin. You haven't released enough insulin. That's a bad thing. But

134
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,000
maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the cells of the body were just really sensitive to what little

135
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,120
insulin is left and you could still at least clear some of that blood glucose. Unfortunately,

136
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,800
that doesn't happen because what's worse is that the cells of the body actually become insensitive

137
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:11,480
to the signal of insulin. And so the cells of the body stop sucking in as much glucose,

138
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,760
as much sugar from the bloodstream. So on both sides of the glucose homeostasis balance,

139
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,480
you're kind of a little bit screwed that insufficient sleep means that you don't release

140
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,880
enough insulin. So you don't have enough of that signal to begin with. What little has been released

141
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:39,480
unfortunately is not listened to and heard by the cells of your body. So those cells actually

142
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,400
don't end up dragging in the blood glucose, the gushing kind of monsoon of glucose that's now in

143
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,400
your bloodstream after a meal, which means that you end up having an inability on both sides of

144
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,960
the glucose equation to clear that blood glucose. That's why you have that type of glucose intolerance

145
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,200
problems with glucose absorption. And to get down to even the causal mechanism in humans,

146
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:15,320
some great studies where you can actually say, why are the cells so mute to the signal of insulin?

147
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,800
Why are your cells not listening to insulin correctly and not responding by bringing that

148
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,240
blood sugar into them to drop your blood sugar levels? And the answer is this, what they did was

149
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,400
they took a group of, again, healthy people, no signs of diabetes. They took a biopsy of cells

150
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:40,280
from around the belly button from the umbilicum. And then you can actually measure how those cells

151
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,480
are behaving inside of those cells themselves. So you can kind of like poke around inside and

152
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,320
figure out what's happening. They took the biopsy in those same subjects after they've been limited

153
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,680
to just four or five hours of sleep. And then they repeated the biopsy when those participants had

154
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,040
been sleeping eight hours. So this is again, one of those beautifully, carefully controlled studies,

155
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,880
same individuals, same process. And are they looking at adipocyte or myocyte?

156
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,080
So it's adipocyte. So this is fat cells. Right. So this, I would expect something different in

157
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,160
the adipocyte from the muscle cell. I don't think the experiment has been done with the muscle cell

158
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,680
yet, but it has been done with the adipocyte. And then they've essentially got these now, these cells

159
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,720
outside of the body. And you can play around. You can essentially sort of, you know, drip insulin

160
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,240
onto those cells and you can ask what's going to happen to those cells in terms of the instruction

161
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,360
that they receive from the insulin. One of the critical things that happens when insulin binds

162
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,480
to the receptor of the cells is the phosphorylation of something called AKT. And when AKT is

163
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,520
phosphorylated, it essentially helps something called the Glue-4 transporter inside of the cell

164
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,520
to essentially go to the surface of the cell. And it's almost like the metaphorical straw that

165
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,720
gets stuck out of the cell and it's bringing glucose in to simplify it. What you find is that

166
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,800
when that cell has been under conditions of insufficient sleep, the amount of insulin required

167
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,640
to phosphorylate that AKT to get those cells to start absorbing glucose, you need almost

168
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,440
twice the amount of insulin. You need double the amount of insulin to get those cells to do the

169
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:36,440
same thing, which- That's counterintuitive actually. You'd think that the adipocyte would be even more

170
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:47,480
sensitive to insulin as the body works harder to undergo esterification and put fat away,

171
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,960
given that the muscle becomes more resistant to insulin. So that's interesting. So of course,

172
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,360
this speaks to why many hormones are necessary to drive the metabolic derangement because also the

173
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,400
cortisol level would maybe even oppose that. But in isolation, what you just described would

174
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,320
actually oppose reesterification of fatty acid. Yeah. But in my mind, I think what's striking

175
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:19,480
though, it starts to tell you that individual cell types need sleep. Yeah. I was just going

176
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:29,480
to say, what do you think is the communication vehicle? What is telling that phosphorylated

177
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:37,800
sign, do less of it, be less effective? How is that communicated? That right now, I think we,

178
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,320
at least I don't know of what intracellular mechanisms have transpired to decrease the

179
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,200
amount of all the capacity for the phosphorylation of AKT to bring glucose into the cell.

180
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,280
There are clearly some kind of signaling mechanisms that are coming extracellularly

181
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:09,160
and telling intracellularly things to do that are either maladaptive or just much less efficient

182
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,240
inside of the cell. But to me, that just blows my mind that we often think of the impact of a lack

183
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,080
of sleep on things like behavior, like driving or making food choices. We've done some of this stuff

184
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,560
with brain scanning. But your question is so beautifully nuanced because it's actually asking,

185
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,480
there is something about a lack of sleep that will get even into cells themselves and alter

186
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:45,480
intracellular functioning. So if you can get a single factor sleep that can have its impact

187
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,760
all the way from complex cognitive issues like decision making all the way down to something

188
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,880
like intracellular function, my goodness, you need to look out if you're depriving yourself of

189
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,520
that one function. And I'll go a step further because there was a great paper published in

190
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,040
something called the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. It's a very prestigious

191
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,480
journal. We like to call it PNAS around it. Right. Yeah. PNAS, the acronym, with my students,

192
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,520
I'll say PNAS and try to navigate around that unfortunate acronym. That is hilarious because

193
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm so far removed that it was just PNAS. We never even thought you would have to be politically

194
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,320
correct and call it PNAS. Yeah. I just published my biggest girth of research in penis.

195
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,400
Well done. That sounds like your parents must be swelling with pride right now.

196
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Could you imagine? And I actually have, we have published a bunch of stuff in penis, but this

197
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,960
I just got to pause for a moment. Why is it, here's another evolutionary question.

198
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,320
Why is it that any two guys can be hanging out? Like you could have the, I was going to say the

199
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,440
president of the United States, bad example. You could take any two male heads of state and put

200
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,760
them in the UN on the floor trying to negotiate a resolution. And like a penis joke just makes

201
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,800
everybody laugh. Can I just say that within, I think, and people can tell me the time of this

202
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,880
in the comments, I think within the space of about 180 seconds, we went from intracellular

203
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,120
cascade mechanisms from phosphorylation of AKT to penis jokes. And it's all my fault. No, no, no,

204
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,480
no. Now I want to go back to this because what you said is, it actually scares me more. Here's why.

205
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,720
I think that at the surface, everything you opened our discussion with with respect to

206
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,240
Alzheimer's disease, I mean, you led with the best punch, right? To me, that is, you could stop

207
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,480
there. If sleep disturbance didn't impair your driving, didn't increase your risk of cardiovascular

208
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,000
mortality, didn't trash your immune system and double your risk of cancer, didn't give you

209
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,880
diabetes. If you took every one of those things away, just driving your risk of dementia is,

210
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,520
that's full stop reason enough. Didn't impair your learning. Take everything away.

211
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,600
I'll take it all. But paradoxically, most of those things, because at least we see what the

212
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,640
mechanism is, that the mechanism of action is, and even when we don't, like in Alzheimer's disease,

213
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,560
I don't think we know exactly the mechanism of action, but there's a plausible theme.

214
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,480
But it's this last one that you're bringing up that in many ways scares me the most because it

215
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:45,080
speaks to the ubiquity and the spread and the breadth of that impact. Like there are other

216
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:52,360
cellular facts, like this is so central that it's impacting and regulating the phosphorylation of a

217
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,000
series of enzymes that drive something so seemingly unrelated as a GLUT4 transporter to translocate

218
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,280
the surface of a cell. Like why in the world would that happen at a single cell level?

219
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,320
You can observe the impact of a process, be it diet or exercise or food, at that level,

220
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,560
the fact that it can transcend almost every biological level of slice that you can do to

221
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:23,720
biology. And to me, I think that the final one, which comes back to the penis, the PNAS paper,

222
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,680
takes the final step for me. What they did was they took a group of, again, healthy adults,

223
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,720
and they limited them to six hours of sleep for one week.

224
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,600
So they basically made them average Americans.

225
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,760
Average Americans, yeah. And then they essentially looked at the change in their gene activity

226
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,680
profile. This is from blood.

227
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,560
You're not going to tell me there was epigenetic change.

228
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,240
Well, relative to when those same individuals were getting eight hours of sleep, and there were two

229
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,200
critical findings. First, what they found is exactly your fear. They found that a sizable

230
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,320
and non-trivial 711 genes were distorted in their activity caused by that insufficient sleep,

231
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,560
which by the way, again, six hours of sleep, you know, may even sound luxury to some people,

232
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,560
but this is very common. So this is not one of those experiments where you say,

233
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,400
oh, they limited them to two hours of sleep, or they did total deprivation.

234
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,680
And that's not ecologically relevant. This is an ecologically relevant manipulation.

235
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:30,840
This is six hours of sleep. It's very common in society. And it distorts, you know, well over 700

236
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,840
genes relative to when those same individuals are getting eight hours of sleep.

237
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,120
Let's just put that in context. There's only about 20,000 genes in the human genome.

238
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,880
It's not like you said seven genes or it's not like you said 700 in the presence of 2 billion

239
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,240
genes. This is 3%. Right.

240
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,640
You have an epigenetic change in 3% of your genome.

241
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:03,000
And this is with an epigenetic change within seven days at a moderate dose of sleep restriction.

242
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,080
What was also interesting was the direction that about half of those genes were actually up

243
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,600
regulated. The other half were actually down regulated. Those genes that were impaired in

244
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,960
their activity were numerous genes associated with the immune system. Those genes that were

245
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,560
actually up regulated were genes that were associated with tumor promotion, genes that

246
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,920
were associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body, and genes that were associated

247
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:40,040
with stress and as a consequence, cardiovascular disease. And I find that impressive because

248
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,680
many people in society right now feel uncomfortable about the idea of something like genetically

249
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,840
modified embryos or genetically modified food, for example.

250
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,760
Or CRISPR, right?

251
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,000
Or CRISPR. Yeah, especially here as we are in Berkeley, it's relevant. But to me, I think that

252
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,280
if you feel that way, if you feel uncomfortable about GMOs, genetically modified food,

253
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,160
or genetically modified embryos, but you're choosing to get insufficient sleep, and here

254
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:17,960
we're talking about six hours of sleep, then I think you must accept then that you are performing,

255
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,760
firstly, a similar genetic modifying experiment on yourself by reducing your sleep amount. And

256
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,400
secondly, if you don't let your children get the sleep that they need, you may be inflicting

257
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,320
inadvertently a genetic manipulation on them as well.

258
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,160
Did that penis, sorry, see to me, I can say penis without thinking penis, but now I can't.

259
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,560
Did that paper show the reverse? In other words, once you restored sleep, could you undo any of

260
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,760
that genetic damage?

261
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,880
Didn't look at it.

262
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,080
Because I'm going to take the sort of contrarian view here, which is we're all hosed, because

263
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,040
there's not a single person that hasn't been restricted to six hours a night. So it's almost

264
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,000
like we should throw up our hands and wave, which I don't think is the answer.

265
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,480
No, I don't think it is the answer. And I think here's why. Firstly, you know, coming back to this

266
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,040
argument that sleep is not like the bank, you cannot accumulate a debt and then hope to pay

267
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,160
it off at a later point in time. That's why that binging at the weekend doesn't work. So once

268
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,480
you've gone without sleep, whatever has happened during that time when you are underslept doesn't

269
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,000
seem to be reversible. However, that doesn't mean that from this point forward, it's a waste of time

270
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,240
to start sleeping better. And I have evidence for that. We and others have been looking at cognitive

271
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,440
decline in older adults, as we've mentioned before. Now, once the deed looked at a group of individuals

272
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:53,240
who were in mid to later life, and they had sleep apnea snoring, which by the way, is a devastating

273
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,600
condition, if you snore or your partner tells you to snore, please go and see your doctor, get a

274
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:06,120
sleep test and get on sleep apnea treatment. But the point was this, they gave them this CPAP treatment,

275
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,000
which is this sort of face mask to push the airway open so that you don't snore and you don't go

276
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,640
without oxygen. And by way of an experiment of nature, about half of those individuals were

277
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,720
compliant with the treatment, about half of them weren't those individuals who complied to the

278
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,320
treatment and started sleeping better because they had their sleep apnea treated, ended up

279
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:37,560
staving off the onslaught of Alzheimer's disease by about 10 years. So in other words, this is a

280
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:45,720
causal demonstration that if you course correct sleep, you can actually modify your dementia

281
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,200
probability risk. And it tells me in some ways, a message of hope, which is that perhaps it's never

282
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,640
too late to start sleeping better. Because if I've got evidence that in moderate in mid to late life,

283
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,280
that when you start course correcting bad sleep here, it's a sleep disorder with a particular

284
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,920
treatment that can have an observable benefit in terms of reducing your cognitive decline rate.

285
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,560
Although it's hard to know, right? Because the people who are compliant with CPAP presumably

286
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,720
are doing so for reasons that might also make them more compliant with other inputs such as,

287
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,720
you know, nutrition and exercise. That's right. And it could even be, you know, that the sleep

288
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:37,880
is not actually, so maybe the sleep is the influencing factor, but sleep is not the

289
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,680
route through which the benefit comes. It's because you're sleeping that you start to eat

290
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,600
better. And we can speak about that relationship between sleep and food choices and caloric intake.

291
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:56,600
And when you are underslept, you are far less likely to be active and motivated to be physically

292
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,160
active. When you are physically active, the amount of force pressure that you can generate,

293
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,800
the amount of aerobic output that you can generate, the amount that you can resist

294
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,000
physical exhaustion when you're sleeping well, all of those things are improved to your point.

295
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,200
If I recall, it's about a 30% rough. I mean, it's not, it's a non-trivial reduction in

296
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,320
performance with sleep deprivation. Yeah. I take someone healthy person who's physically active

297
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,920
and I limit them to six hours of sleep. You get about a 30% decrease in your time to physical

298
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:35,640
exhaustion. So the idea would be, let's say that you're training for a 10 K and in the days before,

299
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,160
for whatever reason, you're down to six hours of sleep and you've trained to maintain your point

300
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:47,000
of physical exhaustion, you know, to the 10 K level. Well, now just with six hours of sleep,

301
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,600
I'm going to see you fail. It's at seven K because I've had a 30% reduction in your time to physical

302
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,560
exhaustion. But I think your point again is a very good one, which is maybe it's not the sleep

303
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:06,760
directly, it's the sleep transacting. It's benefits that we know also play into decreased risk for

304
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,440
cognitive decline such that you start making better food choices. The amount of caloric intake

305
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,400
that you have is lower. The amount of calories that you expend is higher. Your motivations to be

306
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,520
physically active. And when you are active, you work out more intensely and harder. All of those

307
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:31,720
things we know come by way of a benefit of sleep. So maybe sleep is, you know, the root cause,

308
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,080
but it's not ultimately the thing that may be transacting it. Now, I think knowing the

309
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,280
relationship between sleep loss and Alzheimer's protein pathology that we described, maybe it is

310
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:49,080
playing a part. I don't think we know, but to your point, which is a good one, don't feel as though

311
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,600
if you're someone listening to this and you've been on a diet of five or six hours of sleep for

312
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,440
most of your adult life, that all is lost. And you should just cash in your chips and say, well,

313
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,160
basically my fate is now sealed. It's not, I don't think it's ever too late to start sleeping better.

314
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,760
I honestly don't. I think the argument that it's too late almost fails on first principles when

315
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,160
you just consider virtually every other intervention, right? If you take someone who has diabetes,

316
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,080
type two diabetes, and you dramatically change the way they eat and exercise,

317
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,120
it's quite clear what you can do. If you take someone who smokes, I mean, smoking might even

318
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,920
be a better example because we have such longitudinal data on risk reduction as time

319
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:43,640
of non-smoking increases after a period of smoking. I mean, that's actuarially mapped up

320
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,280
the wazoo and that's a simple enough intervention that you can attribute it to. It's actually a very

321
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,920
similar intervention, right? Because you would argue that in the individuals who stop smoking,

322
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,840
they're more likely to make more positive health decisions for the simple reason that if I'm not

323
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,840
going to smoke, what else am I going to take seriously in my health? And in the end, for the

324
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,880
purist who says, I need a randomized prospective trial to demonstrate this, one, I don't think you

325
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,280
are ever going to get it. And I think the reason is we're really at the point where it's going to

326
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,840
become unethical to do draconian studies of sleep deprivation or I don't even think it would be

327
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,640
ethical to do a longitudinal study of depriving people with apnea of CPAP. I think the evidence

328
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,920
is so overwhelming that yet you're ethically going to be unable to do those things. And it's the same

329
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,040
way with kids in school that I think the only option that we're going to have in terms of proving

330
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:44,440
the importance of sleep for school start times and just health in general for kids is going to be,

331
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,960
you know, elongating their sleep. If you look over the past 50 years, what we found is that

332
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,800
kids across all ages are sleeping about two hours less now than they did 50 years ago,

333
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,040
two hours less. Now to put that in context, if I went to my ethics committee and said, look,

334
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:10,680
I'd like to take a group of seven year olds or six year olds and I'd like to lop off two hours

335
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,960
of their sleep. And I'd like to impose that on them for the next month and study it. Is that okay?

336
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,080
I'd probably be, you know, put on academic probation for even suggesting that, let alone

337
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,600
they would never let me do that. But that's what's happened in society. So I think your point is,

338
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,440
is a great one too, which is we are probably not going to be able to do the sleep restriction

339
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,800
studies increasingly anymore. We're going to have to do, you know, the sleep intervention and the

340
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,400
sleep extension studies, and even some of the sleep intervention studies, ethically, you may not be

341
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,920
able to do it because it's already so clear that you need to be treating the sleep disorder. And,

342
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,360
you know, sleep apnea is a good example there too, that when you treat sleep apnea and you typically

343
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:05,640
see far higher rates of diabetes in people who have untreated sleep apnea. And when you treat them,

344
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:13,160
you see it, their diabetic profile improve markedly, but you also see that they start eating

345
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:20,200
less. Their choices of food are better. They are far more likely to be physically active once again.

346
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,200
So again, I think it's unclear whether it's that direct benefit of sleeping better on things like

347
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,920
the pancreas releasing the right amounts of insulin or the cells in the body being

348
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:39,480
instructed by the insulin to suck in the glucose more, or if it's just higher order things such as

349
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,760
you're sleeping better. So you make better food choices. You are not as hungry anymore. And,

350
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,120
you know, we and others have done these studies where you look at sleep and appetite regulation

351
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,800
and there I think the data is just as causal and powerful as it is for glucose regulation.

352
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,920
What we find is that when you start short sleeping people for five, six hours a night for one week,

353
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,200
the appetite hormones that regulate exactly, you know, that food intake, they're called leptin and

354
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,080
ghrelin. They go in opposite directions in ways that you wish they didn't. So leptin is the hormone

355
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,880
that essentially is the satiety signal. It tells your brain that you are full. You don't need to

356
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,680
eat anymore. You're satisfied with your food. Stop eating. Essentially it's that satiety sort of red

357
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:38,280
flag. Ghrelin is the opposite hormone. It essentially says, no, you're not satisfied with your food.

358
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,320
You want to eat more. It's a hunger signal essentially. So what you find is that when you

359
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,800
are under slept, the leptin, which is saying you're full, don't eat anymore. That signal gets

360
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,120
turned down. So it's not particularly volumous anymore. So your brain loses the signal of I'm

361
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:06,440
full. I'm satisfied. And instead, ghrelin is actually ramped up. So you start to feel

362
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:14,120
unsatisfied by your food and you will eat more. And so on both sides of that hormonal appetite

363
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:24,600
equation, you essentially downgrade this red flag of satiety and you upgrade the signal of hunger,

364
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,000
which then leads to what we've now demonstrated, which is an increase in your caloric intake.

365
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,800
People sleeping six hours a night during the week, they will typically eat about 300 extra

366
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,920
calories during the day, which may not sound very much, but when you add it up week after week,

367
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,440
year after year, it comes to about 70,000 calories. If you look at the actual numbers.

368
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,600
And I think it's even more pronounced than that because, you know, the caloric arithmetic is

369
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,440
complicated because of the compensatory components. But I think anybody, I mean, I do this natural

370
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,200
experiment of doing too much flying across the country and the East to West, which is a very long

371
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,360
day and it's a sleep deprived day. Cause you're used, at least for me, I always want the earliest

372
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,520
flight out to have the most time back. That is unquestionably one of the worst eating days of my

373
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,400
life if I let it be. So one of the tricks I've learned for that day, which I now do very well,

374
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,680
but I had to be very deliberate about it was, so you're going to fly out of JFK at 6 AM,

375
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,960
which means you're waking up at about four and you didn't go to bed at eight. Right? So that sucks.

376
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,960
I go to the airport and I get a really good breakfast, a proper breakfast. Like I eat,

377
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,080
you know, exactly what I would want to eat. I don't eat a single thing on the plane,

378
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:54,760
despite all of the dumb snacks that keep coming your way. And I also manage to exert enough

379
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,040
self-discipline to get on the plane without buying trail mix, which is my absolute airport

380
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,000
kryptonite. But here's the thing. Then, you know, you land in California, it's like 10 o'clock.

381
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:15,160
And what I do is basically have a tiny snack that is also like well scripted. Like I know exactly

382
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,520
what it's going to be. It's like sort of avocado and macadamia nut, highly satiating. And then I

383
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,000
don't eat again until dinner. And then I go to bed really early. So super early dinner, 5 PM,

384
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,200
super early bedtime, eight. And if I do that, it's awesome. But like that requires a lot of work.

385
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,800
It just requires a lot of planning and momentary moments of discipline. But if you don't,

386
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,880
if you just do that on autopilot, which is basically what you would be doing if you were

387
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,200
living that way every day. I mean, I'm amazed at the food choices I want to make. Like I have

388
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,720
literally, if I look back, there were moments when I caught myself eating a pizza in the airport for

389
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,320
breakfast. Like under no circumstance would you do that regularly. And yet like the cravings you

390
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,360
get for the craziest things under these sleep deprived. I mean, any college, any college kid

391
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,160
will know this, right? You're pulling the all nighter. Like you want to eat. Yeah. Right. And so,

392
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,160
you know, imagine someone like you who has the knowledge that they have about sleep and then has

393
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:26,920
this maniacal discipline to be able to fast for long periods of time. And even you with that

394
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,760
arsenal of benefit in place can struggle under the weight of sleep deprivation. No wonder the

395
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:43,160
majority of, you know, as non demigods of control will implode so quickly. You have to see what

396
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,520
Jaco would do under sleep deprived conditions with respect to food. Right. And a gentleman who, by the

397
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,560
way, I have such incredible respect for in many areas. And I would love to have a conversation

398
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,600
and just an honest Frank conversation about sleep with him, but it's someone who, you know, I just,

399
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:08,040
my goodness, what an incredible human being. But to come back to your point about food choices,

400
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,920
it's not just that you overeat when you are under slept, which you do. And if you pull the all nighter,

401
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,760
you will typically eat probably about 450 more calories than when you're well rested.

402
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,680
It's also the profile of food that you eat. And what I mean by that is if you give people,

403
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:35,000
and these are the studies that have been done, essentially an ab lib food buffet were at the

404
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,160
end of the sleep deprivation period or sleep restriction, where you kind of limit them to

405
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,720
four or five hours of sleep for the week. And at the end of that, you give them this food buffet

406
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,120
and you say, eat whatever you want. It's up to you. And there's everything from kind of leafy greens

407
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,880
to, you know, avocados and macadamia nuts, all the way down to Oreos, ice cream, and pizza.

408
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,520
What you find is that not only do you eat more, but you eat more of the things that you should not

409
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:11,720
eat. So people will actually eat more from the heavy hitting carbohydrates, the stodgy carbohydrates,

410
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,920
together with simple sugars. So they'll be going after pizza, cookies, ice cream, and they stay

411
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,960
away from things like protein, as well as, you know, leafy greens. So in other words, it's not

412
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:33,880
just that you eat more, but what you're eating in terms of both micro and macro groups of food

413
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:41,160
is actually also distorted in the wrong direction that you want. So we understand at the hormonal

414
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,160
level, what's causing these changes. We understand that it leads you to overeat in the excess of

415
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,920
probably about 70,000 calories each year, which is about 10 pounds of additional obese mass that

416
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,080
you would put on each year, which for some people may be painfully familiar. But we also know what

417
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,280
happens in your brain. And we did a study where we took a group of people, we limited them, we

418
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,000
restricted their sleep. And then we gave them a full eight hours of sleep, put them in a brain

419
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,360
scanner, showed them a whole bunch of different food images, desirable foods, non-desirable foods.

420
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:21,080
What you find is that when you are under slept, the centers of the brain that keep your hedonic

421
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,760
desires in check, and it's a part of the brain that we call the prefrontal cortex, that part of

422
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,480
the brain was actually taken offline by sleep deprivation. And that led to the more primitive

423
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,440
areas of the brain regions, such as the amygdala, for example, that just erupted in terms of its

424
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,480
hedonic response to desirable foods. So you can see that essentially you're losing impulse control

425
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,480
networks within the brain. Which by the way, brings us right back to the five year old.

426
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,320
It's so obvious when we see the kid that missed his or her nap, especially his nap, it seems.

427
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,360
And look, as adults, maybe we're not going to throw temper tantrums in the grocery store,

428
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,880
but you know what, we're probably a hell of a lot more likely to buy Pringles.

429
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,560
Right. And you can scale this up. We've just described the litany of causal evidence

430
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,640
from circulating hormones to food choices to changes in network brain activity.

431
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:25,160
This idea of sleep leading you on a path towards obesity and diabetes is very clear.

432
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:32,920
Input regulation equation of energy balance. That I think is just unquestionable. But your point is

433
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:39,240
a good one about impulsivity. You know, think about other sectors where impulsivity is probably

434
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:46,120
not great yet sleep deprivation is rife. Military aviation, stock markets. I was speaking to

435
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:52,760
a, another author who lives here in Berkeley called Michael Lewis, was written some fantastic books.

436
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:59,400
And he was describing how rife sleep deprivation is, you know, down on wall street in terms of

437
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:06,520
trading and money markets. I can only imagine the types of poor decisions and deficits that

438
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,760
come by way of your brain shifting into impulsivity when you are underslept. And we're starting to do

439
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,880
some work in those financial market sectors as well with choice and decision. I'd love to at some

440
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,000
point do a survey of sleep in McKinsey and see exactly what the efficacy of insufficient sleep

441
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
is. And there's already work out there. We've done some of these studies and Chris Barnes has done

442
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,120
some of these studies in Washington. If you look at employees who are sleeping six hours or less,

443
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:39,800
the impact is probably fivefold. Firstly, those employees who are underslept will select less

444
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,280
challenging problems. So you give them the experiment where you give them a range of problems

445
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,040
and they just typically will choose listening to voice messages or doing email rather than digging

446
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,760
into hard project work. Secondly, of the problems that they do select, they end up producing fewer

447
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,360
creative solutions to those problems. And that's an issue because it's supposed to be creativity

448
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:08,040
and ingenuity that's driving businesses forward, but you lose that with a lack of sleep. The third

449
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,720
thing that we found is that when underslept employees are actually working in groups,

450
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,840
working in teams, they just slack off and they just let other people work. It's riding the

451
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,400
coattails of other people's hard work. It's called social loafing. It doesn't breed good atmosphere.

452
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,520
The fourth thing that they found was that the less and less sleep that an employee has had,

453
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:34,760
the more and more deviant and unethical they became, which comes back to impulsivity and deep

454
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,520
emotional sort of eruption uncontrolled. So for example, they started to falsify data and

455
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,560
spreadsheets. They started to claim the work of other people, even falsify reimbursement claims.

456
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:52,440
And then the final study, which we didn't do, but it was a great study. This was from Christopher

457
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:59,880
they looked at the sleep of a business leader and then they asked their employees how charismatic

458
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,160
and inspiring was that business leader from one day to the next. And what they found is that the

459
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,400
less sleep that that CEO had had from one night to the next, the less inspiring and charismatic

460
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,520
their employees rated that business leader from one day to the next, even though they knew nothing

461
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:25,240
about the sleep of that leader, it was evidential in their behavior. So here again, we've gone from

462
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:33,240
intracellular networks and the impact we've gone from genes out to changes in food consumption,

463
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:40,760
energy consumption, food choices, changes in brain networks, all the way back up to the workforce.

464
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:47,480
And that last one, by the way, is to me, one of the most interesting, which is when you consider

465
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,880
what that message is, right? Because that's a great blinding in the sense that the employees

466
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,640
have no idea how much sleep they might not even recognize what the purpose of the experiment was.

467
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,200
I'm sure that if the study was done correctly, they were blinded as to even the reason.

468
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,080
That's right.

469
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,280
If something so socially important, because that goes beyond just being the CEO and being

470
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,160
the person that works for the CEO, right? That speaks to a much broader network of communication

471
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,960
and interpersonal skill. You think about that from the standpoint of dating, mating, like all of these

472
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:30,440
other things, parenting. Like I think about, God, what kind of a horrible parent am I when I'm

473
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,280
sleep deprived? Because I mean, I just I can't imagine that I'm doing the same job.

474
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,160
And what's interesting, you know, they're about sort of dating, mating and parenting.

475
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,840
It brings me on to sort of that similar control. One of the interesting things, and this really

476
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:53,000
actually does impact reproductive fitness and reproductive health. It's a great study from

477
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,400
Sweden, a colleague of mine there, and they took some individuals and they gave them a full night

478
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,160
of sleep and they sleep deprived them. And then they took essentially a portrait shot, beauty

479
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:10,040
picture under both conditions. And then they took a group of independent judges who knew nothing

480
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,720
about the sleep that those individuals had got or had not obtained. And they just simply asked

481
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,840
them to rate those pictures, essentially like a beauty contest. How attractive does this person

482
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:27,880
look? How sickly does this person look? And how sleepy does this person look? So these, it's the

483
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,760
same individual just under two different experimental conditions. And the judges in this beauty contest

484
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,920
have no idea what those two images are. They just see the two images. Despite being blind to the

485
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,080
experimental manipulation, you are consistently rated as looking more sickly, looking sleepier,

486
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:53,800
but especially looking less attractive when you have not slept. So there is scientific proof of

487
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:00,440
this thing called beauty sleep. But you know, in truth, it's a real issue regarding, you know,

488
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,720
attractiveness. If you're trying to find a mate or if you've got a mate and you're trying to get

489
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,320
intimacy and move towards reproduction, you're not going to be looking your best when you are

490
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:18,520
underslept in that regard. So I think you, you know, these things consistently keep playing out

491
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,960
under very carefully controlled experimental conditions. You just can't get around it. You

492
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:32,360
know, sleep is, it is a life support system. And I often think of sleep as the Swiss army knife of

493
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:39,480
health, whatever ailment you face, it's more than likely that it's got a tool in its box that's going

494
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:48,040
to help out. And this decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations, I think is having a real

495
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:57,960
demonstrable, and I mean that as in literally a demonstrable impact on our health, our productivity,

496
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:06,440
our safety on the roads and the education of our children. There is, there is truly no aspect of

497
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:16,600
a human beings wellness that we've been able to discover that isn't eroded by a lack of sleep,

498
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,760
lack of sleep. It's almost like a broken water pipe in your home in the sense that it will leak

499
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:27,720
down into every nook and cranny of your physiology. That is actually an elegant way to state what I've

500
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,360
been struggling to wrap my mind around over the past few hours. Taking a step back, we've gone

501
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:41,880
through so many aspects of the pathology of sleep deprivation from what I would consider, we started

502
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:48,120
at a somewhat macro level, which is big chronic diseases that are multifaceted. We went really,

503
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:54,040
really, really micro into something for which we can't even elucidate the mechanism of AKT's

504
00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:01,800
phosphorylation, then brought it out to arguably the most macro, which is suitability for leadership

505
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:10,200
and appearance. I mean, you can't get more macro. And a great analogy is water. I mean,

506
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,560
as anyone who's ever had a leaky roof has known, and I had a leaky roof in residency that tormented

507
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:23,640
me for two years, water will always find a way. And that's, I mean, I sort of picture sleep as if

508
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:30,440
you interrupt this system, it is always going to track into something negative. And sometimes it'll

509
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:37,800
be water gushing through the ceiling. And sometimes it'll be a slow drip that streaks your wall,

510
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:45,160
and you barely know where it's coming from. Yeah. It's been very hard to find something

511
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:52,360
that is resistant. There are a few things in your biology or your psychology that can retreat at the

512
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,720
sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed. I think it goes back to the point you made earlier,

513
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:05,320
Matt, which is it is such a ridiculous proposition to sleep that the fact that it is here,

514
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:13,320
the fact that we spent probably when you consider our origins at the very beginning,

515
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:21,480
call it half a billion years, keeping this strange thing around that on the surface makes no sense.

516
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,320
And we've had no pressure to get rid of it. I mean, that we haven't already resisted,

517
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,320
right? Meaning like all the pressure that would get rid of it that we discussed,

518
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,720
the inability to get food while you're sleeping, the inability to find a mate,

519
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,600
the inability to protect yourself, the inability to care for your children.

520
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:46,120
We resisted all of those things, but it's only in the last 150, 250 years, and really in the

521
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,840
last 40 years that a totally new pressure has come on board that we didn't have anything to prepare

522
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:57,640
for, that it could be so devastating. Whereas starvation, excess food, we've had lots of time

523
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,440
to prepare for that. And again, even though the excess food we have today doesn't look anything

524
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:08,760
like the binging that we would have done years ago, and Rick Johnson has written very eloquently

525
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,720
about some of the genetic changes in fructose metabolism that really saved us and enabled us

526
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,000
to fatten up in the fall when the fruit were sweeter. At least that prepared us a little bit

527
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,320
of what we would do with excess nutrients in this modern era. At least we had a relatively

528
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:34,280
safe place to store excess energy. And we certainly have a safe way to handle not having

529
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,960
energy. I mean, ketosis, starvation, ketosis, if not for that ability, our species wouldn't exist.

530
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,640
So we've got that one pretty covered. For sleep, we just didn't have the chance.

531
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,080
There's just nothing there. And I think part of this now comes

532
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:56,840
to the bleed out of what's happening, which is where people are either so stressed or the

533
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:05,080
diet exercise substance intake is such that they are finding all manner of sleep aids.

534
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:11,640
We know for a fact that 10 million American adults in the past month have swallowed some

535
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,760
kind of a sleep aid. 10 million. I'm actually surprised it's not higher.

536
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,480
Which, well, and that's all that we can get people to admit to. And we know of,

537
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,400
you know, I think there's probably a lot of over the counter things that are, you know,

538
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,120
that wouldn't include necessarily someone taking Benadryl for sleep.

539
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,480
Right. Exactly. Tylenol, whatever. And so, you know, I think this is where we're starting to see,

540
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:43,320
and people have a very, I think complex misunderstanding about what sleep aids actually are.

541
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:49,720
Alcohol is probably the most misunderstood of all of those sleep aids. And it comes back to our

542
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:55,320
discussion about sleeping pills a little bit too, that what I often hear from people is saying,

543
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,360
you know, I'm pretty stressed in the evening. I can't fall asleep. I, when I get into bed,

544
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,760
I'm too awake, perhaps because they're not getting enough darkness or perhaps because of use of

545
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:11,080
caffeine too much, or because of that anxiety. One of the problems with alcohol is that,

546
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,480
well, it does three things to your sleep. Firstly, alcohol, as we sort of mentioned before,

547
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,320
is also a drug that is a sedative. So it works on the same class of receptors that sleeping

548
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:27,480
pills actually does. And when you have a nightcap, what you're doing is again, just sedating your

549
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,560
brain. You're just knocking yourself out. So that's the first thing you think you fall asleep

550
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,680
faster. You don't, you're just losing consciousness quicker. You're not falling asleep quicker.

551
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:43,080
The second thing is that alcohol will fragment your sleep. So you wake up many more times

552
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:49,000
throughout the night. Now, typically they're so brief that you don't remember them, but they have

553
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,080
a measurable impact on your sleep physiology. And as a consequence, your own wellness biology,

554
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,120
the final thing that we've discovered is that alcohol is actually very good at blocking your

555
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:06,120
dream sleep, your rapid eye movement sleep. And so what happens is that you end up waking up the

556
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:12,920
next morning feeling unrefreshed and unrestored by your sleep. And some of the times you may think,

557
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,040
well, I don't remember waking up with the alcohol, so maybe it wasn't the alcohol. I don't know what's

558
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:25,160
going on. But now you start to feel lousy the next morning. You start to feel that you have this kind

559
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,960
of sleep inertia where sleep is still with you and you won't let go of you. So now you start

560
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:36,840
abusing caffeine. Or by its more technical name, adenosine reducing substance. Correct. Yeah,

561
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:44,040
adenosine muting substance. If you are taking caffeine before midday, I think a good question

562
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:50,280
is to ask why, because that naturally should be your peak level of alertness around 11 or 12.

563
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:56,920
I often used to look before on planes now where you can now use your phones on takeoff. Five years

564
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,920
ago, you couldn't do that. And it was a great experiment for me because I get on a flight at

565
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,640
10 o'clock when everyone on that plane, for the most part, depending on their chronotype, they

566
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,880
should be getting into the nice sweet spot of their alertness. They should be wide awake.

567
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,960
And when finally people could not do anything, they weren't allowed to use their phones. They

568
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:23,400
could, they just had to sit with the boredom of taking off. Boredom unmasked their state of

569
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,480
chronic sleep deprivation. And I would look around and half of the plane was fast asleep.

570
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,600
So what then happens with, you know, alcohols that you start using caffeine and caffeine is a problem

571
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:40,040
because everyone knows caffeine, you know, makes you awake. And the way that caffeine works comes

572
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:45,640
back to our discussion of adenosine, which is that adenosine builds up. It's a sleepiness signal.

573
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,480
It's telling your brain, get to sleep, get to sleep the longer, the more that you have.

574
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,880
Caffeine rushes into the brain and it latches on, it hijacks those adenosine receptors,

575
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:01,320
and it just blocks them. So essentially it acts like a remote control for your TV and it just

576
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,000
hits the mute button on the sleepiness signal. So your brain thinks, Oh,

577
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,280
I haven't been awake for 16 hours. Maybe I've only been awake for eight hours because I've just

578
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:18,120
slammed an espresso after dinner. But then the problem with caffeine is that it actually has

579
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:24,600
half life of about six hours. It has a quarter life of 12 hours. So in other words,

580
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,680
if you have a cup of coffee at midday, a quarter of that caffeine is still in your brain at midnight.

581
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,840
So the equivalent would be, you know, getting into bed and before you go to sleep, before you turn

582
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,400
the light out, you swig a quarter of a cup of Starbucks and you hope for a good night of sleep.

583
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:48,520
And it's not going to happen for some people. Other people will tell me, well, you know,

584
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,320
I'm one of those people with caffeine. I can have an espresso after dinner and I fall asleep and I

585
00:58:53,320 --> 00:59:00,600
stay asleep. So no harm, no foul, presumably, isn't that okay? And the danger there, we've done these

586
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,720
studies too, where if you give someone a standard 200 milligram dose of caffeine in the evening,

587
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:13,080
and then you measure their sleep architecture, what you see is about a 20% reduction in deep

588
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:19,080
sleep as a consequence of that caffeine being in the system. To put that in context, to drop your

589
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:27,400
deep sleep by about 20%, I'd have to artificially age you by about 20 to 30 years to get that type

590
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,360
of reduction of a loss of deep sleep. Is this independent of the caffeine metabolism snip

591
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,080
differences that exist? Is everybody equally, like I've always felt like caffeine doesn't

592
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,520
do anything to me. I mean, I love coffee. So I make most days I'll make a coffee in the morning

593
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,760
as a French press more as the ritual. And I just love the taste and the aroma. But when I'm tired,

594
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:56,360
caffeine does not wake me up. And it just seems to have zero impact on me in any way, positive

595
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,080
or negative. And I think that's where we, you know, we don't know, we know that people have

596
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:07,240
different genes that are associated with the enzyme that decomposes caffeine. And that's why

597
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:14,760
some people are very caffeine sensitive or less. Yeah. We actually run this on most of our patients.

598
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:20,440
If you do, yeah, if they've done a 23 and me, you can run it into Prometheus and see that. And

599
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:27,880
truthfully though, Matt, you know, the association isn't as clear as I experience it clinically with

600
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,000
people. I've always kind of been jealous of those people who can use caffeine as a true performance

601
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,120
enhancer. Yeah. But the flip doesn't have that effect. It has no effect on me whatsoever. What

602
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:44,120
we don't know is those people who have those particular gene profiles that may have the

603
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,720
ability to more quickly decompose caffeine, are they the same people who also don't suffer the

604
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,520
same type of deep sleep reduction? I don't think we know. We don't know. And this gets to something

605
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,560
interesting, right? So, you know, going back to the alcohol point, I would add two points. The

606
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:06,680
first is there are a handful of things that my wearing the aura ring for the past three years has

607
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,800
done for me. And I want to disclose that I'm an investor too and an advisor to aura. So please

608
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,640
understand that it's important you know that so that you can take what I'm saying with a grain

609
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:24,360
of salt. But what I'm about to say, every single one of my patients has said, and we buy this ring

610
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:30,520
for every single one of our patients, there is no greater behavioral tool to show you the

611
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:38,280
deleterious effects of alcohol than this ring. I mean, you see the effect and for most people,

612
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:47,960
it is somewhere between zero and two drinks. So in other words, for me, it appears that

613
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:57,560
a single drink four to five hours before bed doesn't appear to have a difference that I can discern

614
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,760
anything beyond that, meaning one drink closer to bed or two drinks, even six hours before bed.

615
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:13,560
My sleep is shot. My resting heart rate will be six to eight beats higher. My heart rate variability

616
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:22,120
is compressed by 20 percent. My respiratory rate is higher by probably two breaths per minute,

617
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:27,720
one to two breaths per minute. My temperature is up by point three to point six degrees Fahrenheit.

618
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:35,560
It is a kick in the groin. On every one of those levels, you know, that's that's exactly what we

619
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:42,040
see in the scientific evidence. You know, you need heart rate to drop. You know, heart rate variability

620
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,840
is, you know, usually far higher with sleep, especially good sleep. The same is true for

621
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,640
the next morning. If you've been getting good sleep, temperature and respiration are critical

622
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:57,160
as well. We know that you need to drop your core body temperature by about two to three degrees

623
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:02,840
Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. And that's the reason that you will always find it easier to fall asleep

624
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,840
in a room that's too cold than too hot, because the cold is at least taking you in the right

625
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:16,120
temperature direction for good sleep. Yet alcohol with this thermogenic profile starts to increase

626
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,800
your core body temperature, which is the exact opposite of what has to happen for good sleep.

627
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,760
So you're going to get more fragmented sleep. You get more awakenings. You disrupt REM sleep.

628
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:33,480
It fits exactly the profile of the scientific data. So, you know, people can take your comments if

629
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,720
they want with a grain of salt should that, you know, invest a thing sort of, you know,

630
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:43,240
but I can tell you here as a sleep scientist that what you're describing is exactly what

631
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,960
you see in the scientific literature. And the reality of it is I think every one of my patients

632
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,520
who at least wears their ring, some of them won't wear the ring for reasons I don't know, but any

633
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:57,080
patient who wears the ring reports the same thing. And it's this, they'll report it on the same four

634
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:04,520
metrics. The second thing I want to point out, which is, um, alcohol inhibits vasopressin.

635
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:10,440
And so anybody who's, who's, who's had something to drink knows you tend to pee a little bit more.

636
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,400
And some people might think, well, you know, the reason you're peeing more is you're just drinking

637
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,200
more, but the reality of it, that's not true. You're peeing disproportionate to the volume you're

638
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:28,120
consuming because ethanol inhibits a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone. So if you inhibit

639
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:35,480
the anti-diuretic hormone, it has a pro-diuretic effect. And so if it, if everything you just said

640
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:43,240
weren't bad enough, now imagine taking a diuretic before bed. I mean, do you really want to make

641
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:51,880
your sleep any worse? I mean, and by the way, I used to be so dumb that I, if I drank before bed,

642
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:59,000
I would actually take vasopressin. I would take 0.2 milligrams of vasopressin to at least not like

643
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,120
make me get up, which of course is, I mean, talk about the most backwards logic in the history of

644
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:09,640
civilization. Or you could just try to be a little bit more sensible with the alcohol. Yeah. Yeah.

645
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,160
It's, it's incredible. The other thing I've noticed is a very high carbohydrate meal and especially a

646
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:20,760
crap carbohydrate meal. So, you know, like high quality carbohydrates don't seem to do this, but

647
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,880
I mean, and it's so funny, I'm admitting all the horrible things I do, but it's good. I think

648
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,120
people need to know just how much of a failure I am. It's just you and me here pizza dough.

649
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:38,200
At least once every few months, like I just cave in and I just, an hour before bed, I just binge

650
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:44,120
eat something stupid as beyond, like a bowl of cereal that like I just can't resist or something.

651
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:52,440
It basically produces the exact same architecture as that drink, as those two drinks. I want to go

652
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:58,440
to another compound that I get asked about a lot and truthfully, I just don't know the data. And

653
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:06,200
that is, well, we'll start with THC and we'll move to CBD. And then the THC touches, I guess you could

654
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,520
think about it through two lenses, right? Which is the developing brain versus the quote unquote

655
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:18,040
developed brain. So let's start with the latter since I think it's more clear in the former that

656
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:23,320
the developing brain probably is not benefiting from THC. So it's probably not even worth asking

657
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:30,600
the question is THC a good sleep aid in a teenager? I think the answer would be clearly no, but you

658
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:40,600
and I, is THC a pro sleep compound? No, I don't think I'd feel comfortable in suggesting that it's

659
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,600
a pro sleep compound. And would you say that independent of strains? I mean, you know,

660
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:49,400
anybody who's experimented these things will tell you, you know, well, sativa may be not,

661
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,960
but indicate, yes. I mean, first thing, I don't think we have enough data to, you know, pinwheel

662
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:02,680
out the different strains and sort of parametrically slice the, the strain pie as it were and ask that.

663
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:09,480
But what I do know from the evidence, firstly, I should say that, you know, acute use of THC

664
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,760
typically has a quote unquote beneficial effect such that it will decrease the amount of time it

665
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,240
takes you to fall asleep. What's called your sleep latency. That's the only thing it impacts is

666
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:25,160
latency. So it reduces the latency and it makes it feel as though, well, and you are essentially

667
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:32,600
more duration. So yeah. So you're falling asleep faster, total duration, not so much. But what is

668
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:39,400
happening, however, unfortunately, is that that THC, just like alcohol has been shown to be a

669
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:46,920
very robust blocker of your dream sleep of your REM sleep. Add that to the fact that with chronic

670
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:54,680
use of THC, you build up a tolerance to the benefit on falling asleep faster so that now you

671
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:02,360
actually have to start using more of the compound to get the same reduction in sleep onset time

672
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,360
means that that tolerance and dependency, I don't think is necessarily a good thing.

673
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:16,200
When you then cease the use of THC, what you find in the studies is a pretty horrific

674
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:24,200
insomnia rebound where people then actually have miserable sleep. And it usually typically leads to

675
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,320
then falling off the bandwagon of abstinence, if that's their goal and people then to start

676
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:35,320
having to use again to gain back that crutch that you may not necessarily have needed otherwise.

677
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:44,360
So I think the, the evidence right now, especially with the REM sleep blocking effect of THC and the

678
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:51,000
importance of REM sleep that we know of, I just don't feel comfortable in thinking that THC itself

679
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,200
is really the sleep aid of the future and that there is more evidence on the THC side.

680
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:05,560
CBD is starting to gain more research traction. I don't think there's enough studies done. I think

681
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:12,360
part of the reason with CBD is and THC is just, it's hard to do these studies because they're hard

682
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:19,320
to get funded because of still some of the moral and now I am not, again, I'm not puritanical about

683
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:24,680
this. I'm not casting any judgment at all. And I've often thought, well, you know, what would it

684
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:31,000
take? Maybe, you know, I should do like a Kickstarter and try and crowdsource enough money

685
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,640
to do the appropriate CBD studies. Cause I think CBD is more promising on the data right now.

686
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,840
The data for CBD is that you get that benefit of falling asleep faster.

687
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:46,840
By the way, would you just to interject for a second, would you be able to get an IRB approval

688
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:54,040
to do a real world study where a bunch of people were just using wearables and you could homogenize

689
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,000
and uniform the wearable and the CBD and things like that, but without having to do it as an

690
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,920
in-house sleep study, do you think the wearables are good enough that you could get enough data

691
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,360
in the community? I would probably do a hybrid. I mean, no, that makes sense. The irony of,

692
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,320
it's of THC and CBD often being used as hybrids is not lost on me, but I would probably do a hybrid

693
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:21,800
where I would do some tracking of sleep ecologically in the, in the home setting as it were,

694
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,720
and then have a couple of nights where they would actually come in and we would measure their high

695
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:31,080
grade sleep quality because the trackers out there right now, you know, they're just not quite

696
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,960
accurate. They're not clinical grade enough for me to understand the quality in the stages of your

697
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:40,840
sleep. I think trackers are not bad right now. And, but even those metrics, you'd get a clue,

698
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,400
right? Like even with the ethanol somewhat of a clue, you can see it. I think, you know, people

699
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,720
often ask me what's the best sleep tracker. And I would say it's the sleep tracker that you wear

700
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:55,000
every night. You know, I think most of them are much of a muchness in terms of their current

701
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,280
inaccuracy. So I would do a hybrid study probably where I would do some tracking outside with

702
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:05,880
things like wristwatches or rings. And then I would do some in-laboratory studies, but I think

703
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,240
for CBD, things are actually looking more promising. CBD does give you that same benefit.

704
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,920
You fall asleep faster. You don't seem to get the hit on REM sleep. Now I don't think there's

705
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:23,480
enough studies for me to yet feel comfortable in saying definitively you don't, but for the small

706
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:30,920
handful of non placebo controlled trials for whatever it's worth. And we are talking about

707
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:37,160
hands up here, everyone, no recommendations, no promissorial notes. This is just very early

708
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,840
tentative preliminary evidence suggests that you may not get the REM sleep deficit, which is good.

709
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:50,680
The other thing is that you typically don't see the dependency issues, nor do you get the

710
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:59,080
insomnia rebound when you stop using CBD. And the final thing I think that's interesting with CBD

711
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:04,520
is that it may actually have some benefits in certain sleep disorders. There's some as the

712
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,640
little bit of evidence that it may reduce the severity of sleep apnea, but I think that that's

713
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:17,160
just, you know, one or two studies. There's some benefit that's happening in PTSD with CBD treatment

714
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:24,200
to help with PTSD sleep problems. And sleep problems are real problematic issues with PTSD

715
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:29,400
patients. So I think anything there that could be of help as long as it's medically safe and

716
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:36,440
doesn't compromise your sleep, unlike THC would be a good thing too. Probably two caveats or at

717
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:43,400
least one caveat. It does seem to be somewhat dose dependent. I don't think it's very clear right now

718
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,040
what the optimal dose is. There have been some times where people have actually suggested that

719
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:54,840
the use of CBD at a certain dose is actually wake promoting rather than sleep promoting. So I think

720
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:01,000
there may actually be this U-shaped function when it comes to CBD that what, or some kind of a

721
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,200
function, I don't know what the function is going to be, but there's going to be perhaps a sweet

722
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:13,160
spot of a dose concentration that is optimal for CBD's benefit on sleep. And there may be other

723
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:19,640
doses that are actually detrimental to sleep and we need to stay away from them. How is CBD

724
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,680
doing that and having that kind of benefit of sleep? There was actually even some evidence that

725
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,320
it may actually increase the amount of deep sleep, which was interesting. And that was just one

726
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:35,160
single study, small study again, I'm not believing it. I'm not going to go out there and start telling

727
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,840
people to take CBD on the basis of that single study. I am saying that I think it's got promise

728
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:46,920
right now, but we don't know. How could it be doing that? Well, one of the interesting things

729
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,040
could actually be thermoregulation. In some of those studies, they were actually finding that

730
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:58,680
the core body temperature decreased with CBD administration. And we were just describing that

731
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:04,040
when you drop core body temperature, you sleep better. When you increase core body temperature

732
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:10,600
by way of something thermogenic like alcohol, or it's just a hot room or a big meal, that

733
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:15,640
increasing core body temperature is worse for sleep. So CBD may actually be having its

734
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:22,440
mechanistic benefit through the thermoregulatory system is one of my hypotheses. The other is that

735
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:28,360
it's indirect through its anxiolytic benefits. I think probably the greatest strongest evidence

736
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:35,320
out there right now for CBD's clinical efficacy is for anxiety. And I actually think, and I've

737
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,560
tried to read as much of that data as I can, I think it's actually pretty interesting.

738
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,200
I think one of the major causes of insufficient sleep and poor sleep right now is that everyone

739
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:52,040
is just cranked in terms of anxiety and that they wake up or, you know, we are constantly on

740
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:57,960
reception in this modern day of life. And the only time that our brain goes from reception to

741
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:03,640
reflection is when our head hits the pillow. And that's the last time that you need to be

742
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:10,280
ruminating and catastrophizing and having that Rolodex of anxiety. So I think if CBD

743
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:18,040
is efficacious for lowering anxiety and anxiety is one of the causes of poor sleep in society,

744
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:23,720
then part of that benefit may not be through a direct mechanism on sleep regulating centers,

745
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:31,400
but instead a secondary benefit of lowering anxiety, which perhaps lowers that sympathetic

746
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,440
fight or flight branch of the nervous system, which means that you shift into a more parasympathetic

747
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:43,160
state and, or it drops core body temperature. Both of those routes, I think are in my mind,

748
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:48,520
the tenable hypotheses that in, you know, a crowdsource study that I would want to do.

749
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,880
And I don't know if people want to do that study, you know, comments in wherever comments can be.

750
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:59,400
I would, I'll speak for myself. I would love to see that study because anecdotally,

751
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:08,760
not so much in myself, but I also think I'm, I sleep reasonably well, but in people who don't

752
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,920
sleep that well, I have anecdotally seen some pretty impressive results with CBD.

753
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,040
And other times I've seen nothing. And what's interesting is in some of the people in whom I've

754
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:25,800
seen impressive results, it's people who have been largely recalcitrant to other big guns.

755
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,600
Again, I think whenever you can sleep without pharmacology, you're doing a good thing.

756
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:37,160
But when you look at things like trazodone, thorazine, with their anti-ruminative properties,

757
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:43,640
and you see patients who even at 25 and 50 milligrams, doesn't matter. That's right.

758
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,040
You know, doesn't, it's not helping them sleep. And yet, you know, CBD does.

759
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,320
And at that point you start to think, well, it's less likely to be the placebo effect because

760
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:57,720
you've tried all of these other things that didn't work. Why would this silly little oil work?

761
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,440
And, you know, I'll share a sort of unrelated story that speaks to this role of anxiety,

762
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:08,120
because this kind of brings it back to this idea of mental health that I think is such an important

763
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:14,920
part of longevity. I have a patient whose sleep has really eroded in ways that I can't even imagine.

764
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,360
And it's been quite devastating to watch. And this is an individual who's done everything

765
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:26,440
that you would ask someone to do, right? This means you control the room temperature,

766
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:31,240
you control the light, you control the nutrients, you eliminate the alcohol, you eliminate the

767
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:37,320
caffeine, an hour of meditation a day. I mean, this is everything, but, you know, this person's

768
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:43,000
in the midst of a very difficult personal struggle. And that's, so by the time you're at, you know,

769
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,680
50 milligrams of thorazine to just try to shut off the ruminative properties,

770
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:56,360
and you would get some intermittent benefit, but not long-term. So in the end, what he was able to

771
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:03,560
do was enter into a clinical setting under which he was able to therapeutically utilize MDMA

772
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:10,040
to deal with some of the issues that were predisposing. And again, I want to be very

773
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:15,480
clear what I'm saying here. I'm not saying he went to a party and did ecstasy, right? To the listener.

774
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:23,400
This is a clinical administration with a therapist of MDMA to address the underlying

775
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:34,360
trauma and anxiety and depression of the situation the next day and for months to follow. And we're

776
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:39,480
still at that standpoint, his sleep is fixed. Now, I think that is an outlier situation,

777
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:46,920
but sometimes these outlier situations provide an insight into a mechanism. And I think in this

778
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:53,080
person's individual, because we had already fixed all of the sleep hygiene metrics, I mean, we had

779
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:58,840
literally done everything in our toolkit. And that's a toolkit that has about 10 tools in it.

780
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:05,000
To see this one thing, this one intervention work, and, you know, the patient would describe this as

781
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
a transformational life experience was just another example of the power of the mind and how

782
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,600
the mind can sort of get in its own way at times. And the power of the mind in terms of it,

783
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:24,280
essentially deconstructing this thing called a full night of sleep is, I think, so critical.

784
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:33,160
And more and more now we are seeing that the causes of sleep difficulties and sleep problems

785
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:40,440
are shifting from, you know, typical biological problems to increasingly psychological problems.

786
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:50,120
I think that rise in anxiety has walked in lockstep with a rise in insomnia. And I think we've got

787
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:55,320
enough evidence to suggest that those two are probably not coincidental, but are significantly

788
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:01,160
interrelated is probably the strongest thing I could say right now. So it doesn't surprise me

789
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:09,800
that if you have something that essentially is, you know, a mental health reset on your

790
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:18,040
wifi router in a demonstrable, you know, in a marked way that could lead to essentially the

791
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:23,640
same type of reset in that physiological thing called sleep, it doesn't surprise me, you know,

792
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:29,000
whether or not, you know, that is the treatment for everyone, you know, is, and you are very clear

793
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,920
about that. And I enjoy that, but it doesn't surprise me that if you fix mental health, you

794
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:40,760
fix, and we've seen this by direction. We do a lot of work on sleep and mental health, and it's very

795
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,840
clear that I can take people who don't have any problems with mental health, depression, poor mood,

796
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:53,960
anxiety, suicidality. And when you sleep deprive them, you can instigate many of those conditions.

797
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:59,720
In fact, I can within one single night of sleep loss, I can put someone who is non clinically

798
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:06,120
anxious to a level of anxiety where they would have a clinical anxiety disorder diagnosis.

799
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:12,280
That's how quickly it can happen. So yes, sleep can impact your mental health. And what's

800
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:19,240
interesting is that psychiatry in the past 25 years, I have not been able to discover a single

801
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:28,280
psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal, which to me was quite profound when we added it up

802
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:36,840
that I can manipulate sleep in mentally well people, and then produce by way of the excising of

803
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:44,840
sleep, mental ill health tells me that there is a causal direction from insufficient sleep to poor

804
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:50,520
mental health. That sleep is essentially emotional first aid in that regard. However,

805
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:56,520
don't mistake that for the fact that it's a two way street as well. And I think what you're

806
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:04,280
describing here is a state of mental ill health. And when you course correct that mental ill health,

807
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:12,040
you then correct the sleep. And so I think the relationship between sleep and mental health is

808
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:18,920
bi directional. I think is it's a two way street is the traffic flowing more in one direction than

809
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:25,400
the other, perhaps, and perhaps psychiatry has had it wrong for the past 50 years, they used to think

810
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:30,920
that the poor sleep and their patients that they knew about long before we published, you know,

811
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:37,480
scientific data, that was a symptom of the disorder, rather than considering it a potential

812
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:45,800
predisposing cause of the disorder. So I think psychiatry is starting to undergo a revolution

813
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,880
when it comes to sleep, and understanding how fundamental sleep is to the maintenance of good

814
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:57,720
mental health. I think it's I think it's the bedrock of it. You can stack up the different

815
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:02,760
physiological body systems and the different operations of the mind. But I would put mental

816
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:09,720
health pretty high up there in terms of one of the things that falls apart quickest. And the

817
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:15,560
reason I can say that is because essentially, we start with these sleep deprivation studies,

818
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,160
and we can just keep sampling the organism, which is the patient, the individual, you know, every

819
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:27,800
hour. And we can just look to see the further you go into sleep deprivation, what is the trajectory

820
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:35,640
of impairment in brain and body systems. And some, you know, come on tap later in the sleep deprivation,

821
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:41,400
others very, very quickly. Essentially, what we're trying to ask is what is the recycle rate of a

822
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:47,720
human being? And after about 16 hours of wakefulness, things start to go wrong. And the things that

823
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:53,960
start to go wrong, soonest and perhaps most severely, one of those things certainly is your

824
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,800
mental health, anxiety being one of the mood being the other, depression.

825
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,880
It's interesting, right? How long it can take for certain things to to ravage the brain,

826
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:07,320
neurodegenerative disease that manifests clinically in dementia. And yet how quickly

827
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:13,640
certain elements of the brain will demonstrate the limitation, memory consolidation, and anxiety,

828
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:18,280
as two examples. You're in your sabbatical year, correct?

829
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:24,520
I am. I'm finishing it up right now. Yeah. So what else are you doing with your time,

830
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,440
besides being incredibly generous and sitting here with me?

831
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:36,840
So I still, even though I don't teach, I still am here at the sleep center. I'm the director of

832
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:43,320
the center for human sleep science here at Berkeley. And we continue to do all of our research. So I'm

833
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:49,880
still, you know, directing the center, I'm writing grants. I've been doing a lot of public advocacy,

834
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:54,840
I've been doing a lot of public speaking now that the book has come out and I'm doing sort of

835
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:01,960
television media. I've also got a couple of startup companies that are emerging. One of them has just

836
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:07,160
gone public. It's a brain stimulation company. This comes from work that's out there in the

837
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:12,520
literature showing that if you can try to essentially electrically sing in time with

838
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:17,480
deep sleep brainwaves, you can boost the amplitude and the size of those deep sleep brainwaves.

839
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:22,120
We're hoping to try and transfer that same technology into older adults and those with

840
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:29,720
dementia. Can we salvage some aspects of their learning and memory by way of boosting back their

841
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:34,920
deep sleep? That's one of those. Can you say how the device works? Is it a device that sits in the

842
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:40,040
room? No, it's actually a device that you place on your head. So it actually measures the waves.

843
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:46,440
It both measures the waves and then it inserts electrical voltage into the brain. And essentially

844
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:52,520
what we're trying to do is measure when you're having those sleeping brainwaves and almost act

845
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,760
like a choir to a flagging lead vocalist, that you're trying to sing in time with the electrical

846
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,840
stimulation of the deep sleep of older adults, which is diminished by 50 to 80%. But giving them

847
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:12,280
an electrical stimulation to try and every time they have a deep slow wave, boost the size of that

848
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:18,360
slow wave. And in doing so, try to almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from

849
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,520
sleep because that's what we've already been able to demonstrate in young healthy adults.

850
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,760
So that's one of the companies. What's that company called? It's called Stym Science. And that's

851
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,960
together with a set of co-founders that we just recently got seed funding for from Coastal

852
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:40,280
Adventures. Then I'm starting to think about writing a second book and unclear exactly what

853
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,320
it will be. I think there's probably three candidates right now. The other thing that we're

854
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:51,000
trying to do as well though, is raise funds for the sleep center. We've just moved to this beautiful

855
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,200
new building that we're in with the new sleep center. So we're trying to raise philanthropic

856
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:02,360
funds because, and I think you've done this wonderfully and you've done work with Gary Tubbs

857
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:09,960
to try and create this vision for how you can fund science in ways that typical funding

858
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:16,120
mechanisms will never do. And that's what we need at my sleep center is that we need

859
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:22,440
philanthropic support. And there is now currently through the university, they've granted the

860
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,960
ability to name the sleep center for a philanthropic donation. So I'm now just trying to move that

861
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:33,800
work out. So I guess this is a shameless plug that should anyone out there wish to have a legacy

862
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:39,320
name to name the center that is there. But just to give you a sense of some of these studies,

863
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:45,320
one of these other studies that I'm fascinated by in our elderly cohorts, it's not just the deficit

864
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:52,360
in deep sleep that happens as you age, which it does. There is also this strange cluster of outliers

865
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:57,960
of people in their seventies and eighties that when I put their data of sleep and deep sleep

866
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:03,880
plotted against all of the young healthy adults that we've studied, some of those older adults

867
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:11,800
seem to be incredibly resistant to age related sleep decline. Why? No one is willing to kind of

868
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:17,000
give me the money to do the studies, which is the inverse, you know, it's easier to get money to

869
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,320
explore when things go wrong, but you can get insights into those critical questions

870
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:30,680
by looking at also when things go anomalously right. And a good example of this is the Blue Zones,

871
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,480
you know, this work that was done starting by National Geographic, where they looked at

872
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:40,120
longevity, and they found that there were these pockets throughout the world where people seem

873
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:46,680
to live longer. Now, I think some of the data there is controversial, but it was a good idea

874
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:50,120
that you could look, is there something about their social fabric? Is there something about

875
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:57,880
their diet, their exercise that no one in terms of these Blue Zones has asked the fundamental

876
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:04,840
question about sleep? Why? You know, that's going to be fiendishly difficult for me to get funding

877
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,800
for. So one of the things that I'm trying to do right now is raise money for the sleep center

878
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:17,320
to do what would be otherwise impossible fundamental research to make critical discoveries

879
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:23,880
on the flip side of where I think we can make real inroads into understanding sleep,

880
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:28,680
which are usually typically very difficult to get funded. These are kind of more blue sky research

881
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:34,760
questions, but could make real impacts. But sorry, I interrupt. Where does sleep reside within NIH?

882
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:42,280
Which of the 17? It resides in most of those branches. You know, it resides in the National

883
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:48,280
Institute of Aging. It's there for neurology. It's there for cardiovascular disease. It's there for

884
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:56,920
metabolism, glucose, and it's there for NIDA, which is the Institute for Drug Abuse. So it's

885
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:02,680
prevalent in all of them, but I would say that. But paradoxically, it doesn't have its own institute.

886
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:10,840
Which it seems like it ought to. Well, if you were to think that exercise, nutrition, and sleep

887
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,880
are the three fundamental ingredients that as best we can tell from the science that we've done as

888
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:22,600
a human species keeps us alive and longer living and living longer well. And yet those things all

889
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:28,760
spread across the entities as opposed to stand in their own, which there's benefit to that. You

890
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:33,160
would argue they shouldn't be siloed. They should be studied. But of course, you could almost argue

891
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:39,960
for a matrix as opposed to. Yeah, what you really want is horizontals and verticals. And when you put

892
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:44,120
those together, we create the matrix that you've just described. So I would say, you know, I think

893
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:50,120
NIH has done has definitely supported a huge amount of sleep research and they support some

894
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,240
the research or some of the research that we do here at the sleep center. And I'm incredibly

895
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:01,160
grateful and very fortunate to have those grants. They're very hard to come by, but there's also,

896
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:05,640
I keep running into these fundamental questions that when I write these grants,

897
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:11,160
they're difficult to get money for. And I understand why because you've got government

898
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:18,440
policies, you've got particular institutional mandates that you have to fill. They're just not

899
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,920
going to fund these, these research programs. So that's another thing that I'm doing is trying to

900
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:29,480
raise money for the sleep center, then with the startup companies, and then also just doing our

901
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:35,080
fundamental basic science. Now, are you formally involved with Google in some way as well? I've

902
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:40,440
seen some of your talks there, but I, do you work with Verily? Do you work with Google? Yeah, so I do.

903
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,080
So right now I'm also a scientific advisor for Verily, which is formerly known as Google life

904
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:52,920
sciences. So I do help Verily to try and help shape their mission of sleep. And, you know,

905
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:59,080
I've also been a consultant for many of the other large tech companies out there and many of the

906
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:05,560
fitness trackers as well. But right now, yeah, I do also do some time at Verily to try and help

907
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:12,360
with many of their exciting visions regarding how you could use the resources of a big technology

908
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:18,360
company like Alphabet to try and do things differently than the way that the government

909
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:22,920
does health. I think we'll need both of those forces and both those forces will be for good,

910
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:30,920
but it's a wonderful place to be. You've got incredible people there. And the way in which

911
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:37,720
they see problems is different. The time course over which they want to solve those problems

912
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:43,560
is different. And the solutions and the expertise that they bring to those health problems are

913
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:49,960
different. So when I got the chance to work at Google life sciences there, or essentially be an

914
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,360
advisor there, you know, I jumped at the chance. It was, it was great to try and help shape that mission.

915
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:01,880
You know, Matt, I had a list of probably five pages worth of things that I wanted to discuss

916
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:06,600
with you. And we covered many of them, but I would say we covered half of them truthfully.

917
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:11,000
And I think the only, the only solution is we, we probably have to sit down again

918
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,400
sooner rather than later. And amazingly, we were pretty good about not getting into cars,

919
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:23,080
which is, I mean, like we could have spent this entire time talking about formula one.

920
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,880
Maybe that's the second half of the second conversation. Should people not generally

921
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:32,760
lose the will to live when they hear my voice for, you know, several hours, which is what most

922
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:39,640
people do, unfortunately, but I would be so thrilled to come back at any time you would wish

923
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:46,760
me to. And same for the audience. And if that second time did involve a little discussion of

924
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:53,800
all things cars and car racing, including formula one, it is one of the few things, you know, I,

925
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:59,080
I've never been a big fan of alcohol, not because I'm down or against it. It's, I've never really

926
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:03,960
liked the taste. So I typically don't drink. I'm caffeine free just cause I'm one of those

927
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:09,880
people who's sensitive to caffeine. But the one vice that I have, my biggest weakness

928
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:17,160
is cars, car racing. Oh, it's, it's, it's a wonderfully terrible affliction. I adore

929
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:23,800
all things automotive. The next time we do this, let's do it in San Diego. So we can sit in the

930
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:29,080
simulator and I don't know, maybe just do a hundred laps of Coda or something like that.

931
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:36,760
Yeah. It's, it's a, that would be such a gift that really would be, I'll take you up on that.

932
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:40,920
You know, it's possible that by the time this comes out, we'll already know the answer to this

933
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:48,360
question, but given where we are right now, which is in late February, what is your take on this

934
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:54,120
year's season? I mean, early testing looks really good for Ferrari. Looks like that front wing is

935
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:59,960
giving Mercedes a little bit of difficulty. Yeah, they struggled with me. If you had to predict

936
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:07,640
one, two, and three this year in both constructor and driver, how would you handicap it now? And

937
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:13,000
these are impossible questions to be known, to be clear. Yeah. I don't know about driver. I think

938
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:20,600
I'm going to put Ferrari one and three, Mercedes two. And I think I feel like.

939
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,280
So the huge question then is Vettel Leclerc, I mean, where are you going on one and three?

940
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:28,760
Okay. If you're going to push me, I would say Vettel one. And I think Hamilton, you know,

941
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:35,560
obviously is going to probably be number two, the Mercedes. That's my suggestion. Or I would at

942
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:40,680
least say that that's going to be the first half of the season. You know, Mercedes as a team,

943
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:47,080
technologically, they are fantastic too. And I think that they could rebound, you know, if this

944
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:51,720
first or all the data I've seen is just the one set of testing data that, you know, you and I have

945
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:57,720
both seen here and now in February. And it looks like Mercedes has got a rip roaringly hot car on

946
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:03,800
their hands. But I think Mercedes is in Ferrari. Sorry, Ferrari. Yeah. Sorry, sorry, Ferrari. I

947
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,600
think Mercedes is capable technically though, of coming back in the second half of the season

948
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,480
to make sure that that car performs. So they've got a good chance and Hamilton with the skill

949
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:19,640
that he has, I think may be able to hang in there until that technology and the engineers come good.

950
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:27,240
I would also just love as a British man to see McLaren do a little bit better. I love them as

951
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:32,840
a car brand. I've never had the opportunity to, to be in one of their cars. I've only had the chance

952
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:39,000
to look at them. And usually that means that I become a even more incoherent human being. And

953
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,600
then I dribble and want to typically tend to lick the car. Just to be honest.

954
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,880
If you had to have as a daily driver, so cost doesn't matter, but it's got to be the car you

955
01:36:49,880 --> 01:37:00,120
drive. You'd take a 720 or a P1. I think the P1, just the rattle alone that, that happens on that

956
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:05,160
carbon monocoque with driving around would probably prevent it from being a daily driver.

957
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:05,640
For sure.

958
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:11,640
Would I like to have the uptown problem of having a P1 as my daily driver? Absolutely I would,

959
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:18,120
but I think 720S I could live with every day. You know, I look, I could go with any one of their

960
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:22,760
models, you know, put me in any one of the five series that they've come out. I would adore to

961
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:28,360
that. It may actually be a more relaxing car, but I'd love to see, well, firstly, I'd love to see

962
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:34,600
myself in a McLaren, but what I was about to say was I'd love to see McLaren doing a little bit

963
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:40,840
better. And I've got a soft spot for Bruce McLaren and what he did for the automotive industry and

964
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,440
his philosophy and mentality.

965
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:49,800
It was a remarkable era of driving and he died relatively soon after Clark, right?

966
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,400
He did, unfortunately.

967
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,480
Very shortly after Jim Clark died.

968
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,600
Yep, that's right.

969
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:59,800
I mean, that was the era where the exception and not the rule that you retired.

970
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:06,360
Yeah. And, you know, it's that and then plus my similar obsession that you have with

971
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:11,880
Ian Senna and the history that he had with McLaren too. Of course, he then transitioned to

972
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:19,000
Williams later, but there was something special about that time where he was with McLaren that

973
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:27,240
makes me just want to see McLaren do better too. If you look at McLaren's rise in just road cars

974
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:34,840
and what they've done, they have scaled more quickly in terms of incredible technology

975
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:41,880
and competing with the likes of Ferrari and Porsche within such a short time period.

976
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:48,840
And I think Ron Dennis, who is the mastermind behind McLaren in that regard, is just a man of

977
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:55,640
genius. And so, you know, they came out with the 12 C and there was a lot of discussion that it was

978
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:02,440
it didn't have the heart of a Ferrari and GT3 or GT3. You know, it didn't have the

979
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:09,480
emotional temperament that would excite you that it was perhaps somewhat of a clinical car.

980
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:15,560
And I think they've been better at increasingly increasing the emotionality into their cars.

981
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:23,160
But I also think that part of them is resistant to that idea of necessarily the emotionality,

982
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:30,040
but just the precision and performance that you can get from those cars and the doing

983
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:35,960
emotionality better. But in terms of precision and performance, I don't know if anyone touches

984
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,680
them right now in terms of their evolution. I have not driven a McLaren that I've never

985
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,720
driven one and I have friends who have them and they've said, you know, you're welcome to come

986
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,400
into it. I just haven't, I don't know why I haven't done it, but I've driven lots of Ferraris.

987
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:53,000
I've driven lots of Porsches. I've driven lots of these other cars. And it's everything you say

988
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,600
has been reiterated to me by the McLaren drivers who themselves have driven all of these other cars.

989
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:04,120
So just my curiosity is equally piqued and I'm a bit ashamed to say, I don't know why I haven't

990
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,640
just taken someone up on the offer to do this. Please do. And then can you write me

991
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:14,680
a long email so that I can live vicariously through the gift that was given to you.

992
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:20,280
We will figure out a way to do it together now. So one more question before we figure out something

993
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:30,280
else to do. The 1988 McLaren versus the 1993 Williams, which again, you don't compare them car

994
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:35,800
to car, totally different technology, but you could make an argument. Those were the two most

995
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:43,640
dominant cars in formula one. I'm guessing your heart is with the MP4,4, but what do you think

996
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:47,880
about that 93 Williams? I mean, that's a car that doesn't get as much attention as I think it

997
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:56,440
deserved. I mean, it was so technologically advanced. Some have argued it is to this day,

998
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:01,240
the most technologically advanced formula one car. If you look at some of the shots where,

999
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:07,560
they've got different computers plugged into it, and they're always making musical symphonies with

1000
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:15,400
the engine and the suspension, the chassis, the dynamics of damping. It was just next level. It

1001
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:21,320
was kind of almost this step function that we'd been going along with race cars and we've been

1002
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:27,800
having beautiful evolution. And then all of a sudden revolution came along with that car.

1003
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:34,040
So I would actually go for the Williams. And again, this probably goes against my McLaren

1004
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:44,360
bent, but it was just such an exercise in engineering passion that lent itself to this

1005
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:51,880
clear night and day, almost next day benefit. And obviously Prost won that year. Was Hill

1006
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:57,480
the other driver? I believe he was. Yeah, because Mansell was driving,

1007
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:02,360
at that time, well, yeah, I just don't know. Yeah, Mansell was with Williams the year before.

1008
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:06,840
He won in 92 in that Williams. Yeah. It's just such an amazing.

1009
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:14,040
Great era. I mean, I love watching now and there's still competition that's relevant there and

1010
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:21,320
there's still, I think there's lots of good colorful characters, but I just can't help

1011
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:26,760
thinking that there's, there was these eras during formula one, you know, even back in the

1012
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:34,120
days of, you know, James Hunt, for example, who I just adored that kind of just fly by the seat of

1013
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:39,720
pants, you know, he was also in a McLaren, also in a McLaren too. And then, you know, there was this

1014
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:46,120
lovely kind of passing of that chalice from him to Iert and Senna. And I think it was happening

1015
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:54,360
when he was commenting, maybe it was with Murray Walker, when Senna was finishing up his last race

1016
01:42:54,920 --> 01:43:02,280
in the season when he was with the John Player car, you know, that beautiful kind of black and gold.

1017
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:02,920
Yeah, the Lotus.

1018
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:08,760
Sort of the Lotus. Yeah, sorry, the Lotus. Yeah, with that. And, you know, you could just hear the

1019
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:15,720
excitement in Hunt's voice as to what this young potential prospect called Iert and Senna

1020
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:21,640
could possibly be. And for me, it was just this lovely kind of, you know, generational shift from

1021
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:28,680
one driver to the next. It was a driver who knew how to spot talent and to see that, you know, talent.

1022
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:36,680
And you could hear in the emotionality of James Hunt's voice, that type of affirmation that you

1023
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:42,200
will next be one of the great, and I read all of that, you know, I think it's probably nonsense,

1024
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:47,480
but for me, that was beautiful too. But there's been great eras, you know, the Hunt and then

1025
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:52,680
Iert and Senna and now it's just different. But I still watch and I still love it.

1026
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,280
And I think with four wheels.

1027
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:59,000
Yeah, it's sort of funny. Like, I mean, truthfully, we can all sit here and poopoo the sound of the

1028
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,640
engines today and stuff. But the reality of it is when you hear them, it doesn't matter. It's still

1029
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:09,320
Pavlovian. I mean, it's, you just can't stop drooling. They're such beautiful machines.

1030
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:14,680
Yeah. And if you just hear them at full chat coming down a straight and it goes past you

1031
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:21,000
and you've got any small modicum of gasoline that runs in your veins,

1032
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,880
the hairs on your back of the neck will stand up, you know, and you'll say, yeah,

1033
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,320
I was wrong about it all going away in this modern era. Truly not.

1034
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,400
Well, we'll see what happens this year. But I think you're right. I think it's going to be

1035
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:41,000
really competitive. I think despite the challenges Mercedes have had, you can't count them out.

1036
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,960
They're just so damn good. And dominant.

1037
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:51,080
Yeah. And of course, Lewis is incredible. So I'm not actually a huge Ferrari fan as the team,

1038
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,240
but I like Vettel a lot. Yeah.

1039
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,720
I think the culture of Ferrari is broken. I think that's actually become quite public in the past

1040
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:02,760
year. I think it's a lot of people have made that pretty clear that it's sort of a toxic culture and

1041
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,600
it's a stark difference to see how those two garages operate.

1042
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:11,720
Just as a fan, if you're there and you can sort of see what's happening, it's a stark difference.

1043
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:16,440
So anyway, it should be fun. Talk about another sport where like all sports,

1044
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:20,360
sleep really matters. I mean, I can't I can't imagine any athlete that's under

1045
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:26,280
more difficult sleep conditions than a Formula One driver, because, you know, it's one thing if

1046
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:31,640
you play in the NBA, you're going to fly a lot, but you have a three hour time zone max. And

1047
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:36,920
based on how the conferences work and how the schedules work, it's not like you're going plus

1048
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:41,000
three minus three plus three minus three plus three minus three. When you look at Formula One,

1049
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,440
first of all, it's a 10 month season, basically. I mean, it's, you know, when you include

1050
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:52,520
preseason testing and it's truly a global sport and it's not even like it's structured perfectly

1051
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:58,520
well. It's not like they comb through Europe, then go over to Asia and then, you know, hit a little

1052
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:03,480
Australia and Melbourne on the way over to North America and then hit South America. It's not even

1053
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:09,080
done in the logical way that you would do it if you were optimizing for continental jump. Right.

1054
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:16,120
It's just like, it's horrific. And there in that sport, if you're talking about margin of error

1055
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:22,520
and reaction time, we don't currently have essentially a breathalyzer for sleep deprivation,

1056
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:26,280
which we should. And I think, you know, there's ways that we can think about that too.

1057
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:33,160
But if there is one gold standard measure of insufficient sleep, it's not only just your

1058
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:38,360
response time, your basic reaction time, but it's the number of times that you miss a response,

1059
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:44,680
what we call a lapse or an error of omission. You omitted a response that should have been happening.

1060
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:54,120
It is so obvious that insufficient sleep impacts your basic reaction time and you're missing of

1061
01:46:54,120 --> 01:47:01,720
choice response times. And in formula one or in any vehicle racing at high speeds, you know,

1062
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:08,520
response times and reaction times, you're talking about margins of error here that are 0.00X,

1063
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:18,920
you know, and six hours of sleep for one week can drop your reaction time by up to three to

1064
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:26,200
400 milliseconds. Now, three to 400, you know, almost half a second in terms of slowed response

1065
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:33,640
times in formula one can make the difference between you being first and you being somewhere

1066
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:38,120
basically nowhere. Yeah. The other thing I've noticed, and this is one of the things I enjoy

1067
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:45,400
about having a simulator is I get to test stuff out. I mean, I've figured out that even after

1068
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:51,960
one drink, I drive worse in a simulator, even though I am not legally drunk, right? I probably

1069
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:57,560
have a blood alcohol of 0.03, 0.02. I mean, a very low blood alcohol after one drink and someone my

1070
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:03,400
size who metabolizes things so quickly, but I don't drive well. And I know this is clear as,

1071
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:08,680
you know, as clear as day because when I drive with my coach, you know, we drive virtually

1072
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:14,200
inside of iRacing together. So he's in the cockpit with me, seeing my telemetry, seeing the drive,

1073
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:19,720
the whole thing. And it's just a different game. And it's not actually just reaction time. The other

1074
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:26,440
thing I've noticed is there's something about my spatial coordination that goes down. So I actually

1075
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:31,800
think that that's a bigger problem than the reaction time. I think the bigger issue is you're

1076
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:38,040
just, you're never quite hitting the right apex. You're never quite finding the right grip in the

1077
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:42,520
track. And this is even when you know the track, like the back of your hand, you're just off.

1078
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:48,040
So it's spatial attention. It's one of the things that we can study. We do it with brain scanners

1079
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:57,960
very quick. I think that's what's killing me. That I think together with also just specific choices,

1080
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:03,000
you know, if you're racing, you know, you can, if you're by yourself and you're on the clock,

1081
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:09,000
that's one thing to worry about. As soon as you put other cars on the track, you make it strategic.

1082
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:15,640
When you make it strategic, you make it about decision choices. Do you dive into that apex?

1083
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:20,600
When you know that you've got someone on your flank, do you not? When is the time to break?

1084
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:26,920
Do I want to break later? Do I have the downforce? Where am I with my tires? You can go through a

1085
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:33,800
whole litany of decision making that has to happen within split seconds of time. Decision making,

1086
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:39,560
again, you know, sleep critical components. Yeah. And just judgment. I mean, I think

1087
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:45,160
that's right. You've been having a microscopic miscue on your judgment. And as you said,

1088
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:50,440
it's hard enough when you were on a track by yourself, just trying to bang out best lap times

1089
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,080
the moment someone else is there. And it's incredible how much your judgment can be

1090
01:49:55,080 --> 01:50:00,600
impaired even subtly to do something stupid. For me, you know what it is? It's impatience.

1091
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:05,720
I am much more impatient under that situation. Impulsivity. Yeah, very impulsive.

1092
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:11,240
Expects the child in the supermarket. Yeah. Yeah. Just much more likely to, you know,

1093
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:17,560
for example, you think about it. Let's say you have 10 laps to go and there's one car you need to pass.

1094
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:22,680
You know, you think about that for a moment. You've got all the time in the world to figure

1095
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:28,200
this out. You want to wait until it's perfect. And yet I can see it in myself. There's this

1096
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,320
belief with like, well, I just got to do it now. It's got to be on this lap. It's this lap or never

1097
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:42,120
that I totally irrational thinking. And I have to wonder because it's not, we do see these guys who

1098
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:47,320
are gods. I mean, you know, you've driven race cars. I've driven race cars. So we can

1099
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:52,280
watch that sport and appreciate it maybe more than the casual observer. Like we know how good

1100
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:57,720
they are. Just like someone who plays soccer and watches Messi can appreciate him more than I can,

1101
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:03,480
right? Or someone who plays tennis can look at Federer and actually explain why he's so great.

1102
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:09,080
That's what we can do with these Formula One guys. And yet sometimes you see them do things that

1103
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:14,680
really don't make sense. In the light of this conversation, it's hard to wonder how much of

1104
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:21,000
that could be due to impaired sleep given the, again, grueling schedule that they have to keep

1105
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,760
and the enormous time zones they're constantly skipping with very little recovery. I mean,

1106
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:32,360
it's impossible actually, because on many occasions, they won't show up in a new city until

1107
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:39,640
Monday or Tuesday. And if you've hopped eight hours in a time zone, a great demonstration of this

1108
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:47,560
is just simply your, you know, driving a race car is physical as well. It requires physical fitness

1109
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:52,600
and non-trivial physical fitness. And a good example of this is that when you're trying to

1110
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:58,280
mismatch your physical performance relative to your natural circadian rhythm, which is what happens

1111
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:05,240
when you're jet lagged, you are not going to be performing at your optimal sweet spot. And I can

1112
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:12,120
tell you that because if you look at the number of world records that are broken in the Olympics,

1113
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:20,760
they are statistically far more likely to occur world record breaking efforts at the peak of most

1114
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:27,560
human beings circadian rhythm, which is around about one to 2pm in the afternoon, far more world

1115
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:33,560
records broken in the Olympics at that moment on the circadian phase. And if you look earlier in the

1116
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:40,680
morning or later in the day, that probability curve actually decreases down and it's common across

1117
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:47,400
all sports. So that shows you that when you are in harmony with your circadian rhythm, your ability

1118
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:55,400
to perform physically, according to at least world records, is optimized and maximized. So I can only

1119
01:52:55,400 --> 01:53:02,040
imagine that when it comes to race car driving, if you're shifting between time zones so dramatically,

1120
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:08,120
and you're not finding ways to optimize your circadian rhythm biology, nor your sleep,

1121
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:16,520
you are losing a competitive advantage. And you as a team could spend 10 million on trying to shave

1122
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:22,680
off 0.1 of a second in a car, which would be heroic as an engineering accomplishment. Yet you

1123
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:31,000
could be shaving off 0.4 or 0.5 by way of human error, by way of this thing called insufficient

1124
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:37,240
sleep or mismatch circadian rhythm. So as with many things that we're finding now with technology,

1125
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:44,040
we're starting to get to the saturation maximum of engineering and technology accomplishments.

1126
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:50,840
What we're finding is that the weakest link, the lowest hanging fruit may no longer be technology,

1127
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:57,240
it may no longer be tire compound or downforce, it may be the human being themselves. And if you look

1128
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:03,080
at that constellation of things that are taken care of in race car drivers and in most high

1129
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:10,680
performance athletes, diet, nutrition, mental health, those three things are well on the radar

1130
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:18,280
map of most of them. Sleep, usually not. Yeah, and as you know, because you've driven and I've driven,

1131
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
when I think about what separates people like us who are enthusiasts from people who are professionals,

1132
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:32,600
it's really this ability to be consistently exceptional. I mean, I've probably had

1133
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:41,800
individual laps that were really, really good, where like you could squeak, like if you only saw

1134
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:49,160
me do that one lap, you'd think that guy's good. But I don't think I've ever strung together

1135
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:56,840
three laps that you could look at and say, wow, that guy's really good. And that's sort of the,

1136
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:03,880
in many ways, the challenge for even the best in the world, which is you can't make a mistake

1137
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:14,120
on 70 laps. That's two plus hours sometimes. And I think to your earlier point about the reaction

1138
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:19,400
times and the speed with which the world is coming at you when you're driving a Formula One car,

1139
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:27,240
this need to be incredibly focused, have a level of concentration that,

1140
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:32,600
if you think about it, there's no other sport I can think of that requires that level of focus

1141
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:39,800
and concentration for that long. Most sports, you have brakes and you could say, well, sure,

1142
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,840
if you're on a straightaway, maybe you have a bit more of a break, but I don't know about you. But

1143
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:50,760
even when I'm on the straightaways going flat out, I'm already going, okay, where's the brake

1144
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:57,640
zone? Like, yeah, there's really no moment where I'm not focusing. Right. In cognitive neuroscience,

1145
01:55:57,640 --> 01:56:03,400
we call that essentially a time on task effect, which is that the longer that you're doing it,

1146
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:08,200
does your performance change as a function of time? And firstly, the answer is yes, that your

1147
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:14,360
sustained attentional ability starts to wane the longer that you perform just about any cognitive

1148
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:21,960
task. It turns out what's interesting with sleep deprivation is that the effects, the unmasking of

1149
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:29,880
insufficient sleep grows the longer that you apply the brain to a task. So maybe for the first 30

1150
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:35,080
seconds, they may be performing, you know, 10 seconds at the level of someone who's sleep rested

1151
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:41,400
or their own level when their sleep rested. But you've got to go into kind of minute four or minute

1152
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:48,120
five before you really start to see the lines deviate from one another. And that's what we call

1153
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:53,480
a time on task effect. And that is most prevalent in what we call sustained attention, sustained

1154
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:59,080
spatial attention, which comes right back to exactly what you were discussing. So certainly, I think

1155
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:06,760
if it's a missing ingredient in a racing team, it would be a cost savings to you and a point scoring

1156
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:13,880
benefit that you may want to look into. Well, Matt, until next time, this has been,

1157
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:19,560
I mean, really, really insightful. And when I think about how much I probably know about

1158
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:24,440
sleep to begin with, and how much I have learned even from this discussion, and certainly from

1159
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:33,560
reading your work, I'm incredibly grateful. And I do think that this is probably the single biggest

1160
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:39,960
deficit within the toolkit of most physicians. And I'm, you know, few people are more critical of

1161
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:46,440
the absolute dearth of rigor in the nutrition field, but I think this is worse. And it's not

1162
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:51,880
the dearth in the quality of the research, it's the dearth in the translation of that research

1163
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:56,760
to clinical application. I agree. I think the research in nutrition is the worst research of

1164
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:01,080
all things. Just, and again, it's not to be critical of the people doing it, it's the difficulty in

1165
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:06,520
studying it. But at least there's a greater effort to translate what is known into practice. But here,

1166
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:11,880
this is the biggest chasm that said, I think your work has had a greater impact here than anything

1167
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:16,840
I'm aware of. And I wish you all the continued success. I think you could argue part of our

1168
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:22,840
humanity depends on it. Thank you for giving me firstly, that affirmation, because I am on a

1169
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:28,200
mission to try to reunite humanity with, I think, the sleep that it is so desperately bereft of.

1170
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,680
And having this type of forum where you can disseminate that knowledge. I mean,

1171
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:37,480
what you described there is that the research has not been translated to the clinical practice.

1172
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:43,320
You're absolutely right. And that's part of the work that I do with trying to be a sleep advocate.

1173
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:49,400
But another part of that is just the transmission of that sleep knowledge to the general public as

1174
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:54,360
well. And I think people, you know, I'm not, I can't speak for any of my colleagues, but early

1175
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:59,480
on in my career, I don't think I did a very good job at communicating science, the importance of

1176
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:05,400
sleep to the public through the science. And that's what I've been desperately trying to course

1177
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:12,440
correct with the book. And then just trying to be out there and having this type of a forum,

1178
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:18,120
this type of an opportunity, a long form discussion with, you know, just a fascinating,

1179
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:24,440
intelligent mind like yourself, who has an incredible listenership to be given that platform

1180
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:29,880
is such a privilege. And so I have an immense amount of gratitude for this

1181
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,160
time that you've been providing me with. Thank you, Peter. Thank you very much.

1182
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,760
