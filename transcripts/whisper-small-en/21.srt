00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:47,240
Hi everybody, welcome to episode two of five in the week of day spring.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,940
This episode we cover lipoprotein basics, what's lipoproteins and lipids 101.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,820
We talk about Goffman and the ultra centrifuge and how we came up with these whole ideas

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,760
of densities of lipoproteins.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,200
We get into very specifics around the lipoprotein structure, their function and their metabolism.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,000
We talk about how to measure the lipoprotein and the cholesterol content and what NMR is

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,880
and how it has changed the game a little bit.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,660
We get into the distinctions between LDL cholesterol, LDL particle number and APO B. There is some

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,480
confusion here amongst physicians and presumably amongst patients.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
So hopefully that will clear that up.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,360
We get into the biochemistry of lipids and then we talk about sterols specifically as

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,200
a more broad category.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Now before we could measure anything to do with lipoproteins, if my memory serves me

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,720
correctly, it would have been the late 40s, very early 50s when the first assays were developed,

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,960
maybe it was 1951, that could actually just measure total cholesterol.

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,760
So you would take plasma from a patient, you would presumably in an assay break down all

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,560
of the lipoproteins and just aggregate the total amount of cholesterol and you would

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,660
yield that number which still amazingly shows up on a panel today.

29
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,800
You go and get a blood test and it might say your total cholesterol is 200 milligrams per

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
deciliter.

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,060
Am I correct?

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,060
That was the early 50s maybe?

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,800
No, I think they were analyzing cholesterol long before that because that's a molecule

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,840
you can take blood and dissolve whatever you got to dissolve and cholesterol appears.

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,000
So they had cholesterol measurements for a long, long time.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,880
It's like the first lipid anybody could ever measure.

37
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,120
What you're talking about in the 50s is where John Hoffman discovered that, hey, wait a

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,000
minute, there are no lipids floating around in plasma because lipids are incredibly hydrophobic.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,340
Your plasma is water.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,140
You can't have lipids circulating in plasma.

41
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,260
So lipids obviously have to be within what I call water soluble lipid transportation

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,520
vehicles and that turns out of course to be a lipoprotein, a protein-wrapped collection

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,800
of hydrophobic and amphipathic lipids that just wouldn't be in your plasma unless they're

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,440
attached to a protein.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Peter mentioned albumin.

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
It's a protein.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,040
So lipids can attach to albumin and be circulated around and other type proteins but albumin

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,180
is the most frequent protein in the blood.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,560
So it serves as a carrier.

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,480
I think an albumin can carry like 17 molecules of cholesterol, a few of phospholipids too.

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,040
So it's a player out there.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,280
We got a ton of albumin in our plasmas.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,440
You'd be shocked to find out how much cholesterol is in it.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
Not quite as much as in lipids.

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,800
Albumin is kind of an amazing protein.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
It'll carry hormones.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
It'll carry just about anything.

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
It's remarkable.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,800
And it has everything to do with osmotic pressures and things like that.

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,960
So albumin is kind of an essential protein to say the least, performing many, many functions.

61
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,300
But when John Hoffman, a physicist by the way who had, physicists have been playing

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,100
with ultracenta fuge for a long time separating their radioactive particles and stuff, he

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:01,380
somehow wound up separating lipoproteins or saw things floating around in a centrifuge

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,340
test tube that he then identified as the lipoproteins.

65
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,860
So if you learn nothing else today, learn the first thing is lipids for the most part

66
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,660
go nowhere in the human body unless they're a passenger inside a lipoprotein.

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,620
Because if you believe there are a lot of lipid associated diseases, and I certainly

68
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,580
believe atherosclerosis, you cannot have atherosclerosis without a starol and lipid being in your arterial

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,660
wall.

70
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,420
And I know that arterial wall didn't over synthesize starols, creating a starol buildup.

71
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,500
Somebody had it delivered of starols there.

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,980
And that of course turns out to be a lipoprotein.

73
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,420
One of the places a lipoprotein should never deliver starols to, to any serious degree

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,460
of course is your arterial wall intima.

75
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,460
So being a Jersey guy, one of my standard jokes on a lecture circuit was atherosclerosis

76
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,020
is just the evidence of illegal dumping where a lipoprotein instead of bringing lipids to

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,180
wherever it's supposed to be bringing it was bringing starols to the arterial wall.

78
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,940
And over decades, you got a problem.

79
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,940
You know, it could do it for a few days, six months, you're not going to die of atherosclerotic

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
disease.

81
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,500
So when did it become clear?

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,260
So Hoffman figures out by first principles basically, he imputes that there's got to

83
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,420
be something that is transporting this very, very hydrophobic molecule through plasma.

84
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,940
It doesn't, you know, I mean, it's easy in retrospect to make light of what an observation

85
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,940
that is, but the next observation would be it would lead to be spherical.

86
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
Right?

87
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,220
I mean, it's to optimize the volume in which you could transport.

88
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,500
It would have to be spherical.

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,820
You're a mathematician, a volume of the sphere, the third power of the radius.

90
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,100
So if you're going to devise a transportation vehicle, a sphere is better than a flatbed

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,420
truck, you know.

92
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,540
So how long was it until, I mean, I know the answer to this question, but I just have to

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
sort of tee it up.

94
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,060
Who then went on to figure out these things occur in different densities?

95
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
It's not just one.

96
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,620
There's not just one spherical molecule that's transporting these things.

97
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,860
This is a beautiful story, right?

98
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,060
It was Hoffman.

99
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,340
He noticed that they're, and they weren't calling them April B and April A, they weren't

100
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,660
particles at the day, but they were different densities.

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,660
They were gigantic.

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,300
So explain what you mean by density because this term, you know, we talk, everyone knows

103
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,740
low density, low proton, high density, low proton, but tell me where that terminology

104
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,140
actually came from.

105
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,180
Well, I think it has to do with water has a certain density.

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,620
So it's whether things float in water or sink in water.

107
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,980
We know rocks sink if we throw it in a pond, so they're very dense things.

108
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,700
Whereas other things float on top of water.

109
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,940
They obviously are less dense than water is.

110
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,680
So everything is relative to water there.

111
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,980
So if you establish what you think is the density of water, things that float.

112
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,140
So when he separated these things in a centrifuge, the lipoproteins or these fatballs that didn't

113
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,140
move at all were obviously very buoyant.

114
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,020
Some sunk just a little bit.

115
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,980
So they were less buoyant, but still pretty buoyant.

116
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,780
And some went right to the bottom of the test tube, obviously incredibly dense.

117
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:17,500
And it turns out what makes a lipoprotein buoyant is a ratio of its lipid fat content.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,460
Cause I think we all know fat floats on water or proteins check out the molecular weights

119
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,020
of proteins really heavy.

120
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,140
They sink, so they're the rocks.

121
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,060
So your density of a specific particle here, lipoprotein particle is going to be related

122
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,820
to its lipid content versus its protein content.

123
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,660
So our big monsters that are delivering, as I told you, triglycerides, but have a lot

124
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,900
of phospholipids on their thing, they have some proteins, but they have so much lipids

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
they float.

126
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,380
They're the buoyant ones.

127
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,140
And as they lose the lipids, they become smaller.

128
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,260
They might lose a few proteins as they shrink, but they're really using the lipids.

129
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,860
But they're fundamentally concentrating protein as they get smaller.

130
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,420
Because when you go from chylomicron, even though they're not the same lineage, so I

131
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,060
want to be very careful, you'll explain this in detail.

132
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,140
You do not go from a chylomicron to a VLDL to an IDL to an LDL to an HDL.

133
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,140
There are three separate lineages I just described.

134
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:23,020
But in size, they loosely track as the smaller they get, the more they've concentrated protein.

135
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,060
Within every category of lipoproteins, you talk chylomicrons, which intestinally produce

136
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,420
VLDLs, hepatic produce.

137
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,940
And the classic teaching is as VLDLs become smaller, you call them intermediate density

138
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,460
and low density, we now know the liver can produce an LDL without making a VLDL first.

139
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,060
High densities which form themselves in the things sort of go the opposite way, whereas

140
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:55,100
the VLDLs and Chylos come out as big fat monsters and lose lipids and become smaller and denser.

141
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,420
The HDL as it gathers lipids becomes bigger and more buoyant.

142
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,580
But within every class of lipoproteins, you're going to have a heterogeneous range of densities

143
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,620
from big species to small species.

144
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,140
And this is why to me, I like to tease because you always hear people talk about the small

145
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,180
dense LDL.

146
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,620
Within every lipoprotein classification, the smaller particle is always more dense than

147
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,740
the, so that's a redundant thing.

148
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,660
Just tell me dense LDL, just say smaller.

149
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,500
I know it has to be dense or if it's dense, I know it has to be small compared to its

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,540
sister particles within that family or so.

151
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,540
Somehow small has only been applied more frequently to LDLs because that's the killer one or HDL

152
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,700
is, oh my god, you want to have the big HDLs.

153
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,540
Another joke that's turned out, but for a long this while, if you don't have big HDLs,

154
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,620
you're in big trouble or so.

155
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,660
And if you've got the small LDLs, you're in the biggest trouble.

156
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,020
That basically turns out to be because if you have small LDLs, you need a ton of them

157
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,940
to carry whatever your lipid load is.

158
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,740
So you've got a super high LDL particle concentration if you have small LDLs.

159
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,380
And that's more related to its pathology per se than the size, not that that won't

160
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,740
cause certain functional characteristics of the LDL.

161
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,220
But the LDL, the kylos come out big and they shrink.

162
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,780
Now the reason though that differentiate kylo microns and the LDLs, IDLs and LDLs is they

163
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,860
have a lot of apoproteins on their surface, which they do lose as they shrink.

164
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,580
But there's one protein they never lose and it's the one that has the most massive molecular

165
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,180
weight, apo-hyperprotein B. So that's why they are never going to be as dense as an

166
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,780
HDL particle because an HDL doesn't have this monstrosity high molecular weight, APoB, on

167
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
it.

168
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,620
It's got other things, far less lipids.

169
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,340
But to some, the LDLs, IDLs, VLDs are always going to be way more buoyant because they

170
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,380
do have a little bit of an anchor on them, creating titter densities that APoB.

171
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,820
And it's the only, as you study apoproteins, there are probably up to 20 to 30 of them

172
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,660
now, all of which have certain functions that it sort of directs a lipoprotein down which

173
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,500
path it's going, a catabolic path.

174
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:24,220
The only apoprotein, by the way, get definitions out the way, apoprotein, apolipoprotein, lipoprotein.

175
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,780
An apoprotein is the protein your cell makes.

176
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,340
Once it binds two lipids, it's called an apolipoprotein and of course the whole particle itself is

177
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,540
called a lipoprotein.

178
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,300
So let me re-synthesize that.

179
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,980
The lipoprotein is the spherical structure whose membrane is made up of mostly these

180
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,780
phospholipids but also other lipids.

181
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,060
The apoprotein is the thing that kind of gives it its signature.

182
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:56,940
So for example, the chylomicron has a B48, the IDL, VLDL, and LDL have a B100, etc.

183
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,660
That's just called the apoprotein.

184
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,860
Once the apoprotein, and I assume it's covalently bound to the lipoprotein, that becomes the

185
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,740
apolipoprotein.

186
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,140
And we abbreviate that apo fill in the blank.

187
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Yeah.

188
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,740
So if I took a VLDL particle and later on I'll tell you, boy, on a VLDL you're going

189
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:24,980
to find apo C1, apo C2, apo C3, apo A5, and including apo B. But it's going to lose everything

190
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,060
but apo B as it's transferred.

191
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,060
It'll lose most of the other ones because they're transferable.

192
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,180
They can jump on different lipoprotein if they so desire to.

193
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,000
Apo B never does.

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,700
For a bunch of reasons, it provides the structural integrity to that particle throughout its

195
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,980
existence.

196
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,180
But apo B turns out to be the ligand for receptors that internalize those particles when your

197
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,620
body don't need them anymore.

198
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,060
So the LDL receptor that everybody knows about-

199
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,660
So the ligand just for some people listening, it's like the key that fits into the lock.

200
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,980
If the receptor is the lock, the ligand is the key.

201
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,060
In biology, that's sort of how everything works.

202
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,620
The key has to fit the lock.

203
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,620
Correct.

204
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,940
And if it didn't, then that lipoprotein is going to stay in your plasma and probably

205
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,500
wind up going somewhere where it's going to create a pathological state.

206
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,980
So when was it figured out that apo lipoproteins are going to come and go, but there's one

207
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,900
of these ones that not only always stays, but you have one?

208
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,460
Because that's a big deal, the realization that apo B100, if you knew that concentration,

209
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,140
you had a proxy for how many particles you had.

210
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Yeah.

211
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,820
So Goffman certainly figured out there were proteins involved here, but he wasn't applying

212
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,620
that nomenclature to them and everything.

213
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,340
Guys who further, a few years further down the road, Fredrickson, Levy and Lees started-

214
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,220
We've talked about those with Ron Krauss.

215
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,100
I never realized there are some very important structural and functional proteins on these

216
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,180
particles that we better start investigating and giving names to.

217
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,740
So their research led to the identification of all them.

218
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:10,620
And ultimately, I mean, we know now the amino acid breakdown of every darn apoprotein that's

219
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,300
in our body or on our particles and everything.

220
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,260
So it just, when one research invents a little bit of the story, other ones pick up the pieces

221
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,780
and start further elaborating on it with different studies and technology improves and some of

222
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,220
these things that were not a saleable at one point become that you can measure them and

223
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,100
identify their structure and everything.

224
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,300
So it's one of these evolutionary things.

225
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,660
And it just made such perfect sense too, because we knew these particles are changing.

226
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,460
So they're undergoing catabolic processes.

227
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,060
Why? What's doing that?

228
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,020
And then all of a sudden you figure out that these ligands, these apoproteins are keys to

229
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,060
various receptors.

230
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,980
Some of those receptors pull the particle next to where the expression of a lipid dissolving

231
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,940
enzyme or lipase.

232
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,060
And it starts to all make perfect sense to you.

233
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:13,460
So over time, we've identified numerous of these enzymes that can catabolize lipoproteins,

234
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,420
numerous of the receptors that temporarily bind these particles in place so they can

235
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,860
undergo this thing.

236
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,420
Is that lipidate fill the particles with the lipids or delipidatum?

237
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,020
So if you're listening to this and you're confused at this point, it's okay.

238
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,860
One, there's going to be killer show notes, but more importantly, we're going to take

239
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,700
a step back now.

240
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,780
I'm a guy listening to this.

241
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,220
I'm a girl listening to this.

242
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,860
All I know is every time I go to the doctor, he or she gets a blood test and it spits out

243
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
the following.

244
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,580
Total cholesterol equals this.

245
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,460
LDL, and they won't even, it'll be worse.

246
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,700
It'll say LDL equals this.

247
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,020
HDL equals this.

248
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,260
Triglyceride equals this.

249
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,060
And maybe it will say non-HDL equals this.

250
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,820
What do those things mean in relation to everything you just said?

251
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Yeah.

252
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,940
First of all, the misinformation on labeling lipid metrics is one of the things that Miracle

253
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,900
hasn't given me a stroke yet.

254
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,220
I do a lot of peer review.

255
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,620
I'm going to, I want to associate editors.

256
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,940
That's why we're fasting you, Tom.

257
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,140
Journal of clinical lipidology, and I will reject a paper instantly that uses improper

258
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,020
lipid metrics.

259
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,980
Don't tell me your, the LDL is this because LDL is a low density lipoprotein.

260
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,100
It's not a laboratory metric.

261
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,940
You want to tell me what the LDL cholesterol is, the LDL particle number is, the lipidomics

262
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,100
of an LDL is the LDL oxidizer.

263
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Not great.

264
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,620
We do have assays that will measure that.

265
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,140
So let's please all you.

266
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,860
Identify yourself as an ignoramus.

267
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,060
And like I've told this to many of the top lipidologists in the country who lecture,

268
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,140
stop telling people what's your LDL.

269
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Ask them what is your LDL cholesterol?

270
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,220
What's your, if we don't all talk the talk, you're never going to understand the process.

271
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,060
So this patient almost assuredly is talking about total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,

272
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,100
HDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol.

273
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Yeah.

274
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,660
So I'll give you a quick, and by the way, Peter did mention something very quickly before

275
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,700
I just wanted to expand and he talked about, hey, APOB100, APOB48.

276
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,020
APOB is a giant structural, non-transferable, APOProtein that's on chylomicrons or VLDLs.

277
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,820
The intestinal machinery that synthesizes a chylomicron makes a certain type of APOB

278
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,780
and the APOB that is made in the liver makes a much bigger APOB.

279
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,300
It has a higher molecular weight.

280
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,700
So they knew the APOB that's being made in the intestine is much smaller.

281
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,300
So it turns out to be that the APOB in the intestine is 48% of the molecular weight of

282
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,740
the hepatic-produced APOB.

283
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,900
If you get into genetic APOB, you'll see APOB31 that has 31% of the molecular weight

284
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,220
of what's considered a normal APOB.

285
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,380
So when you hear APOB48, that should identify it as an intestinal-produced APOB particle

286
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,020
and a liver would be an APOB48.

287
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,860
And LDLs that come out of the liver should have APOB100 on it like the VLDL or VLDL,

288
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,420
it becomes an LDL, the APOB100 is still there or so.

289
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,540
Just keep, if you hear 148, what does that mean?

290
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,680
It sort of tells us the origin.

291
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,980
We are going to be talking about nuclear magnetic resonance and one of the parameters that used

292
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,980
to give you a lot on, less so nowadays, is VLDL particle concentration.

293
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,380
When you analyze the lipoprotein using nuclear magnetic resonance, it cannot tell the difference

294
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,740
between a chylomicron and a VLDL because NMR doesn't measure the proteins.

295
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,980
It's hey, that's a very big particle, so it has to be a VLDL or chylose.

296
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Most of your big particles are VLDLs.

297
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
But if you're fasted.

298
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,640
Yeah, and even in a postprandial state, chylomicrons have half-lives in minutes, they're gone.

299
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,580
So the vast majority of VLDL particle number via NMR is still VLDL part of it.

300
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
There could be some powers in it.

301
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,300
All right, but I want to go back to our lady.

302
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,100
So her total cholesterol is 190 milligrams per deciliter.

303
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,860
So total cholesterol, remember my premise that lipids go nowhere in the body unless

304
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,540
they're within a lipoprotein.

305
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,900
It's not exactly true, but for today's purposes, that is true and certainly understanding lipid

306
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,860
metrics, that's true.

307
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,180
So total cholesterol would be the laboratory has separated all your lipoproteins from the

308
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,020
serum and they're take how much cholesterol is in this serum tube.

309
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,260
So where would that cholesterol be that they're analyzing?

310
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,620
Well, it would be found in, if there were any chylomicrons there that were hanging around

311
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,020
or maybe they didn't fast, some of it would be chylomicron cholesterol.

312
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Some of it would certainly be VLDL cholesterol, a lesser amount because there's just so many,

313
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,500
so fewer of them would be intermediate density cholesterol particles.

314
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,940
And the rest would be in either LDL particles, low density lipoproteins or the high density

315
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,060
lipoproteins.

316
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,220
There are other types of LDL particles called LpA, which we'll talk about.

317
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,260
So total cholesterol is all of the cholesterol.

318
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,700
It is every single lipoprotein that's in a deciliter of your plasma.

319
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,940
And that is directly measured.

320
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
It is not computed.

321
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
That's an assay.

322
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
That is not a calculation.

323
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
That is assayed.

324
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,340
Anyway, there's always a coefficient of variability.

325
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,580
That's inaccurate.

326
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,140
And so if you want to use cholesterol for anything nowadays, because let's face it,

327
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,420
that was the first parameter looked at in the epidemic.

328
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,060
And they certainly correlated total cholesterol levels with the risk for heart disease.

329
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,160
But think about what I just told you.

330
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,900
It's the cholesterol within all the lipoproteins.

331
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,860
What is the, if you counted particles, what is the most numerous particles in your bloodstream?

332
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,220
The ApoB particles.

333
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,020
Well, actually the HDLs are more, but they're so small they don't carry much cholesterol.

334
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,900
So most of your, if you want to put a parentheses around it, atherogenic cholesterol would

335
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,940
be within your ApoB particles.

336
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,020
So if you want to ascribe any use to total cholesterol, it's a real poor man's ApoB

337
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
level.

338
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,460
In general, most people with very high total cholesterol levels will have a very high ApoB

339
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
level.

340
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,220
That's the real reason they're at risk for atherosclerosis, because those are the particles.

341
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
Yeah.

342
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,740
I mean, the original epidemiology basically said, you know, you have to sort of applaud

343
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,660
them for doing the best they could with the tools they had, but let's take total cholesterol,

344
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,580
which is at the time, the only thing we could measure clinically.

345
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,380
Let's take the patients who were in the top 5% and the patients in the bottom 5%.

346
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,620
Was there a difference in their risk of MI?

347
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,620
And the answer was yes.

348
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Correct.

349
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,620
It could be another at least decade until Framingham.

350
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,060
This is kind of an interesting story, right?

351
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:02,740
Part of the story got ignored in Framingham was that low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride

352
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,540
turned out to be four times more predictive of MI than high LDL cholesterol.

353
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:13,900
And again, this is still crude measurements, but that sort of didn't come back into, people

354
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,420
didn't come back to try to explain why that might be the case until Jerry Reivan had sort

355
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,140
of done his work on metabolic syndrome.

356
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,860
But I also realized I'm going to get us off topic.

357
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,800
I want to go back to this other question.

358
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,940
So we've just explained what 190 milligrams per deciliter means.

359
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,500
When it says HDL, it really means HDL cholesterol as evidenced by the units.

360
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,740
So those will either be measured in millimole or milligrams per deciliter.

361
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,060
That's a direct assay or an indirect assay.

362
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Yeah.

363
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,940
So Framingham, of course, did measure total cholesterol.

364
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,540
It was easily, they always did it.

365
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,100
They measure triglycerides too, although they really had no clue what they, where they

366
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,660
related to us, but it was measurable glycerides.

367
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,980
They called it glycerides back then.

368
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,380
And they did have a direct assay for HDL cholesterol.

369
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,900
They, you know, you could also measure, you know, you can centrifuge particles.

370
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,060
You can take out the LDL fraction and analyze how much cholesterol is in them.

371
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,900
That's theoretically the gold standard.

372
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,780
You can separate the HDL part, but that's too time consuming.

373
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,260
Nobody's got ultra centrifuges.

374
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,380
So to have real world tests, chemists had to develop direct assays.

375
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,020
So HDL assays were developed real early on.

376
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,740
So Framingham could not only measure total cholesterol, they could measure, directly

377
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
measure, not calculate HDL cholesterol.

378
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,780
What they could not measure, and it took a long time, was LDL cholesterol.

379
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,300
Without ultra centrifugation.

380
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,220
Without ultra centrifugation, correct.

381
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,260
In the 70s, somebody came up with a formula that here's a way of at least estimating

382
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,940
or calculating LDL, which took fire because by the 70s, they realize the most numerous

383
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,020
atherogenic lipoprotein were the low density lipoprotein.

384
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,500
So as Framingham started calculating LDL cholesterol, they, whoa, this is the story here.

385
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
So they calculate.

386
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,940
So just to be clear, what they're doing is they're directly measuring total cholesterol

387
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,220
because you can just do that off serum.

388
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,060
They precipitate out the HDL, right?

389
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,580
So you could measure the HDL without ultra centrifugation and you could measure triglycerides.

390
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:25,820
So now the formula for estimating LDL cholesterol became total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol

391
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,240
minus triglycerides over five.

392
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,940
Why the triglycerides over five?

393
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Yeah.

394
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,820
So Friedel-Wahl put two and two together and realized, hey, total cholesterol is in essence

395
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,340
LDL cholesterol plus LDL cholesterol plus HDL cholesterol A equals B plus C plus D.

396
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,740
So if I know parameter A and I know parameter D and I know parameters, say I can figure

397
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,900
out what parameters C is.

398
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,700
And so what he did was he said, I'm going to ignore chylomicron and IDL and LP little

399
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,420
A. Well, LP little A was at that point probably being not even, it was being included in the

400
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
LDL.

401
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Yeah.

402
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,900
They were basically counted as, the, the collos are counted as VLDLs and the IDL is counted

403
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
as LDL.

404
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
Okay.

405
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:13,020
So therefore if I know the HDL cholesterol and I know the total cholesterol, if I only

406
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:19,820
knew VLDL cholesterol, I could easily calculate what your LDL cholesterol was.

407
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,980
So then it becomes, you have to know what is a VLDL particle.

408
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,860
And at least if you have a physiologically normal VLDL particle, most of those lipids

409
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,100
are in the core of the particle.

410
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,860
No triglycerides on the surface, no cholesterol ester on the surface.

411
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,000
If I only knew the composition of these particles, I could figure out.

412
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,420
So they came to the realization that on average a physio, at least in the 1970s, a VLDL particle

413
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,700
composition had five times more triglyceride than it did cholesterol.

414
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,180
And virtually in a fasting state, all of the triglycerides are not in HDL.

415
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,100
They're not in LDL.

416
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,460
They're not measuring column icons because you're in a VLDL.

417
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,860
So cholesterol in a VLDL has to be triglycerides divided by five because there's one fifth

418
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,860
as much cholesterol in a VLDL particle.

419
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,200
So VLDL cholesterol is triglycerides divided by five.

420
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,420
So now if I have HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, you do the math, you're

421
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,620
a mathematician, Peter.

422
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,180
It's very easy to, aha, this is what your LDL cholesterol is.

423
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,900
Even as they calculated that and they applied it to clinical trial data, correlations are

424
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,780
very, very good.

425
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,940
And they knew that's probably where the money is because of our APOB particles, the particles

426
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,980
that are the ones delivering these sterols to the artery wall, the overwhelming majority

427
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,740
of them, 95% at the lowest end, 90% are LDL particles.

428
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,460
It's where the money is.

429
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:59,620
We need a metric of LDL and the calculated LDL C was earliest introduction to that.

430
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,020
Now down the road, people have developed direct assays of LDL cholesterol.

431
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,980
But you know what, turns out it's not that much more accurate than the calculated VLDL

432
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,280
cholesterol unless as you start to go up, up, up in triglycerides, that calculation

433
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
falters.

434
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,700
Which is something we're seeing more and more of today than we saw in the original framing

435
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
him.

436
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,140
Dad who said, oh boy, if your triglycerides get above 400, don't use that calculation.

437
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
It's ridiculous.

438
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,580
So they actually developed a direct LDL C to give us an LDL cholesterol metric and people

439
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:38,380
with triglycerides of 800, 1200, 4,000 where now you know what their LDL cholesterol is.

440
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,800
Whereas the formula would be useless there.

441
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,700
We now know that formula starts to become kind of erroneous at somewhere between a trigger

442
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:54,220
150 and 200 and the higher you go above 200, be careful with a calculated LDL cholesterol

443
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,260
and rely on direct LDL C.

444
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,980
And here's what nobody realizes.

445
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:07,740
The only value that calculated or directly measured LDL cholesterol brings to the table

446
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:14,780
is it's a better poor man's estimate of your LDL particle concentration than is total cholesterol.

447
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,420
So an LDL cholesterol would correlate better with APO-B or LDL particle concentration than

448
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,660
would a total cholesterol.

449
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,260
Down the road a little bit we've come to the realization that if we get another calculation

450
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,380
called non-HCL cholesterol that even better correlates with APO-B or LDL particle concentration

451
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,700
than does LDL cholesterol.

452
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,760
So that's why that's the new thing that's involved.

453
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,420
We also, thanks to your, I know you spent a little time down in Hopkins, some of the

454
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,420
lipid guys down there have invented a much better calculated LDL cholesterol, which they're

455
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:55,100
trying to get incorporated rather than the older calculation, the Frito-Wald that we've

456
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,340
been using forever and most labs entirely use nowadays or so.

457
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:06,220
So NMR, which is, you know, my first exposure to NMR was in high school when we were taking

458
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,420
organic chemistry and you learned that we had these tests.

459
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,880
I still remember how fun these tests were where they would show you an NMR spectroscopy

460
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,000
and you had to figure out what the molecule was by knowing where those spikes were.

461
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,060
So was Jim Otvos the guy that first figured out that you could use that stuff to actually

462
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,600
count the number of these APO-Bs?

463
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah, I think Otvos was certainly one of the early pioneers and over father time, the real

464
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,800
pioneer who evaluated lipids and lipoprotein using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

465
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,980
He knew that lipids would emit specific spectral signals that he could analyze and through

466
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:55,180
very complex mathematics, turn them into a variety of lipoprotein metrics, including

467
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,160
you can do an NMR LDL cholesterol level and LDL triglyceride level.

468
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,080
In the future, that's one of the ways we're going to be measuring phospholipids on various

469
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,080
lipoproteins is NMR spectroscopy because as Peter says, every lipid has a different

470
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,200
spectral signal and if you know what you're doing, you can look at a spectral signal and

471
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,480
know what its molecular composition is and everything.

472
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,000
So Jim turned it into, you know, as we had all these lipid metrics that we're talking

473
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,720
about, cholesterol, even triglyceride metrics, deep down the guys know these are just poor

474
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,160
man's way, easily assayable ways of quantifying lipoproteins and it's a quantification that

475
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,640
matters in many cases or so.

476
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,480
So we have, it turns out in the long run, it's the number of APO-B particles that primarily

477
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,520
is what forces it into the artery wall, very little L, I mean, or other factors, but that's

478
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
the number.

479
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,760
But when was that pathophysiology first stumbled upon that it even mattered how many of these

480
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,600
particles you have versus, so let's just take out the estimates and let's assume that

481
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,240
you have the ability to measure the total cholesterol concentration within an LDL particle,

482
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,520
which is what's showing up when someone gets a blood test and it says direct, when it says

483
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,980
LDLC direct, that means they've actually measured it.

484
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:19,360
So now it's better than Friederwald's estimation, but that's different from if you have an NMR

485
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,160
where it says LDL-P nanomole per liter and that's counting the number of those particles.

486
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,920
So one is the number of particles, the other is the amount of cholesterol contained within

487
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
them.

488
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,760
We'll get to what a revisiting of Mesa and Framingham made unambiguously clear, which

489
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,520
is one of those predicts better than the other.

490
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,200
But was that really the realization that it was a gradient driven process by number or

491
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,420
was that understood beforehand or at least hypothesized beforehand and then more verified

492
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,640
by the experimental evidence?

493
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,500
No, early on they discovered it was the ApoB particles going into the artery wall and delivering

494
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:00,220
these sterols and everything that set off this maladaptive inflammatory process that

495
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,160
led to a whole other area of investigation or so.

496
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,680
So the particle number data came once they sort of identified a way of assaying particle

497
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,160
numbers and they almost evolved that this maybe ApoB came a little bit first, but then

498
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:23,580
Jim Opphos' work on LDL particles came at the same time and it clearly became evidence

499
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:33,060
that ApoB is a better risk factor and remember there is one ApoB on every VLDL, IDL and LDL

500
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:39,480
but 95% of the ApoB particles are LDL so ApoB is just a way for the labs to report to you

501
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,260
what an LDL particle concentration is.

502
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:48,980
Opphos identified an LDL particle concentration using these methyl signals coming out of the

503
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,620
methyl groups that are on cholesterol, ester and triglycerides and phospholipids and translated

504
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:03,260
into a particle number that wow, either ApoB or LDL particle number correlates a lot better

505
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,380
with clinical events or the presence of atherosclerosis.

506
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,020
You'd have an event but if we do some imaging we see plaque in your wall then does the cholesterol

507
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,460
measurement per cell.

508
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:21,080
So it's not a surrogate of particle, they are particle measurements, ApoB or LDL-P. So

509
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,780
ApoB is an LDL particle metric.

510
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,780
What too many people get lost at, hey, VLDL particles are an ApoB particle so VLDLs are

511
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,660
part, there's no doubt that VLDLs can get in the artery wall and contribute to it but

512
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,300
it's like a minor.

513
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,340
The number of VLDLs that get into the artery wall are infinitesimal, the number of kylos

514
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,140
that get in are infinitesimal compared to the number of LDL particles.

515
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,540
So yet are all bad guys and a VLDL per particle have significantly more cholesterol molecules

516
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:58,560
in it than an LDL but there are just so many more LDLs that collectively the LDLs deliver

517
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,220
more cholesterol to that artery wall.

518
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm going to go back and do one more.

519
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,700
ApoB by the way gives us no information on VLDLs, it's an LDL particle metric.

520
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,260
You can't use it for anything else.

521
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,140
So don't call me up and say my ApoB is high because I got too many VLDL particles unless

522
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:21,220
you have a rare lipid disorder where there are no LDL particles to type 3 this beta lipoproteinemia.

523
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:27,300
That's the only time an ApoB is measuring it's a VLDL measurement or a remnant measurement.

524
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:34,220
That's not an LDL measurement but in everybody else ApoB, LDLP those are the tests you need

525
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,220
because although they correlate very well with LDL cholesterol if they're both high

526
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:44,920
in a given person, that person's at terrible risk but as you well know and probably because

527
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:53,780
of the metabolic makeup of our existing humans at least around throughout the world now is

528
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:00,180
some people have very high ApoB, LDLP, very good LDL cholesterol, some people have high

529
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,580
LDL cholesterol, perfect ApoB, LDL particle counts.

530
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,540
When those metrics agree they're said to be concordant.

531
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Hey use them both.

532
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,840
Either one will give you the same information but what happens if you get a patient where

533
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,900
they don't agree these metrics in virtually every single trial ever looked at the risk

534
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,780
follows the particle metric more than the cholesterol metric.

535
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:32,120
So the only way to know who is discordant with a cholesterol metric and an ApoB or an

536
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,460
LDL particle metric is to do both of them.

537
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,600
You could also say hey if I'm just doing ApoB or an LDL particle count I don't even need

538
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,640
lipids and I'd agree with you except I think there is value in knowing what a triglyceride

539
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,620
is for other reasons.

540
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,360
So that's the real key and if you ever go to a doctor and you're told I'm very happy

541
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,120
because your LDL cholesterol is normal say well so am I doc but by the way what was the

542
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,680
ApoB or LDL particle count and if the doctor didn't do it you demanded do it instantly

543
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,760
because otherwise you don't know your lipid related risk.

544
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,720
Yeah we're going to upset a lot of doctors here because I've already and you've already

545
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,280
been in the business of that where people will hear you talk or something or read something

546
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,980
you've written or something I've written and they'll go to their doctor and say hey

547
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,820
I want my LDL P or my ApoB and the doctor says that's nonsense you know fill in the

548
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,780
blank TBD blah blah blah blah blah and it puts patients in an awkward position.

549
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,580
I mean I really feel bad about this because especially on depending on what country they

550
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,580
live in at least in the United States I think anybody can go to lab core directly and get

551
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,340
the assay without a physician's prescription but it upsets me I think the patients even

552
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,500
have to do that it upsets me that something that is such an important metric.

553
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,840
I would list LDL P as one of the five most important metrics I've talked about this that

554
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,900
every patient should know their LDL P or ApoB and that that wouldn't be sort of fundamentally

555
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,700
a part of screening somebody for disease and that a patient would get into a position where

556
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,160
they're having to argue with their doc about that is disconcerting and look hopefully this

557
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,800
is sort of why I do these podcasts is I think it's just as much to help physicians say look

558
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,780
just because I didn't learn this in my training doesn't mean I don't need to sort of pick

559
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
it up today.

560
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:22,700
Amen and I'm sad there's so much what I consider inferior lipid care being administered by

561
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,420
healthcare professionals in the United States but there's nothing I can do about that is

562
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,500
try and teach them one at a time or expose my writings and other people's writings and

563
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:39,700
the data on this as much as I can and is tragic with public health problem number one or number

564
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:47,720
two that this is lag so far behind in part retarded by guidelines and third party payers

565
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:53,440
who just don't want to pay for different metrics and other reasons behind it but a big part

566
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
is they don't understand it.

567
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,280
You have had cardiologists call you up.

568
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,240
I have had being recognized as maybe in northern New Jersey one of the hey hey Tom you know

569
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,360
you told my patient that you know what I said about LDL cholesterol doesn't matter

570
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,060
because you've done an LDL particle and you put you know not everybody believes that or

571
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,060
they give you some horseshit like that.

572
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:24,420
I said I'm on my desk hey doctor would you like 200 manuscripts delivered to your desktop

573
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,580
tomorrow I'll do it if you promise me you'll read them every single so you know it is what

574
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
it is.

575
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,880
I think the internet is help people in certain ways I think the internet is confuse people

576
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,860
in a lot of ways too because there are people out there who what we just talked about it's

577
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:46,380
pretty much fat who become deniers of the particle concentrations because whatever else

578
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,180
they're exposing as their way to cure heart disease somehow aggravates LDL particle count

579
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,260
they just choose to ignore it and look are there people with high LDL particle counts

580
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,660
who don't somehow yeah they're out there but the overwhelming amount of literature

581
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:08,700
says the odds or if you keep this for 20-30 years you're going down until somebody does

582
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,340
a serious study showing there are people who can escape this you're playing with fire to

583
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,380
ignore an elevated LDL particle count APOB I don't have a way of identifying who who

584
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,740
might have a high metric there is somehow protected against atherosclerosis.

585
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,540
Well I have lots of thoughts on this myself but and maybe we'll come back to it but I

586
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,940
and I think we've gone back and forth we had this fun email string a while ago with you

587
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,780
Ron me Alan I think Josh Knowles was on it as well where we just you guys were the first

588
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,180
people to be exposed to my new model which is the necessary but not sufficient sufficient

589
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,940
but not necessary neither necessary nor sufficient causalities because you can actually have

590
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,280
causal metrics that fit each of those buckets but we'll we'll digress and come back to that

591
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
I want to go back to one semantic thing you use the word sterile a lot I'm very comfortable

592
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,440
with it I want to make sure the listener knows the difference between a sterile a stan all

593
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,520
a zoo sterile a phytosterol we're gonna I think we're gonna touch on this later so let's

594
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,920
just hammer out the semantics right well cholesterol of course is the molecule we all fare because

595
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,680
it's been drummed into our head that cholesterol in an arterial wall is where what is plaque

596
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,160
it's a cholesterol core and that cholesterol can cause impaired vascular biology resulting

597
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,040
in clinical events so what is cholesterol and we certainly in Peter's notes here you're

598
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,920
gonna have pictures of the cholesterol structure and it's got four rings it's an aromatic compound

599
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:45,440
and off the fifth ring is a little tail sticking out which is a carbon chain so the precursor

600
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:53,560
molecule is called the storane so you have the the rings the four rings and you may or may not

601
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:00,760
have this tail sticking off of the 17th carbon in the fourth ring so all of the bonds are saturated

602
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:09,800
that is called the storane so if you unsaturated one double bond in that storane it's called the

603
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,800
storane and if you then stick a hydroxy group on the third carbon in the first ring it's called the

604
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,920
storol it's an alcohol because you got a hydroxy group now sticking out hydroxy being OH oxygen

605
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:32,800
yeah excuse me correct so you'll see the pictures in my illustrated diagrams there and that little

606
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,800
tail that sticks out on the other end of the molecule has a lot to do with what exactly type

607
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,680
of storol that is and how it will function in a cell or in a cell membrane or so so cholesterol

608
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,680
would be this four ring structure three of the rings have six carbons in it the fourth ring has

609
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,240
five carbons in it you have this tail sticking off of carbon 17 it goes out and cholesterol that's

610
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,920
a totally saturated tail every bond in it is the saturated fatty acid and then on the three position

611
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,720
you'd have this OH group the hydroxy group by the way since OH is sort of soluble in water that part

612
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,920
of the cholesterol molecule is soluble in water whereas that carbon chain sticking out so pure

613
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,320
lipid that's all carbon that's not soluble in water so when cholesterol does exist in a surface

614
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:31,280
membrane like a cell membrane or lipoprotein it's it orients itself so the hydroxy group is sticking

615
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,800
out in that allopathic tail is sticking into the core of the particle or so now the cholesterol

616
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,600
it's in the middle of the particle oh that the hydroxy group can't be in the middle of the

617
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:50,920
particle that's water so they stick a really long chain fatty acid they replace the hydroxy group

618
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,840
with a long chain or really any chain fatty acid mostly it's a long chain so you a storified

619
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,240
cholesterol remember I told you attaching a fatty acid to something is called the stir so

620
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,160
cholesterol which is the active form of cholesterol that can be changed into a hormonal bile salt or

621
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:15,040
function in a cell membrane becomes a storage form of cholesterol or a lipid core transportable

622
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:23,160
form of cholesterol called cholesterol now it's YL it's not OL ester and we abbreviate that as CE so

623
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,640
free cholesterol is either going to be abbreviated as a C or an FC and cholesterol ester it's very

624
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,280
difficult if I wanted to if I'm an adrenal gland and I got some cholesterol ester stored and I want

625
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,040
to make a hormone because I need cluster I have to deesterify that cholesterol ester to free

626
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,920
cholesterol if the liver has cholesterol ester storage poles and it does and it wants to make a

627
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,680
bile acid it has to deesterify cholesterol ester cholesterol is stored in huge quantities

628
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,080
and fat cells as cholesterol ester and it would have to be deesterified to be utilized to do

629
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,520
something else or so one little story I'll just tell before we get to the stan halls and all the

630
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,280
other stuff is one of my prouder moments in front of Bob Kaplan was when you sent an email like this

631
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,360
a couple months ago you sent this an email and you said see if you can spot the error in this figure

632
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,320
and it was like a figure that had a million things on it and I was like oh I'm not getting up until I

633
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:23,680
figure out where the mistake is and sure enough somewhere in there it took me about 10 minutes the

634
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,640
illustrator had written because this was out of a paper something they had written cholesterol

635
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:35,040
OL ester instead of cholesterol YL ester and and and when I responded to you and you responded in

636
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,360
the affirmative I was like I've got my stripes and that figure he's talking about came out of one of

637
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,280
the productions for the company that I work for we develop educational pieces for physicians and I

638
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,960
obviously drew it in labeled it but you send it off to medical illustrator who formats it for the

639
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,240
PDF or whatever and cholesterol cholesterol and they make the mistake even though I sent in the

640
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,160
picture where it was properly labeled because I had a heart attack the first time I saw and we've

641
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,640
since changed that but somehow Peter got a hold of an older version or something that probably even I

642
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,320
sent out and didn't recognize initially but yeah so it is cholesterol ester anything that's

643
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,080
esterified becomes a YL so you'll see lipids this discussion illustrates one of the challenges of

644
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:25,960
lipidology which is I find this to be certainly among the two or three most complicated subject

645
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,360
matters I've ever tried to master and again no one masters anything in life I mean that's sort of

646
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:37,600
the beauty of this you haven't mastered this but this journey of trying to learn it I am constantly

647
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,800
humbled by how hard it is it's just so goddamn complicated well that's true especially you want

648
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,600
to take it to the nth degree but you need to invest yourself in some degree of education to

649
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,840
at least be competent in today's a world or so so you have to know some of this stuff well and

650
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:00,160
that's something you have to be willing to learn some of this chemistry I mean you have to steep

651
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,920
yourself in biochemistry and understand the because the significance becomes enormous one double bond

652
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,960
in one of these things completely changes its properties and not to say that that's not true

653
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,640
in general in biochemistry but it's much easier to talk about blood pressure or to talk about

654
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,000
elevated levels of uric acid or insulin or glucose without getting into that level of minutia it is

655
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,120
not possible to discuss lipids without that that is the problem with a lot of people are spouting

656
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,520
off on the internet and elsewhere but always they just don't have an understanding of the

657
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,880
complexity of how this all works and fits together and why what you just said is wrong

658
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,040
because there's something going on stoichiometrically that you haven't even considered or so to finish

659
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,640
the sterile so a steroid is a sterile it's got another keto group stuck on it some place look

660
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,360
at all the hormones you'll see a double bond with oxygen attached but a stan all is you take and

661
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:05,880
let's take cholesterol as a stan all or a sterile and remember cholesterol at the third carbons in

662
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,560
OH group there's a double bond at carbon 5 to 6 in their first ring and then there's that tail

663
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:20,120
at carbon 17 if I desaturated cholesterol the double bond at C5 and 6 disappears that's called

664
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:28,280
cholesterol cholesterol it's a stan all a stan all essentially a saturated sterile changes the

665
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,800
characteristics of that my cholesterol free cholesterol can be readily absorbed in your

666
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:40,960
intestinal wall stanels cannot be absorbed and it's kind of funny our liver to get rid of our

667
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,320
body to get rid of cholesterol but sends it to the liver the liver sends it through the bile to

668
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:53,080
the intestinal pool is free cholesterol and your intestines more than capable of just reabsorbing

669
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,240
that cholesterol that delivers trying to evict except our little friendly microbes down there

670
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:06,680
in the gut convert a ton of the biliaryx redo cholesterol into a stan all called cholesterol

671
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:13,760
or there's an isoform of it called coprosten al it's a stan all cannot be reabsorbed so you poop

672
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,560
it away and that's how the body gets rid of cholesterol it changes a lot of it to a stan all

673
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:25,360
anthropologists have been measuring specimens for coprosten all that tells them humans live there

674
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:34,080
because they find that in certain specimens and that human had to excrete it you know so a stan all

675
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:40,680
is simply a saturate that adds other applications because hey if stan all cannot be absorbed and I

676
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,880
would like to have a metric of whether you're absorbing cholesterol or not if I measured

677
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:54,440
cholesterol in your blood shouldn't be there to any appreciable degree because you can't absorb it

678
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,240
if it is elevated in your blood for whatever reason and we now know why your intestine just

679
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:08,960
absorbed that cholesterol and if it's absorbing cholesterol which it tends not to what is it

680
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:16,960
absorbing in humongous excess cholesterol so cholesterol serves as a biomarker of are you or

681
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,840
are you not or what degree of cholesterol absorption is going on in your intestines and

682
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:28,200
the last thing Peter did mention he said phytosterols he called it a zoosterol I call

683
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,720
it zoology so I call it a zoosterol so I don't know who's right on that I'm gonna go with your

684
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:39,080
right yeah I'm just gonna give you that and I do have a degree in zoology when I went to

685
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,320
college and I was one of my majors and you're wearing just so everyone knows you're wearing

686
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,560
your Rutgers t-shirt right now as well from college which is perfect I wouldn't be here without

687
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,500
the euro Rutgers that's medical school is inconsequential I learned everything in Rutgers

688
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:01,080
pre-med at least the biochemistry and the physiology anyway so phytosterols what plants

689
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:06,000
are full of stearls their cell membranes are not cholesterol those there are some plants that do

690
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,760
have cholesterol and most do not but they have stearls that if I show you here's cholesterol

691
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,360
and here's what's in this plant you would think you're showing me a lot of cholesterol but if

692
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,760
you look closely you'd see that tail that's coming out of carbon-17 is constructed a little

693
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,440
differently or wait a minute if there's another double bond in one of those rings in there so

694
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,840
it looks like cholesterol but it's close but it's really not and since it was made in a plant

695
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,960
collectively let's call them phytosterols but we hopefully all eat a few vegetables during the day

696
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,760
so you're eating phytosterols unless you're a total non you don't need any vegetables and they get in

697
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,000
even in other things even you're eating shrimp and stuff fishy phytoplankton and stuff so there's

698
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,440
phytosterols and bunch of foods but your body knows the only sterile I need to function is

699
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:04,360
cholesterol I don't need any plant stearls why would I want a human to ever absorb the plant stearl

700
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:10,360
they would get in a way could they even be toxic you know so evolution must have figured out they

701
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:18,680
were so evolution made sure our intestine did not absorb phytosterols why to me it tells me there's

702
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,520
a certain level of which phytosterols are toxic well this becomes interesting because I had a

703
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,240
disagreement with a physician recently who jointly takes care of one of my patients because

704
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,240
the physician wanted to put this patient on phytosterol supplements because this physician

705
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,080
became convinced that it was such an elegant way to lower cholesterol it turns out about 10 to 15

706
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,640
percent of people in whom you give massive doses of phytosterols you do indeed lower their cholesterol

707
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,360
this physician felt that was a good idea I felt otherwise for reasons you'll explain I'm sure and

708
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:58,600
needless to say after a long discussion we agreed to stop the phytosterols yes and again to me the

709
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,440
best argument with that is if your evolution thought we need a phytosterols your intestine

710
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,120
would be encouraged to absorb phytosterols if somehow they brought some miraculous property

711
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,880
to the human body that enhance survival you'd want them in there and everybody's now plants

712
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,360
carry a lot of great stuff we're only talking about the sterile it's in the plant the phytosterol

713
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:23,320
other ingredients in plants do get absorbed and probably are good for you but not phytosterols

714
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,840
well there's data to show that phytosterols on a per molecule basis are probably more

715
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,160
atherogenic than cholesterol there certainly is that data there but again the people who just

716
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,960
so focused on lowering LDL cholesterol don't even entertain it won't even look at it or you dismiss

717
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,800
it as nonsense you know and it's never going to be studied in a proper type of trial that you'd

718
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,880
have to study it in you know so and as Peter just hinted if you're not a hyper absorber of

719
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,200
sterols probably giving a phytosterol supplement is good because it does compete with cholesterol

720
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,360
firms so you will absorb less cholesterol and maybe that's one way of lowering LDL cholesterol

721
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,680
but I would say who cares but it you would get a little bit of APO B reduction in certain people

722
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,520
with that but if you're a hyper absorber I'm polluting your body with something that evolution

723
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,480
didn't want in your body why would I do that so I beg anybody who's a big advocate of supplementing

724
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,520
phytosterols please monitor phytosterols in the bloodstream that's how you identify oh my god

725
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,200
you're the one person I absolutely should not be given this to and I can send you a lot of data

726
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,240
Peter's talking about showing you phytosterol toxicity in humans and stuff so and when we say

727
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,040
someone's a hyper absorber I mean you and I have both written about this ad nauseam so we'll link

728
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,240
to it rather than get into a diatribe but we're basically talking about and your analogy is my

729
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:46,320
favorite I've always borrowed it outright stole it I'd hopefully I've always given you credit you

730
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,380
got a ticket taker in the bar Neiman pixie one like one transporter he lets everybody in if you

731
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,720
can fill in the door yeah he lets any sterile and if you can fit through the door you're coming in

732
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:01,480
but then you've got this ATP binding cassette g5 g8 and that's the bouncer that's the enforcer

733
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,520
that's the one who in theory probably informed by Alex are is making some sort of decision about

734
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,800
you're a good guy you're a bad guy you got to go you got to stay when someone is genetically a

735
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:19,040
hyper absorber is the quote-unquote defect more on the the ticket taker or on the bouncer turns out

736
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,560
that it's both because now when we talk about absorption let's face it there's a million molecules

737
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,800
that can be absorbed by your intestine we're talking about sterile absorption right now and

738
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:36,080
cholesterol is a key ingredient for human life so evolution not only gave every cell in your body

739
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,960
the wherewithal to synthesize cholesterol it allowed your intestine to absorb cholesterol

740
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,640
because it certainly didn't want any cellular deficiency of cholesterol which has nothing to

741
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,240
do with plasma cholesterol by the way you can have an LDL C of three and have perfect cellular

742
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:02,840
cholesterol metrics so as evidenced by the hyper functioning PCSK9 patients so this Neiman

743
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:11,720
pixi one like protein in our proximal intestine recognizes sterols and there's a sterile domain

744
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,000
on here that binds tightly to sterols but it binds most tightly to cholesterol because cholesterol

745
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,720
has that structure it has a less avid binding to a phytosterol and it has minimal binding to a

746
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,400
stan all now ultimately it'll bind to all of them but cholesterol gets the first preference to be

747
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,480
pulled into the enterocyte xenosterol as I call it rather than phytosterol xenon meaning other

748
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:42,440
star all a star all other than cholesterol I would get in secondarily and a stan all they get in but

749
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:50,200
at much less concentrations so now the enterocyte has this sterile you just absorbed now the

750
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:55,560
enterocytes position is I gotta get this to the rest of the body so I have to take this sterile

751
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:01,640
and put it in a chylomicron that I'm gonna make or I could also efflux any sterile out to a baby HDL

752
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:07,320
that's looking for sterols I can lipidate an HDL so that's how sterols get out of the intestine

753
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:13,400
or the intestine can say we don't need any more sterols I'm getting rid of you and that's where

754
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:20,920
the bouncer comes in so these ATP binding cassette transporters ATP binding cassette transporters are

755
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,640
a sterile efflux membrane transporter so and this is important to distinguish because and again it

756
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,520
might be confusing but the diagrams will make it easier there's two effluxes you've referred to

757
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,680
there's an efflux on luminal side and then an efflux back into the body both of them are leaving

758
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,560
an enterocyte one ends up leaving the body if it goes out the ATP binding is that it's going into

759
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,320
the lumen it's being excreted with stool if you efflux on the other side of the cell into either

760
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:54,200
the chylomicron or into the HDL you're actually putting it right back into circulation and that

761
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:59,160
is such a crucial point here I'm glad you elucidated on that more so yeah remember we're talking about

762
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,680
the enterocyte like the liver and enterocytes have a lot of things they can do with sterols

763
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,400
so they can get rid of it or they can even use it remember enterocytes have cell membranes they

764
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:15,160
need some cholesterol for their own cell membranes and everything so they can ship it out a body needs

765
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:22,120
cholesterol in a chylomicron they can lipidate in HDL or they can return it to the lumen of the gut

766
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:29,080
where it'll go out your rear end so these abc g5 or ga transporters as you're called then it's a

767
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:35,800
heterodimer so you have one of each well efflux and they also have different affinities so unlike

768
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:41,960
the neem and pic which really wants cholesterol to come in less so phytostarols and not so stanols

769
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:47,880
which tells me evolution didn't want those other products in your body the abc transformer or

770
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:55,320
exporters they number one evict phytostarols first that's another evolutionary happenstance

771
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:01,480
to me that tells me the body evolution didn't want phytostarols in your damn body because why is it

772
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,160
giving you a phytostarol efflux protein in your intestine and the liver has it too just in case

773
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,880
a phytostarol ever makes it as far as the liver it gets evicted back to the bile it'll go back to

774
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:19,000
your intestine so second in line for exportation would be a stanol and third would be cholesterol

775
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:28,520
so your ability to absorb cholesterol is a happy working relationship between the expression of

776
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:36,600
your neem and pic c1 like protein and your abc g5 ga transporters so technically if you even had a

777
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,480
good normal degree of absorption but you couldn't evict any storals because you got a

778
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,840
loss of function of an abc g5 or g8 you're going to be a hyper absorber because then the only way

779
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:52,360
those storals can get out of the anthracite is in a column micron or in an HDL and by the way when

780
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,120
you do measure these phytostarols in the blood people it's like when you measure cholesterol in

781
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,200
the blood do you understand i've already told you where that cholesterol man it's the cholesterol

782
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:09,400
within all the lipoproteins so if i'm measuring cytosterol stig masterol campesterol which are

783
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,640
some of the names of the 50 phytosterols that are in our plant products what am i measuring

784
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:22,360
well since the vast majority of lipoproteins are LDLs i'm measuring LDL cytosterol LDL cholesterol

785
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,880
like i'm measuring LDL cholesterol so you're measuring there but god forbid that particle

786
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:34,520
invades an artery wall the sterols go with it and one last intriguing part of this story which

787
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,920
better put the fear of god of phytosterols into you that evolution didn't want it in

788
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,080
so it gave you a protein that will not absorb phytosterols if it's working right it gave you a

789
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:49,640
protein that immediately vix phytosterols but for any storol to go in a column micron what does it

790
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:56,440
have to be a storified how does the intestine storify cholesterol into cholesterol ester which

791
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,760
is what makes up a giant part of the core of a column micron there's an astarifying enzyme

792
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:10,600
acyl cholesterol acyltransferase a cat guess what is the favorite ligand for a cat cholesterol

793
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:17,480
guess what is not a favorite ligand for a cat phytosterols so they you just don't astarify

794
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,720
phytoster which retards them getting into your body and you know the real way to get in

795
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:30,520
that abca1 efflux transporter which is what lipidates a baby HDL parto it's not abcg5g8

796
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,960
abca1 exports storols into baby HDL and just for the listener again you're saying abc what you're

797
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,240
saying is ATP binding cassette so when they hear you say abc that's what you're referring to it's

798
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:48,600
an energy driven process so some of that phytosterols you're measuring in the blood are in HDL

799
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:54,920
particles also so that's the way they get in and i always make and you'd have to do a study improve

800
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,040
it we're going to be talking about HDL dysfunction suppose i measured phytosterols in your HDL and

801
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:06,200
it's very high it's probably a type of dysfunctional HDL particle you know so there's all sorts of

802
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,840
intriguing it would also you know not to get too esoteric but that would also suggest enterocyte

803
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,640
dysfunction because the enterocyte should also quote unquote know better that that's not the

804
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:22,600
direction of efflux i want it is but it's relying on the abcg5g8 to efflux it then it wouldn't even

805
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:28,840
get to an abca1 to efflux it on the other side and a cat is not going to starify it if it's all

806
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:33,240
being evicted really very little it would wind up being a starified and the last part of this

807
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:39,160
puzzle as peter thought you have a gut lumen side and you got a plasma side or a lymphatic side

808
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:47,320
which is where kalamikrons exit we probably talk about it somewhere today is this crazy process

809
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,960
they used to call reverse cholesterol transport which is another one of these idiotic terms that

810
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,640
should have disappeared a long time ago at least if you think it's mediated by solely by HDL high

811
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:03,640
density lipoproteins that's the part that's got to change a big pathway of how does the body get

812
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,800
rid of cholesterol we're all told oh it brought it back to the liver and the liver will get rid of

813
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:13,640
it in a certain way guess what a ton of it is just brought directly right back to the intestine

814
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:19,160
and the cholesterol in the particle or the particle itself finds its way into the enterocyte

815
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:25,800
through and then the enterocyte has another supply of sterols all of a sudden that it didn't absorb

816
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:31,560
and so what it then will do with that sterile what it wants it can efflux it through abc g5g

817
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:38,360
into your gut lumen and you can poop it away so the process of a lipoprotein or some other

818
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:45,160
trafficker albumin red blood cells bringing cholesterol back to the small intestine bypassing

819
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:53,240
the liver gets right out into your stool is called trans intestinal cholesterol efflux abbreviated as

820
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,840
tice and it's a major reverse cholesterol transport pathway now do we have a sense because

821
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,160
we're going to talk about direct and indirect rct in a moment i think that might as well this is

822
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,640
as good a foray into that as any do you have a sense of how much cholesterol is being reverse

823
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:15,320
transported so to speak through tice versus the sum total of direct and non-direct reverse

824
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,600
cholesterol transport yeah this has been studied even dynamically but you know the real small

825
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:27,320
studies and it probably varies individually depending on the complexity of your lipid and

826
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:33,640
lipoprotein transportation systems or so some in some people it's probably 20 percent and other

827
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:40,280
people it's been reported as high as 60 percent so it varies a lot but it's a major player it's not

828
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,440
this infinitesimal minor baby pathway that's inconsequential except in some rat in a laboratory

829
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:52,520
or something it's this has been proven in humans now they're i just read it's part of the review

830
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:58,440
process and a really cool article coming out in a journal clinical lipidology where because of some

831
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,920
biliary surgery the guy had the only way cholesterol gets out of this person's body was through the

832
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:09,720
intestine and he did so he shows you the body can get rid of cholesterol without a biliary system how

833
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,880
many articles do you review a year there's two things when you're an associate editor

834
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:21,480
the main editor will say here here's a submitted paper do you think this is pretty good if so send

835
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,200
it out to four or five reviewers they will send their review to you and then you make your decision

836
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:31,880
and send it to me and i'll make the ultimate decision but then also i'm also just a reviewer

837
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,280
where another associate editor would say i think tom knows a lot about this subject i'll ask him

838
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:43,000
would he please review this article to me so uh i don't know i probably get about 15 articles a year

839
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,520
where i'm the associate editor and probably double that where you're one of the reviewers are just

840
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,880
one of several reviewers or so but that's still about 50 papers a year that are coming across

841
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,480
and i am blessed at my stage of the game to have a job where i do have i don't have to see patients

842
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:05,640
anymore i'm not traveling throughout the united states a hundred times a year on flights doing

843
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:12,600
lectures here they're in everywhere so i am blessed in my current position or my true health

844
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:19,560
diagnostic peter probably when you hear this the first time you'll get a list of my who i work for

845
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,600
and who i don't that's the only company i work for nowadays and i'm their scientific academic

846
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:31,000
advisor so my job is to stay on top of the literature know all this stuff and explain it

847
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,040
so i have the freedom every day to spend time reading and edging and part of my education

848
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:41,880
anybody who's a reviewer or an editor with other you'll learn a lot doing that because i i don't

849
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,880
know everything that's sent to me for review but i'll sure as heck know where to go and get well

850
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,840
there's a small group of us that are very lucky we're having dinner with jamie underberg tonight

851
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:55,400
but you know jamie said there's like this group of like 10 people that you always send out the

852
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:01,400
most interesting papers to and about a year ago i had forwarded a number of these onto bob

853
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:07,720
caplin and he was like hey can you put me on this email too and i i mean we'll have to think about a

854
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:13,000
way for you to create a special group where because it strikes me that there's a broader

855
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,960
group of people who would actually like to get the once a week email from tom with the most

856
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,080
interesting lipid paper i've read this week yeah i think the best way of doing that is

857
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:29,400
somehow contacting me at dr lipid or so i mean you put a lot of this stuff out on twitter yeah

858
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,360
i do so you can research it but you don't get the commentary because your emails are sometimes so

859
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,920
great because what you'll do is you'll say look i know all of you aren't going to read this 12 page

860
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:45,400
paper here's like a 300 word summary of what you would learn and then that like for me to read that

861
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:51,880
then open the paper it's like it's quick and it's just the number one i really don't want to get

862
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,360
i don't know how many people listen to peter's podcast but it's immense i don't want 4 000 emails

863
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:04,200
to mars and there's two things as part of that email one would be my interpretation of something

864
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:10,280
which is fine that's day springs of no but maybe we can i can attach pdfs to it that i might to an

865
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:15,000
isolated friend yeah because of copyrights yeah yeah that's that's that's probably the bigger issue

866
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,480
that's part of an issue also so if it's open access great and if it is i've probably tweeted it and

867
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:27,640
you best bet and look people aren't afraid to ask me questions i mean a lot of them are asking

868
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,760
i and i ignore them but i will answer it my twitter followers no you're legitimate no

869
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:40,360
either direct message you yeah yeah all right so if i don't then uh there's a reason okay so let's

870
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:46,760
get back to the business of lipids here so we've done a pretty good job explaining one side of the

871
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:52,280
equation at how cholesterol is regulated a joe austerel would be cholesterol it's the only

872
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:59,800
sterile we the animal kingdom produces yes yeah yeah cholesterol is the joe yeah okay so the other

873
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:05,400
end of this regulatory pathway so we've described the reabsorption side pretty well there's a

874
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:11,240
synthetic side which you've alluded to obviously by making the statements that hey every cell in

875
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:17,080
the body can make cholesterol and most of the time it's sufficient for its needs obviously

876
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:22,600
exceptions well i'll let you explain what the exceptions are to that there are certain scenarios

877
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,640
and certain cells where they actually do need cholesterol from other tissues but let's just go

878
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,520
back to this synthetic stuff just briefly because i don't want to give anybody too much headache

879
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:41,320
how do we make cholesterol very complexly it's a multi-stage process 20 to 30 individual steps

880
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:47,000
where one molecule is changing into another into another and at the end of the day cholesterol is

881
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,680
made and it starts very small it's basically acetyl-CoA acetyl-CoA it's two carbon two carbon

882
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:59,560
chain molecule that keeps growing in length because cholesterol has 37 carbons in it so it has to grow

883
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:06,200
through much of that growth it's just a linear structure and at a certain point this linear

884
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:12,920
structure is long enough that it bends and changes into a sterile configuration lanoestral being the

885
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:18,600
first sterile that appears in the cholesterol synthesis chain by the way if i wanted a lab and

886
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:26,280
labs with liquid chromatography and mass spec could give you a lano cost a lano sterile

887
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,680
measurement and if it was up hey you're over synthesizing cholesterol that's not the one they

888
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,560
focus on they pick a more downstream a cholesterol precursor to do that but even you could pick some

889
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,680
of the earlier ones and they do serve as markers of cholesterol synthesis you know now the

890
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:47,160
cholesterol synthetic pathway is bifurcated tell me a little bit about that so once you

891
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:54,920
go through squalene and then that bends into a ring structure lanoestral has to become cholesterol

892
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:00,840
so lanoestral and there's cross talk between the pathways but it has one or two pathways that

893
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,600
it's going to go down and at the end of the day both pathways you'll wind up with cholesterol

894
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:12,280
and no good pathways don't come with names so they do what are the names of these pathways yeah

895
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:19,560
mr facetious yes well my favorite of course is the block pathway because if you die and i told

896
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,680
he was a twitter picture i put up recently he won the nobel prize for discovering this pathway

897
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:31,160
in cholesterol so it's probably important they give you a nobel prize for discovering this

898
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:36,680
pathway of cholesterol synthesis so the block pathway would be lanoestral goes through a lot

899
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:46,600
of precursors and becomes something called desmostral desmostral looks exactly like cholesterol

900
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:53,320
except in carbon 24 there's a double bond there's no double bonds in that tail that's on

901
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:59,480
the cholesterol molecule so if i just saturate that double bond and desmostral i change it into

902
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:04,760
cholesterol and of course there's a specific enzyme that does that if you inhibit can i guess it

903
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:09,720
yes if it's just so people can understand what these enzymes mean so i remember learning this

904
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:16,120
in in college all right so med school not college enzymes always end in ace right now you just told

905
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,080
me it was carbon 24 so it's it's probably going to have something to have it's going to have a 24

906
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:26,600
in there well and we often throw deltas into these things because delta denotes the position

907
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:33,080
of the bond and did you say that desmostral has a double bond at 24 and it has to be saturated

908
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:40,120
saturated so it would probably be something like a delta 24 saturate or desaturate correct all right

909
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,960
so that would be the enzyme so when you say that when you rattle that off it sounds crazy and

910
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,640
intimidating but it's logical right it is and this is why what you were talking about before

911
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:54,360
you really have to notice stuff or you might not be able and the presence or the expression or the

912
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,480
lack of expression at that enzyme is gonna are you going to use that pathway if you're using that

913
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:03,800
and you don't convert desmostral into cholesterol you're going to have a lot of desmostral in your

914
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,920
system are there consequences to that there's a human disease called desmostral or also instead

915
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:13,640
if it occurs in utero that kid ain't coming out alive or if he does he ain't living for more than

916
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:19,400
a few days and is that disease a genetic deficiency in the enzyme delta 2040 saturated it is yeah now

917
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,600
there's another pathway ln nostril doesn't and what determines what it is if you've got a double bond

918
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:30,920
at that 24 because it's going to go through that pathway now there's a ln nostril has another

919
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:36,920
pathway that goes through that's going to wind up with cholesterol and the pre-calorissoral the pen

920
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,400
ultimate as we call it the next to the last cholesterol molecule in that chain is something

921
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:49,960
called ln nostril some people call it lathe stearl i call it ln nostril l-a-t-h-o stearl and that is

922
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:56,120
called the canned dutch russell pathway obviously after the guys who discovered that by the way they

923
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:01,160
didn't get the nobel prize for some reason even though that was i think the nobel committee said

924
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,720
we already gave one of these things out and also that you can only have three people receive a

925
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:11,720
nobel prize oh so that would be two yeah so whatever everybody else i guess who worked in

926
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:18,600
blocks lab got no credit so but anyway uh so it's the canned dutch russell pathway so and it's kind

927
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:25,080
of interesting because in most people both pathways exist and there are some ways of jumping from one

928
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:30,200
pathway to another so at the end of the day you're going to make cholesterol or so but if you want to

929
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:35,400
start interfering with these pathways there are specific enzymes in each pathway that maybe that's

930
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,200
would be something you could play with or maybe if you're building too much of something there's a

931
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,640
lack of expression of that enzyme in you which maybe has consequences maybe it doesn't so it's

932
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:52,360
all important to know but some of this may be tissue specific one of the things i know it's a

933
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,800
big topic of yours and i hope we get into today is the brain everything i've talked about cholesterol

934
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,280
today that we're measuring in the blood has zero to do with cholesterol in the brain

935
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:08,520
cholesterol lipidology in the brain is might as well be in another different body it has nothing

936
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,800
to do with what the cholesterol is going on in the rest of your body the brain makes every

937
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:21,800
cholesterol molecule it needs and therefore there are no LDL particles delivering cholesterol to

938
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:27,800
your brain so again if with super aggressive and to be clear this is because the LDL particle

939
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:33,000
just doesn't fit through the blood-brain barrier correct even htls where a little bit of their

940
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,720
cholesterol might get into it's de-lipidated through these abc things and some of that might

941
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:45,240
work its way in inconsequential amount the apo b is i guess too big the brain doesn't make apo b so

942
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:50,360
but the central nervous system has to traffic lipids from brain cells to peripheral nerve cells

943
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:59,480
apo e is the protein transporter in the brain so cholesterol or any stroller is attached to apo e

944
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:05,000
in the brain and that's how it it traffics around there or so and again i got nothing to do with the

945
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,720
apo e that's involved with whatever lipoproteins are doing in your the rest of your body also

946
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:16,360
so just understand it but obviously i want to come this is such an important topic but i absolutely

947
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,760
want to come back because i'm glad you brought it up but that said at the moment i would love to go

948
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,600
back to the synthetic stuff so you've got each cell in the body can basically start with the most

949
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:32,920
simple carbon subunit which is a two carbon subunit acetyl-CoA and through a process of carbon

950
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:41,720
fixation go on to make these very complicated four-ringed structures they first and foremost the

951
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:47,960
cell uses these things they make the important part of the cell membrane and if anyone organelle

952
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,920
membranes and deposit that's right so everything from the Golgi apparatus to the ER to this movie

953
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:58,360
or ruffier etc you also you don't have to be i think a biochemist who look at a picture of a

954
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:07,080
molecule like cortisol estrogen testosterone and i think you could show a four-year-old

955
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,400
picture of those and then a molecule of cholesterol and they would be like hey those look similar

956
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,360
yeah it's like maybe i look like my mother and father or they did they have a an origin or did

957
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:23,320
they come from that so sure so certain cells can certainly transform cholesterol into reproductive

958
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:30,040
hormones or adrenal cortical hormones certain cells hepatocytes can transform cholesterol into a bile

959
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:35,720
acid i don't think there's any other cell that can change cholesterol into anything else so when

960
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:41,000
people talk about cholesterol metabolism there is no cholesterol metabolism it can be converted

961
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,560
into something in specific tissues but it can be excreted that's it there's no other way your body

962
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:54,280
can handle so do we is there any evidence that we use cholesterol for energy zero why there's no

963
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:02,120
energy is really coming out of the saturated the fats that have the most no double bonds that's

964
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:08,360
the most they're carrying the most ATP cholesterol is not producing energy cholesterol cannot be

965
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:13,560
metabolized and produce ATP in the process i mean to me that's the bigger issue right i think

966
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,040
some people get confused about this it's not that there isn't energy in a carbon-carbon bond or a

967
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,840
carbon-hydrogen bond because that's exactly what's being liberated in the metabolism of a fatty acid

968
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:29,240
the point is we don't have the enzymatic machinery to undergo the chemical process of breaking down

969
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:35,080
those bonds and liberating the chemical energy into electrical energy can't metabolize cholesterol

970
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,040
cholesterol ester which carries that fat can be de-esterified but your cells aren't making

971
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:46,520
cholesterol ester the liver is the intestine is but the adipocytes are my hypothesis for why that's

972
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,840
the case which could be entirely bullshit and i'm just making it up but it that's what hypotheses

973
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:56,040
are their guesses is that it would have been evolutionarily dangerous if we could have

974
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:02,760
metabolized cholesterol because in periods of fasting which we all did evolutionarily the last

975
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,880
thing you want your body doing is going after cell membranes and hormones as a source of energy so i

976
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:15,000
think it's actually a very deliberate design quote i use design in quotes to say hey no matter what

977
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,280
your cholesterol and your hormones are off limits during starvation and instead we evolved this other

978
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,640
remarkable pathway of ketosis which takes an ample substrate of fats and goes down the path of

979
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:31,480
metabolizing those and actually saving our muscle from the catabolic destruction that we would

980
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:36,760
undergo if we couldn't undergo ketosis this is the brilliance of peter it to me that he can

981
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:42,120
come up with what sounds like a super plausible thing see i'm not smart entirely bullshit so i

982
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,280
can tell you how to sell got cholesterol what it can do with it but he's figured out what sounds

983
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:52,360
like a really plausible reason and everybody's so worried about depleting cholesterol in the plasma

984
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,360
is measured by LDL cholesterol which has nothing to do with anything because actually there's more

985
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,760
cholesterol in your red blood cells than their own lipoproteins and you're not making that zero

986
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:07,720
by any means by using lipid drugs or something so but you can't deplete a cell of cholesterol beyond

987
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,960
a certain amount so you're going to scrub cellular function and you can't put too much cholesterol

988
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,800
in itself because it'll crystallize and kill that cell so that's why it's so tightly regulated

989
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:25,080
synthesis it influx and efflux now are there cells under certain circumstances for whatever reason

990
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:30,200
you can't make enough cholesterol yeah there there are pediatric disorders where if you don't

991
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,600
synthesize cholesterol things happen to you and utero well the other thing we see this in and i

992
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,680
didn't i don't even know why i started noticing this but this is one of the things i used to do

993
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:43,480
in residency that used to kind of piss off some of the attendings is i would do little experiments

994
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,000
and it was always a measurement experiment so it wasn't like i was putting a patient at risk other

995
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,160
than a few more milliliters of blood were being drawn but i remember once happening on a finding

996
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:59,320
which was maybe by accident i had checked a lipid panel on a patient in the icu and i saw

997
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,760
something interesting and i kept rechecking it in other patients over and over again i kept seeing

998
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,600
this which was anytime a patient was having a SERS response that's capital s irs systemic

999
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:15,480
inflammatory response syndrome so this is the vaso you know metabolic response to sepsis

1000
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:22,920
infection trauma you name it enormous drop in hdl cholesterol and i think we could look at that

1001
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,440
today and say it's very likely that what we were seeing was in that period of profound physiologic

1002
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:35,240
stress the body is greatly ramping up its hormone production leukocorticoids and it's and others

1003
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:39,880
and that would be one of the situations where cells were actually you know hdl was now delivering

1004
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,960
cholesterol to the adrenal glands in a period of you know because that's about the most physiologically

1005
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,520
stressful thing that an organism can respond to again i don't know if that's been documented but

1006
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:53,000
it seems to me pretty logical that that would be a at least the most plausible explanation for why

1007
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,760
hdl could plummet in patients who are going through that degree of stress yes and by the way it's the

1008
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:06,280
reason you never do an all lipid profile in an acute situation because a lot of lipids are going

1009
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:12,840
to be transiently changed or so here but peter's right we know this for a lot of reasons clearly

1010
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,840
the your steroidogenic tissues need cholesterol to make their steroid hormones be they reproductive

1011
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:25,960
organs or your adrenal cortex and in the situations peter's talking about cortisone is a pretty

1012
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:33,240
useful hormone to have around or other mineralocorticoids and things like that are so so clearly

1013
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:39,480
the those organs those tissues are going to need a lot of cholesterol pools to make all that

1014
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,640
so they they turn up their synthesis rates so they make a lot of cholesterol

1015
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:51,160
but they would also tune up their hey let's gather some exogenous cholesterol so to speak

1016
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:57,640
so those cells would up regulate ldl receptors and that's a case where there's a tissue that

1017
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:03,400
might under certain circumstances pull in ldl particles full of cholesterol ester they would

1018
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:10,520
de-astarify it and use it but in a physiologic person who's not in one of these acute situations

1019
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:15,160
the adrenal gland most of the time just makes all the cholesterol it needs but if it needs a

1020
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:22,440
secondary source that's why you have hdl's hdl's have a half-life of five days one of the reasons

1021
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:28,360
they circulate for five days is it's a floating plasma reservoir of cholesterol for tissues that

1022
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:34,200
might actually need cholesterol now my nose cell that i talked about before doesn't need

1023
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,480
hdl's or anybody else to deliver cholesterol to it no other cell does except those

1024
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:45,320
steroidogenic tissues in other words to be really clear and specific you're sloughing off endothelial

1025
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:51,720
cells in your nose every day well you have to replace them the lion's share of the cholesterol

1026
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:57,800
requirement is to make a cell membrane it's just it has the machinery it has the machinery within

1027
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:04,520
the nucleus to produce that just as it's producing other structural proteins right so and this is what

1028
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:09,800
people just translate low cholesterol plasma measurements to think you're screwing up cells

1029
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,760
throughout the body and you're not yeah this is one of the challenges that i've never come up with

1030
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:20,840
a great way to explain this idea of flux which is you do a lipid measurement at a moment in time

1031
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:26,200
you're getting a snapshot of what's in the plasma at a moment in time which doesn't give you two

1032
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:30,440
pieces of information how is it changing over time and what's the movement or the velocity

1033
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,400
and secondly it gives you no insight into what's happening in the cell

1034
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:39,000
or what's happening in the endothelium for that matter and instead that's the nature of

1035
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,880
lipidology is you have to be able to extrapolate to these other things by indirect measurements

1036
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:50,440
it gives you zero insight the only usability of plasma measurements are as surrogates of

1037
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:57,880
lipoprotein defining whether you have apo b apo a1 particles and we know too many apo b particles

1038
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:05,240
your over time at big risk at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease or events

1039
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:12,760
otherwise why even measuring lipids in the plasma tells you nothing and what we're talking about you

1040
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:19,160
call it influxy flux and that nails it down but it's cholesterol homeostasis or sterile homeostasis

1041
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:27,400
and your body has evolved a lot of ways to do interesting too and say that a crisis is going

1042
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:33,240
on adrenal needs continued it's not just hey you're you cured yourself in 12 hours overnight

1043
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:39,400
you survived whatever and if that catastrophic process was ongoing HDLs eventually would run

1044
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:43,320
out of cholesterol you just said your HDL cholesterol level is plummeting and it's been

1045
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:49,160
documented many times so the HDL all of a sudden has to go back and start grabbing

1046
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:55,880
cholesterol molecules from some other tissue and get it to the steroidogenic tissue in the number

1047
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:01,640
mega place where HDLs get most of their lipidation as it goes right back to the liver and gets

1048
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,080
lipidated or what is the biggest cholesterol storage organ in the body not the liver your

1049
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:12,280
adipocytes everybody thinks adipocytes are just stirring triglycerides they're a massive

1050
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:18,440
storage organ so baby HDLs that are depleted they run back to the adipocytes which express

1051
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:24,760
this ABCA1 transporter that pumps out all their cholesterol to an HDL which boom right back to the

1052
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:31,960
adrenal gland bounces back and forth like a ping pong ball you can find all of this information and
