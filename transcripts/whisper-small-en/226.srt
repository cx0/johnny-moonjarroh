00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:16,080
Well, Arthur, this is a first in that we're doing a repeat podcast. Although unfortunately,

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,360
this time we're not in person. The last time we did a wonderful podcast, we were in person and

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,240
I enjoy that even more. You want to tell everybody what happened?

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,040
Yeah, for sure. Hi, Peter. Nice to see you again. And I wish I were down in Austin where all the

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,240
cool kids live with you too. Showing up at your podcast studio last time, we had a great conversation

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,800
for a couple of hours and then learned afterward that we hadn't turned the sound on, which it

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:50,040
turns out you need for podcasting. People can just stare at two bald guys for two hours looking like

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,560
they're talking, but that turns out to be not the most interesting programming. So we had a great

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,880
we had a great time together and now we're doing the parts here.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,200
Yeah. And then we did have a great video from that first podcast. And we actually were able to get

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,200
some people who could sort of sign it. And we even contemplated releasing it with subtitles.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,400
But in the end we decided, eh, what the heck, let's just do it again, even though it won't look as

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,600
good because we'll be on video. The good news, I think for the listener is though I have a pretty

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,160
good memory. I have an awful memory for podcasts. So, um, when I record a podcast, if you asked me

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,680
two months later, what did we talk about? If I remember two things, that's a lot. So it's almost

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,240
like we're doing this from the beginning, at least for me, because I don't really remember what we

18
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,000
talked about. And I hope that that allows us to reproduce the, uh, what I recall Gestalt wise or

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,480
valence wise was a pretty positive discussion and a really enjoyable one. Yeah, me too. I agree. And

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,400
I don't remember exactly what we talked about, except it had to do with happiness and longevity

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,680
and living a prosperous, flourishing life. I see it by the way, also that when we were together

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,960
last year, turn me onto Gia, which is, and you're drinking it right there. And I've been drinking

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,680
ever since too, by the way, I've been on a constant diet of it. It's the best. It's really nice to be

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,400
able to talk about things where the company has no idea you're promoting it because, you know,

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm paying full retail for this stuff, which is, uh, enjoyable. And yeah, I make no money off it,

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,280
have no affiliation with it, but, but do love it. And I always love when I can get somebody

27
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,880
turned on to Gia. Oh, it's so great. No, I completely agree. So I think for folks who

28
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,080
might not be familiar with you at all, um, to understand the arc of what we want to talk about,

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,800
which, um, I think there are a lot of sort of things to talk about, but the biggest arc is sort

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,880
of accepting the transitions that are inevitable in life. I mean, if I were to sort of put my finger

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,280
on one thing that resonates the most, and by the way, I went back and reread your book, uh,

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,320
because I, you know, I'd read it months ago when we did the thing. And I was like, you know, the best

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,480
thing for me to do to prepare, just to be reread it. That was really the part that stood out to me,

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,320
especially when we get to the, uh, sort of four stages of life that you talk about, as I think

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,120
about personally transitioning from the second to the third. But, um, you've lived many lives. And I,

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,600
I think for people to understand kind of that first life, which happens to be a life that has

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,000
a short half life, had you stuck with it indefinitely. So talk a little bit about

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,520
the background, uh, as a, uh, as a musician. Yeah. I mean, I'm, as a social scientist,

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,520
you don't usually dig into the background of a guy who teaches behavioral social science and,

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,080
and find classical music, but that's actually where I started. And that's where I intended to finish.

41
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,000
I intended to be a one act guy and to be, I wanted to be the greatest French horn player in the world,

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,640
which is a pretty weird ambition for most of the people listening, I would imagine. Um, but that

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,760
was also my parents ambition for me. For some reason, I started on violin at four piano at five

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,160
and I took up the French horn when I was eight and I was really good at it or I had a natural ability

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,440
in it at least. And so I did it a lot. I did it to the exclusion of nearly everything else. As a

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,960
matter of fact, and, and when it came time to go to college, I had one successful run at a year in

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,280
college and then went pro because that's really what I wanted to do. So at 19 I dropped out or,

48
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,000
you know, dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs out of college. And, and, and I went on the road

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,640
as a classical musician. I played chamber music for six years, um, all over the United States,

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,400
all over the world. And then, uh, then I, then I went to Barcelona where I was in the symphony

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,480
orchestra. And then my plan was to become a French horn soloist, um, you know, playing these great

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,400
concerti of the greatest composers. And it just didn't work out that way. And so by my late twenties,

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,080
actually by my, my, my mid twenties, I was in decline as a, as a performer. My, my technique

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,000
was getting worse. It's, it's not entirely clear why that was happening at this point,

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,360
but I had to make a plan to exit to do the next thing. And so by my late twenties, I was in college

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,400
by correspondence, which I finished a month before my 30th birthday. Then did my master's degree at

57
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,280
night, finished up my horn career at 31, started my PhD. And that was the new, the new phase,

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,440
the next phase, which was becoming a social scientist. So, so before we kind of exit that

59
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,480
first phase, I want, I want to sort of dig into that a little bit because again, as you said,

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,720
it's very foreign. I certainly can't really appreciate what you're speaking about. And I

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,680
suspect a lot of people listening can't either. Um, what is the arc of a French horn player and

62
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,920
how many exceptional, uh, French horn player talents can be consumed by the world? So for

63
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,080
example, we were talking about baseball, you know, you know, there are hundreds of people who can be

64
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,320
good enough to make a living. Uh, what is it with French horn players? Well, classical music is

65
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,880
musicians in general, there's about a 95% unemployment or underemployment rate in the

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,800
classical music industry. It's an absolute superstar industry. Now that's not like professional sports

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,440
insofar as the people are not getting rich. I mean, the great soloists, the great opera singers,

68
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,560
the great conductors are pretty wealthy, but orchestra musicians are earning a kind of a

69
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,000
middle-class upper middle-class income, but they're not really very money motivated. So they're,

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,240
they, they want to do this to almost the exclusion of anything else. And so what you find is that

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,960
there are a few, let's say, uh, probably about a hundred really great orchestras in the world,

72
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,800
each one of which has a principal French horn player and then four other French horn positions

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,960
in those orchestras. And then a few other people, a handful of other people are making a serious

74
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,960
living in playing chamber music. And they're usually about one or two French horn soloists

75
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,440
in the world at any given time. So they're not that many people making a living at it.

76
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,240
And there are a lot of people who are trying. So it's weird, you know, most people are listening

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,400
to us, they're like French horn player, what an exotic thing to want to do. And yet there are

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,520
plenty of people who are trying to do that. We're really motivated by the idea of making that kind

79
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,320
of music and are good at it and are taking every audition that they can. And what kind of commitment

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,120
was necessary to get to that level? How many hours a day were you practicing as a teenager,

81
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,160
for example? I was all in, I was practicing five, six hours a day, plus playing in every ensemble I

82
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,280
could possibly find. I was basically doing it to the exclusion of almost everything else in my life.

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,760
It was like being a gymnast. It was like being an athlete where you practice as much as you can

84
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,400
without doing damage to the musculature. So there's not just diminishing returns for athletes,

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,560
there's negative returns if you over train. And that's the same thing that happens in classical

86
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,120
music. You can get all kinds of repetitive stress injuries, et cetera, et cetera, if you do that.

87
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,400
But then the time that you're not actually actively practicing, you're listening to music,

88
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,560
you're learning the repertoire, you're thinking about what your craft actually is. So the result

89
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,200
of it is that it's almost every hour of the day is what you're doing. You're thinking about your

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,320
future, you're thinking about what you want to do, you're trying to get better in your mind as much

91
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,320
as in your lips and in your fingers to the craft. So it's very much like a sports career, just that

92
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,720
it's more fine motor skills as opposed to gross motor skills. What distinguishes the best French

93
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,040
horn player in the world from the hundredth best? Which I'm guessing I wouldn't be able to

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,640
distinguish them, but for the discerning ear, what is it that separates those two people?

95
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,040
It largely has to do with accuracy. So the French horn has a problem of physics,

96
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,920
insofar as that the mouthpiece is smaller than a trumpet mouthpiece, but it has a very long,

97
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,120
the tube is as long as the tuba, which is the largest brass instrument. So by physics,

98
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,280
it should actually play in the low register, but by mouthpiece, it should actually play in the high

99
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,760
register. And the result of that is for anybody who knows that any of the physics of these,

100
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,920
of the harmonic structure of these instruments, that harmonics are very close together, meaning

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,920
it's very easy to miss notes. That's the reason for a guy who will like classical music, and they go

102
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,160
to the orchestra, the principal French horn, notwithstanding the fact that she or he is one

103
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,080
of the best in the world is missing a lot of notes. It's just really, really hard to be accurate.

104
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,320
The greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest, they have some uncanny ability. It's sort of like

105
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,480
Nolan Ryan, who was able to hit a postage stamp at 98 miles an hour, the fastball when he's 40.

106
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,400
That's the kind of difference that you get the freakish microscopic differences. Now, yeah,

107
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,320
you probably wouldn't notice the difference if you're not a big classical music buzz,

108
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,440
and especially if you're not really into the French horn. But if I went to an orchestra

109
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,640
now and I heard the best French horn player in the world versus the hundredth, I would notice

110
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,480
the difference in a big hurry. You mentioned in your mid twenties, that if I sort of remember

111
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,400
what you said correctly, you felt you were in decline, or at least you'd peaked and you were

112
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,680
now on the way down. Two thoughts on that are two questions. The first is, is that the typical age

113
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,600
at which a French horn player peaks? And secondly, what is it you noticed that was changing?

114
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,320
Yeah, so the answer is I was peaking and declining early. The average age, now I've done this

115
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,120
research subsequently as a social scientist, not as a French horn player. I kind of knew casually

116
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,360
that brass players, the classical musicians in general, they tend to peak in terms of

117
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,720
their physical qualities, their ability to dominate the instrument in their late thirties.

118
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,400
And you start to see a little bit of drop off in their forties and fifties. The greatest players

119
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,440
in the world, the greatest piano soloists will still be touring and playing beautifully in the

120
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,080
seventies, but they're not what they once were. I mean, you find that, I mean, even in rock and roll,

121
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,480
you find that the great guitar players can shred at 40 very differently than they can at,

122
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,240
now these days, the great rock and rollers are all like a hundred at this point. The rolling

123
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,160
stones are still on tour, but you heard Mick Jagger saying recently, and it's, yeah, it's

124
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:34,840
he's reminding you of what he was doing 57 years ago when I can't get no satisfaction was released

125
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,200
and was number one of his charts. So it's usually late thirties, early forties where the peak happens,

126
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,520
then it's a slow decline. I was declining much earlier than that. And it's almost certainly

127
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,000
having to do with a microscopic terror in, in one of the lips, an injury. And that wasn't well

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,920
known at the time, but there actually are surgeries that brass players will get at this point to

129
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,280
repair that. And had I been 25 years younger, I certainly had a much longer career in music and

130
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,840
much to my own detriment because I wound up going on to something that's touching a lot more people,

131
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,600
I think, in which I actually have more possibility of doing something positive in the world. So

132
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,280
within every, what seems like a tragedy at the time is, is there's all kinds of opportunity.

133
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,880
Now, I've heard you say in the past that when you started going back to night school for college and

134
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,880
ultimately for your bachelor's and master's degree, you were a little bit ashamed. You're

135
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,040
kind of doing this in secret, right? Why is that? Classical musicians think nothing else matters.

136
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,640
It's one of these, it's a cult, basically. It's not, it's not a profession. It's more like a cult.

137
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,960
So it's like a lot of, my son would, my oldest son would have Princeton and my younger son is in

138
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,200
the Marines. Those are cults too, right? And so if you basically say to someone, your friends in the

139
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,280
Marines, you know, I'm getting out, but I think I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna re-up,

140
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,960
but in the Navy, they'll laugh you out. I mean, that's just like, that's, you just wouldn't do

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,200
that. Well, that's what it's like in classical music that I remember one time I was hanging

142
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,720
around with this group of brass players and I was probably 28 years old or something. And it was,

143
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I knew the writing was on the wall and I wasn't telling anybody. I was actually studying at night

144
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,640
serendipitously. And this woman who hangs out with us, she's also a French horn player. She,

145
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,960
you know, says, I got an announcement. We're like, hey, what, what happened? You went and auditioned,

146
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,000
man? She says, nah, I decided I'm going to leave the business. I just got a full scholarship at the

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,840
University of Miami. I'm going to become a, to the medical school. I'm going to become a surgeon.

148
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,720
And, and then, and, and she leaves, you know, after a little while, we're all sitting around going,

149
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,960
see, she didn't have it. It's like, she's going to become a surgeon. I mean, this is,

150
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,400
that's a big deal, but it wasn't to us. It was just like, obviously she didn't have it. So she

151
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,680
had to quit her crummy, low paying French horn playing career to settle for becoming a, you know,

152
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:52,360
a lifesaving doctor like you, Peter. So what did you study for your bachelor's? Economics. And I

153
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,680
didn't intend to do that. I actually intended to get my, you know, my bachelor's degree in some,

154
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,400
you know, some area of the humanities or maybe even composition. I was a pretty avid composer.

155
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,800
And I thought that that's what I would do, but I took an economics class and it just opened my

156
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,000
eyes. I mean, just the, I statistically based social sciences, it felt like I had a magic wand

157
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
or some actually more like a, you know, crystal ball. That's a better metaphor. I mean, I could

158
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,560
see things about the world. And furthermore, I could actually analyze behavior in ways that I

159
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,320
never, I didn't even think was possible. I felt like I was, you know, those whole world of

160
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,200
information to be able to generate information was being open to me. I was just, my mind was

161
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,440
blown. I was completely hooked and I wanted to become, becoming an economist, you know,

162
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,680
talk about the sublime to the dismal. And then did you go straight from bachelor's to master's?

163
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,440
At what point did you formally hang up your French horn and say, I'm going to pursue the PhD. Where

164
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,840
did, where did that occur in the timeline? So I finished my bachelor's degree completely

165
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,280
by correspondence. And in those days I was faxing in my assignments and buying course materials,

166
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,920
you know, over the phone from the, from the bookstores of these universities that offered

167
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,800
these correspondence school courses. And I was banking the credits at this state college in New

168
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,640
Jersey at the time that I never visited. I never saw the place until I went there. They gave me an

169
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,000
honorary doctorate 20 years later and I went and gave the graduation speech. I mean, what's the

170
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,600
graduation for correspondence school? Is it like 10 guys around a conference table? It turns out

171
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,920
there was 3000 people in the Trenton ice rink. It was, it was fun. I was wild. I mean, it was

172
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,720
mostly first-generation college graduates, a lot of active military men. I was very proud that day

173
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,760
to be among that group, you know, of, of really sort of American life entrepreneurs. It made me

174
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,960
very proud. And then I went on to the state, the local state university, and at night did my master's

175
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:44,280
degree, a one-year master's degree. And at that point, I mean, it was Fisher cut bait. And so I,

176
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,320
I left music at that point after that, and, and, and went away residentially and more traditionally

177
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,120
started my PhD and over the next four years finished my PhD. And what was the focus of your

178
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,320
PhD? My PhD was in quantitative policy analysis. So I was doing mathematical modeling and applied

179
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,200
microeconomics for public policy. I was working at the same time as a military operations research

180
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,000
analyst for the Rand corporation. I was doing theater level combat modeling for the air force.

181
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,840
So I was doing, you know, large scale, early artificial intelligence algorithms to link

182
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,080
computers up together to simulate battle situations across a lot of scenarios. So I was

183
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,760
learning a lot of math modeling. And that was a real weakness for me was my mathematics and

184
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,360
statistics. So working in that area was critically important for me to beef that up and, and, and

185
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,440
become a well-rounded scholar in the area where I had previously had weakness. And what did you do

186
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,680
right after that? You went, you became a professor, if I'm not mistaken, before you went to AI, right?

187
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,920
No, no, I was, I was 10 years as a professor then. So I graduated when I was 34 for my PhD. And I

188
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,960
went to Georgia state university in Atlanta for three years. And then I went to, I was able to

189
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,440
secure a position at Syracuse, which for public policy is the best school in the country. That was,

190
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,440
that was a really great opportunity. I will always be grateful to that place for giving me that

191
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,120
opportunity. And I moved to Syracuse and we spent the next seven years at Syracuse. And I, you know,

192
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,400
I did what academics do, you know, I was writing academic journal articles, refereed 14 readers,

193
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,080
highly technical writing papers that were mathematically so complex that now at age 58,

194
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:23,160
I can't read them. I actually don't know what I was talking about at 35, which speaks to a lot

195
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,560
of what I do now, which is the changing structure of the prefrontal cortex and our ability to learn

196
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,480
and perform at different phases of life. What are we good at then? And what are we good at now?

197
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,680
So I want to come back to that. Cause of course that's really the important hook here, but I just

198
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,080
want to go to this next chapter. Cause I want to understand when you understood this shift in

199
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,000
intelligence. So from Syracuse, you then went to AEI. You were the CEO for about a decade,

200
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,880
if I'm not mistaken, almost 11 years. Yeah. Before leaving to join the faculty at Harvard,

201
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,840
where you are today. At what point during this journey, did you begin to understand

202
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,600
what it is that you've now written about in strength to strength? So when I was, I went to

203
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,320
AEI and for those who don't know the American enterprise Institute is a think tank in Washington,

204
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:17,080
DC. It's a think tank is like a university without students. It's completely dedicated to

205
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,720
high quality academic research, but in, in, in the service of better public policy. So it's in the

206
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,200
middle of Washington, DC. It's one of the oldest think tanks in the world. It started in 1938 during

207
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,240
the great recession, the great depression to poll the United States and the world. They thought

208
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,280
out of the great depression using the tools of the American free enterprise system, but they had

209
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,960
to bring together the greatest economists and later foreign policy experts in health and education

210
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,800
experts. So I had 300 employees. I had to raise about $50 million a year in philanthropy. You

211
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,600
know, my job was like running for the Senate and never getting elected. And I did that, you know,

212
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,520
for 10 years, it was, it was, you know, it was actually kind of a slog. I mean, there's an 80

213
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,240
hour a week CEO job. And I noticed about halfway through that my skills were kind of changing. I

214
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,080
was getting worse at certain things and I was getting better at other things. I didn't actually

215
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,120
understand why that was. I found that I was, I was getting worse at thinking up brand spanking,

216
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,400
new, clever ideas. And I was getting much better at explaining things. I was becoming effectively

217
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,480
a better teacher, a better instructor, but I was worse as a classic innovator. When I had first

218
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,680
come to AEI, I was developing new programs. I was coming up with these new big policy and

219
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,480
research ideas. And about halfway through, I was noticing that what I was really good at was

220
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,920
synthesizing everybody else's ideas and putting them together into a relatively compelling argument

221
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,640
about how we should do things, which was interesting to me. But it also occurred to me that it was

222
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,680
probably more to it than that. And I got to work on what, where this was going to lead in my own

223
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,480
life such that I could exploit my own strengths optimally. And I started looking at the research

224
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,080
on different forms of intelligence as people get older. What it led me to conclude based on the

225
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:04,120
work of a lot of social psychologists that were doing intelligence work in the 1960s and 70s,

226
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,680
actually, it was older work out of the UK, primarily the work of Raymond Cattell, is that early on we

227
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,400
have a fluid intelligence, which is largely our innovative capacity based on working memory,

228
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,000
where we can do a lot of things alone and come up with brand new ideas based on kind of limited

229
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,480
background. Later on, we're less good at that, but we're much better at synthesizing ideas. We have

230
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,880
a vast library, much less working memory, but a much better vocabulary, pattern recognition,

231
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,120
and ability to synthesize ideas of other people, which is called crystallized intelligence.

232
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,320
Now, what we find is that fluid intelligence tends to peak in the late 30s, which is, by the way,

233
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,360
why a lot of classical musicians are picking in their late 30s is because fluid intelligence is

234
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,200
not just about writing mathematical formulas. It's about doing a lot of things that make you great

235
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,880
with your 10,000 hours of practice and your mastery, et cetera, et cetera. And then it

236
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,120
declines in your 40s and 50s, but your crystallized intelligence, your teaching capacity,

237
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,080
your explaining capacity, your pattern recognition, your management of other people, that those things

238
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,640
get better through your 40s and 50s and 60s and stay high in your 70s and 80s. When I saw that,

239
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,960
I thought, hmm, what am I going to do? What's my plan so that I can exploit that for the rest

240
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,080
of my career? And that's actually what led me to quit my CEO job and to do what I do now,

241
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,480
which is writing and speaking and teaching, really using my creative capacities to mix

242
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,120
ideas together about happiness, which is my main area of focus and research.

243
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,880
Now, these terms, fluid and crystallized intelligence, the first time I ever encountered them,

244
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,400
I think is about four years ago in an Atlantic piece that you wrote. I think it was in the

245
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,920
Atlantic. Obviously, this was a precursor to the book. Does that sound about right?

246
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,960
That's exactly right. That was in July of 2019. And that was when I first wrote that piece,

247
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,400
I was doing this research for myself. It was me search, Peter, which is what we all do. I mean,

248
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,920
it's like, you know, people think, ah, Peter Attia, the great longevity doctor. Well, Peter

249
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,760
Attia wants to live a long time with good lifespan and health span and happiness span.

250
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,680
And so that's why he's doing this work. And that's exactly why I was doing that work as well.

251
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,040
And it was so I found that it was so useful to audiences that I wrote it up for the Atlantic.

252
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,000
And if you know this, how to go from strength to strength in your life, that article was one of the

253
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,800
50 most read articles of the entire year of all publications in the world. And I thought,

254
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,000
it turns out I'm not the only one who's thinking about this. And so I wrote it up in a book over

255
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,680
the next couple of years and published it in February of 2022.

256
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Now, what I don't recall, though, I'm sure you explained it in the article, are those

257
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,160
terms, fluid and crystallized terms you came up with or are those in the literature and you're

258
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,160
simply bringing them to our attention? Those are in the literature that that was they were coined

259
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,400
by Raymond Cattell, the social psychologist I talked about later. And his findings were

260
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,280
replicated. And and of course, the social psychology then expanded into the neuroscience

261
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,480
literature. This is the way that the world is going. I mean, social psychology was kind of

262
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,680
the whole show through the 50s and 60s and 70s. And since about the 90s and especially this

263
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,240
century, neuroscience is really getting into the game. So the neuroscientists have started to

264
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,080
replicate these these two curves and finding the strength and some of the neurophysiological

265
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,600
reasons for these strengths that are occurring as well. In the in your book, you open, I think you

266
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,120
open with this story about being on an airplane sitting in front of an older gentleman who's

267
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,440
well, I'll let you tell the story because I want to I want to hear the story. And I'm also curious

268
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,520
where that experience occurred in your personal evolution of this. Yeah, I was thinking halfway

269
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:47,240
through my time as a CEO, you know, where kind of where does it go? I mean, it's it's crazy. I mean,

270
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,560
you run a company, I mean, you know what it means to actually run a business. But sometimes you

271
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,880
think, you know, I'm going to turn my I'm going to do my homework and turn it in and things are

272
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,480
going to get better. And then it's going to stop. Well, when and under what circumstances and what

273
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,680
does that mean? What is the end goal? What is my intention with all that is very funny. It's

274
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,000
mean, that's a I remember feeling a kind of an existential crisis about that. And I was thinking

275
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,920
about it a lot. And around that time, I was doing what I always did, which was sit on a plane and

276
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,000
with my laptop. And I was coming back on a long cross country flight from LA to to DC is this

277
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,120
flight that leaves LA at five o'clock in the afternoon, gets in about one o'clock in the

278
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:33,000
morning into the into Dulles. And I took it a lot. And and one night I was listening to this guy

279
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,720
telling his wife that he might as well be dead. And his wife was consoling, he was very

280
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,320
disconsolute. I couldn't quite make out his words, but her words were very penetrating. So I was just

281
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,720
hearing the answers. Oh, don't say it would be better if you were dead. And then it's not true.

282
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,360
Nobody remembers you or cares about you or loves you anymore. It's just it was just awful. And,

283
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,600
I thought, you know, this guy is, you know, somebody who's not Peter Attia. I mean, this is

284
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,520
somebody who, you know, he hasn't lived up to his own personal standards. He hasn't had the

285
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,960
opportunities. He hasn't pursued the education and started the business. And and now it's kind

286
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,440
of near the end. I could tell by their voices that they were in. They were elderly. And at the end

287
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,360
of the flight, I was kind of curious just to give a little look. And the lights went on. I

288
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,040
stood up and I turned around. It was one of the most famous men in the world. This is somebody who

289
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,440
is not controversial. He's not some, you know, actor or politician. This is somebody who's

290
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,840
justifiably considered a hero by many millions of people for his his, you know, his achievements,

291
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:34,760
his accomplishments in the in the 1970s, 1980s and and before that as well. And and and he evidently

292
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,760
is living a real life of regret because those times are long past. And I got this window onto

293
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,880
his soul. Now, when we were leaving the plane, the pilots like, you know, thanks for flying

294
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,120
United folks like that was doing. And he looks through me like a pane of glass. I mean, why

295
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,280
wouldn't he? He sees the guy behind me and he recognizes him and he says, sir, you've been my

296
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,520
hero since I was a little boy. And I turned around and he's beaming with pride and joy. And I thought

297
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,400
to myself, which is the real guy? And then I had a selfish thought, which is how can I be not that

298
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,760
first guy? How can I structure? Look, I'm trying to I'm not going to be the hero on the plane, Peter,

299
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,120
but I'm trying to do a lot with my life. You know, I'm trying to live to the max to create

300
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,920
to have a contribution to achieve a lot. And which has some pathologies attached to it as well. I

301
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,840
write about this in my research now about the success addiction and the workaholism that's

302
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,520
attendant to that. And then and the neuroscience behind those addictions as well. But what can I

303
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,800
do so that the rug is not pulled out from under me? And I'm telling my long suffering wife, Esther,

304
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,720
on a plane in 30 years that I might as well be dead. And and that's what really led to this

305
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,680
research project that led to the book. Let's define happiness. I don't think I understand

306
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,960
what it really is. And given that it's your business effectively, it's what you teach,

307
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,160
it's what you write about. It's the thing you think about as much as I think about, you know,

308
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,920
sort of the longevity component of biology. I'm sure you get asked this question all the time.

309
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,280
And I'm sure you've got a 30 second answer. And I'm sure you've got a three hour answer.

310
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,320
Take it in any direction you like. Yeah, I've got a semester long answer,

311
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,640
which is the class I teach at the Harvard Business School, which is what is it and how do you get it?

312
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,880
And the reason for that is that by the time my students reach me, my graduate students at Harvard

313
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,160
reach me, a lot of them are realizing that the world's promises are empty, that, you know,

314
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,120
the money, power, pleasure and fame that are supposed to bring you undying happiness are

315
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,320
false promises. They're a bill of goods. They couldn't be instrumental to getting what you

316
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,720
want, but they can't intrinsically give you the satisfaction you desire. So I start in the first

317
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,760
day of class and say, OK, guys, I mean, you you spent all your all your elective points getting

318
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,400
into the class because they have a competitive system to get these electives. And the class

319
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,600
fills in like nine seconds its happiness after all, who are the free candy kids. And there's

320
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,560
hundreds of people on the waiting list for this class. I say, OK, you you made a commitment to

321
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,200
getting this class. You must know what happiness is. As I go around, I cold call what's happiness?

322
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,080
They'll say, it's that feeling I get on Thanksgiving and, you know, yada, yada, yada, feelings, feelings

323
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,200
that are wrong. Happiness is not a feeling any more than your Thanksgiving dinner is the smell

324
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,040
of the turkey. The feeling of happiness is evidence of happiness. Now, we measure happiness

325
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,440
in all sorts of very complicated and very simple ways. And one of the things that we know is that

326
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,280
all of the people who are really happy, who have a lot of happy feelings, but also have a lot of

327
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,720
satisfaction content with their lives, they're basically they're they're getting abundance

328
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,560
and balance across three dimensions. And so this is the the definition of happiness. I'll think about

329
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,360
this like if I were to say, hey, Peter, what is the Thanksgiving dinner? You'd say, well, carbohydrates,

330
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,000
proteins and fat, you know, you'd say there's the three macronutrients of all food. And, you know,

331
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,760
we're always trying to get our macros in order. Right. And so and so you talk about forget lifespan,

332
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,760
let's talk about health span. And I say, let's take it even farther to happiness span. So let's

333
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,120
get our literal macronutrients in order for health span, let's get our happiness span in order with

334
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,440
the macronutrients of happiness. They are enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose. Those are the three

335
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,240
macronutrients of happiness. If you don't have those things in balance and abundance, you will

336
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,640
not report being a happy person. Now, this is different than unhappiness, which is another

337
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,600
entire subject, believe it or not. Happiness and unhappiness are not opposites. They're different

338
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,280
phenomena. So we're just talking about happiness here to be a truly happy person. You need to enjoy

339
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,840
your life. And that requires not pleasure. It's it's pleasure plus elevation is pleasure plus,

340
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,440
plus metacognition. And so, you know, Thanksgiving dinner fills your belly and tastes good. That's

341
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,720
pleasure. But the the experience that you have of consuming the Thanksgiving dinner with other

342
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,480
people and having a memory that you can last forever, that's enjoyment. And so it's a much

343
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,800
more elevated experience than pleasure. Satisfaction, which is super fleeting and troublesome. And,

344
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,720
you know, as Mick Jagger saying, I can't get no satisfaction. The truth is, you can't keep

345
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,920
no satisfaction. There's an entire research literature on that that I've participated in on

346
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,680
the problem with satisfaction, but it's the joy and reward for a job well done and a goal met,

347
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,880
you know, that elation from actually meeting a goal. And last but not least, is purpose,

348
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,480
is meaning in life. You know, I talk an awful lot about the coherence, the significance, the

349
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,000
direction, these are the the meaning of meaning. And it gets back to a lot of the great philosophy,

350
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,560
but we can also measure it. And I can even have a few diagnostic questions that I asked for the

351
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,200
clients who come to me and they'd lack purpose in their life. The questions I asked are why,

352
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,720
why were you born and for what are you willing to die? And if you can't answer one or both of those

353
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,240
questions, you're going to give a serious meaning problem. We got to dig in and actually solve that

354
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,080
particular problem. But that's it. I mean, these are the three macronutrients, the protein,

355
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,200
carbohydrates and fat of happiness or enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose.

356
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,520
There's so much I want to touch on there. I'll start with the latter. I have to be honest with

357
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,400
you and I've thought about this a lot. In terms of purpose, I literally can only think of one

358
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:17,320
thing. And I suspect a lot of people will think of this, which is kids. I think that's probably

359
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,160
the only thing I'm I would say I have a real purpose for that I would die for in a second and

360
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:30,600
think nothing of. Is it bad that I don't have a higher purpose than that? Well, it sort of

361
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,240
depends on what the higher purpose means. One of the things that you find is that the one of the

362
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,280
habits of the happiest people is and this is different than the micro maybe think of this

363
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,000
as the dishes and the happiness meals, as opposed to the mic, the macronutrients and happiness meal,

364
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,120
the happiest people, they all have a transcendental understanding of life, which is that it's just to

365
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,320
say that they have an understanding of life bigger than themselves. But the most miserable people,

366
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,880
the people who lack happiness and have a lot of unhappiness, they're focusing on me, me, me,

367
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,240
me, me, the philosophers talk about the I self and the me self and the I self is outward looking.

368
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:12,440
It's observational, it's sort of Zen. The me self is reflective of the outside world. It has a lot

369
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,640
to do with social comparison. It has a lot to do with the micro circumstances, you know, like

370
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,440
my job, my money, my career, my friends, my house, my mortgage, my commute, me, me, it's just so boring.

371
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,320
And a transcendental understanding of life is key to a happy life because you need peace.

372
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,320
You need perspective. You need to zoom out. When the Dalai Lama says, you're one in seven billion,

373
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,440
what he's saying is not that you're insignificant or you're the speck. What he's saying is that you

374
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,520
need to stop focusing on yourself so you can actually get some relief for once in a while.

375
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,560
So that might be the higher purpose, but it's just a transcendental purpose and understanding

376
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,800
of something bigger than yourself. So that's another thing. And I know you have that. I know

377
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,800
you think about things that are bigger than you. And part of that is your family and part of that's

378
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,200
your kids. But part of that is an understanding of the universe. Yeah, I guess it's interesting. I

379
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:10,840
mean, coming back to the kids thing, I think one of my greatest fears of aging is less about the

380
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:20,280
physical changes of aging and more about kids being out of the house. And again, I think a lot

381
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,760
of parents probably feel that way, which is it's so enjoyable to have young kids around, even though

382
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,400
it's hard, right? It's like a two-edged sword. But I can't imagine how quiet a house would be without

383
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:39,080
them. And I don't know, sometimes I think like I'm not really sure how enjoyable life would be

384
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,880
when they're gone. Because when they're gone, they're gone. You know, recently I posted something

385
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,360
on Instagram that I found really depressing, which was a chart of the fraction of time that people

386
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,720
spend with others in their life over the course of their life. So it's kind of like the x-axis is time

387
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,560
and the y-axis is percent spent with each entity and its various curves. And the one that just

388
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,960
depressed the hell out of me was time with your kids, which basically corresponds to once they

389
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,320
turn 18, it just plummets. Now you've got kids that are all, you have three kids, right? Yeah,

390
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:20,760
my three kids have grown up. My youngest is 19 and in Spain in college. So yeah, so I know all

391
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,760
about how the empty nest works. And there were times, I mean, like I've been in your house and

392
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,520
there's a lot of Legos on the ground. And it's, I mean, there's a lot of chaos that comes from

393
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,240
little kids. And I remember that and my wife and I, we said, you know, what's it going to be like

394
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,720
when actually, you know, they grow up and move out. And it is very different and it's very

395
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,560
disconcerting. And it's kind of new to us quite frankly. But the key is, and this is one of the

396
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:51,480
most important things for a happy life is, is a partnership with somebody who will be the last

397
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,880
person on whom you lay your eyes as you take your dying breath. That's really, really important. A

398
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,680
companion that love that is your wife. That's all that turns out to be much more indicative

399
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,080
of your happiness than actually getting the, you know, developing and having a relationship

400
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,760
with your kids because your kids are turning into different people every single year.

401
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,360
I mean, that's super fun and that's super interesting, but that's actually not the key.

402
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,000
The people who suffer the most from empty nest syndrome is not the empty nest. It's the fact

403
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,120
that they're only with one other bird and they don't really like that bird very much. That's the

404
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,520
real problem is when it comes in. And that's one of the things that I talk about with my students.

405
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,360
And by the way, I'm doing lots of executive teaching these days. And it's what I'm talking

406
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,480
about with people our age too, is the goal of your marriage is not passion, it's friendship.

407
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,360
This is the goal. You must be close friends, ideally best friends with your spouse such that

408
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,800
your kids, they grow up and they move away. And then you have your grandkids. I'm probably going

409
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,440
to have grandkids with them. My oldest son is Mary and you know, they're going to have kids

410
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,440
quick. I bet. I mean, I don't know. I mean, you can tell that I'm projecting and praying about

411
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,040
this, but, but you know, then I'll have grandkids and it'll be a different experience, but I'm going

412
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,960
to be with my wife Esther and until, you know, death do us part. So that has to be the juice of,

413
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,080
you know, who, who of the relationship or, or the love that actually makes true happiness and

414
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,440
love truly is the great secret of happiness. Yeah. I mean, that, that, that's the one saving

415
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,400
grace is, as I feel very fortunate that my, my wife and I are, we joke that we're the best

416
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,280
roommates in the world. Right. And so, um, there, I think we'll have a lot to enjoy in, in, in that

417
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,040
transition is the implication of that though, Arthur, that, cause I don't think it is, but how,

418
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,280
how do we reconcile then a person who chooses not to have a partner? Yeah. So the key is with,

419
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,240
there are some people who do really, really well on their own. They're, they, you know,

420
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,880
introverts who like to live alone, for example, and loneliness is not the same thing as solitude.

421
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,600
Isolation and solitude are very, very different phenomena, but they're, by the way, they're

422
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,160
neurocognitively different phenomena. They affect the brain in different ways. And, and, and so

423
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,280
isolation is always bad, but, but solitude is not, as a matter of fact, we all need it. We need it in

424
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,200
different levels. That's point one point two. And actually this is based on the Harvard study of

425
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,480
adults. And, and sorry, just to interrupt for a sec, Arthur, you can be lonely in a relationship.

426
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,800
Oh, for sure. And you can be in solitude and not be lonely. Absolutely. One of the greatest

427
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,000
predictors of divorce is, is partners who are lonely while living together. And this is the

428
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,400
big, and this gets back to the big danger of the empty nest syndrome is that the only thing you

429
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,680
have in common is your kids. And that one point of commonality disappears and you're sitting across

430
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,680
the table blinking at each other during dinner, not talking, because you literally don't have anything

431
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,280
to talk about. That's, that's really, that's metastatically awful for a relationship. And so

432
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,320
that's why it's critically important that couples have something in common besides their kids,

433
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,320
that they're practicing their religion together. They're practicing interest together. They're

434
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,560
reading the same things. They're on the same philosophical journey together. I mean, one of

435
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,480
the things that I talk about with, with couples is that they should develop philosophical interests

436
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,840
in common. They're talking about deep things. And, and, you know, so it, the, the gold standards

437
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,480
that your kids are like, ah, mom and dad are talking about Kierkegaard again, or whatever.

438
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,120
I mean, it's got to be something that's bigger than digit change is diaper, because, you know,

439
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,880
that, that's not going to be something you have in common forever. And you're going to be lonely

440
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,880
inside your relationship. The second big point, however, is that whereas most of the truly happy

441
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,000
people, as they get older, they do have a spousal partner where that's companion in terms of his love,

442
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,040
which also has some passion, but the companionate part is ascendant throughout, you know, the,

443
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,720
throughout your marriage, whereas the passion part is not as high as it used to be. And that's

444
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,040
completely okay. That's healthy, normal, and actually advisable because it's more sustainable

445
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,080
over the long run. But some people are very happy and don't have that. What do they have in common?

446
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:57,560
Very, very close, personal, lifelong friends. So here's the key. If you don't have a spouse,

447
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,680
you need real friends. These are people who know your secrets, who would take your 2am phone call

448
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,560
and that you talk to a lot. Now, that doesn't mean that if you're married, you don't need that.

449
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,640
Because, you know, when I talk to, especially men, men are horrible at real friendships. They're the

450
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,880
worst. You know, they got lots of deal friends, but no real friends a lot of the time, especially if

451
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,440
they're really successful in business. And so we'll say, okay, name two guys or whoever,

452
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,520
who are real friends beside your spouse. And they're like, yeah, so and so and so and so and so.

453
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,720
So what was the last time you talked to him? It's like, I don't know, four months ago,

454
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,760
not a close friend. That's just the case. And so you got to work on these things for sure,

455
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,680
for a lot of reasons, besides the fact that it's just healthy and good. You also might at some

456
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,440
point be left alone if you're if you're widowed. And you don't want to be alone in the world under

457
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,760
those circumstances. That's really corrosive. That's one of the reasons that men do so poorly

458
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,920
when they lose their wives to death. Because a lot of them don't have real friendships to backfill

459
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,120
any of this need in their souls. Why? Well, actually, before I ask you that the gender

460
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,280
differences there, can you give me a few other characteristics or features that differentiate

461
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,600
deal friends from real friends? Yeah, so this is actually an Aristotelian notion, believe it or

462
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,600
not. And we do a lot of this stuff in our, you know, mathematical social sciences as well. But

463
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,640
all the things that we do in behavioral social sciences now, all we're doing is we're just

464
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,080
exposing the ancients to empirical scrutiny. And, you know, we're just testing whether or not

465
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,160
Aristotle was right, which he always is. So Aristotle wrote a lot about friendships. And

466
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,600
he talked about these, these escalating levels of friendship in terms of the satisfaction they bring

467
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,320
and the virtue that they bring to our lives at the lowest level is the friendships of transaction.

468
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,280
So these are, you know, friendships where people work together, and they're really, you know,

469
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,760
you're a shirt manufacturer, and you've got a guy who sells you cloth. And your friends like, you

470
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,960
know, you probably really are. I mean, you like him, he likes you, you're really friendly with

471
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,800
each other, you take care not to offend each other. But if you stop making shirts, you're probably

472
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,000
not going to continue that relationship. Above that are relationships of admiration or beauty,

473
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
where you admire each other, you know, and that's a really good thing too. But that's dependent on

474
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,600
a particular quality. The perfect friendship or the friendship of virtue is just inherently

475
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:10,520
satisfying. You'll like being together, frequently, it'll revolve around a third kind of useless thing

476
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,840
like baseball, right? It'll be, it'll be that thing. This is what guys do. It's like, I don't

477
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,240
know, what do you guys do together? I don't know, we build birdhouses or whatever it happens to be.

478
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,520
And it's that third thing that is the kind of the focus. But what you're doing in parallel is

479
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,920
developing a very beautiful friendship of that's a very positive link. And that's what these real

480
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,040
friendships have in common. They're intrinsically satisfying, and they're frequently focused on the

481
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,440
cosmic therapy. It doesn't have to be useless, by the way. I mean, I have a very close friend,

482
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,440
one of my very closest friends is he's in Atlanta, and we have the same religion. And we talk about

483
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,240
that a lot. And our discussions about that are quite deep. And he also wants to know what's going

484
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,880
on with my marriage and my kids. And he knows my secrets is the bottom line.

485
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,000
You alluded to something that I think most people intuitively would appreciate. But I'm curious as

486
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,960
to why. What is it about men that makes it harder for us to have those really deep friendships?

487
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,680
Again, if I were to consider my parents, you know, I don't think my father has one

488
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,800
such friendship. I think my mother has many. I mean, really many. She's rich in friendship.

489
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,720
Maybe they're an extreme example. Why do you think that is?

490
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,840
Well, there's some generational differences between men and women, and there are probably

491
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,480
some intrinsic differences as well. The generational differences largely have to do with the fact that

492
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,760
in conventional family setups, I mean, I'm going to guess that your dad was super hardworking.

493
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,080
He probably was busting his pick all the way through your childhood. He put you through

494
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,040
college. He did all that stuff. And he knew that he was gone all day. And that if he went

495
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,520
out to goof around with his buddies after work, he was stealing from his family. And so he came

496
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:54,120
home. The truth was that his intimate relationships were in his family and his business

497
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,040
relationships were at work. And there was a firewall between the two such that he could afford

498
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,520
to spend adequate time where he had adequate time to spend with his family. And so it was a very

499
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,560
traditional situation. Meanwhile, your mom was making sure that you kids were, you know,

500
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,960
properly brought up and you had friends and she knew your friends' mothers. And the result was

501
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,400
that she was reinforcing friendship relationships and therefore getting better at them. Now, the

502
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,320
distressing thing is that friendship is a skill that requires practice. It's like a muscle. And

503
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,480
it will atrophy. You can get worse and worse at friendships. And so I'll meet these 60-year-old

504
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,400
guys. Guys who are a little older than me, and they'll be like, what do you want me to do? Call

505
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,160
up some other dude and ask for a play date? I mean, how does one do this? I don't know how to do this.

506
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,520
I haven't had a real friend since I was in college. And ever since then, then I got married and,

507
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,040
you know, had my family and I worked really, really hard and now I'm lonely. And so what do

508
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,160
you expect me to do? And the answer is you have to actually learn how to make and maintain friends,

509
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,120
real friendships. And that's a skill that a lot of men lose because of our traditional social

510
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,080
circumstances. So what do you say to that guy? So the 60-year-old guy comes to you and let's make

511
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:09,720
this a dramatic case. He and his wife have divorced or she's died. His kids are grown up.

512
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,000
And using the example you said, I mean, this is a guy who hasn't had an intimate friendship

513
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,920
with somebody in 40 years. And let's say he's bought into what you're saying, which is

514
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,720
a crucial part of his happiness for the remainder of his life is going to be

515
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,960
intimacy through friendships. And maybe some of those are not platonic, right? Maybe he meets

516
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,520
another woman, but let's focus on the platonic side of that. Yeah. So the truth is, it's not

517
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,160
an easy nut to crack, but you have to do the work like anything else. You can, we know that there's

518
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,840
enough plasticity in the brain and there's enough emotional plasticity as well that we can learn

519
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,800
all kinds of new skills. I mean, people can learn lots of skills. They can't be as good playing the

520
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,800
cello starting at 70 as if they started at seven. We know that to be a fact, but you can get plenty

521
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,880
good at stuff. And that includes social skills, but you have to be committed to doing the work.

522
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,680
What a lot of guys want is like, okay, I just thought great. That's a good advice, professor.

523
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,040
You know, I'm going to go out and get some help me get some friends. Like you, it's going to take

524
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,880
time. It took your wife years and years and years and years to build up her friend group.

525
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,600
It's going to take you some time as well, but you actually have to start putting into work.

526
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,040
That has to do with actually making yourself available and vulnerable to other people. That

527
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,520
means actually hanging out with other people and saying, and taking the time. A lot of guys will

528
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,080
be like, I don't want to go have dinner with some guy. Well, you got to go have dinner with some guy.

529
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,920
Furthermore, you actually have to ask that other guy questions about his kids and be interested in

530
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,200
that other person. That sounds so obvious, but these are skills that a lot of men have lost or

531
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,200
never really cultivated over the course of their lives. So you can go through these basic social

532
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,160
skills and they're sort of mystifying to a lot of guys. But once they do it, I've seen case after

533
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,080
case, because I've been coaching people on this now for a couple of years since this research has

534
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,800
started to get some prominence and I've seen amazing progress from people who are older than me.

535
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,400
Let's go back to the three components of happiness. The one that we didn't really touch on is

536
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,480
satisfaction. You've obviously alluded to the Rolling Stones tune, which speaks to how fleeting

537
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:28,040
it is. I wonder then why it's included, because whenever I think of satisfaction,

538
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,880
I echo that sentiment, right? Which is like, I'll have some goal. And I mean, I think of,

539
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,080
I can't think of a single goal I've had, including ones that took me years to achieve,

540
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:49,160
where the moment I achieved it, I mean, I don't think I'm being facetious to say within five

541
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,680
minutes. I'm thinking about the next one. And I mean, that's a very depressing thought. So

542
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,520
given the sort of fleeting nature of satisfaction, why is it even a component of happiness?

543
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,840
Well, you're not a typical case, Peter. And part of the reason is because you're doing an unusual

544
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:15,800
and unusually difficult success oriented thing. Not only are you working for your own success,

545
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,360
you're working for your client's success. And so you're an addict for your success,

546
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,720
you're an addict for other people's success. Now let's talk about a more typical profile.

547
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,760
Most people are not going through life thinking, I'm going to get this great big thing, and then

548
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,080
running for the next great big thing and next great big thing after that. Most people are not

549
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,720
thinking about their achievements in exactly the same way or the same scale as you. Most people

550
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:48,440
have sources of satisfaction, which is a reward for getting to the end of the day, a reward that

551
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,320
feels like a real reward to get through the week and to get to Saturday and to be able to relax.

552
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:58,360
And those are real sources of satisfaction. Now you can blow that up. You can bloat that

553
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:07,160
to the point where your version of Saturday is some huge business milestone. Your podcast now

554
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,400
has 200,000 weekly downloads. This is just so out of proportion to the ordinary experience.

555
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,040
Now that doesn't mean that the ordinary person can master satisfaction and get it in a reliable

556
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:27,000
way either. We all fall prey to the problem of I can't get none. Actually, I can't keep none. And

557
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,560
there's a reason for this. Now it is extremely joyful to be rewarded, to achieve a goal, even

558
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:41,160
a little goal. I mean, we're made. Our brains light up like Christmas trees. We all know,

559
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,720
I mean, you've talked on your show many times. I'm a regular listener to your show and I've heard

560
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,520
this many times and I've heard you on Huberman and all the other kind of parallel shows that people

561
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,000
listen to in this suite of how can we improve our lives podcasts and shows that we all have to

562
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,840
understand dopamine these days. And dopamine, of course, is a neural modulator, not a pleasure,

563
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:06,040
but of anticipation of reward. And what it does is it says you're going to get satisfaction if you

564
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,640
get this thing and you're going to get it forever. Dopa means a liar. Mother nature is a liar. She's

565
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,880
horrible. Mother nature basically says if you're getting that new car smell, it's going to last

566
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,160
forever. Right. And you always believe it, which is why we do what we social science call get on

567
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,120
the hedonic treadmill. Hedonic means feeling and the treadmill is obviously a metaphor. So we can

568
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,920
run and run and run and run, but it moves against us. We think we're going to get satisfaction and

569
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,520
we're going to keep it. And we actually don't. So we run for the next one. Now, fortunately,

570
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,840
ordinary people get a next Friday and a next Friday and the next Friday. But if you're doing

571
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,680
this and your main objective is, you know, the next big financial milestone, something out of

572
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,920
proportion to the ordinary human experience, then it becomes quite tyrannical. You know,

573
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,440
then it becomes something that you really can't keep up with. Now there's a reason that mother

574
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,960
nature does this. There's, you know, bringing coals to Newcastle by telling Peter Attia about

575
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:04,040
homeostasis. But every biological and even emotional process is subject to homeostasis in

576
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,480
which we go always back to our baseline. You know, if you're on the treadmill this morning for good

577
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,920
cardiovascular health and you want your pulse to be at 135 or 140, you don't want it to be there a

578
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,800
week from now because you die. Homeostasis 15 minutes or 30 minutes after you get off the treadmill

579
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,800
takes you back to your baseline pulse rate. That's for good and proper health. And the same

580
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:30,120
thing happens emotionally. If you get elation from a job well done, it's going to leave so that you

581
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,440
can be ready. It's going to go away very quickly. So you can be ready for the next set of circumstances.

582
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,800
That's why you can't keep no satisfaction is so that you won't be just staring at the delicious

583
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,520
berries on the bush with joy in the Pleistocene while the saber-toothed tiger is sneaking up

584
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,720
behind you and you're not aware of it. You need to be ready for the next circumstantial, you know,

585
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,200
whatever is going on in your life. And that's how homeostasis works. That's why it happens and that's

586
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,640
why you can't keep no satisfaction. That notwithstanding a life without those moments

587
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:07,160
of satisfaction is dull and it's gray. And that's one of the key parts of major

588
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:14,360
depressive disorders called anhedonia. You know, anhedonia means the inability to get this feeling

589
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,080
of satisfaction and the anticipation of the reward. So you need it, but the paradox is you

590
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,360
can't keep it. And so one of the things that I talk about is for people like you who have this

591
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:29,080
outsized understanding of what satisfaction is going to be, how you can how you can crack that

592
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,320
code, how you can dominate the matrix in a different way. And the answer is basically this,

593
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:41,160
you need to stop managing your haves and start managing your wants. In other words, your

594
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:47,320
satisfaction is what you have divided by what you want. And you need to manage the denominator of

595
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:55,640
your satisfaction fraction as opposed to the numerator. And serious, full on wants management

596
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,880
can be a game changer for a guy like you, for anybody for that matter. But it's a less serious

597
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,040
issue for a lot of people. But for a guy like you, you need a wants management strategy or you're

598
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,240
going to be running from thing to thing to thing. And as your haves go up, your wants will go up by

599
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,560
more and paradoxically your satisfaction will decline, which pulls down your overall happiness.

600
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:28,840
A lot to unpack there. So let's start with how much of the want deals with comparison versus

601
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:36,280
intrinsic needs to one up yourself. So I'll give you an example. A great source of satisfaction

602
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,520
in my life has historically come not anymore, but certainly historically has come through sort of

603
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:48,120
athletic achievements. So when I was a cyclist, it was certain milestones I wanted to be able to

604
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,440
hit when it was a marathon swimmer, it was certain swims I wanted to be able to do.

605
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,720
And I mean, believe it or not, there's less comparison to others in some of those things

606
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,040
depending on how you define your metrics. Like you might say, like, I want to be able to climb

607
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,000
Mount Palomar, which is a long climb 20 miles or something. I want to be able to climb it in a

608
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,600
certain amount of time or I want to be able to swim across this sliver of the ocean or things

609
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:21,240
like that. So those don't feel like they're heavily dependent on comparison to others,

610
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,600
but yet there are a number of other things where I think it's almost exclusively about you can't

611
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:32,120
ignore what's happening to others, right? You mentioned income or some other measure of

612
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:39,480
professional success. You know, we joked about the idea like you could literally be worth 100

613
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,400
million dollars, but if your peer group is worth a billion, you might actually find yourself feeling

614
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,960
poor, which is like a loser. Yeah, it makes no sense to those of us that are, you know,

615
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:59,000
miles beneath that. But so how do you sort of untangle those two types of objects of satisfaction,

616
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,840
one that is purely intrinsic, one that is pure comparator and yet both of whom could easily put

617
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,080
you on a hedonic treadmill? Is there a difference? Well, yeah, there is, but they're kind of in a

618
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,520
hierarchy of what will bring you enduring satisfaction. And the one you're talking

619
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:19,400
about where you're comparing Peter with Peter, Peter times zero with Peter time one, that's

620
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,640
still a tyranny. It's just not as bad a tyranny as comparing yourself with somebody else, you know,

621
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,520
counting your social media followers or your, you know, it's like, I don't care if I have 200,000

622
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,400
downloads, as long as I have more than Huberman, you know, that's a real tyranny.

623
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:43,720
That'll never happen. And to be clear, I wasn't suggesting that the former was less insidious than

624
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,600
the latter. I just wonder what the difference is because the problem with the former is whether

625
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:55,960
it's playing something on the French horn or swimming, you're, you know, those tend to rely on

626
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,600
going back to fluid intelligence. Well, we've just established that that's probably going to peak in

627
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:07,080
your 30s. So, you know, your, whether it be athletic achievements or whatever, they're probably going

628
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,080
to start going down. For sure. Now, the biggest problem with social comparison, however, there's

629
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,720
nothing good about social comparison. We do it because we have to. And part of the reason is we

630
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,080
have to understand what we're doing. We have to understand who we are and where we're going. And

631
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,960
that means, and we're part of a society. So there's a natural fabric of comparisons that are happening

632
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,680
all the time. But, but actually trying to understand your own self-worth in comparison to other people

633
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,800
is, is, I mean, that's really the worst tyranny that leads to envy. Envy is the only, you know,

634
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,600
it's like Joe Epstein, who's the, you know, the great essayist says that, that, that envy is the

635
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:47,160
only deadly sin that's not even fun. Right. I mean, it's just misery because it's like, my dad,

636
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,320
my dad was a really funny guy. He used to joke that it's not enough to win, son. Your friends have

637
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:56,760
to lose too. Right. It's like, it's, it's horrible because it actually tears other people down.

638
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,400
You can feel awful about yourself notwithstanding the fact that you're creating real value.

639
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:07,240
I mean, that's the, in Dante, you know, down to the bottom of Mount Purgatory, that he finds

640
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,560
Satan and Satan at the worst of the deadly sins is actually half frozen in a block of ice. Keep,

641
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,760
and, and, and, and twisting in agony in this ice. And he's keeping the ice solid because of the wind

642
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,800
from his wings where he's, he's fruitlessly trying to get away. And it's in such agony, he doesn't even

643
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,240
notice the, the narrator of the inferno going down to the bottom of Mount Purgatory. This is analogy.

644
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:38,120
It's not envy isn't fire. It's, it's, it's your, your, your frozen is awful. There's two commandments

645
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,440
against it. It's so bad is the whole idea. Okay. So when you're comparing yourself with yourself,

646
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,160
that's just looking for progress. And, and mathematicians will say that all of happiness

647
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,040
is in the first derivative progress off the baseline. That's what you want is progress.

648
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,480
And that's really good. The problem is that's insidious too, because that's also on the

649
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:02,440
treadmill. The true master, you know, will be getting intrinsic enjoyment from the thing that

650
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,560
she or he is doing. That's what the true master actually gets. And, and that's the goal that we

651
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,680
should all be going for. And the way to do that is to have this idea of wants management or, or,

652
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,800
you know, there are other ways to put it. There's other ways to actually get at this as well.

653
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,440
You know, I like the metaphor of instead of adding brushstrokes to your, the canvas of your life,

654
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,160
start thinking of your life as a sculpture where you have to chip away until you find the,

655
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,080
you know, the true Peter. Yeah. Tell, tell that story. Actually,

656
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,000
you wrote about that in the book. I believe you were in a museum in, was it in Taiwan?

657
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,840
Yeah. And the national palace museum in Taiwan, which is the greatest collection of Chinese art

658
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,320
and artifacts in the world from the paleolithic into the present. And I was asking this, I,

659
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,960
I actually, when you go to a museum, never go by yourself because you'll, you'll remember nothing

660
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,720
except the, like the snack bar. You got to go with somebody who will show you 10 things. So hire,

661
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,760
get a guy, as they say in the vernacular and say, I want to understand deeply 10 things. That's the

662
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,760
way to go to any museum. And so I hired a guy and he was a philosopher and an expert in both

663
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,080
Eastern and Western art. And, and I said, what's, you know, I was looking at this block of jade

664
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:14,280
that was carved a two ton block of jade carved intricately into a village, a village scene.

665
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,080
I said, even if I'd never seen any Chinese art in person, and I were not in Taiwan,

666
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,640
if I were in Dayton right now, I'd know this is Chinese how he says, oh, it's just that the whole

667
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,480
philosophy is different between Western and Eastern art. And I said, what is it? He said,

668
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,480
well, Western art is, is uses the metaphor of starting with nothing and then creating something.

669
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,480
The Eastern art uses it. The idea is starting with everything there and chipping away until

670
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:45,240
you reveal it. Now this is true in music too. You'll find in Eastern classical art traditions,

671
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,440
you have studied, uh, Hindustani classical music, you know, Raga, for example, I studied tableau,

672
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,240
which is the North Indian classical drumming. And you know, the, the, the ensemble will be as small

673
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,760
as it needs to be such that nothing is extraneous. Whereas in a Western orchestra, a symphony orchestra

674
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,400
is 85 people cranking in a hundred decibels such that in the East they'll say, I can't even hear

675
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,440
the music of a symphony orchestra because there's too much going on. It's the same kind of metaphor.

676
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,160
Well, your life in the first part is usually a canvas. By the time you're 45, if you're a

677
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,280
successful person, that canvas is full, man. It's like Jackson Pollock, you know, add one more brush

678
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,000
stroke and it adds nothing that you can possibly, it probably gets worse. It's just dense and dark

679
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,760
at that particular time. You got to move to the metaphor of the, of the block of Jade that you

680
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,160
chip away until you actually find the beautiful thing that's in you. And the goal for the second

681
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:43,320
half of life, certainly after 45 years old is each year having less each year, getting rid of more

682
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:50,120
relationships that are extraneous, more possessions, more ambitions, more experiences. And the way that

683
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,800
I do that, I actually have a practical way of doing it. You know, when I was a, I was a young guy,

684
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,640
like everybody else had a bucket list. I'm a very ambitious guy. I've gone from career to career,

685
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,560
try to do a lot with my life and I had a bucket list, you know, all the things that I wanted,

686
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,720
all it did make me feel like a loser, you know, it's like all these things that are unfulfilled

687
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:11,720
and it kept me fired up to be sure. But now I have a reverse bucket list where I make a list of all

688
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:17,160
of my worldly cravings and ambitions and I might get them and I might not. What I'm not is I make a,

689
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:23,960
a conscious metacognitive commitment to not be attached to the things on that reverse bucket

690
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,240
list. I'm not attached to my opinions in the same way that I was. My political views, I'm not

691
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:35,160
attached to the ambitions that will show me that I'm Mr. Big along the way. It might happen. It

692
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,960
might not happen. But when I make a commitment consciously to detach myself from those things,

693
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,840
it's like chipping away and I'm telling you, Peter, it is very, very effective for helping you with a

694
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:53,080
wants management strategy such that you can have a big fulfilling life that's enviable by any outward

695
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,040
standard, but at the same time not be chained to it in this, this insidious kind of success addiction

696
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:04,040
that brings so many successful people so much unhappiness. Say more about this want management.

697
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,880
I mean, I think I intellectually kind of understand, I certainly understand the equation, right? Why

698
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:18,200
we want the want in the denominator to go down, which therefore, you know, raises the value of the

699
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:24,040
fraction. But what's the practical set of tools that one, so let's just say I'm sitting here saying,

700
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,480
Arthur, I just don't think I can be happy until I, and I don't want to use myself as an example

701
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,320
because people are sick and tired of hearing about me. So let's just say I'm a normal guy.

702
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:41,960
And until I get this promotion, I just got to get to VP. Until I'm a VP, it's just not, you know,

703
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,960
but once I get there, I swear it's going to be great. And I just want to pay the mortgage off,

704
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:54,040
like I, you know, because right now it's just, it's a bit of a chain. And once the mortgage is

705
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:00,600
paid off, like we are absolutely going to be able to take a month off every summer and go anywhere.

706
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,760
And so there's a list of all of these things that all seem pretty reasonable in terms of aspirations,

707
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:13,480
in terms of, you know, career success, etc, etc. So how would you explain to that guy? Well,

708
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,880
let's skip the first part. The first part is you're going to tell him that, by the way,

709
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,400
when you get all those things, you're not going to feel that much different for very long. But

710
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,600
more importantly, how would you spare him the agony of spending the next five years pursuing that,

711
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,200
only to find out he'll be right where he is now? Yeah. So I actually started, I have an exercise

712
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,240
that I do with my students when they're in their late twenties. My MBA students are on average 27,

713
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,560
28 years old. And it's the same thing that I, the same exercise that I do with people who are my age,

714
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,960
I'm 58. And it basically starts like this. Imagine yourself, you're 49 or 50, I can't remember.

715
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:54,200
49. Yeah. Okay. I'm not trying to give you an extra year, Peter. So imagine yourself in five

716
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,160
years, you're 54 years old. Okay, totally imaginable at this point, you're going to be in,

717
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,320
you know, really good health, you're going to be working really hard. Okay, now,

718
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:08,520
imagine that you're happy. And we've talked about what that means, but you know what it means when

719
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,160
you're happy. You know how it feels when you're happy. So you don't even have to describe that.

720
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:20,440
Put in order the five things in your life that explain it, why you're most happy in order,

721
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,160
right? And think about it carefully. Don't, you know, it's not the stuff that you wish would make

722
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,640
you happy, the things that might make you happy, the things that never have, but could somewhere.

723
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:36,840
The things you really know, really realistically, 54 years old that are making Peter Attia happier

724
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,840
than he is today in order. I guarantee you that one, two, and three are going to be about your

725
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,760
relationships. And the only, the bottom of the list is going to be about human achievements.

726
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,520
That's just the way it's going to be. And then the next thing I'm going to ask you is what's

727
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,600
your strategic plan for aggressively managing one, two, and three, as opposed to leaving them off to

728
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,240
chance? How much of your time are you spending on four and five and even things that are not on the

729
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:05,560
list as opposed to one, two, and three? What is your strategic plan for fortifying your friendships,

730
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,440
your marriage, your spiritual walk, the relationships with your children,

731
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,320
your relationships with your parents, all that stuff. Those are the biggies. And that's how you

732
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,480
think about it. And you say, okay, you got to promotion. Congratulations. You've got extra

733
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,240
money. I might say that's a good way for me to have better relationships because I'll be able

734
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,840
to go out of town with my family. Do you really think that that month away is going to be the

735
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:34,120
game changer for you to have the perfect marriage? Or should you be thinking, great, if you get the

736
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,440
promotion, more power to you, but do you think you should be thinking more aggressively and

737
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:44,520
strategically about how to improve your marriage today? How can you improve your marriage today?

738
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,240
And probably has a lot more to do with paying attention to your wife. It probably has a lot

739
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,840
more to do with actually trying to, to get interested in many of the things that she's

740
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:59,240
interested in. And, and, you know, it's not rocket science. We actually know how to do this,

741
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:04,040
but if it turns out to be that mystifying, maybe get some help, but manage the things that really

742
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,360
will be what you know, will bring you the greatest happiness. Don't leave those things up a chance.

743
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:17,400
I love that exercise, Arthur. My, my question, I guess, is what fraction of people do you think

744
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,000
have enough, maybe awareness or introspection is the word that they could come up with that list?

745
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,960
Because I think you're absolutely correct. I think if you really think about this from the right spot,

746
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:39,640
one, two, and three have to do with your physical and emotional health. And if your physical and

747
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:45,880
emotional health are out of order, I don't think anything else really matters. Do you get the sense

748
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,800
that when you pose this question to your students, that all of them are able to arrive at that

749
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,480
conclusion? Yeah, so it sort of depends on how deeply they take or how seriously they take the,

750
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:04,120
the question. So if you ask it in a kind of a breezy way, a pretty informal way, half the

751
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:08,840
students will have these extrinsic motivations about money, power, pleasure, and fame,

752
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:13,560
and half of them will have intrinsic motivations about relationships and love. But if you ask them

753
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:19,000
to think very, very deeply about it, almost all of them wind up in the intrinsic category of love

754
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and relationships, usually the top, especially for people in their late twenties of the romantic

755
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:28,760
lives. They want to have that on point. The second is their family and friends is the second big

756
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,960
category. And the third is that they want to have children. Most of them really actually want to

757
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,960
have children. They don't know when and they don't know how, but that's really, that's something that

758
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,640
they want. And so we say, okay, well, we need to be focusing strategically on, on, on treating your

759
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,360
romantic life the way that you would a startup, you know, we need to have the same seriousness.

760
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,200
You need to be putting in the time you need to be putting in the work. And we talk about actually

761
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,720
how to do that with the barriers typically are. There's a lot of science and there's a lot of

762
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,480
good practices behind that. And they tend to, when you ask them to do the work, they will focus in on

763
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,880
those three areas. Now, if you say, why weren't you paying attention to those things? They'll say,

764
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,880
I don't know how to manage those things. I came to the Harvard business school to learn how to

765
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:17,080
be successful in my career. I didn't learn how to be successful in dating. So professor, how do I do

766
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:22,040
that? And then it turns out that there are ways to do that, but you have to take it seriously and

767
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:30,040
put it to work. We spoke about the four idols, right? So what is it? Money, power, pleasure,

768
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,840
pleasure, and fame. Fame. Fame is really a funny one though. Because most people listening to us

769
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,800
are like, I don't want to be famous. Yeah. But you want to be admired by others and you want to have

770
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:46,120
some prestige. And that's localized fame. That's to be known and admired by the right people. It's

771
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:53,080
exactly the same phenomenon philosophically and psychologically. So let's explore those a little

772
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:59,880
bit more. Is it necessarily the case that we are hardwired to have preferences along that spectrum?

773
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,480
Or how much of that, well, I suspect it's both nurture and nature, right? I can imagine that

774
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,880
the circumstances by which you grow up would heavily influence that. But how much of that

775
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,400
do you think is sort of hardwired versus developed as a result of circumstances?

776
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:20,680
So there's a lot of research on that. And what most of the philosophy would suggest, and even

777
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,880
the evolutionary psychologists would suggest that we're hardwired to be looking for money,

778
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:34,120
power, pleasure, and fame because that gives us fitness in the mating market. Who gets mates?

779
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:40,120
Somebody who's got a bigger cave, more flints, more animal skins, more buffalo jerky piled up

780
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:46,360
in the corner. And it was actually known by more troglodytes than troglodytes that he or she knows.

781
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,880
This gives you mating fitness. And so the result is this would become an imperative. It would become

782
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:57,640
a hardwired imperative. And then you have all kinds of evidence of this. You actually find that when

783
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,040
people are kind of at their base nature, when they're being distracted, they will go for these

784
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:07,000
particular rewards over much more intrinsic, more satisfying rewards having to do with love. They

785
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,240
will go for these types of rewards all day long. We see this in our consumer patterns. We even see

786
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,320
some of the really interesting neuroscience research talks about how it will illuminate

787
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,640
our brains, how it will stimulate the most dopamine. The most dopamine comes from these

788
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,240
not very satisfying rewards, but nonetheless, the ones that we're supposed to go for. Now,

789
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,720
here's the key thing to keep in mind. Mother Nature wants you to pass on your genes. Mother

790
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:38,120
Nature wants Peter and Tina have like a hundred kids. But of course, you don't want that. You want

791
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:44,520
three and you want to have a lifelong partnership with one wife. And that means that you can't

792
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:52,760
live the hippie motto of if it feels good, do it. That is the motto of useful idiots.

793
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:57,880
Now, by the way, there's other stupid mottos like if it feels terrible, treat it and make it go away

794
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,480
because suffering is really important in a full life too, it turns out. But the key thing to keep

795
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,320
in mind is that Mother Nature, she doesn't care if you're happy. She doesn't care. That's not Mother

796
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:14,040
Nature. We don't select on happiness. We select on biological fitness to mate, to pass on our genes.

797
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:19,400
And so the result is if you follow, if it feels good, do it. You're going to be chasing a whole

798
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:24,920
lot of very fleeting rewards for what you think is enduring satisfaction. And you're going to have

799
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:30,760
your hedonic treadmill speeding at a terrifying velocity and you won't even know how to get off

800
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:36,440
it. You need to get in charge of your own life is the bottom line. You wrote something,

801
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,640
God, I want to say it's been in the last couple of months in the Atlantic about

802
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:47,640
happiness and success and noting that the happiest people weren't necessarily the most successful.

803
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,800
If I'm remembering that correctly, I think you wrote this in maybe April, it might have been June,

804
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:58,920
but it looked at some data that suggested actually a little bit of sacrifice in happiness led to

805
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,080
greater success. Am I remembering that sort of correctly? Yeah, that's right. And part of the

806
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:08,280
reason is because people who are tremendously successful in worldly terms, when I'm talking

807
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:12,680
about success, we can define it in different ways, right? I mean, having a lifelong marriage

808
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,200
where you're in love with your spouse, that's unbelievably successful. Believing like you have

809
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:24,360
found spiritual transcendence, that's unbelievably successful. Living for the good of other people,

810
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,560
tremendously successful, but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about worldly

811
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:33,320
success, money, power, fame, the admiration of other people. So these particular metrics of

812
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:39,480
success, people who are remarkably successful along those worldly metrics, they're making cost

813
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,920
benefit calculations systematically that are not in their own happiness favor. Typically they're

814
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:50,200
making sacrifices of their own happiness for some reason. And this is one of the things that

815
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,840
I've looked at in my own research. Why? Why? Why? Why? And I was talking to a woman, one of the things

816
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,320
that I do as a social scientist, I'm not just cranking data, I go out and talk to the humans,

817
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,440
which I find is a really beneficial thing to do. And I was interviewing this unbelievably successful

818
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:11,400
woman on Wall Street. I mean, billionaire business or epic success after success and very well known.

819
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:17,720
And she was confessing to me that she was missing decisions, that people were doubting it,

820
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,440
that at the same time that she and her husband were just kind of roommates, that she had a

821
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,920
cordial relationship with her adult kids, that she was starting to get bad blood work back for her

822
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,440
doctor. She thinks that she was probably drinking too much. She couldn't sleep right. And the whole

823
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,120
thing, she said, what are you doing? I said, you don't need a nerd from Harvard to tell you what to

824
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:40,200
do. You told me you're a billionaire, step back from your company, take a souvenir in it,

825
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,480
go on to the board, whatever. Get to know your husband, re-establish a relationship with your

826
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:53,480
kids, start to take care of your drinking problem, become a client of Peter Attia. I don't know. You

827
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,800
know what I'm talking about here. And I say, why don't you do these things? And she said,

828
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:02,440
she thought about it. She said, you know, I think I, I guess I'd prefer to be special than happy.

829
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:10,760
And I thought, she, that, that is the hallmark of addiction. You know, I've met, you know,

830
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,240
I used to be a musician. I've met a lot of addicts. I've met a lot of alcoholics in my life.

831
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,960
And they will confess that before they got clean and sober, that they preferred to be high than

832
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,760
happy. They all said that. They knew that they'd be happier when they were finally beyond this

833
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:30,040
thing. But let's just get high one more time. Just the feel of that pipe on my lips one more time,

834
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:34,760
just the burning of the alcohol in my throat one more time. Just the, what did, what did William

835
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:41,880
Burroughs call the, the, the, the red that of the blood in the hypodermic needle before you actually

836
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,000
put down the plunger. And it gives incredible pleasure to people. And they say just one more

837
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,280
time, just one more time. And that's what that lady was saying to me. That's a success addiction. And

838
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:57,800
that is a, that is absolutely implicated in the dopamine system. And that is like any other

839
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,840
behavioral addiction that a lot of very worldly successful people fall prey to. A lot of people

840
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,640
listening to us and I'm glad they're listening to us right now because they want an edge, but you

841
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,720
got to ask yourself, I have to, Arthur has to ask himself and Peter has to ask himself and all the

842
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:17,880
people listening to them have to ask themselves, is this a pathology that, that I'm actually feeding

843
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,360
by, by actually trying to get this edge. And I hope it's not, and I hope it's not for me,

844
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,520
but I know a lot of people where it is. And, and you know, they'll thought we talk about work

845
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,800
holism. There's a lot of literature on work holism. Work holism is an ancillary addiction to

846
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,600
success addiction. You know, people work really, really hard. The payoff, the cookie that you get,

847
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:43,000
you know, that the dopamine is just driving you to is the promotion is the raise is the dollar is

848
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,440
the compliment is the adulation on social media. That's where the real addiction is coming in. And

849
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,680
those are the people that are going to be sacrificing their own happiness decisions for these

850
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:58,520
success metrics. Do we have a sense of, I mean, this is an unanswerable question, so I'll rephrase

851
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:06,680
it in kind of a more theoretical way. What would the world look like today if no one was pursuing

852
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:13,080
being special over being happy? Like how, what year would we be living in? Right? Would it,

853
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:19,000
would it be 1842 right now? Like I, in other words, what I'm really getting at is how much of the

854
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:30,200
modern marvels of this world do we owe to the backs of people who sacrificed their own happiness

855
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,080
for the, the innovation that allows us to be doing what we're doing right now?

856
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,880
It's such a smart question. And I consider this myself for me to say,

857
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,840
you and I should break our success addiction. Therefore, the world would be better if nobody

858
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,240
has a success addiction is the fallacy of composition. You know, it's to basically say,

859
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,160
since I get home faster, if I go a hundred miles an hour on the freeway, it would be better if

860
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,680
everybody drove a hundred miles an hour on the freeway. Now you live in Texas, you're like, yeah,

861
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:05,640
actually that would be better. But anyway, but it's that, that is really, really relevant because

862
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,680
what you find is that the, many of the greatest innovators, composers, creative intellects, these

863
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,160
were people who are, that absolutely sacrificed their happiness, that were deeply, deeply unhappy.

864
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:22,600
Look, there's a huge literature that shows the, I mean, what is it? The ventral lateral prefrontal

865
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:29,560
cortex is stimulated by, in, in, in depressives in a way that makes them highly creative.

866
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,680
I mean, we actually have good brain science at this point that shows the people who are suffering

867
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:40,040
from mood disorders, they tend to be disproportionately creative and they do a lot.

868
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,960
This is, I mean, it's not, you know, Van Gogh was not the outlier. It turns out there's a lot

869
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,880
of weird people in Silicon Valley that have a lot of pretty untreated maladies and they're doing a

870
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,800
lot. Now you might say in Silicon Valley, a lot of them are doing a lot of harm for society as well.

871
01:15:53,800 --> 01:16:00,440
But the point is that, that it is true that the world has been propelled by a lot of unusual

872
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:05,320
people with unusual goals. And so I don't know how I would, if I were the, if I were the divine,

873
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:12,120
how I would create the universe, I don't know how I would designate people in society. I don't know

874
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,480
whether I would make people sacrifice their happiness for the greater good of the whole.

875
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,800
I'm just not sure whether there's a kind of a success martyrdom that's going on here.

876
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,080
Yeah, I think about this a lot. I mean, my,

877
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:30,520
two cents having none of the data and none of the insights that you do is that we are,

878
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,760
we are probably a lot better off for people who have made enormous sacrifices. And I,

879
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,320
and I'm not just talking about like what we think about in Silicon Valley. I mean,

880
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:41,880
I'm talking about Newton and Gauss and Euler and like the great physicists, the great mathematicians.

881
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:49,400
I feel like these people made untold sacrifices in terms of the pain that they endured as a result

882
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,240
of their genius. I think you're right, Peter. I think, I think that's actually right. But there's

883
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:59,480
one thing that I want to emphasize, which is that the misery is not inevitable. You can actually,

884
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:03,880
and this is the, one of the reasons I've done my work. I'm not asking people to not be successful.

885
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm not asking people to be not ambitious, to not work hard. I'm asking them to dominate it such

886
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,920
that you're not playing to your, your, your, your most innate drives so that you can be successful

887
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,440
and happy. And that's a small quadrant of the happy, unhappy, successful, unsuccessful,

888
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,480
the successful and happy, really, really successful and really, really happy. It's a pretty small group

889
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:30,600
of people, but it's not, it's not not populated. I mean, I write in my book about the case of

890
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,480
Johann Sebastian Bach, the greatest composer who ever lived, who died surrounded by the people who

891
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:41,160
loved him and who revered him. And the reason is because he got on his second curve because he

892
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,880
would, he dedicated his work to, to other people. He didn't say, you know, forget it. I'm not going

893
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,440
to write any more music. He said, I'm going to write music and, and I'm just going to detach

894
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:58,440
myself from the ego of having this enormous audience of people who will say that I'm the

895
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:03,240
greatest composer ever, and I'm going to do it for humanity and for the glorify God and to refresh

896
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:08,360
the soul of other people. And, and if it's really successful in commercial terms, it is. And if it

897
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:14,600
isn't, that's okay too. In other words, be, be really ambitious, but detach yourself from the

898
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:20,200
worldly idols and think about how you can use your success in service of other people. And that's the

899
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:26,760
hack. That's the workaround. That's actually the glitch in the, in the success unhappiness matrix

900
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,920
is when you become other focused, you can be a success machine and also happy.

901
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,400
I agree with all of that. I was going to actually make a slightly different point, which was

902
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:43,480
just because that's what got us here today as a civilization, doesn't speak to the individual

903
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,760
choice that we all have. Right. Right. I mean, it's sort of like how I, I'll give you an example

904
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:57,160
in my world is my thinking on cancer screening for an individual is based solely on the individual.

905
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:03,400
If I were in charge of creating a cancer screening program for everyone in the country or in the

906
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:10,280
world, it's a totally different question. Right. Right. Because the former is really all about

907
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:17,320
individual risk, individual cost, and what the reward potentially is. When you start to talk

908
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,800
about that at a societal trade-off level, it's a much more complicated problem. Now you have to

909
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,800
look at quality adjusted life years and all these other metrics. And, you know, you have to balance

910
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:32,440
a budget to basically do this. Right. And so, yeah, my takeaway from this is that just because

911
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:40,760
everything we said is probably true, it doesn't mean that any one individual doesn't have the

912
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:46,760
potential to make a choice to live in less misery or to be happier. Absolutely. Absolutely. And part

913
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:54,920
of it is, I believe you don't even have to sacrifice the success, but you do have to go against your

914
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,480
worldly urges in a very big way, not against your worldly urge for success, but against your

915
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:06,360
worldly urge to pursue the success for a particularly idolatrous reason. And that's a really big

916
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:11,880
distinction as it turns out. Now, this is the point that's made by, you know, philosophers and

917
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:17,400
theologians forever, that when you do things in service of others to lift other people up, to bring

918
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:23,000
other people together, then you can become unbelievably successful. You can become the

919
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:27,960
Dalai Lama, you can become Desmond Tutu, Mother Teresa, you can do, you know, you can do what

920
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,520
they, you know, the Albert Schweitzer, what are all those people have in common? I mean,

921
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,160
they were world famous, but they were doing this in the service of their fellow women and men.

922
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:43,000
And that was the key distinction that allowed them to wiggle their way into the both happy

923
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,200
and successful quadrant. You wrote about this also very recently. You're the only reason I

924
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:55,240
subscribed to The Atlantic, by the way. So The Atlantic should know that. Thank you, Peter.

925
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:05,160
You wrote about the mortality paradox, right? We can't conceive of not being here. I have been

926
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:10,040
thinking about this so much. I'll sit there on my bike and I was thinking about it yesterday and I

927
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:17,560
was really sitting there thinking, you know, how difficult is it for us to imagine the world with

928
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:24,040
us not in it? Because every experience we have is only through our eyes, only through our senses.

929
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,760
Say more about that, because I just find this to be such a fascinating topic.

930
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,720
Yeah, the more the important mortality paradoxes is has to do with the fact that we're as big brained

931
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:41,400
mammals, we're able to understand that we're going to die intellectually. But what we can't conceive

932
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:47,800
of, because our brain isn't that big, is the idea of not existing. So I know I'm going to die,

933
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:53,080
but I can't imagine not existing. Those are two different phenomena, the two different cognitions.

934
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,520
And one, I can really understand the other that I can't. And the fact that those two things are

935
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:04,680
intention creates a lot of fear. It creates a lot of uncertainty, real discomfort, real cognitive

936
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,000
dissonance and discomfort in people. And so the result is they're trying to work through that

937
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,160
their whole lives. Either they'll say, okay, well, I'll just resolve it on the first time. I won't

938
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,160
die. You know, well, good luck with that. I mean, it's like, you're the longevity guy. And I heard

939
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,160
you say, you know, I was listening to you today and you said like, the one thing we all know is

940
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,840
that we're going to die. So Peter Attia says, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Right. Okay.

941
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:31,720
Or they try to resolve it on the other side, which is to either understand, to apprehend

942
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:36,280
the concept of not existing or to say, I will always exist, notwithstanding the fact that I'm

943
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,640
going to die. And there's lots of philosophies and religions and look, I'm a traditional Catholic.

944
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:46,600
And so I've resolved it in a particular way. But the result is that of all of this is that this is

945
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:54,760
a lot of what leads to people's fears. You know, people talk to me a lot about what they're most

946
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,600
afraid of. I ask people about that a lot. And part of the reason is because my main focus of my

947
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,600
happiness work is love and love and fear are opposites. Love and hatred are not opposites.

948
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,600
Hatred is downstream from fear. And this is a philosophical principle from Lao Tzu and Saint

949
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:15,560
John the Apostle, but it's also a neurocognitive regularity where you find that, you know, how the

950
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,080
brain works, you know, that you tend to find that love neutralizes fear and fear can turn off love

951
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:25,640
and every other, every other feeling like a switch because of the way that the brain is designed.

952
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:31,640
The main focus of my work and happiness is the subject of love. And part of the reason is because

953
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,640
love is the nuclear fuel rods of happiness. If you want to know one thing about how to be happy,

954
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,880
happiness is love full stop. And there's a ton of longitudinal data that shows this.

955
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,720
There's a ton of data that shows, you know, people who are in their 80s and 90s who are really happy.

956
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:48,840
If you look back in their 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s, what they all have in common is strong

957
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,520
relationships that they were cultivating and working on real love relationships in terms of

958
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:58,920
romance and family and real friends, not just the old friends. Now, the interesting thing is when

959
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,080
you're studying love is you also have to study its opposite and the opposite of love is fear.

960
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:09,880
That's a philosophical truism. You know, Lao Tzu talked about the fact that fear and love are

961
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,720
opposite Saint John the Apostle, but also we find this in modern neuroscience in the way that

962
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:20,440
emotions are processed in the human brain. Psychology shows this abundantly that love

963
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:25,400
and hatred are opposite. Hatred is downstream from fear. So if you want to understand what turns off

964
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,040
love in your life, when people come to me and say, I don't have enough love, I'll say, well,

965
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,320
tell me about what you're afraid of. And when people come to me and they say they have too much

966
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:35,400
fear in their life, we'll say, well, we need more relationships. We need more love to neutralize the

967
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:41,560
fear. So the big fears that I ask people about, one of the things that I find is that everybody has

968
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,800
a death fear. This is an interesting thing. You know, most people say I'm not afraid of dying and

969
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,640
I'm not afraid of dying. I mean, like Peter, you and I are like, you know, it's like the reaper comes

970
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,280
tomorrow. It's like, okay, it's, you know, I lived right. I'm actually not afraid of that. It's,

971
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:01,400
but I do have a death fear. Everybody does. And it has to do with the extinction of how you

972
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:08,680
understand yourself. And that gets back to the mortality paradox. The idea of not existing has

973
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:14,200
some manifestation almost everybody's life, whether it's I'm really afraid of becoming irrelevant.

974
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:21,560
I'm really afraid of being forgotten. That's your mortality problem. That's your death fear. You know,

975
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,640
for me, it's like, I think about it. The one thing about my health I'm most worried about

976
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:32,600
is dementia. I'm just, you know, my mother was demented, was in early stage dementia,

977
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:39,400
which was my age. She was mid 50s. She was in early stage dementia and she lived for another 15

978
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:45,960
years. And it was, man, it was really, really bad. It was really a bad ending. And for me, I mean,

979
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:50,200
my whole living is inside my head because these are my ideas. This is how I make a living. This

980
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:56,280
is how I support my family. Furthermore, it's how, it's how it's everything I love to do is,

981
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:01,640
is it has to do with my, my ability to think clearly and to think creatively. So for me,

982
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,920
my death fear is my cognitive decline. Everybody has something like this, whether it's really

983
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,640
ego related or has to do with skill related. Everybody's got their, their mortality terror.

984
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,760
And so this is one of the things that we need to dominate if we want to be happy.

985
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:22,200
And, and I have an exercise, believe it or not, Peter, that I give my students on how to do that.

986
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,240
Number one is you have to figure out what it is. You have to do some serious reflection of what

987
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,760
your death fear is. And for most of my students at Harvard is fear of failure. You know, these are

988
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:35,000
super high performing. I mean, this was you, I mean, you went to Stanford and then, I mean,

989
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,080
and you did all of this, you know, fancy college stuff. And so my guess is that you never had any

990
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:44,600
academic failure and you were perhaps pre-afraid of academic failure because you'd never experienced

991
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,960
it. And because it would have been problematic in your family if you had started to fail some

992
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:55,480
classes in college, I was going to guess, right? But I'm a bit confused because what you spoke

993
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:01,240
about earlier makes a lot of sense as a death failure because I see a cognitive decline being

994
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:07,240
tied to physical death because it's an end of life thing. I'm a bit confused about what the

995
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:13,480
students, these 29 year olds are equating failure in life, for example, starting a business and

996
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:21,640
having it fail with actual death. Yeah. So it's basically, I am a success machine. Most of my

997
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:26,600
students start off as very objectified by their parents, where their parents say, you're the

998
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,960
special one, you're successful, you always get A's, you're a hard worker, you know, get it done.

999
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,280
And they start to see themselves as kind of homo economicus. They see themselves as

1000
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:41,160
highly, you know, high performers. And they're very bright and they're very hardworking and

1001
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:45,640
the result is they don't experience any failure in school. I mean, for me, these are absurd things,

1002
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:49,640
you got to be on an exam who cares, right? You know, I've flunked out of college. I mean,

1003
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,720
it's like, man, I know failure, but for them, they've never experienced these things. So it

1004
01:27:53,720 --> 01:28:00,920
feels like a mortal threat, because it's a threat to who they think they are, which is a successful

1005
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:06,280
person, somebody who never fails, and is very foreign territory to them. So whether their

1006
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:12,760
their death fears failure or cognitive decline, or being forgotten, or being irrelevant, or actually

1007
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:18,360
dying, the technique for getting beyond this is really all the same. And it comes from that I

1008
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:24,120
found very successful is to do what is called a Theravada Buddhism, the marinasati meditation,

1009
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:29,560
this is the nine part death meditation that Theravada Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka and Thailand

1010
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:36,360
and Vietnam, what they will they will undertake in which often they'll contemplate corpses,

1011
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,640
photos of corpses in various states of decay. And they'll say, I that is me and that is me. And

1012
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:46,760
they have a nine for this marinasati is a meditation in which they they imagine themselves

1013
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:54,440
decaying, dying, and then, you know, a rotting bloated corpse. And then it's so graphic is

1014
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,760
super graphic. It's unbelievable. And that's the point, right? And super accurate, like it really

1015
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:05,880
is how a human corpse decays. Just unbelievable. And so, and what you're trying to do is what

1016
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,600
psychologists would call exposure therapy, you're exposing yourself to the inevitable truth. Like,

1017
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:18,040
I heard you say, Peter, I'm gonna die. Okay, fine, fine, fine. No, think about it. Think about it.

1018
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:24,040
Why? Because that it loses its terror when it becomes familiar. So what I make my students do

1019
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:29,480
is a nine part meditation on their own failure, catastrophic failure by their own terms, which is

1020
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:33,320
not necessarily human catastrophic failure. But there'll be I remember the first time I did this,

1021
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,280
I put the steps in because they didn't know how to do it. And the first one is,

1022
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:44,360
I'm falling behind my colleagues at school. I graduate, but just barely. I'm not getting the

1023
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:49,960
jobs that my friends are getting, and the people thought I was going to get. I'm finding a really

1024
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,600
my career is not what I thought it was going to be. And then I get to this one point, I threw this

1025
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,920
in just for a little bit of pathos. And I said, there's one point I say, I think my parents feel

1026
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:08,040
sorry for me. And a student starts crying. Because that's the nerve, man. That's the nerve. There's

1027
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:14,920
always this point in the deaf meditation. So figure out what death means for you, where this mortality

1028
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:20,600
paradox, it really has teeth, and then actually put together the exposure therapy of walking

1029
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:26,280
yourself through the the experience, the emotional experience of this failure, and you will be free.

1030
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:31,160
This is the one thing that I guarantee that you'll be free of that. Now you got to think and do it

1031
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:35,720
just once. You have to do it again and again and again, because what your fear is has very

1032
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:40,760
as deeply rooted in a lot of your experience. But once you're exposing yourself to that,

1033
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,440
again and again, it has an incredible therapeutic impact.

1034
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:52,360
So the exercise is obviously first taking some time to really be thoughtful about what these fears

1035
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:57,720
are. And by the way, I'm guessing some people have more than one. I mean, you have this sort of the

1036
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:04,760
fear of actual death, perhaps the fear of failure along the way. So you might be doing this exercise

1037
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,240
twice, right? Yeah, for sure. For sure. You know, like, we probably all have multiple versions and

1038
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,520
they change throughout life. You know, when I was 20 years old, I wasn't afraid of cognitive decline.

1039
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:17,800
I'm 58 years old and I want to keep the party going, is the law of life. And the party's not

1040
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,400
going to keep going. I might not be demented. I might be hit by a bus tomorrow. I might be,

1041
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:27,080
you know, my mother-in-law died last month and she was talking about a good death. She was 93.

1042
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:32,600
She had her marbles to the last minute and she died at home, right? I mean, not bad, not bad,

1043
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,800
you know, chapeau. I mean, that's like, that's really, really good, but everybody goes.

1044
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:41,720
And so you can't keep these things unless you're comfortable with this inevitability,

1045
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:46,440
the mortality paradox, this inability to process these two competing ideas,

1046
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,560
it'll terrorize you. It'll paralyze you. It'll be a problem.

1047
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:55,800
What's the optimal dose of exposure? So if I was an arachnophobic and I came to you and said,

1048
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:02,920
you know, we came to the understanding that I need to be exposed to spiders, how often would we need

1049
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:08,200
to do this? That's a good question. And actually, there are psychologists and psychotherapists who

1050
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:12,280
deal with this with different kinds of phobias and they find that different people have to be

1051
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:20,120
exposed, have to have an exposure that's had more or less frequent and you have to re-up it or you

1052
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:25,720
don't. Some people are just, they solve a problem. I mean, my little girl, she's 19 when she was a

1053
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:32,360
baby, we adopted her from China and she had, you know, she had never been held and, you know, she

1054
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:37,080
was undernourished. And so when she came to live with us, she was afraid of a lot of stuff. And one

1055
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:42,600
of the things she was really, really afraid of was dogs. She would see a dog outside, she would

1056
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:49,240
scream and, you know, she would want to be. So we wanted to solve this and we did it by getting a dog,

1057
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:53,640
right? But we didn't just like throw the dog in the room with her in the crib. You know, we

1058
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,320
held, we kept the dog apart and it turns out there was about three days. And after about three days,

1059
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:04,680
she was not afraid of the dog anymore. And after about six weeks, she loved all dogs. And that was

1060
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:09,960
it forever. She's so crazy about all dogs. She's 19 years old. She has pictures of the dog that

1061
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,840
was that dog sadly passed away, but lives in blessed memory at this point because it was her

1062
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:20,120
cognitive therapy, death meditation dog or something like that. But other people who have

1063
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:23,800
lived with these phobias all their lives, including people who have these stresses about their own

1064
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:29,640
mortality, it requires a, I think a more strenuous and thorough intervention and one that's more

1065
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:36,280
frequent. And so how, how do you suggest somebody go about doing this exposure? In the case of the

1066
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,720
monastery, they literally have pictures of nine stages of decaying corpses. I assume that the

1067
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:47,240
monks come there and look at these pictures and meditate. Yeah. Yeah. They stand in front of each

1068
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:51,320
one of the pictures each day and they say, that is me while staring at the photograph. And they

1069
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:56,040
want it, what they want it to become is actually completely trivial and familiar. That's what they

1070
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:02,680
want. So for all of us, um, again, that's a good one to do by the way, but because we're all going

1071
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:07,720
to die and you know, no, he's like, Hey, can't wait. You know, they're there. Um, but the thing that

1072
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:12,040
really is your bugaboo, you know, the thing that really is holding you back, your version of the

1073
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:18,280
death meditation, think about it, contemplate it, write it out and expose yourself to it as much as

1074
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:23,640
you need to. And you'll, you know, you know, when you're getting the benefit, it's hard at first.

1075
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:28,280
And that could literally just be, I could just be reading it out every day. Yeah. I actually ask my

1076
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:34,840
students to contemplate each step for two minutes. Um, and to do that each day for three weeks. Because

1077
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,920
one of the things that I found is by the end of three weeks is like, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna fail.

1078
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,760
Wow. So not a big commitment. Look, it's 20 minutes a day for three weeks, basically.

1079
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:49,080
Totally. Yeah. And again, you know, maybe a psychotherapist would be like, Hey, you're

1080
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:53,080
kidding yourself. If it's a really entrenched problem, it's going to take a lot longer than

1081
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,760
that. Plus cognitive behavioral therapy plus drugs. I know. But one of the things that I found

1082
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,040
is that my students are afraid of failure and we can get over it pretty quick.

1083
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,440
You visited India. You're, you're, I think you describe yourself as an India file.

1084
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:12,840
Yeah. I'd love it. Um, by the way, when you were here, did I make you Curry? I can't remember.

1085
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,400
You did. And it was delicious. Oh yeah. Yeah. I know we talked about it. I couldn't remember

1086
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:22,040
what we ended up doing. Yeah, we did. It was delicious with tofu and, um, and with non-fat

1087
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:26,040
Greek unflavored Greek yogurt that you actually pointed out for consistency and thickness.

1088
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:33,480
Yeah. Yeah. Really good. So, um, talk about the four ashrams and how we can kind of,

1089
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:39,320
I know they're divided into sort of 25 year chunks, but I'm, I'm, I find this very interesting what

1090
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:44,200
those four stages are. And especially, I guess, as you pointed out, I'm about to be 50. So

1091
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,480
I'm really under entering enter, ending the second one about to enter the third. Yeah.

1092
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:53,080
And it's really the second one. That's the hardest one I think to leave, isn't it?

1093
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:59,320
Yeah. So these are called ashramas, which are, which means what, what it means is the quarters

1094
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:08,360
of a perfect life in, in Vedic philosophy. So really ancient Indian wisdom. Um, these ideas

1095
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:12,280
are probably 5,000 years old. I mean, this is, this is, you know, it's funny. You know,

1096
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:17,480
when I talk to, I, I, I have studied with a lot of these very deep Hindu masters in Southern

1097
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,680
India. When every time I go to India, I try to sit at the feet of one of these masters and they'll

1098
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,800
say, you're Christian, right? And he says, you think all these things that we used to think 4,000

1099
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:31,080
years ago. And it's a, and, but the, I went to India specifically to study the ashramas with a,

1100
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:36,520
with a wonderful guru in a place called Palakkad in Southern India, um, on the border between

1101
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,800
Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which is these two Southern states. And his name is Sri Nochir Venkatarama. And

1102
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,800
I asked him about these ashramas, which are the four quarters of a, a well balanced and perfect

1103
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:51,320
life, ideally 25 years each. Now the odds of getting to a hundred are one in 6,000 in the

1104
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,480
United States today and a lot lower than that in India. So the point is not to be dogmatic about

1105
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:00,840
turning 50 Peter. What we're really talking about is just these, these chunks of life. The first

1106
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:06,120
phase of life is called brahmacarya, which is the student life. And all that means is not

1107
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:10,200
necessarily literally a student. It means the time when you're learning, when you're absorbing,

1108
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:17,880
when you are a sponge for human capital and, and, and ideas that then around age 25 is when you

1109
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,960
enter Grihastha, which is typically when a man, for example, would, would get married and start a

1110
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:31,080
household. And that's called the householder phase. And that's career and marriage and children and

1111
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:37,160
success and sexual relationships and all of these kinds of worldly rewards of money, power,

1112
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:41,160
pleasure, and fame. You know, that's when you get addicted to those worldly rewards of money,

1113
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:46,840
power, pleasure, and fame. And, and it's fun and it's good and it's hard and it's tiring, etc, etc.

1114
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:54,040
Then whereas in the West we talk about that one hard transition from kid to adult from brahmacarya

1115
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:58,120
to Grihastha. And India, they talked about the difficulty of the second adolescence,

1116
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:04,200
which is passing out of Grihastha into the third phase around 50, which is called Vanaprastha.

1117
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:09,400
That's 50 to 75. And that's a really critical and very interesting phase. It's hard to get into

1118
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:16,120
because it requires wanting less. It requires chipping away. It requires a reverse bucket list.

1119
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:21,480
What it requires, it's in Vanaprastha comes from two Sanskrit words, Van and Prastha, where it

1120
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:27,000
means to retire into the forest. Obviously, not a foric. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to go live

1121
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,160
in the forest and neither you. The whole point is to retire away from a lot of the parts of Grihastha.

1122
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:36,680
You're still going to work. You're still going to do your thing, but you're going to have a different

1123
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:40,920
focus. You're going to be focused on teaching. You're going to be focused on other people.

1124
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,520
This is very second curve. This is where it all comes together. And this is what I try to do with

1125
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,960
my work. As I take Eastern or Western philosophy and wisdom, I mix it up with neuroscience,

1126
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,320
with historical regularity, and with modern experimental social science. And it all has

1127
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:00,120
to be consistent. If it's not all consistent, and there's one part of that that's not quite right,

1128
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:05,640
then I'm onto the wrong comprehensive story. So how this hangs together is you're passing

1129
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:11,320
into your second curve, which is also Vanaprastha as one of the ashramas retiring into the forest

1130
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:19,240
where you are the teacher. You are becoming less involved in your own success, but more involved

1131
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:25,000
in the success of other people. Now that might carry you to great glory, but that's not primarily

1132
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,320
for that. If you're going to be in the happy, successful quadrant. And here's the twist. There's

1133
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:36,920
another goal ahead of you, a big goal, which is the last ash or the last quarter, the last ashrama,

1134
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:42,360
which is 75 and beyond, which is called sannyasa. Now, a lot of people who studied Eastern philosophy

1135
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:47,000
or, you know, Hindu thought, they know what a sannyasi, a sannyasi is somebody who's an enlightened

1136
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,560
one. And in a lot of religious cults, they talk about sannyasis and all that. But basically all

1137
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:57,000
that means is somebody in this ashram of sannyasa. And that is where you're really dedicated fully to

1138
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:04,360
spiritual and spiritual enlightenment. And in ancient times, Hindu men of some means at age 75

1139
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:09,320
would take leave of their families and go to the Himalayas and sit at the foot of their master until

1140
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:16,040
death. Now I'm not suggesting that right. That doesn't sound so great to me because I want to

1141
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:22,120
death to do us part with my wife. But the whole point is once again, not that to take it literally,

1142
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:27,400
but rather to say, look, I mean, the fruit of my old age requires a lot of training. The intellectual

1143
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:37,560
and philosophical and spiritual transcendental fruit of my life requires this elite training,

1144
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:43,480
which is vana prastha. You can't show up to the Olympics, 60 pounds overweight, expect to swim

1145
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:49,160
the backstroke, having not swum in months. It can't be done. You have to train for it. It takes,

1146
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:54,680
according to the Hindu philosophers, 25 years of elite spiritual and intellectual and

1147
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:59,960
transcendental training to get to that point later in life. Arthur, if you go back in time to that

1148
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:07,880
plane ride from LA to DC, and let's just imagine you've somehow found yourself alone with this

1149
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:13,560
gentleman once you figured out who he was and processed all he had to say, what would you say

1150
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:21,720
to him? Well, I wouldn't intrude on his privacy to begin with because I was overhearing a conversation

1151
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:25,720
about the most intimate things in his life with his wife, which is one of the reasons I haven't

1152
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:29,480
divulged to a single soul and the identity of that man of the plane because it's not important. It

1153
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:35,960
could be anyone of, you know, could be anybody practically under very similar circumstances.

1154
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:42,680
But if you're asking me for particular advice, I would talk about the one thing that he's

1155
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:49,480
really missing, which he's evidently really missing. And by the way, I have Googled him

1156
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:55,720
since then. I've been following him since then. He divorced that woman already, and it's not his

1157
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,880
first wife. You know, and so the whole point is what he's been hungering after, panting after,

1158
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:10,280
lusting after is what he had in Grihastha, what he had on his first curve, what he had in his

1159
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:16,520
idols of money, power, pleasure, and honor. That's what he wanted. That's what he wants back. And

1160
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:24,280
the fruit of his life should be his enlightenment based on love, on faith, and family, and friendship,

1161
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:29,960
and service to other people. Those are the habits of the happiest people. Those are the people who

1162
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,840
are maximizing their happy span. I made up that word being as hot as awful, but I'm just trying

1163
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,680
to, you know, I'm talking to Peter and Tia here. So I got a, you know, saying in the theme,

1164
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:45,320
that's what I would talk about is like, you're going for the wrong thing. Your ambition to go

1165
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:51,640
back in time is going to lead you to misery. You need to move forward into the bonds of love that

1166
01:42:51,720 --> 01:43:00,120
are your, that should be your, your rightful claim as a person later in life. And I did the research

1167
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:03,720
so that I could give the advice to myself and other people on exactly how to do it.

1168
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:09,880
Well, Arthur, I won't even ask if this gentleman is still alive, but if he is, I hope he's listening

1169
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:15,320
as I think we all are. And I think we all benefit from this. It's a lot to think about. I think this

1170
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:21,080
is, I think this is a harder thing to fix than a lot of the things that I talk about. And I'm not

1171
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:27,080
sure why, you know, I, I, because you would think, well, gosh, it must be really hard to

1172
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:33,240
take somebody who's sleeping six hours a night in a fragmented way and, you know, help them get to

1173
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:37,160
eight hours a night of great sleep or someone who's sitting on the couch all day and get them

1174
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:41,800
to exercise or someone who's living on McDonald's and get the meat happy. All of those things are

1175
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:49,000
difficult, but they're not as difficult. I think as taking somebody who lives on a hedonic treadmill

1176
01:43:49,640 --> 01:44:01,640
and getting them to adjust that to decrease wants to make the type of strategic changes that are in

1177
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:06,840
keeping with what ultimately will bring them happiness. I guess my final question for you is,

1178
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,440
why do you think, well, first of all, I guess, do you agree with me? But assuming that you would

1179
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:16,600
agree that this is very difficult, why do you think it is? I've contemplated that an awful lot.

1180
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:23,880
And I mean, I'll answer that actually in a weird way. When I was doing work for the Rand Corporation

1181
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:31,880
on, on combat modeling, using, you know, huge computer systems to look at unbelievable number

1182
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:37,560
of simulations and contingencies. What I found was that, that, you know, all of the easiest

1183
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:42,680
problems to solve, which can be very hard, but they're solvable, are what mathematicians call

1184
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:47,080
complicated problems. Those are problems that they're, they take a lot of computational

1185
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:51,800
horsepower, but once you solve the problem, you can, you can replicate the solution over and over

1186
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:56,200
again with great accuracy, like creating a jet engine where every single jet flies and almost

1187
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,520
none of them ever crash or fail. That's a complicated problem. Now it took a long time to do

1188
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:05,560
that. That's what we call that the toaster problem. It wasn't that long ago that there were no toasters

1189
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,320
and I recommend that you don't try to build your own. You probably burn your house down,

1190
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:13,480
but now you can get a $20 toaster in the last two for many, many years and it makes really great

1191
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:18,840
toast. That's a complicated problem. But the bigger problems, the problems that really

1192
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:25,240
bedevil us, the problems of human life and the essence of human life are mostly complex problems.

1193
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:29,480
Those are the problems where we, we understand the nature of what winning means very easily,

1194
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:36,840
but there's a so many inconceivably high number of permutations that they can't be solved.

1195
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:42,360
Those are not toaster problems. Those are cat problems. Cats are complex, not complicated.

1196
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:48,600
You know what they want, scratches and warmth and kibble and a box to poop in, but you don't know

1197
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:54,520
what they're going to do next ever. And all of life's really interesting things that make life

1198
01:45:54,520 --> 01:46:00,920
life. They're complex problems. Love is a complex problem. Love is a cat, not a toaster. The problem

1199
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,760
that we have in our life today, you know, and the problem with what we're getting from tech,

1200
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:10,200
for example, is that they're trying to solve our complex problems of love using complicated

1201
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:14,680
engineering solutions. You know, you're lonely. Here's Facebook. That's like saying you want a

1202
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:21,640
cat, here's a toaster. So that's the problem is that these complex issues, they're insoluble,

1203
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:27,400
actually. And so we're looking for a simulacrum for a solution to these particular problems. And

1204
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:35,560
when it comes down to saying just love more, it's insufficient. And that's why it's so hard.

1205
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:41,080
And so what I'll do when I can't get my cat is I'll just try to be contented with a toaster.

1206
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:49,240
It's like, I don't know, I can't find a mate. So I guess I'll buy a boat. I guess I'll try to be

1207
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:54,440
more successful. I guess I'll try to make more money and it doesn't work. And that's what leads

1208
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:59,880
to a lot of the heartbreak of ordinary life. Arthur, I think that's literally one of the most

1209
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:05,240
remarkable explanations I've heard for, I mean, certainly I'm familiar with complex and complicated

1210
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:11,720
problems, but this application of it is probably one of the most helpful I've heard. So I appreciate

1211
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:17,000
that. And I appreciate your patience and sitting down with me a second time. What a pleasure. Are

1212
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,440
you kidding? I was like, that's great. That's awesome. I get to talk to Peter twice.

1213
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:27,320
Well, we'll do it a third time at some point, it'll be in person and we'll come up with something

1214
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:33,240
great to eat as well. Thank you, Peter. Thank you for what you do. I love your show and all of the

1215
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:37,800
things that you do, you make my life a lot better. Well, I can say the same to you, Arthur. Thank you

1216
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:48,840
so much.
