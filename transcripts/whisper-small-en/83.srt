00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,560
natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now, the

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,440
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,600
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,640
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,300
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,920
have proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,080
doing, you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,400
available for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,760
you choose to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,320
will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,480
plan to build upon. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,460
nature of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,880
in the regular Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,840
portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,840
that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,360
already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,960
will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one,

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,660
the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members. I want to thank

44
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,100
you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content

45
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,100
I produce, please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,140
guest this week is Dr. Bill Harris. Bill is an internationally recognized expert on omega-3 fatty

47
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,020
acids and how they can benefit patients across a broad range of medical conditions, but particularly

48
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,100
with attention to heart disease. He's a professor in the Department of Medicine at the Sanford

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,580
School of Medicine in the University of South Dakota. He's also the president and CEO of Omega

50
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,660
Quant, which is a company he started about 10 years ago that we spent a little bit of time at

51
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,620
the very end talking about. Again, the caveat being of course he does have a vested interest

52
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,180
and therefore conflict with respect to involvement of his company. I can say I've known Bill for 10

53
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,380
years and I know people who have known Bill for much longer than that. His reputation amongst his

54
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,180
peers is really someone who is a very honest broker of the science. He's been the recipient

55
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,060
of five NIH grants for the study of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA-DHA. On

56
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,020
human health, he's published over 300 papers on the topic and we discuss just a couple of those

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,180
here, some of the really interesting ones. He was also the author on two of the American Heart

58
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,300
Association scientific statements on fatty acids. He earned his PhD in human nutrition from the

59
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,700
University of Minnesota and did a postdoc in clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism with

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,140
Bill O'Connor at Oregon Health Sciences. I was introduced to Bill, like I said, probably nine

61
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,180
years ago from Tom Dayspring. This was around the time that I was really searching for insight

62
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:29,140
around the polyunsaturated fats and in particular EPA and DHA. Since that time, Bill has been a very

63
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,140
generous, generous mentor to me with respect to just one of those guys. You send him an email with

64
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:42,220
a simple question and he responds with a very thoughtful, 600 word response that contains more

65
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,100
insight than anything I could have drummed up. We talk about mostly the landscape of polyunsaturated

66
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,780
fats here, but this is a great episode. You don't have to know anything going into this episode when

67
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,940
it comes to fats. We're going to explain what saturated fats are, monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated

68
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,140
fats, omega-3s, omega-6s. You're going to come out of this and have a better understanding of this

69
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,620
topic than if you went to med school and took a course in this subject matter. I think I'm just

70
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,380
going to leave it at that. The show notes will be very helpful for this episode because some of this

71
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,260
stuff, it really makes sense to be able to look at a diagram as we go through it. Then of course,

72
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,620
as usual for subject matter like this, we're going to go heavily into studies, so you'll want to be

73
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,380
able to reference those studies and see that. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation

74
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:33,860
with Bill Harris. Bill, thank you so much for making the time to talk about a subject matter

75
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,940
that I think is incredibly confusing and incredibly important. That intersection of things that are

76
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,700
confusing and things that are important tends to be very important and sometimes overlooked

77
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,180
intersection in medicine. So with that, I want to thank you for making the time.

78
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,700
Yeah, my pleasure.

79
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,060
How long have you been the guru of this? I mean, for the listener in the background,

80
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,660
I'd give a little bit of your background, but I was introduced to you in I think 2011 from Tom

81
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,300
Dayspring, who basically said anytime I had a question that had to do with anything around

82
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,220
fatty acids, you were the guy to ask. And over the past eight years, you've steadfastly answered

83
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,740
more questions than I can count. Tell me a little bit about how you got to be the guy that knows so

84
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,980
much about this. Just hanging around a long time. So I got my PhD in nutrition in 1978,

85
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:31,180
and I went to work with Bill Connor in Portland, Oregon for my postdoc. His first assignment for

86
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,740
me was to study the question of what does the effect of salmon oil on cholesterol levels?

87
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:44,180
Because we were very familiar with the effects of vegetable oil on cholesterol and animal fat,

88
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,660
saturated fat, but we really didn't know what a fish oil would do to cholesterol. So my first

89
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:58,260
really metabolic ward study I organized, recruited subjects, did the protocol, and we fed people

90
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:04,780
huge amounts of salmon oil, basically all of the fat in the diet. So people were eating salmon

91
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,820
steaks twice a day. And this was a 28 day inpatient feeding. Well, actually, it was outpatient feeding,

92
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:17,540
but metabolic ward. And beyond the salmon steaks, they were drinking about 100 milliliters a day of

93
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:26,420
salmon oil to strengthen it straight. And so it was a huge load, 25 grams of EPA DHA per day. And

94
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,660
we found that the omega-3's lowered, well, actually salmon oil did lower cholesterol relative to the

95
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,700
saturated fat diet. And it was about the same lowering as we saw with the vegetable oil diet.

96
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,060
But the thing that was unique about salmon oil was that it lowered triglyceride levels. And

97
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,300
nobody had known that at that time. So we published our first paper on that 1980. That's

98
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,260
really coincident with the time that the Greenland Eskimo studies were finally becoming well known

99
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,900
from Iraberg and Bang. And the omega-3's had been sort of discovered in the sense at that time.

100
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,980
And so we started chasing omega-3 effects on lipids and platelet function and all kinds of

101
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,420
other things. And so I've just been able to stay with it. I've had five grants from the NIH to

102
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,660
study omega-3 related questions. And so just again, it's been a field that's continued to be

103
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,020
fascinating and ups and downs, but enriching. And as you said, it's confusing right now. It's been

104
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,780
confusing for most of its history. That's kind of an amazing story. And I want to come back to that

105
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,060
study because it's possible the listener right now doesn't understand the context of what 25

106
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:42,260
grams of EPA would mean. But that's a dose of a type of fat we're going to talk about when we get

107
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,180
into the nomenclature that is almost unprecedented. And I already have a dozen questions for you about

108
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,380
that exact study. And were there any side effects such as bleeding noses and anti-anabolic effects,

109
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,900
all these things, but I'll refrain from going down that path to instead make sure we can get

110
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,420
everybody on the same playing field. So I'm going to start and give a little bit of a framework,

111
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,980
but I'm going to very quickly hand the baton over to you to get into the weeds on this a little bit.

112
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,820
So obviously fat is one of the four or five, depending on how you look at it, macronutrients,

113
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,580
right? So fats, proteins, carbohydrates, ketones, alcohol. And I think most people know that fats

114
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,740
come in different chemical families. So you've already alluded to one of them called a saturated

115
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,780
fat. And then everybody's probably heard of a mono unsaturated fat. And then there are these

116
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,980
things called polyunsaturated fats, which then get further divided into these omega

117
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,580
threes and sixes typically, but there are others. Do you want to say a few words about what separates

118
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:48,900
a saturated fat from a mono unsaturated fat from a polyunsaturated fat, and then how we further

119
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,100
subdivide those polyunsaturated into the omega threes and sixes? And I guess if you can answer

120
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,180
the question, Bill, not just through the chemical explanation, though I'd like you to provide that,

121
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,940
but also through some of the examples and characteristics of each of them so that

122
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,500
folks have a sense of what we're talking about. From a chemical structure point of view,

123
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,180
a saturated fatty acid is a long single chain of carbon atoms all hooked together.

124
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,140
And there are what we call single bonds between each carbon atom. In chemistry, you can have

125
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,260
single bonds, you can have double bonds, you can have triple bonds. But in a saturated fatty acid

126
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:33,060
or a saturated fat like lard or butter, any of those saturated fats have the vast majority of

127
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,140
fatty acids that make up those fats are saturated, meaning they have long single chain. And they're

128
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,780
solid at room temperature. I think that's the most common characteristics. The simplest way to detect

129
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:51,860
a saturated fat is at normal room temperature, they're solid. Mono unsaturated fat fatty acids

130
00:11:51,860 --> 00:12:00,740
are the next class and these have the same long carbon chain. It can be 12, 14, 16, 18 carbons long.

131
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,260
And there's one double bond in a mono unsaturated fatty acid. So when there's a double bond in a

132
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,660
molecule, it now has a point of unsaturation. And why they pick that nomenclature is not worth

133
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,500
talking about the moment, but that's what that means. The classic oil that is rich in mono

134
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,500
unsaturated fatty acids would be olive oil and canola oil now too. Those are both very rich in

135
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,780
mono unsaturated fatty acids. They are liquid at room temperature, but you put them in the

136
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:37,700
refrigerator and they'll get hard. That's kind of a way of telling a mono unsaturated rich oil. If

137
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,820
it's out at room temperature, it'll be liquid in the fridge overnight, it'll get solid or certainly

138
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,260
get very cloudy. The pollen saturates the next group, it's really instead of one double bond,

139
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:55,140
now we have two or more double bonds and that's the poly. So again, the same long carbon chain

140
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,900
with now two or three typically. Actually in foods, all you really find is two double bonds.

141
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,140
The oils that contain poly unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature and they're

142
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:13,460
typically liquid in the refrigerator too. You have to put them in a freezer to get them to get solid

143
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:20,660
or to get cloudy. Even some fish oils will not get solid even in a freezer. The polyunsaturated

144
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,180
fatty acids are, again, they are what you find in oils. We say fats in oils. When we say fats,

145
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,740
we're usually talking about things that are solid at room temperature. Oils, we're talking about

146
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,860
things that are liquid at room temperature. And again, the oils are going to be mono or polyunsaturated

147
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,740
rich and the fats be saturated fat rich. Again, in the polyunsaturated fat world,

148
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,900
we have two families, two major families. It's called omega six and omega three.

149
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:54,980
And they're called omega because when chemists start first started naming chemicals, naming

150
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,780
fatty acids when they were discovering the structure of them, there was the beginning and

151
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,900
the end of the molecule and the way they designated what was the beginning of the molecule, they call

152
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,740
that was the alpha carbon, the first carbon. And the last carbon in the molecule was always the

153
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,540
omega carbon taking from the Greek alphabet, the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end.

154
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:23,700
So the omega carbon was at the end. If you have an omega six fatty acid, it's actually said omega

155
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,940
minus six means that if you count back six positions from the omega or final carbon,

156
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,300
you get the first double bond in the molecule. And that's specific for all the fatty acids that

157
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,460
are omega six family, they all have that characteristic. First double bond, six

158
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,580
counting back from the omega or final carbon and the omega three fatty acids all have the first

159
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,220
double bond in the third position. And that sounds like it really shouldn't, you know, so what,

160
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,860
but actually chemically, it makes quite a bit of difference in the physical properties of the oils,

161
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,500
as well as the other molecules or metabolites that these fatty acids are converted into by

162
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,260
enzymes in the body. So that's the omega six omega three family fish oils are the ones that contain

163
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:14,180
omega three, predominantly vegetable oils, safflower oil, corn oil, sunflower oil are rich in the omega

164
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,260
six fatty acids. It would have taken me an hour to have tried to explain that Bill, and it would

165
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,220
have been half as clear. So thank you for that. The thing that's always amazed me is how many

166
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,940
different pieces of information can be conveyed in the nomenclature of fatty acids because

167
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,180
you're dealing with the extent or degree of saturation anywhere from fully saturated to

168
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,500
not as mono and poly. You then have the actual number of carbons in the molecule. And then you

169
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,180
have the position of that first double bond in the case of the monos and the polys. So even for

170
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,980
someone who's taken a course in organic chemistry, like it still requires a little bit of thought

171
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,220
when you're looking at detailed chemical drawings of these things. And I suspect that represents at

172
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,940
least some fraction of the challenge that people have when talking about this is we tend to distance

173
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,740
ourselves from what we're talking about because of the confusion. But as you point out, it sounds

174
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,860
like it shouldn't make that much of a difference, right? The difference between coconut oil and

175
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,420
olive oil is one double bond, and yet their properties are almost entirely different. I don't

176
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,700
know if you have insight into this, but from a nutrition standpoint, does the specificity of

177
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:32,900
enzymes for these fatty acids, is that kind of unique in terms of just how much difference you

178
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,540
can see in the output relative to the starting structure? Or do you see that to be relatively

179
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,900
conserved across all of nutrition, outside of fats that is?

180
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:49,460
No, I think it's probably a truism that every molecule is unique. Every molecule is special

181
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,620
in our foods, in our bodies, from water, which is probably the most special molecule in the world,

182
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,700
or in the universe, which makes up what, 70% of our bodies, to down to the fats and fatty acids.

183
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,820
And of course carbohydrates and proteins are all very unique molecules. I appreciate you mentioning

184
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,940
the number. I should mention how they are numbered in case people ever see them written out in the

185
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:18,260
number format, because any saturated fatty acid, let's take a fatty acid that has 16 carbons,

186
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,340
and it's a saturated fatty acid. Its common name is called palmitic acid. It comes from primarily

187
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:32,020
from palm trees, palm oil. So it's called palmitic acid. Its designation is 16 colon zero.

188
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,700
16 means how many carbons are in the molecule, the colon, what follows the colon is the number

189
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,700
of double bonds in the molecule. So all saturated fats is just a number, colon, and then a zero.

190
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,780
When you get into monounsaturated fats, again, it's the carbon number first, like the most common

191
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,900
one is 18 carbon fatty acid, 18 colon one. And the one tells you there's one double bond.

192
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,940
That fatty acid is called oleic acid. We get oleo from that word, oleo margarine.

193
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,780
Once you start putting a double bond in a molecule, now you have to tell the reader where it is in

194
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,140
the molecule. And to your point, when you have an 18 colon one, you've got to know where is that

195
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,300
thing. And in this case, it's at position number omega nine. It's the ninth position back from the

196
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,700
end. So that'd be 18, one colon n. Oh, yeah, here we go. Here's the other confusion part of

197
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,220
we say omega, we like to say omega three, omega six, omega nine, but chemists like to talk about

198
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:40,340
them using the term n like the letter n. It's the final carbon in the molecules, the nth carbon.

199
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,300
It's the last one. It's just the nth one. Exactly where they came from. I don't know.

200
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,420
Sometimes you'll see an omega three fatty acid called an n minus three fatty acid,

201
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,780
n dash three fatty acid. Same thing. We're talking about the same molecule.

202
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,700
I think there's mathematicians that have snuck in there so that the nth terminus

203
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,620
is where that n must have come from in a geometric series or sequence.

204
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,140
Yes.

205
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,780
We're going to include a lot of figures in the show notes that go through what these pathways

206
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,060
look like because at least for me, I don't find I can wrap my head around these things without

207
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,020
actually looking at the chemical structures. I still remember probably a figure you sent me

208
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:26,180
eight years ago that really walked through the pathway from linoleic acid and alpha linoleic acid

209
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,180
all the way down through the desaturases, elongases, all of these enzymes.

210
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,060
I think I just had to decide like, look, I'm going to sit here and I'm going to learn this.

211
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,940
I remember printing it out, laminating it, carrying it around with me and just going through it.

212
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,540
It's like, okay, well, it's a desaturase. Okay, that makes sense. It's an elongase.

213
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,020
It's going to elongate here one, da, da, da, da. At least for me, that was just the way to do it,

214
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,940
which was just I'm not going to be intimidated by all of these names that by themselves don't mean

215
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,740
much to me. But if I can look at them in the context of what you just said, which is they're

216
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,580
simply referring to positions of double bonds and things, it makes it a little easier. Now,

217
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,540
of course, I think most people listening to this are going to be like, okay, guys,

218
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,740
why are you going so far into this? And I think the answer is these fatty acids

219
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,420
basically make up the most important parts of our body, right? I mean, every membrane of every cell

220
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,140
is formulated with these. And it seems that they have a profound impact on our health.

221
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,100
They do. And we're just discovering that more and more.

222
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,380
And there seem to be quite differences. I mean, on the one hand, I'm struck by

223
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,700
the relative convergence that you can see across people consuming vastly different things. So

224
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,060
there's sort of a dampening effect, if you will, that the body can do where it kind of converges

225
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,900
all sorts of inputs to modestly banded outputs. But at the same time, I'm struck by the differences.

226
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,940
So I'll give you one example, which is in the weeds clinically. But it's hopefully for the

227
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,500
listener gives them a sense of why we want to understand this. So when we do blood tests on

228
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:04,660
patients, one of the things we always like to do is look at the EPA, DHA, AA levels in their

229
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:12,340
red blood cell membranes. And the laboratory will spit out what percentage is EPA, DHA,

230
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,980
total saturates, total monouns, saturates, etc, etc. The ranges on those are not that big. And

231
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,140
most people tend to fall within them, no matter how much they're eating, but they can be at really

232
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,340
different ends of those ranges. So you don't have people that differ by two and three fold,

233
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,380
but people can definitely differ by 20 or 30%. That's my observation. Is that fair?

234
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,740
That's true. And that's true. And because when you're talking about a blood test,

235
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,020
and specifically, you're talking about a red blood cell, which is the test we like to do,

236
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,900
and measure the fatty acid composition of the membrane, as you alluded to, every membrane

237
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:56,180
of every cell is made up of fatty acids. And I would venture to say that there is a unique

238
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,340
suite of fatty acids, a unique pattern of fatty acid for every type of tissue in every cell. It's

239
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,500
not the same anywhere. They're all a little bit different. And that's because the body and the way

240
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:16,180
the wisdom of synthesizing cells, each cell has its own role to play in metabolism. The membrane

241
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,860
has to have certain physical characteristics being real loose and floppy or being real stiff,

242
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:29,860
depending on the need of that cell. And the fatty acid composition is unique to afford a certain

243
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:36,740
kind of chemical flexibility. It's an amazing thing. There is certainly much wider variation

244
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,700
in the fatty acids we eat than when we see in our blood. That's because the body is making the

245
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,460
membranes from the raw materials we eat, and it picks what it wants. And it puts the fatty acids

246
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,860
largely where it wants them to be. When you're making a red blood cell in the bone marrow,

247
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,060
the fatty acids that are selected and put into that membrane are taken out of the blood, and

248
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,500
the bone marrow takes what it wants. You can influence it a little bit, but you can't influence

249
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,260
it like two and threefold different for most fatty acids. To give you one real example that

250
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,620
is just a great illustration of this, if you take somebody who is on the lowest fat diet in the

251
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,820
world, or specifically someone who, for example, goes out of their way to avoid saturated fat,

252
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,580
someone who's consuming in the neighborhood of 10 grams per day or less of saturated fat,

253
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:34,900
and you counter that with someone who's on a super high fat diet that's eating 75 grams a day

254
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:42,180
of saturated fat or more, you might see a 20% difference or a 10% difference in the amount of

255
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:47,780
saturated fat within their cell membranes. As you said, the body tends to be a heck of a lot smarter

256
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,900
at putting things together than just doing it based on what's available in the diet.

257
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,180
Yeah, thank God. That's true. Let's talk about why this stuff matters, and let's maybe take a step

258
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:05,540
back and go back to 1980. You do this experiment where, and I guess just to set the context for

259
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:13,220
listeners, in 1980 is really we're witnessing the height or I would say the wave is about to crest

260
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:22,500
in the major fat phobia 15, 20 year run that's about to sweep over America. In 1977, George

261
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,500
McGovern presiding over the Senate Select Committee on Health basically comes to the conclusion that

262
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,980
even though the evidence against or implicating saturated fat and heart disease, even though that

263
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,340
evidence is not great, it's good enough and they have to make a decision, and the decision that's

264
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,180
put forth at that time is that Americans should greatly reduce their intake of saturated fat.

265
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:52,340
I suspect that it's that decision that largely triggers an enormous interest in the type of work

266
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,860
that you carried out as that first paper, that first major experiment you led as a freshly

267
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:04,980
minted PhD student, which was, well, gosh, if saturated fat is going to do this, does polyunsaturated

268
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,820
fat do the reverse? At that point in time, Bill, if I'm not mistaken, there had already been a number

269
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,660
of studies that had suggested that broadly speaking polyunsaturated fats, mostly omega-6s,

270
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,460
actually showed a reduction in total cholesterol. Is that correct?

271
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,180
That's correct. In fact, in those days, even starting back in the 70s, people were taking

272
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,500
tablespoons of vegetable oil to lower their cholesterol. It was taken as a medicine.

273
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,540
What is the mechanism by which taking tablespoons and tablespoons of sunflower oil or corn oil

274
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,860
would lower a person's cholesterol?

275
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,540
It's complicated. It's been fairly well worked out since, but what that does, again,

276
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,980
we mentioned what you eat is not directly reflected in your cell membranes, but when

277
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:55,860
you're taking the omega-6s or the omega-9s, the monounsaturates, you're replacing some saturated

278
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:02,420
fatty acids in the membranes. If you're reducing your saturated fat intake, like McGovern et al

279
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,340
suggested or said we should do, you're reducing the amount of saturated fat to an extent in your

280
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:17,460
membranes. That has an effect on the physical, chemical fluidity of the membrane. There is

281
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:24,180
buried within all of our cell membranes hundreds and thousands of these receptors, proteins, that

282
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:31,860
are sitting right in the middle of membranes. One of these is called the LDL receptor, low-density

283
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,980
lipoprotein, which is the primary lipid particle that carries cholesterol in our blood.

284
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:44,260
And that receptor is sitting there in the liver membrane. And if you remove saturated fat or lower

285
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,820
the amount of saturated fat in that membrane, it changes the properties of the membrane so that

286
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:57,140
that LDL receptor is more efficient at removing and binding to and removing LDL particles from

287
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,580
the blood. That essentially lowers your cholesterol level.

288
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:07,300
So the cholesterol lowering comes through more lowering of the LDL than the HDL?

289
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,700
Correct. It's the LDL that's affected primarily by the saturation of fats. There's some effect on

290
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,660
HDL cholesterol, but most of it is LDL. On the surface, that would sound like a very positive

291
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:26,100
thing. So as tempting as it is to look back at the low fat mania that swept across America 30

292
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,380
years ago or 40 years ago and just sort of dismiss it as buffoonery for a handful of reasons,

293
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:38,260
especially with the sort of substitution of what became the go-to default, based on just the

294
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,460
mechanisms and the studies of the day, it was not an entirely unreasonable thing to suggest.

295
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,780
No, particularly, as you said, McGovern's committee said saturated fat should be reduced. Didn't say

296
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:56,180
all that. I think that's where the message got mixed because if Americans had just reduced

297
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,380
saturated fat and replaced it with mono and polyunsaturated fats, we wouldn't have had this

298
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,260
problem. It seemed to get replaced by sugar was one of the big things that got... Right. It was

299
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:13,060
take all the fat out and that was the mistake. The question you were trying to ask when you

300
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:20,100
did that study where patients were consuming, in the end, I think you said 25 grams of EPA.

301
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,980
And I guess I should, before you answer this, maybe let's go back and explain what EPA, DHA,

302
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,740
and all these other things are. And again, assume for a moment, Bill, that there will be a large

303
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,620
figure, multiple figures in fact, will be in the show notes. We'll have the really detailed

304
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,940
chemical ones, but we'll also sort of have the cartoony ones. So let's assume that someone's

305
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,140
looking at the cartoony figure that takes linoleic acid down to arachidonic acid,

306
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,260
and then the one that takes alpha linoleic acid down to EPA and then down to DHA. Can you explain

307
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,140
what's happening there? And let's start with the Omega-6 one, I suppose. Sure. The left-hand side

308
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,380
of the slide that I have in my mind, and I think you have in your mind. I'm probably having my mind

309
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,540
a slide you've shared with me, but we will make sure we use exactly whatever you're speaking from

310
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:07,460
in memory now. It's always done this way for some reason. The left-hand is always the Omega-6. So

311
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,300
it starts with linoleic acid, which is an Omega-6 fatty acid. It's the principal Omega-6 fatty

312
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,460
acid in our diet. It is an essential fatty acid with a capital E, essential, meaning we cannot

313
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,940
make it. It's very much like a vitamin. It can't be made from scratch, and it is important for

314
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,540
metabolism. So it is an essential fatty acid. Hey, we have to eat some Omega-6. And what are

315
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:38,260
the dominant sources of that, Bill? Vegetable oils. Soybean oil is probably 80% of where we

316
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:46,260
get our linoleic acid in our diet. So sunflower, corn, soybean, cottonseed would be the big four,

317
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,900
right, as my recollection? Yeah, actually, sunflower and safflower nowadays are not...

318
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,860
Linoleic has been pretty much stripped out of those oils. Now they're what's called hyaluric

319
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,660
sunflower, hyaluric sun... safflower. It doesn't say it on the label, but what's in the bottle has

320
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:09,940
vastly changed from the natural fatty acid pattern. But corn and soybean are still high,

321
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:18,180
Omega-6, meaning 50, 60% of the fatty acids in that oil are linoleic acid. And linoleic is 18,

322
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:26,340
carbon, so it's 18 colon two, two double bonds, Omega-6 position. So what happens is you eat that,

323
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:34,420
and a portion of it is glommed onto by certain enzymes in the liver that want to make a longer

324
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:40,180
fatty acid. And so they add two carbons, and they get a 20 carbon fatty acid now. And then they add,

325
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,060
the liver has enzymes that will add instead of having two double bonds, it'll now have four

326
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,540
double bonds. It goes through a three double bond molecule, and now we're at a four double bond.

327
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,980
When you get to this molecule, it's an Omega-6 family, 20 carbons, four double bonds, that's

328
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:01,620
called arachidonic acid. And that is an extremely important fatty acid in metabolism. If your

329
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:07,940
listeners have ever heard of prostaglandins, this is the stuff of which all prostaglandins,

330
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,740
well, most prostaglandins are made. It's the substrate, it's the beginning, and it's

331
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,900
terribly important throughout the body. The liver can even take that molecule and make it even

332
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,100
longer, 22 carbons, and add more double bonds up to five double bonds, but there's not much of that

333
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:30,420
around. And we really don't know what it does. I think the most important end point of Omega-6

334
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,420
metabolism is to produce arachidonic acid, 20 carbon, four double bond.

335
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,340
Well, the way you explain it, like I think going back to the bio-chem, anyone who's listening to

336
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,260
this who's a college student or a med student or something, I mean, that's not rocket science,

337
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:48,660
you elongate it with the elongase enzyme, and then you further desaturate it, take two of the

338
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:55,220
saturations out, and there you go. So you go from 18, 2 to 24. Now, arachidonic acid has a real bad

339
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:02,660
rap, doesn't it? It has, yes. We'll get into it in detail, but just is it safe to say that that's a

340
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,820
bit misunderstood and that the binary view of arachidonic acid might not be the whole story?

341
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,340
That's safe to say. All right. I would agree with that. We'll get into that later then.

342
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,660
So we'll come back to the demonization of arachidonic acid. Let's go over to the right-hand

343
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,340
side of the picture we both have in our mind that is hopefully about the same picture.

344
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,060
It is, right? Now we have at the top, instead of linoleic acid, we have linolenic acid. Just add

345
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:35,380
one of M to the name, and you get linseed oil. Most people are familiar with linseed oil. That

346
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:42,420
is rich in this particular fatty acid. Flaxseed oil is similar. Chia seed oil are all sources of

347
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:49,300
this linolenic acid. It's in carbons, again, same length as the omega-6 cousin. It has three double

348
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,860
bonds instead of two, and the first double bond is in the omega-3 position. So it's an 18 colon

349
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:04,580
3 N minus 3 fatty acid. It also is essential in the same sense that the omega-6 cousin linoleic

350
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:10,980
is essential in the diet. Alpha, it's just called alpha linolenic acid is also essential. We can't

351
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,300
make it, and it's important for metabolism and health. And so the same game happens. This 18

352
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:24,660
alpha linolenic acids, we call it ALA, thank God. ALA is consumed, and then again goes to the liver

353
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:31,380
and is elongated. In other words, two more carbons are added, and more double bonds are added to the

354
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:38,420
molecules. It goes from 3 to 4 to 5 double bonds, and now you have 20 carbon, 5 double bond, omega-3

355
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:46,420
fatty acid, and that's called EPA. The EPA stands for icosa, E-I-C-O-S-A, which is 20 in Greek.

356
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:55,300
Penta is 5, which is 20 carbons, 5 double bonds, and then we say enoic acid means it's a fatty acid.

357
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,860
So it's a 20 carbon, 5 double bond molecule, and that's EPA, one of the two most important of the

358
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,340
quote omega-3 fatty acids. That fatty acid then, EPA, can then be further converted to two more

359
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:15,220
carbons. Again, elongates the chain and desaturates, replace single bonds with double bonds. So you end

360
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:23,380
up with a 22 carbon, 6 double bond molecule, and that's called DHA, which stands for docosa, 22,

361
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:30,820
hexa, 6 enoic acid. So it's a 22 carbon, 6 double bond. So EPA and DHA are the two.

362
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,180
When people talk about omega-3s, that's what they mean. Those two fatty acids are the principle ones.

363
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:43,620
Going forward, just to make everybody's life easy, we're going to talk about ALA, alpha-linolenic

364
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:51,140
acid, as the omega-3 that you get mostly out of flaxseed and chia seed, I think. Are there any

365
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:57,060
other sources of high, high dose of ALA? Well, no, not a high, high dose, but if you look at what's

366
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,660
the principle source in the American diet, it's soybean oil. Soybean and maybe canola to some

367
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,180
extent, has a little bit. To some extent, to some extent, soybean is such a, it's the gorilla in the

368
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:14,020
room when it comes to vegetable oils in America. And it's about 7% of the fatty acids in soybean

369
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:21,780
oil or ALA. ALA goes through a number of steps, adds a couple carbons, desaturates a couple bonds,

370
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,460
and you have EPA. Though I don't think you stated this, I do believe there's an equilibrium. EPA and

371
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,340
DHA can go back and forth between each other, or is that mostly a one-way street? We thought they

372
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,740
kind of went back and forth, but now I think we know, based on a paper that was published a couple

373
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,900
months ago, it looks like EPA goes to DHA. DHA does not, what they used to call it is,

374
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,980
gets retroconverted. In other words, it goes from a 22 carbon, 6 molecule to a 20 carbon,

375
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,500
5 double bond molecule. That's retroconversion going backwards. We thought it happened. We don't

376
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,460
think it happens anymore. It's more straightforward than what I used to. Yes. My laminated sheet's

377
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:06,980
got to be updated. So it's basically ALA to EPA to DHA on the right-hand side of the page. That's

378
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:12,980
your omega-3 family. And then for the sake of simplicity, we're basically going from LA,

379
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:19,620
linoleic, not linolenic, linoleic acid, down to arachidonic acid, AA. So LA to AA is your big

380
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:26,660
omega-6 pathway. We'll pause there for a moment. With all of that said, what was your state of

381
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:34,980
understanding circa 1978-ish, whenever you probably started this study, about EPA and DHA,

382
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,500
which today we know a lot about and we'll talk about it, but what did you know then?

383
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:45,460
I didn't know anything about it. All I knew was we were using salmon oil. And I don't remember,

384
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,740
at the beginning of our experiments, to see what the effect of salmon oil was on cholesterol.

385
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:59,380
I'm not sure I even knew EPA and DHA existed. In a very simple-minded way, we were asking the question,

386
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,660
we know animal fats that are solid at room temperature raise cholesterol levels. And we

387
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:12,180
know that vegetable oils, plant fats, basically, plant oils lower cholesterol, and they're liquid

388
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:20,020
at room temperature. So we have animal and solid, and we have vegetable, plant, and liquid. So is

389
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,940
it the liquidness that's important, or is it the animal-ness, animal versus plant-ness that's

390
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:32,580
important in controlling cholesterol levels? And so the uniqueness of fish oil is it comes

391
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,740
from an animal, but it's a liquid. That's really a funny and cute way, yet an elegant way to think

392
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:43,460
about it, right? It's a two-by-two of solid versus liquid, animal versus plant derived, and the fish

393
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:49,460
oils sit in a unique part of that two-by-two, as you said, liquid but animal derived. Okay,

394
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,500
so that makes sense. That was the question. So is it the animal-ness or the liquidness of the oil

395
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,620
that lowered cholesterol? It turns out that fish oil lowered cholesterol, and it's an animal fat.

396
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,060
So it's the liquidness that was important, not the source, not whether it's a plant or an animal.

397
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,180
It's the physical property of the oil. That's the important thing. But EPA and DHA, we really,

398
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,500
I mean, I don't remember knowing anything about them until well into our study, and I started

399
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,140
reading the papers from the Greenland Eskimo studies. And that's when I said, oh, these things

400
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:28,020
have EPA and DHA in them. How about that? Now, the average American today who is not

401
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:36,740
supplementing with fish oil will get approximately how many grams of EPA and DHA in their diet?

402
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,540
Well, let's talk about milligrams, because it's about roughly 100 to 150 milligrams,

403
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,660
0.15 grams per day is about the average, EPA plus DHA.

404
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,140
You mean 150 milligrams combined EPA and DHA?

405
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,900
Yeah, right. It's about how much arachidonic we eat too, as a matter of fact. It's about the same

406
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,780
scale. That's kind of mind boggling when you think about how much fat the average person eats,

407
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:11,620
right? Oh, yeah. Out of 80 to 100 grams a day, that 0.15 grams might be EPA and DHA. That's too

408
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:17,940
bad. Historically, was there a day when we consumed more of that, or where is that in line

409
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:24,180
with history? Certainly, any culture that lived off seafood was eating more EPA and DHA.

410
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,740
So let's use the Okinawa as an example, not including this generation, which I've read

411
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:36,100
have sort of fallen off the rails. But if you go back a generation and beyond of the Okinawa,

412
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,020
who obviously would have been consuming seafood daily, how much EPA and DHA would they have

413
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,100
consumed? They were probably in the neighborhood of one and a half, maybe two grams, 2000 milligrams

414
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:52,180
maybe. I mean, the Eskimos, when they were discovered by Dyerberg and Bang in the 1970s,

415
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:59,860
documented six to seven grams a day, the EPA and DHA. As impressive as that is, let's come back to

416
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:06,740
your study, you were giving 25 grams of EPA and DHA to these subjects. So this was, there had

417
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,660
probably been no, I mean, I assume that your rationale for doing this was,

418
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,740
if this doesn't show an effect, we never need to study this again.

419
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:22,340
That's exactly the rationale. Do it once. What was the magnitude of the reduction in total

420
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,420
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride that you saw in that study? Not to put you on

421
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,340
the spot with something you did a hundred years ago, but directionally, was it significant? Not

422
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,340
just statistically, but clinically. Oh no, it wasn't marked. Like cholesterol might have gone from

423
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:44,180
250 to 230. Okay. What about triglycerides? Triglycerides went from about a hundred to 75.

424
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,140
Okay. So that's a pretty big reduction in triglycerides. As a percent, it is.

425
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,820
Yeah. Any other phenotypic changes you observed in those subjects or was that,

426
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,860
those were your primary end points? That's all you had the budget to study.

427
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,500
You alluded to it earlier. Platelet function bleeding was something we looked at because

428
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:10,500
by that time, Jorn Dyerberg had published a paper in Lancet in 1978 proposing that EPA

429
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:17,700
was an anti-platelet or like a blood thinning fatty acid. And that is why it prevented blood

430
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,260
clots. And that is why Eskimos didn't have heart attacks. That was the proposal. And EPA had been

431
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,900
shown by that time to be anti-platelet. So we were very interested in the effect on bleeding.

432
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,260
And we saw a significant prolongation of an old fashioned test called the bleeding time test,

433
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,980
where we actually cut the skin and count how many seconds it takes to stop bleeding.

434
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:48,980
It didn't prolong it any longer than aspirin did. So not outrageous, except in one patient. It

435
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,860
wasn't a patient who was a college student, but he had a marked drop in his platelet count. We wrote

436
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,500
a whole paper on this guy. He had a marked drop in his platelet count, a really prolonged bleeding

437
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,820
time. And we stopped him on the omega-3 diet because of that. But everybody else had a just

438
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,100
kind of a mild prolongation of bleeding, which is an, so the platelets were less reactive,

439
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:17,460
less likely to clot, which is a good thing. So that fit with the idea that these are

440
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:23,140
protective against heart attacks. Now, if I did the math somewhat correctly on your salmon burger

441
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,500
versus salmon oil distinction, is it safe to say they were getting about two thirds of their EPA

442
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,700
and DHA through consumption of salmon and about a third of it then through actual concentrate oil?

443
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,420
It probably would be the reverse because let's say they were getting two four ounce servings

444
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:46,900
a day of salmon. And let's just ballpark that at two grams. Let's be generous. Say that's each one

445
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:52,980
of those has two grams of EPA and DHA. So there's four grams and then they were getting 20 grams

446
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,140
from the liquid oil they drank. It was almost, I don't know why I thought it was only 10. Okay. So

447
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,140
that was the reverse. So they're getting most of it in concentrate. They're getting, you know,

448
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,340
maybe a quarter of it or even less potentially through consumption of salmon. Going back to

449
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,940
the Eskimo for a second, do you have a sense from those studies, what percentage of their total

450
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,300
calories were fat and then how much of that was saturated versus poly? And I'm guessing mono was

451
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:23,540
not a very abundant source in the North Pole. Very high fat diets. Again, I'd have to look it up,

452
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:32,500
but their diet was largely seafood. And we're talking about seal blubber and whale meat and

453
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,540
some fish. This is pretty much what they ate. You know, Greenland, you don't grow anything,

454
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,020
at least not until global warming comes along. But for now they, they didn't grow anything.

455
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,060
So fruits and vegetables and grains were, you could get them at an occasional store, but

456
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,340
fundamentally they were living a traditional lifestyle in eating what they killed out of the

457
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:58,340
sea. So they were probably 80% of their calories were fat. And of that, do you have a sense of how

458
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:04,900
much was polyunsaturated versus saturated? Probably about maybe six or seven grams a day out of,

459
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,300
let's say, let's say they ate a hundred grams of fat a day. So, so six or seven percent of it might

460
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:15,860
have been the Omega three, the polys, polyunsaturated, very little Omega six and probably

461
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:23,780
70% of the fat was saturated. Huge amount. I mean, this is what was so amazing about the

462
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,780
Eskimo studies because we had this paradigm that high fat, high saturated fat, high cholesterol,

463
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,980
of course eating very high cholesterol diet because everything was from animals.

464
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:39,940
Those are bad diets. And yet the evidence, which has been challenged nowadays, but at the time,

465
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,860
the evidence was these Eskimos were virtually free of acute myocardial infarction of heart effects.

466
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:52,180
It just didn't make any sense, which is why the couple of Danish investigators went over there

467
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,300
and started studying them, majored their plasma, their food, and they kind of discovered Omega

468
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:05,060
three fatty acids. So was your conclusion from the study in 1980 that the high amounts of EPA and

469
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:12,100
DHA and their diet were offsetting or protective to the high amounts of saturated fat? Or was your

470
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:20,100
conclusion that maybe the saturated fat because it came from fish was somehow different from,

471
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:28,820
say, dairy or land animals? I mean, how did you reconcile your experiment with this broader

472
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,980
volume of data though, you know, they're obviously asking very different questions and looking at

473
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,140
very different things. I mean, how did you begin to square those things? For one thing, again,

474
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:43,940
we didn't feed any blubber or any whale meat or seal meat, any of that really high. So we were

475
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,700
feeding salmon oil. Your subjects didn't really have a significant increase or change in macros,

476
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,300
really. They were just basically getting an extra 25 grams of fat that happened to be

477
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:59,540
polyunsaturated Omega three, but they weren't that largely true. Largely true. So where do you go

478
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,820
next, Bill? So obviously, well, you've never stopped looking at polyunsaturated fat since. So tell me

479
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:11,140
how that study basically peaked your ears. I think the interesting thing, the way that played out is

480
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:19,780
actually 1985 was a turning point year for Omega three in that year in May of that year,

481
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:30,100
the New England Journal published three back to back Omega three studies. One was our study in

482
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:37,700
giving very high doses of Omega three and looking at effects on lipids. And we showed huge drops in

483
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,820
triglycerides as we were studying people. Some of the study I did was with normal volunteers. We

484
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:48,260
later did studies with people who had lipid disorders, had very high triglyceride levels,

485
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,620
for example. And we found that giving them fish oil just knocked the socks out of their triclacides.

486
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,780
Instead of their triglycerides being 2000, they were down to 250. It was a huge effect.

487
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,660
And how much EPA and DHA did you have to give them?

488
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,860
That was the 18 to 20 gram. We're still doing play in the same game. We were still giving

489
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,780
high doses of salmon oil. So New England Journal publishes our paper. It publishes a paper on

490
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:19,380
kind of arthritis or inflammatory disease. And it publishes a paper on kind of molecular biology

491
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:26,660
cell, the effects of EPA on what's called leukotrienes in inflammatory molecules. It was a basic science

492
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:32,820
paper, but it was bang, bang, bang. Three papers in a row, literally in the magazine in a row

493
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:40,660
in May of 1985 that just put Omega threes in lights on the map. And people got very excited about.

494
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,660
What we did subsequent to that, instead of patients completely controlling their diet,

495
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:53,380
by that time we were able to, because Omega three supplements, concentrated pills were now becoming

496
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:00,420
available. And so we did some studies just giving 18 capsules. So we were giving six grams a day of

497
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:07,540
EPA and DHA in capsule form without changing anybody's diet. What happened in that setting

498
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:12,900
was very different in that setting where we didn't change their background fat intake,

499
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:19,780
just added Omega threes. Triglycerides still came down very nicely, but the conundrum was LDL

500
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,700
cholesterol, the bad cholesterol started to go up. That was one of the downsides of the Omega three

501
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,740
story. Because all of a sudden we published this, it gets a lot of press, American Heart Association,

502
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:36,100
and the, and these fish oil companies that were just starting to advertise their product

503
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:43,620
as cholesterol lowering based on our earlier studies and others is not just us. Fish oil,

504
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,700
folks were marketing their fish oils as cholesterol lowering products. And then we show,

505
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,980
when we directly test them that they don't lower cholesterol. In fact, in some people

506
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,100
at high dose, they will raise cholesterol. So FDA sends out all these letters to these companies

507
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,300
and says, you can't, you're false advertising. You can't say this anymore. So that was what they

508
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:12,180
call a gut punch to the industry at that point. At the time, was it clear whether LDL cholesterol

509
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:18,820
alone was going up? Was APO B going up as well? What other parameters of the, of the lipoproteins

510
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:24,820
were changing LDL cholesterol and APO B. There were more particles. How much were they going up

511
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:32,740
based on just this six grams of additional EPA? They might've gone from an LDL of 120 to 140 or

512
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:38,500
150. That's amazing. I mean, we're talking about six additional grams of a very specific type of

513
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,780
fat having that much of an impact on LDL cholesterol and presumably, as you said,

514
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,660
the particle number APO B. So mechanistically, what do you think was happening there?

515
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,420
That's been hard to figure out, but more recent studies have suggested that there's actually

516
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:01,700
an effect primarily of the DHA component on LDL receptor activity. It actually can slow down

517
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:09,220
the action of LDL receptors. So the LDL receptors are not removing LDL particles from the blood

518
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,780
as fast as they used to be. So the blood levels go up. So it's an effect on clearance, not an

519
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,540
effect. It's not an effect on production. In the previous example, were you saying that the part

520
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,540
of the saturated fat issue on clearance, because there's obviously a big effect of saturated fat

521
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:29,300
on production, but you're saying that saturated fat on clearance was altering membrane permeability

522
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,100
and the LDL receptor was therefore losing efficacy?

523
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,700
Yeah, right. That's, I think, our current understanding of why saturated fats raise cholesterol,

524
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,420
raise LDL. Now here, several years later, we kind of begin to see evidence that fish oil, and again,

525
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,980
I want to emphasize this is in people that have high triglyceride levels. This is not just a

526
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,540
normal people taking one fish oil pill. This is completely out of that realm. We're six grams a

527
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:59,220
day of EPA, DHA in people with elevated triglycerides. And that setting, the LDL and

528
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:04,260
April B went up. Now there's another little wrinkle here, Bill, which is if you're going to

529
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:11,300
take people that have triglycerides that are that high, how many of them are insulin resistant or

530
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,820
have metabolic syndrome as the underlying disease state versus how many of them are

531
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,740
metabolically very healthy, but have a hypertriglyceridemia, a familial, I think that's a

532
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:27,460
Fredrickson-Levy-Lease type three, but I'm probably wrong on that. But how many of them

533
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:33,700
are genetically seeing this high triglyceride in the context of perfect metabolic health versus

534
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:40,260
metabolically ill? Yeah, that's a good question. And I'd have to look back. I mean, you're right

535
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:46,100
about Fredrickson types. It's not type three, it's type four, which is the isolated hypertriglyceride

536
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:52,420
person. And there's type 2B, which is high triglycerides and LDL. In both of those settings,

537
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:58,340
the LDL cholesterol went up. We had never heard of metabolic syndrome in the mid 80s. We'd have

538
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,340
to look back, what was their glucose level? I don't know if we measured it. I'm sure we measured

539
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,540
their blood pressure and their body weight, but other metrics of the metabolic syndrome weren't

540
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,820
even crossing our minds in those days. So it's hard to say. That's interesting. But today,

541
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:19,060
the largest dose of EPA that is given pharmacologically is about four grams. Is that

542
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:24,660
correct? Four grams. Isn't that indicated primarily for people with elevated triglycerides?

543
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,060
It's indicated for people with very high triglycerides. So we got two levels of high

544
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:34,900
triglycerides. You've got garden variety, high triglycerides, which is maybe 200. So a normal

545
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:41,940
triglyceride may be 100, 150. I mean, maybe that's not optimal, but that's kind of normal. 200 to 500

546
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:48,900
is what we call hypertriglyceridemia. And over 500 is now very high triglycerides.

547
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:56,820
And there's kind of a bright white line. The FDA indicated when the first omega-3 drug was approved,

548
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:03,460
it was Lovesa or Omacor. And it was approved by the FDA for treating triglycerides over 500,

549
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:10,580
not under 500, over 500. And it was approved at this dose of four grams a day, because that's the

550
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:16,420
dose that the company did the studies at. They could get better triglyceride lowering with

551
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:21,380
higher doses, but now you're talking six or eight pills a day and it becomes totally impractical.

552
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:26,820
So it was a compromise. Let's make the dose four grams a day. It does lower triglycerides,

553
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,540
and it works to some extent. And so that's what the FDA approved. And so FDA has now set four

554
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:40,180
grams as the standard dose. Their product, is it any different from what one buys

555
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:48,820
over the counter? That product that I was just talking about, what's called Lovesa,

556
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:58,420
it's now Lovesa, that's about 85% EPA plus DHA, it's ethyl esters. You can buy over the counter or

557
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,500
dietary supplement, essentially more accurately. Dietary supplements that have that much EPA and

558
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:12,980
DHA as ethyl esters in one pill. Typically you have to buy, the pill is not a one gram pill. So

559
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,900
maybe we're going to get into this, the confusion about a thousand milligrams of fish oil.

560
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:28,100
But the standard drug, the Lovesa drug is 1000 milligram capsule of which 850 or 85% is EPA and

561
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:33,140
DHA. Oh yeah, no, we should definitely cover that now. So if you go on Amazon, I mean, I'll just

562
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,020
share my bias. I've talked about it before. The two brands I typically recommend to patients are

563
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:43,140
Carlson's and Nordic Naturals. And I'm sure there were several brands out there that are

564
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,540
quite reputable. On a hot O'Connor at the New York Times wrote a story on this probably four or five

565
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:54,420
years ago, looking at lots of different brands of fish oil. And it was looking to basically see

566
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:59,780
how many of these were made at GMP standard, how many of them actually had in them what they said

567
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:05,380
they contained from a content perspective, what was the level of contaminant, all sorts of variables.

568
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,620
But for whatever reason, again, those two brands I've just gotten to know and I've gotten to trust,

569
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:14,340
but you still have to read the label very carefully because one, these are very large

570
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:21,700
capsules to the entirety of the capsule is not EPA and DHA. So we tend to think about how much

571
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:27,060
EPA and DHA we want. And we then have to sort of reverse engineer it out of the capsules.

572
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:35,620
If you're taking 2000 milligrams of fish oil and let's say 1600 of that is true EPA and DHA,

573
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,780
which is 80%. That's not an uncommon finding. What's the other 400 milligrams?

574
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,740
It would be a mixture of some monounsaturates and some polyunsaturates, just to kind of general

575
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:52,420
standard fatty acids you'd find in most foods is just a very small fraction of what's in the fish

576
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,700
oil, particularly fish oil concentrate. Now, am I being paranoid about this stuff or do you think

577
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,820
that most of these things that are sold as dietary supplements are reasonably safe or what is your

578
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:08,820
view on that? I don't have a problem with dietary supplements. I think that the vast majority of them,

579
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:14,500
when they've done consumer reports testing, they've done it twice in my memory. Their final conclusion

580
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:21,940
is generally the products have pretty much as much EPA and DHA as they say, and with some variation.

581
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,820
They're free of toxins and any meaningful levels of environmental pollutants.

582
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:33,220
So, I don't have a problem with it. The challenge is if you're going to try and get four grams a day

583
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:39,300
of EPA, DHA, or three and a half grams is really what four capsules of LaVaza would give you,

584
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:45,540
because it's again 85%. So, you're going to be taking a whole lot of dietary supplements,

585
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,420
a lot of pills, because most pills are not that concentrated. Typically, nowadays you can find

586
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:56,420
very highly concentrated products and the line between a drug and a dietary supplement is getting

587
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:02,340
a little bit fuzzy, which is something some of the drug manufacturers are pointing out more and more

588
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:08,100
loudly that there's a lot of products that are being sold as dietary supplements that fundamentally

589
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:14,180
have the same chemical composition as FDA approved drugs. There's going to be a fight about this

590
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:21,140
coming on, but the processing of omega-3 rich oils has advanced tremendously over the last 20,

591
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,500
30 years and they can really concentrate these, take a raw fish oil which might have 30%

592
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:34,100
of its fatty acids, EPA and DHA, and you do lots of processing to get rid of all the other fatty

593
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:38,740
acids and all you have left is EPA, DHA, and you're really highly concentrated and that's

594
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,140
not all that different than the composition of some of these drugs. It's going to be confusing,

595
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:49,860
I think, to the consumer. Bill, what is our current understanding of the health benefits of

596
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:55,940
EPA specifically? I want to actually talk about this and then do the same thing on DHA and then

597
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:02,820
do the same thing on arachidonic acid. Cover these three end products of the omega-3 and omega-6

598
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:10,100
pathways, but let's come back to EPA because that's where we got off on this little side tangent.

599
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,940
Today is the consensus view that EPA is a quote-unquote heart-healthy oil?

600
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:24,020
Yes, and you could say the same for DHA in my view, but EPA is heart-healthy. Its mechanisms

601
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:31,700
by which it is heart-healthy are multiple and they include being converted into, again,

602
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:37,460
some metabolites, some prostaglandin type molecules that make the blood platelets less likely to get

603
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:43,700
sticky. It's kind of like taking aspirin without some of the side effects of aspirin.

604
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:52,100
So that's one of the arms of the benefit. EPA is also able to produce a whole series of molecules

605
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:59,140
that we call resolvins because they resolve inflammation. So they're kind of anti-inflammatory

606
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:06,740
in that sense. When EPA becomes incorporated into cell membranes, it changes the

607
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,780
flexibility, the fluidity of the membrane just because of its own physical properties,

608
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:18,500
and that changes the way the enzymes that live in the membranes work in such ways that makes

609
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:24,900
cellular metabolism run more smoothly, I mean, to try to simplify this. Those are really primary

610
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:34,900
ways that EPA, I think, is heart-healthy. We've only had one big study with EPA only, free of DHA.

611
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:41,140
Let's talk about that one now and then I want to come into potential risks of EPA and then I want

612
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:46,900
to circle back to DHA. But let's talk about the EPA only study. What was the patient population,

613
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,780
what was the dose, and what was the objective of the study?

614
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:56,700
The study was called Reduce It, which was an acronym as they all are for something. Reduce

615
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:03,100
It was the name of the study. The product was called Vasepa, like vascular EPA, V-A-S-C-E-P-A,

616
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:10,140
a company that makes the drugs called Amarin. And the way the study was done, they gave four grams

617
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:17,740
a day of this EPA, it's EPA ethyl ester. So it's a very purified EPA that has a ethyl ester,

618
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:22,300
which is the typical way that they use, they concentrate omega-3s nowadays.

619
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:28,940
Four grams a day versus the four grams of a mineral oil placebo, which has had some controversy,

620
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:34,780
whether that's a real placebo or not. Roughly 8,000 patients who all were on statin drugs to

621
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:41,180
control their cholesterol levels. And they all still had triglycerides between two and 500,

622
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,940
roughly 150 to 500. So triglycerides were still elevated even though they were on a statin.

623
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:53,740
Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol was roughly in the 70s. So there was low or healthy levels of LDL.

624
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:59,100
And they also had to have either a history of heart disease or some other risk factors,

625
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:04,380
like having diabetes, for example, was another way you could get in. So if you met that criteria,

626
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,980
that kind of patient, you were given either four grams of placebo or four grams of Vasepa.

627
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:16,220
Do we know what fraction of those patients were metabolically ill? I assume most of them were.

628
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,940
And I know the study is only about a year and a half old, right? I mean,

629
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,060
I remember this when this came out. Well, it was reported in November,

630
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:28,540
so six months ago. So almost a year. But okay, I've lost track of time.

631
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,060
Time flies, right. Exactly.

632
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,860
But how many of these people were sort of metabolically super healthy,

633
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,420
but just happened to have these genetic triglyceride elevations?

634
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:41,020
Nobody checked in the study what any kind of, they may be someday, they probably have blood

635
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:46,300
for them and they'll check things later. But as a recruitment strategy, they just took people who

636
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,500
met those criteria. You're on a statin, you have triglycerides between 150 and 500.

637
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:56,460
And you've got some other risk factors for heart disease. And that's it. And you're in.

638
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,660
What did the study show? Because it sure made a lot of headlines.

639
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:06,300
It should have. And it did. It showed a 25% reduction in risk for overall cardiovascular

640
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:14,300
events over about a four or five year period, which is not that long. And it was effective across

641
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:19,740
myocardial infarction need for angioplasty, a variety of different cardiovascular unfortunate

642
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:27,820
outcomes. So it was a big hit. It was really, for the last 15 years, we've been searching for other

643
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:34,540
lipid lowering drugs that, or other drugs that will improve the outcomes over statins.

644
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:41,340
The statins have been established in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s as very effective in reducing risk

645
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:47,100
for heart disease. But there's still people even on a statin that still have events, cardiac events.

646
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,980
So that's called residual risk. We have leftover risk. So what do we do for that? And they've,

647
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:58,300
they're probably even 10 or 15 drugs that have been tested to try to improve upon a statin.

648
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,420
Really, none of them have worked without going into all the details. But this one,

649
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:09,580
pure EPA worked and it worked great. And it worked with virtually no side effects.

650
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:15,020
And you can take it with any other medications. It doesn't have any drug-drug interactions.

651
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:21,100
I think it was a big hit and well deserved. I should mention the name, the trade name

652
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:30,620
of the drug is Vasipa. The generic name is called icosapent ethyl, two words. And this spell starts

653
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:37,820
with an I, I-C-O-S-A, icosapent, it's really just a flipping around of the spelling of icosapenta,

654
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:43,180
you know, like acid or EPA. Now, Bill, one of the issues with this study, of course, is the inclusion

655
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:49,100
criteria assumes that the patients have very high triglycerides. I must have received 12 emails in

656
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:55,660
the span of a day from patients of mine saying, Hey, should I be taking this? To which my answer was,

657
01:03:55,660 --> 01:04:03,980
well, your triglycerides are 86. So I'm going to go with no on that because I can't infer that the

658
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:09,900
mechanism by which this worked in these patients is going to have a benefit in you. Do you know if

659
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:16,700
there's any plans to repeat that study or a study like it in a normal triglyceride population?

660
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:24,300
I don't. I know that what's fundamentally being reproduced is the same type of patient,

661
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:30,860
but with a EPA plus DHA product. Why was that study done with only an EPA versus a combined?

662
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:40,060
Well, in the late 80s, a EPA only drug was approved in Japan called EPDL,

663
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:47,980
which is essentially exactly the same thing as Vasipa. In the Japanese, back in the 1980s,

664
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:55,100
believed that it was EPA that was the active agent in fish oils. So a drug company called Mochita

665
01:04:55,820 --> 01:05:03,180
developed an EPA drug and they got it approved. And they've been using that EPA drug for years

666
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:09,580
and years. And the JELUS trial, which was done published in 2007, which was a Japanese Omega-3

667
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:16,940
trial, used this product called EPDL. We call it Vasipa. And it was successful. This company in

668
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:22,780
Ireland, which Amarin has the same molecule essentially, I think they're trying to carve

669
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:29,580
out a unique niche in the Omega-3 world that they can get an approved drug. EPA plus DHA is

670
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:36,460
already approved. That's Lovesa, Omakor. They said, well, let's just try the EPA part and see what

671
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:43,420
that does. And it works well. What nobody's ever done and nobody is doing yet is the counter part,

672
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:49,020
a DHA only study. What is your take on this from two standpoints? The first is,

673
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:55,980
if you can speculate for a moment, do you believe that EPA and DHA from a cardiovascular

674
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:03,100
standpoint are as beneficial or have benefit in people with normal triglycerides? Yes.

675
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,980
I don't think the benefit, the cardiovascular benefit comes from lowering triglycerides.

676
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:16,380
In fact, in this study, the reducer study I just talked about with EPA, triglycerides were lowered

677
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,700
15% maybe. It was not a huge drop in triglycerides by any means.

678
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,300
What was the reduction in LDLC and APOB? I don't recall.

679
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,820
Yeah, virtually no change.

680
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:34,220
So unlike PCSK9 inhibitors, which really have had the biggest impact on residual risk in

681
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:39,580
cardiovascular disease over the past five years, very similar population to what you've described

682
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:45,740
in Fourier, more so than Odyssey, where they started with patients already maximally

683
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,820
statinized. These patients was independent of their triglyceride level, but they had to be

684
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:54,620
maximally statinized. I think they came in with an average LDL cholesterol of 74 milligrams per

685
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:59,980
deciliter. And in a very short period of time, something to the neighborhood of two and a half

686
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:06,620
years saw an amazing event risk reduction. But the event risk reduction in reducing it was greater

687
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,340
than the PCSK9 studies.

688
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:12,220
Yeah, it was a longer study, wasn't it? About five years in reducing?

689
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:12,860
Yeah, right.

690
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:19,100
Yeah. And Fourier was like 2.2 and Odyssey was about 2.4, which again, I think all of those are

691
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:24,620
amazing. I'm not saying that to be one up on reduce it or one down. I actually just, I think

692
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:30,460
most people don't understand the time course of cardiovascular disease well enough to appreciate

693
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:36,220
the fact that you can take a disease that is a time course disease that starts at birth.

694
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:42,780
And in somewhere between two years and five years, actually reduce events. It shouldn't happen. And

695
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:48,220
in fact, I remember, I don't know if I actually said it out loud, it would be great if I did,

696
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:53,100
because I could go back and maybe someone would remember, but I certainly remember thinking

697
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:59,900
Fourier is going to fail because not that I didn't have faith in the mechanism of PCSK9 inhibition,

698
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:04,380
but because I simply didn't think you could bend the arc of a disease like cardiovascular disease

699
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:10,460
in two years on a group of patients who had an LDL cholesterol in the 70s. That just struck me

700
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:15,420
as impossible. It is really quite amazing that all of these things work. And in some ways, it's even

701
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,980
more amazing, frankly, that just pure EPA could have this effect, which again, I'm bringing you

702
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,060
back to the question that I keep interrupting you when you start to answer. I apologize.

703
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:33,900
Why in the world would four grams of EPA reduce events, especially as you said, when it's not the

704
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:39,020
obvious mechanism of, hey, we're going to drop triglycerides, which all things equal should drop

705
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:43,260
ApoB. And by the way, you're seeing a greater magnitude of event reduction than you're seeing

706
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:50,620
with aspirin. So the pure antiplatelet effect also seems a bit counterintuitive. What else do you

707
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:56,700
think is going on here? Right, right. It's not enough. Whatever role inflammation, and it's such

708
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:03,260
a slippery word that's thrown around so much, but EPA definitely gives rise to molecules that are

709
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:12,540
pro resolution of inflammation. So inflammation starts, the EPA will shut it down. To whatever

710
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:20,620
extent, a cardiovascular event is precipitated by an inflammatory event, the omega-3 EPA could

711
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:28,460
participate in that. It could stop it. The omega EPA could also play a role in even the control of

712
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,940
the heart rate. The heart rate variability can be reduced. I'm not sure in this study,

713
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:37,900
they measured it. But we've done studies with omega-3 showing heart rate variability, which is

714
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:44,540
a marker of autonomic nervous system control of the heart is improved. So that's another piece of

715
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:49,740
the puzzle. It could just be several different things that in each one of itself, they add up

716
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:53,820
and they multiply. And you said heart rate variability improved. Before that, you said

717
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:57,420
reduced, but I think you mean improved or increased, right? Correct.

718
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:03,900
Do you recall if in reduce it, they measured other cytokines, inflammatory cytokines beyond

719
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,940
the usual suspects? Like did they look at the, all of the suite of interleukins and things like that?

720
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:13,500
Was that published in the original study? So presumably, as you said, they've got a bio bank

721
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:19,980
that may be able to look at other markers of what was the signature of this event reduction.

722
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:26,620
Going down this path you just described, it'd be great to see what happened to IL-1, IL-6, TNF.

723
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:32,700
If you look at all of these other things that could be playing a role in the inflammatory component

724
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,260
of atherosclerosis, that would be interesting to see, right? Because then it would give you

725
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:43,660
more confidence that this has broader applicability than just people with sky-high triglycerides.

726
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:48,300
Back again to the inclusion criteria, these are not sky-high triglycerides. And this is not

727
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,940
triglycerides over 500. These are not people at risk for pancreatitis. This is much more garden

728
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:58,700
variety hypertrugular sardemia. I don't know. In my practice, Bill, 150 to 500 is sky-high.

729
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:07,180
Okay. Well, I guess I'm used to hearing type 500,000, 2000, people have that. But

730
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,940
that's the place Omega-3s first got their approval in that very high triglyceride world. And so when

731
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:18,140
we bump it down to under 500, to me it seems like garden variety. But you're right.

732
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,980
Well, but that's a fair point. I mean, it's certainly representative of the US population.

733
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:26,620
Did that study, did it look at how much of that EPA converted to DHA? In other words,

734
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:33,100
one of the advantages presumably of giving mega dose of EPA versus mega dose of DHA is you're

735
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:40,300
higher up the food chain. So presumably you're covering any benefit that's unique to EPA if you

736
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:45,740
believe there may be one, and then you're also transmitting into DHA and getting that. Or do you

737
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:50,700
believe that all of the benefits of EPA are transmitted through DHA?

738
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,460
I think it's probably all the benefits of EPA are transmitted through EPA,

739
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,300
not through conversion to DHA. Not through the conversion to DHA.

740
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:06,540
No, no. In fact, when you look at a couple of papers looked at the effects of giving pure EPA

741
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:14,780
programs on red blood cell DHA levels, for example. And DHA levels actually go down a little bit.

742
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:22,460
EPA goes up, of course, you're feeding EPA, but the DHA component in the red cell membrane goes

743
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:28,860
down. Or in other studies stays the same, but doesn't grow up. You're not increasing DHA tissue

744
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:34,460
levels. That's really interesting. So in other words, if EPA is being converted to DHA, which

745
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:39,740
I assume we still think it is, it's not necessarily, I mean, it's just increasing the substrate pool

746
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:44,700
of DHA, but not necessarily the incorporation into cell membranes. Right, right. That's

747
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:48,940
interesting. And that actually explains, I think, some of what I guess I would see when I look at

748
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:55,740
people's laboratory values. While we're on this topic, if I consumed staggering amounts of flaxseed

749
01:12:55,740 --> 01:13:04,140
oil, by the way, a friend of mine once gave me a recipe to make flaxseed tea. And A, it tasted

750
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,900
really good when I had it at her place. So part of it is just, it was really amazing. And part of it

751
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:15,420
is the recipe was so complicated that I took pride in like taking two days to make a vat of

752
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:21,020
flaxseed tea that could feed a small village. I was never able to get it quite right. But let's

753
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:27,580
assume I could get it right. And I could consume a near infinite amount of flaxseed oil. Could that

754
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:36,780
amount of ALA ever give me sufficient enough substrate EPA and DHA to rival what we're talking

755
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:43,100
about in these supplemental doses of four grams? No, it's never, when people have tried giving

756
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:50,780
12 grams of ALA, not just flaxseed oil, ALA. Just straight ALA. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even get,

757
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:56,060
you might take an EPA level of 1% in a red cell and maybe drive it to 2%.

758
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,740
There's two questions I have, and I hope I'm going to remember the second one.

759
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:05,500
Is there a risk that looking at the red blood cell, which of course is the most obvious and easy

760
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:11,500
cell for us to access the membrane in, is there a risk we're missing something that's not occurring

761
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:17,100
in cells that we can't access like as easily? We can't look at the membrane of adipose cells or

762
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:21,420
muscle cells. And we typically, even though it would be just as easy to look at leukocytes,

763
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:26,460
I assume we don't look at them at least clinically or commercially. Do we run the risk of just looking

764
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:32,060
at one, one pony here? Right. Everything's a compromise. So the red cell is the easiest cell

765
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:37,340
type to get at. Leukocytes are not that easy to get at. Right. You need some A for recess or something

766
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:42,700
like that. Clinical lab. Right. Right. And just a clinical lab setting is very difficult. Red cells

767
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:47,340
are thrown away by the gallon day by day, just because all you really wanted was the plasma,

768
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:51,820
right? So the red cells go to the bottom and you take the plasma off and you throw them away.

769
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,740
Red cells are, we've shown red cells correlate with quite a few other tissues

770
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:01,180
in terms of the omega-3 levels. So they are a good reflection of other tissues, probably the only one

771
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:06,860
that's the least reflective of is the brain, at least in the adult. It's hard to add a

772
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,300
composition of the brain. Yeah. I don't think anyone's going to sign up for the brain biopsy.

773
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,620
So what are some of the tissues that you've seen high correlation with with RBC? Well,

774
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:20,460
we did it originally with the heart using heart transplant patients who were being followed up

775
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:25,180
every six months with a heart biopsy to see how their heart was doing, of course. And we were able

776
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:30,220
to get their red cells and the heart biopsy and measure the omega-3 content and show the nice

777
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:34,620
correlation to higher the omega-3. And the red cell, the higher the omega-3 and the heart. Other

778
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,140
people have done this too. And you can do it in animals, of course, you have lots of tissues.

779
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:42,700
Is there a high correlation with liver as well as myocyte, skeletal myocyte?

780
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,860
Right, muscle and liver and guess is small intestine, large intestine.

781
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:50,700
Wow. Okay. We'll make sure we include all these papers, Bill, as well in the show notes,

782
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:55,100
because that's actually something I've just been too lazy to personally go back and check. It's on

783
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:59,980
my list of 2000 things I want to go and check. And that's one of them is I always wanted to go

784
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:05,500
back and look at what the association between RBC membrane level was and other tissues. The other

785
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,500
question I had was what are the, we've kind of glossed over it because it's a little bit of the

786
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:15,340
stepchild, but what are some of the direct benefits, if any, of ALA by itself? Because you just noted

787
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:21,420
that it's not that having all the ALA in the world is not really meaningful to conversion to EPA. So

788
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:26,780
if there's benefit to ALA, it needs to be through ALA, right? We don't really know. There's certainly

789
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:34,140
some hints in some of the population epidemiologic studies that higher ALA intakes, presumably

790
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:40,860
independent of EPA and DHA intake, is associated with reduced risk for disease. So that's a good

791
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:47,180
thing. I have no problem with ALA. I just have a problem with it being a substitute for fish oils,

792
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:52,700
for omega-3, long chain omega-3s, because it doesn't. But ALA itself, I mean, I don't think

793
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:59,260
it's a bad idea to take ALA products, rich oils, as well as take fish oils. But we don't really

794
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:05,420
know the mechanism, but I think there's probably going to be some metabolites of ALA itself in the

795
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:11,820
same sense that there are prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other metabolites from EPA and DHA.

796
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:17,900
There probably are from ALA too that are doing things we don't know about. It's all dark on the

797
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,660
inside, so we don't really quite know what's going on. I think there's going to be benefit,

798
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:25,660
but it's not because it's converted to EPA and DHA as far as we know.

799
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:31,180
And speaking of which now, let's go down the bottom of that chain. We've talked about EPA.

800
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:36,860
Let's talk about DHA. As you said, we haven't had the study that takes four grams of DHA,

801
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:44,700
administers it in either a high, low, or normal triglyceride population. But based on studies

802
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:51,020
that have looked at high doses combined and maybe trying to contrast with high-dose EPA studies,

803
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:56,220
plus looking at all the animal and mechanistic studies, what is your best guess as to what a

804
01:17:56,220 --> 01:18:02,860
high dose of DHA is doing? In a sense, much the same thing as EPA. There are parallel mirror

805
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:08,620
image molecules being made. What DHA's are called instead of resolvents are called protectants.

806
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:15,660
These are the metabolites that are very active in anti-inflammatory processes. DHA will improve

807
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:21,340
platelet function, make platelets less sticky the same way that EPA does. We did different

808
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:27,580
mechanisms with the same outcome. DHA is probably better at actually lowering triglycerides and

809
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:35,980
raising HDL than EPA is. So there could be actually a lipoprotein benefit there. Although DHA does

810
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:41,820
raise, particularly in people who are hypertriglycerideemic taking fairly high doses of DHA,

811
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,700
there will be an LDL raising effect. Whether that's a bad thing or not, nobody knows,

812
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:53,020
but it's been observed. That's one of the differences between an EPA-only product and

813
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:59,580
an EPA-plus DHA. There have been folks who have been trying to say that the EPA-plus DHA products

814
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:04,620
are not good for you because they have DHA, which can raise LDL. I think that's a big stretch.

815
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,300
This is a lot of caveats. But nevertheless, that's part of some marketing programs now,

816
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:16,700
which I find unfortunate. DHA is certainly, if you look at biology at the membranes of any

817
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:23,180
of our membranes, red cells or heart, DHA is by far the most common, much higher levels of DHA.

818
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:30,620
Like the red cell, 85% and 15%. If you look at the total of EPA-plus DHA.

819
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:35,180
Yeah, I usually think of it in terms of absolutes. So I know I was looking at my labs from,

820
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:40,060
I draw my labs every once in a while. I think the last check was a few weeks ago and my

821
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:51,100
red blood cell EPA level was about 2.2% and DHA level was about 8%. So it's comparable to what

822
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:57,420
you're saying for a total of about a little over 10%, 10 to 11%. At what point do you worry? Is it

823
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:02,700
too high? We really haven't seen any adverse effects in higher doses. And there are major

824
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:08,060
international bodies that are saying up to five or six grams a day of EPA DHA is no problem.

825
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:12,860
And five or six grams of EPA would give you what level in the RBC, the highest level I've ever

826
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:18,140
seen in RBCs. I've had a patient who was just taking this stuff by the truckload, which means

827
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:22,780
he was probably taking about three grams a day, maybe four, I'm not sure. But was sitting there

828
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:28,380
at about 16% EPA-plus DHA in the red blood cell. Is that comparable?

829
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:35,980
We have seen higher, but that guy is probably 99.9% percentile. We've seen people over 20

830
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:41,340
who are not taking fish oil, which is pretty... So there's some interesting biology here.

831
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,860
What do you think is going on in there? How is that happening? Are they just eating a lot of fish?

832
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:49,740
This particular lady I'm thinking of was when we interviewed her said, yeah, she eats

833
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:57,020
baby fish once a week, some salmon, but it's not like she's not doing anything Eskimo and she

834
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:02,220
wasn't taking a supplement. She was a woman of Indian, East Indian extraction and drank a lot of,

835
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:07,820
the thing that really stuck out, she drank a lot of kefir, liquid yogurt. But what in the world

836
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:12,060
that would have to do with Omega-3, I have no idea. So we don't know what happened to her,

837
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,140
why she's that way. And there's other people that have been up that level that I think it's

838
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:20,060
just genetic. I mean, that's a cop-out word, I know.

839
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:24,620
I know. It is funny, but I was just about to say the ubiquitous cop-out of genetic, but

840
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:32,780
I've absolutely seen patients who eat one serving of fish a week and need four mega EPA DHA.

841
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:38,780
And it's the same brand, so it's not a brand issue. They'll take a mega dose, four capsules

842
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:44,460
a night of the big stuff and you might get them up to 7%. And then I've seen other people who eat

843
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:50,380
fish twice a week and they walk around at 9%. You're seeing this as well and you're equally

844
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:58,460
stumped by it. Yeah, right. We published a paper recently looking at, in something like 3,500

845
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:03,900
people that have submitted blood to us and have told us how much oily fish they eat and whether

846
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:10,460
they take a supplement or not. That's all we asked. And we found out that the group that has

847
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:17,580
the 50-50 chance of an 8% Omega-3 index were eating three reported eating three oily fish

848
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:24,940
meals a week and taking a supplement. But below that, the chances of having 8% are diminished.

849
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:29,740
But there's even within the category of people that were not taking any supplements and eating

850
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:35,980
maybe one fish meal a week, there were some people that had 8%. It's just they're real outliers.

851
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:41,180
There's a tremendous variability in the level in the blood compared to what's in the diet.

852
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,900
Bill, just based on your knowledge around this, and we haven't fully finished the DHA stuff,

853
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:52,860
with that caveat, do you have a recommendation for physicians or patients who are monitoring

854
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:57,100
EPA and DHA levels in red blood cells for a target? I mean, the lab that I use,

855
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:03,020
I think gives a range of 8% to 10% is ideal. Do you have a view on this?

856
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:09,900
We think, in what we call the Omega-3 index, which is EPA plus DHA in red cell membranes,

857
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:16,540
our target is 8% to 12%. That's a range we think is a healthy range. The average American

858
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:24,940
is around 5%, maybe, 4% or 5%, twice as high as normal. I've seen people at 2%, which are

859
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,620
obviously people who don't supplement and don't eat fish, but I've also seen people who don't

860
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:32,700
supplement, don't eat fish, and they're at 5% to 6%, which again comes back to this

861
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:39,180
question of the role of genetics in driving this. So let's come back to DHA for a moment.

862
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:45,260
A few years ago, there was certainly a little bit of hoopla around the neuroprotective benefits

863
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:51,100
of DHA. What is the state of the art and science around that particular question?

864
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:56,380
It begins with the observation that the brain and the retina, which is really just an extension of

865
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:03,500
the brain, are very rich in DHA, virtually no EPA in the brain. Beginning with that,

866
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:11,340
the logical conclusion is DHA is important in the brain and the eye because they're there. People

867
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,220
have then tried to jump to the conclusion that therefore if you give more DHA, you're going to

868
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:21,020
get better brain health and better eye health. Well, that's not necessarily panned out,

869
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:25,820
particularly like in depression studies. That's the most clear area at the moment where

870
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:33,740
folks have tried to give high DHA products to try to affect depressive symptoms, and they don't

871
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:38,540
really work. The products that seem to work to actually have an effect on depressive symptoms

872
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:46,700
are ones that are richer in EPA than DHA. So you look at a meta-analysis, a compilation of lots

873
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:51,020
of different studies. The positive ones are the ones that are richer in EPA, but there's no EPA

874
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:57,820
in the brain. The logic was that if the meat of the brain has got DHA in it, the actual physical

875
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:04,060
flash of the brain is DHA, then DHA should be given and it would be beneficial, but that's not

876
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:10,460
a logical assumption. I think what's happening is EPA is probably providing some unique anti-inflammatory

877
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:16,700
effects in the brain circulation that's affecting, because we don't understand depression at all,

878
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:22,940
but it's somehow affecting the expression of depressive symptoms like DHA doesn't. I can't

879
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:28,780
say that DHA is the brain omega-3 and EPA is the heart omega-3. I don't think that's true.

880
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:35,740
I don't think we can at this point say one of them is better than the other for any given system.

881
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:42,700
They come together in nature in all fish that contain EPA and DHA have both of them.

882
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:50,540
It's not 50-50, it's usually 60-40 or 40-60 in terms of ratio, EPA and DHA. I think that's

883
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:55,740
the best thing to do is to get both of them at this point for any condition, all conditions.

884
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:00,060
Because you've done a PhD in nutrition, I'm going to ask you a nutrition question.

885
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:06,940
If you recommend fish for people to eat, if someone says, look, I want to get as much of the EPA DHA

886
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:12,220
as I can through my food intake as opposed to supplement intake, and then being mindful of

887
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:19,100
fish that contain toxins, particularly mercury, what's the best yield for safety and then high

888
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:24,220
quantity of EPA DHA? Salmon seems to be at the top of that intersection, right? Is there other

889
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:32,540
fish you'd put there? Sardines, herring, mackerel, almost all the oily fish are going to have high

890
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:37,580
EPA levels just simply because they have high oil, because they have fat in their flesh and their

891
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:42,860
tissues. There's really only about four or five fish that are because of the mercury have a

892
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:49,820
mercury concern and they're fish that are really very rarely eaten, tilefish, swordfish, king mackerel,

893
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:56,780
and shark. So those are the ones that everybody agrees that pregnant women, lactating women,

894
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:01,740
should not eat because they affect neurodevelopment of the brain. There's anecdotal stories of people

895
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:09,260
eating vast amounts of tuna and getting high levels of mercury and sure, I'm sure that can happen,

896
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:15,260
but by and large, albacore tuna, for example, is twice as much EPA and DHA as

897
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:21,020
chunk light tuna. It's more expensive, so it's a great source of EPA and DHA, but it has more

898
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:27,260
mercury than chunk light tuna has. I think people get that balance way out of whack. They're far

899
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:35,100
or more concerned about miniscule amounts of mercury and they will forego the good benefits

900
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:41,820
of EPA and DHA in a food like albacore tuna, white tuna, because they're afraid of the small

901
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:49,020
amount of atoxin. The benefits of eating fish, even if there's some mercury in it, far outweigh

902
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:53,260
the downside of the mercury. Yeah, I probably need to go a little further down this rabbit hole,

903
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:57,980
but again, this is another example where I've seen amazing individual variability. I've seen

904
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:04,620
people who eat three servings of tuna a week who have a mercury level below 10 on a laboratory

905
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:10,780
assay like LabCorp where the upper limit of normal is 15 and there are people that walk around at 10,

906
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:14,220
so they're perfectly fine and they're eating tuna three times a week. Then I've

907
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:19,820
seen people who consume tuna twice a month and they're right at the upper limits.

908
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:25,660
There's a lab called Quicksilver that we use to further scratch at that a little bit and look at

909
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:29,660
the inorganic and the organic, but one of the things we've learned through that is clearance

910
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:34,860
matters a lot. In fact, clearance seems to matter at least as much and maybe not surprisingly as

911
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:45,420
intake. The Quicksilver test looks at the hair, urine, blood. It basically quantifies how they're

912
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,900
clearing inorganic and organic and then you get a sense and then you're measuring organic and

913
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:54,140
inorganic, so you're getting a sense of, is this coming in through food? Is this coming in through

914
01:28:55,020 --> 01:29:00,140
the environment? Yeah, it's another one of those things that's complicated. My general rule and

915
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:09,580
advice to patients is salmon and small bait fish is open field running. If you're going to go haywire

916
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:13,980
on tuna, which I could do, I could eat tuna every day. I love it so much, I don't. You're probably

917
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:18,780
best to at least measure your levels, but to your point, maybe we don't know exactly what the

918
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,940
toxicity curve looks like. It's worth exploring. I do want to come back to something else in the

919
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:29,180
Omega-3 broad front, which is there are a handful of studies. I've seen one of them, but I believe

920
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:32,940
there are others. I think one of them was the Honolulu Heart Study or something about,

921
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:39,020
this has got to be over 20 years old now, that actually looked at a reduced amount of

922
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:44,940
lung cancer in smokers who had high Omega-3 levels. Am I getting that right?

923
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:52,940
I've not seen that. I'd like to see that, but I've seen papers recently that looking at smokers,

924
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:59,580
some of the adverse effects of smoking seem to be mitigated by a high Omega-3 intake. Sort of the

925
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:03,660
same idea. It's the same idea, yeah, and maybe I'm just not remembering the study correctly, but

926
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:09,980
it sort of goes down this theme of there was a protective benefit of high amounts of EPA and DHA.

927
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:19,100
Let's pivot back over now to the other side of the axis. We talked about linoleic acid or LA as an

928
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:24,700
essential fatty acid. I believe you said we get the lion's share of it from soybean and corn oil,

929
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:32,700
correct? Right. Linoleic acid, you described through the process of elongation, desaturation,

930
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:37,980
ultimately becomes arachidonic acid. How did arachidonic acid get such a bad name? Is that

931
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:44,380
all Barry Sears that we have to thank for that? Partly Barry, partly Bill Lands, partly Artemis

932
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:50,140
Somopoulos. The way I look at it is if we think back to the 1960s and 70s, we had this thing called

933
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:56,780
the P to S ratio in oils. Do you remember that? Polydicetrates, right. For heart health, you want

934
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:05,500
to eat high P to S ratio foods, oils. The ratio mentality, that was the idea. And that made sense.

935
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:10,380
We want less saturated fat, more polyunsaturated fat was good for your health, good for your heart.

936
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:16,780
We move a couple decades in and now we have the omega-6s and the omega-3s and we know that they

937
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:24,380
eat the L, linoleic and ALA, omega-3 side, compete with each other for enzymes to metabolize up to

938
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:30,860
other EPAs and arachidontites. And so there's a competition there. So people like ratios,

939
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:37,580
black and white, you know, black hat, white hat, arachidonic acid does give rise to several or many

940
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:43,020
pro-inflammatory compounds. No question. It's a good thing. It's what it's supposed to do.

941
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:47,660
The concern is, does that get out of whack and does it go on and on and on and never get resolved?

942
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:54,300
So arachidonic got this black hat idea. It's the pro-inflammatory one and an EPA and DHA

943
01:31:54,300 --> 01:32:00,300
are the anti-inflammatory ones. So let's just do an omega-6 omega-3 ratio. I have a lot of problems

944
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:05,020
with that ratio. I think it doesn't make any sense, partly because it presumes that the omega-6s

945
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:11,020
actually are bad and they really aren't. The evidence now coming out from large meta-analyses

946
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:16,700
where people are, and we were part of this study, where they looked at plasma linoleic acid levels

947
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:22,940
or blood linoleic acid levels. So omega-6 levels in the blood and arachidonic levels in the blood.

948
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:27,100
And they measured it in thousands and thousands of people and they followed them

949
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:34,380
for the development of heart disease and diabetes over between five and 30 years. And it was a very

950
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:38,780
clear signal that the higher the level of linoleic acid, meaning the more you eat,

951
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:44,540
that's the only way you can raise it, is by eating more. The higher the level of linoleic acid in the

952
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:49,020
blood, the lower the risk of heart disease, the lower the risk of myocardial infarction,

953
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:56,140
the lower the risk of diabetes. And arachidonic acid levels were unrelated to either of those

954
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:00,140
outcomes. It was neutral. It wasn't higher or lower, it didn't make any difference.

955
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:06,060
So what's the correlation between arachidonic acid level and linoleic acid level? And what's

956
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:10,300
the correlation between arachidonic acid level and ingested linoleic acid?

957
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:15,260
Virtually none. Even though we know arachidonic can be made from linoleic acid,

958
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:22,540
only less than 1% of the linoleic we eat gets made into arachidonic. Very little of it's made.

959
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:26,300
And you may have already said this and I was too busy trying to think about something you

960
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:34,460
previously said, but just as ALA conversion to EPA is virtually irrelevant, is that a similar

961
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,500
statement for LA conversion to AA?

962
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:43,420
The same idea. When the people have given radioactive tracers and measured how much

963
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:53,100
actually goes from LA to AA, less than 1%, very little. And people have also looked at,

964
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:59,580
if you give a huge dose of LA in the diet and then you measure the effect on a plasma arachidonic,

965
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:07,180
no effect. If you completely strip the diet for weeks and weeks of LA, arachidonic levels

966
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:11,820
don't go down. It just doesn't respond. So arachidonic is very tightly controlled

967
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:17,660
and it's not driven by a linoleic acid. While we're on the subject of ratios, Bill,

968
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:26,140
one of the other ratios that people like to talk about is the ratio of AA to EPA and AA to DHA.

969
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:34,220
Do you put that in the same category of helpfulness as total omega 3 to total omega 6?

970
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:39,340
It's a little bit better. One of the problems with the total omega 6 to omega 3 is it doesn't

971
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:46,620
define what the fatty acids are. Right, because the omega 3 can be dominated by ALA, which is

972
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:50,860
what it is. That number could be dwarfed by how much is EPA and DHA.

973
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:56,700
Correct. Right. And the same on the omega 6 side. There's seven different omega 6 fatty acids you

974
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:03,100
throw into that recipe. Which one are we talking about? And so that's a problem. The fact that you

975
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:11,500
can have the same ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 with very high levels of Omega 6 and Omega 3 or

976
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:18,780
very low levels of Omega 6 and Omega 3, same ratio, doesn't make any sense. And it's very hard to,

977
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:24,460
the other problem is it presumes that the Omega 6 is bad and the Omega 3 is good. I love a quote

978
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:29,820
I read somewhere that the guy said, what's the point of the Omega 6-Omega 3 ratio? It's good

979
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:38,060
versus good. So why are we doing this? AA-EPA ratio is better because it at least defines which

980
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:43,660
fatty acids you're talking about. That's good. I don't think it's any more informative. It leaves

981
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:50,780
out DHA completely, which I think is unfortunate. Again, it's a ratio that presumes arachidontic

982
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:56,460
bad. And I don't think we can presume that because arachidontic is not only made into

983
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:02,140
pro-inflammatory, it's made into anti-inflammatory molecules too. What drives that balance? First of

984
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:07,580
all, what are the top two or three things that drive the pool of arachidontic acid? And then

985
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:15,340
secondly, what are the top two or three things that drive its destination, either pro or anti-inflammatory?

986
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:21,340
That's tough to say. I don't know what controls arachidontic levels, substrate levels to begin

987
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:28,220
with. That's kind of amazing, right? Some that you make, the tissues get incorporated with a certain

988
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:34,380
amount of arachidontic and the body likes a certain level. And it's released from membranes

989
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:39,900
when you have a stressor of some kind and you make prostaglandins. But there are like 100 different

990
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:46,460
metabolites you get made from these molecules. And it's almost virtually impossible to study all of

991
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:53,900
them in vivo together. You can take one particular metabolite and sprinkle it on a cell in a test

992
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:59,900
tube and see what it does and then write a paper on it. But it may have nothing to do with reality

993
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:05,500
because in reality you've got a hundred different molecules all banging on the door, fighting with

994
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:11,980
each other, one balancing the other. It's an incredible dance that you can't replicate

995
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:18,060
outside of the body. And people draw these conclusions about this fatty acid is bad and

996
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:24,940
that fatty acid is good based on really naive views, I think, of the complexity of the biology.

997
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:30,540
What's most compelling is let's look at blood levels of fatty acids and who's actually having

998
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:37,340
diseases. Who's getting sick? I mean, I don't care about looking at metabolic charts and what pathway

999
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:41,740
intersects with what pathway or competes. That's swell. But at the end of the day,

1000
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:48,060
if omega-6 levels are high and that's associated with reduced risk for diabetes and heart disease,

1001
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:52,780
that's a very powerful testimony to me that the omega-6s are good.

1002
01:37:53,900 --> 01:38:00,460
When you say omega-6, in that situation, is the bulk of it made up through LA or is it a proxy

1003
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:07,900
metric of LA plus AA? LA. Because that's what we eat. Again, we eat, on average, we eat maybe 15

1004
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:14,140
grams a day of LA and we eat about a tenth of a gram a day of arachnonic. You have a bit of a

1005
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:21,740
contrarian view of the sort of plant oils, the canolas, the safflowers and the sunflowers,

1006
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:27,740
et cetera. Many people view these as sort of unhealthy oils. Do you view any of those oils

1007
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:31,420
when consumed in the quantities that Americans consume them as unhealthy?

1008
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:35,980
I thought you were going to say people, when you talk about canola and olive oil,

1009
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:39,740
people think those are great because they're mono. They're mono-rich oils.

1010
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:44,380
Well, yeah, that's actually funny. The canola and the safflower, at least in its original form,

1011
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:49,260
and olive oil are virtually indistinguishable by fatty acid composition.

1012
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,820
Well, canola and olive, yeah. But in the safflower, it was like 77%

1013
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:58,300
linoleic acid originally. And now it's down to like 15%.

1014
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:04,220
Right. And isn't it largely boosted in omega mono-unsaturated now, omega-9?

1015
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:09,260
Mono is right. They call them high mono, high mono saff and high mono sunflower.

1016
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:13,580
And I think those are a problem. I'm sorry to see that happening. I know what's happening

1017
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:18,940
because partly because omega-6 fatty acids are unstable or more likely to go rancid.

1018
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,180
So they like to get rid of them, which led to the whole trans fatty acid thing,

1019
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:29,020
but we're not going to go there today. So we're reducing omega-6 levels in our oils,

1020
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:33,580
which is going to reduce them in our blood, which if the evidence is pointing in the right

1021
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:39,260
direction, that's going to show lead to an increased risk for these major diseases.

1022
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:43,740
Wasn't there a day when we really didn't have much omega-6 in our diet?

1023
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:44,540
Sure.

1024
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,740
Isn't it a relatively recent thing? Like more than a few hundred years ago, wouldn't we have

1025
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:56,700
only been consuming saturated and mono-unsaturated fats primarily in addition to EPAs and DHA?

1026
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,500
Right, right. We didn't live very long either.

1027
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:04,140
Well, is that really true though? I mean, the mortality curve had more to do with infectious

1028
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:08,140
diseases, infant mortality and things like that, but we certainly weren't dying of chronic diseases

1029
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:15,740
either. Are you suggesting that the addition of plant seed oils is protective against the things

1030
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:19,500
that were killing us or are we surviving despite them?

1031
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:25,500
I don't know what the case is. I know that people have shown huge increases in little

1032
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:30,620
like acid intake over the 20th century. They do that with the intent of scaring people.

1033
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:36,140
Look at how unnatural this is, but then you look at death rates from heart disease,

1034
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:40,460
heart disease rates as the levels of LA go up, they seem to go down.

1035
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:46,540
Although it's so hard to look at that, the problem with that type of data is that we

1036
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:53,260
superimpose the use of statins and advanced cardiac life support and defibrillators and

1037
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:59,580
smoking. Yeah, so I think it's very difficult to do that. But if we look at the literature as far

1038
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:05,900
as what we can say, I mean, it seems that we're on more stable ground saying that EPA and DHA

1039
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:12,780
are probably protective. I'm still at a bit of a loss as to what to say about Omega-6. I mean,

1040
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:16,700
on a personal level, I just find them kind of disgusting, if I'm going to be brutally honest.

1041
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:20,380
I just think they're disgusting oils. I think they taste like crap.

1042
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:28,220
But that's just my taste, right? I think canola, safflower, sunflower, corn oil,

1043
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:31,740
they just taste gross to me, but I think that's because I've just acquired a taste

1044
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,260
for saturated fat and monounsaturated fat over time.

1045
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:40,380
Oh, well, yeah, that could be. And most people don't eat it as oil. It's incorporated in

1046
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:44,780
salad dressings. Well, but that's my point. I don't know the last time I had a salad dressing

1047
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:52,220
out of a bottle because it just tastes disgusting relative to being able to put real olive oil on.

1048
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:56,940
And by the way, we should actually say, most of the time when you buy olive oil,

1049
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:01,580
you're not really getting olive oil, right? I mean, it's a very, very diluted olive oil.

1050
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:05,900
But assuming you're getting real olive oil, which actually has kind of a strong taste to it,

1051
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:10,860
away you go. I don't like to get too far down the omega-6 pathway other than to say I don't think

1052
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:16,780
it's the evil that people think it is. And the problem is that we need to get more EPA and DHA

1053
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:22,380
in our diet, not necessarily get all hung up on omega-6. Yeah, it seems to me that that's the

1054
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:28,300
bigger place to move the needle is if you can increase the EPA and DHA in your diet,

1055
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:35,500
the body's ability to buffer high amounts of LA seems impressive. Is that a fair statement?

1056
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:39,900
I don't know about the second half. I don't know that it needs to be buffered.

1057
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:46,380
Maybe buffer is the wrong word. Again, I think I use this term of a reducing function or a capacitor

1058
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:53,020
in a circuit. It just seems like you can have people like I consume virtually no,

1059
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:59,740
none of those seed oils, meaning I probably consume one-tenth of what the average person

1060
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:05,100
does because I, again, I just don't eat many processed foods and I don't have any of those

1061
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:10,060
oils. I don't have salad dressing or any of those oils in my home. So they're going to sneak in a

1062
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,300
little bit somewhere, but I'm not consuming them in high amounts. Well, sure, they're going to be

1063
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:18,060
in the beach, animal products. Sure, exactly. So you're going to get them through those things.

1064
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:25,500
But if you look at my blood levels, my RBC levels, and compare them to someone who's eating

1065
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:31,660
literally 10 times the amount I'm eating, we might only differ by 10 or 20%. That's what I mean by

1066
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:39,020
there's sort of this huge buffer capacitance function to it. Whereas on the EPA DHA level,

1067
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:44,620
it seems that what you eat matters a heck of a lot more in the output. Is that a fair assessment?

1068
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:50,380
Absolutely true. Your cells respond to EPA and DHA much more strongly than they do to

1069
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:57,260
changes in LA intake. Do you think there's clinically a role for looking at the AA to

1070
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:04,460
EPA and AA to DHA levels? Can we infer anything from that? I prefer the Omega-3 index. Yeah.

1071
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:11,180
Just look at the EPA DHA total. To me, that's the problem. The problem is the lack of EPA and DHA.

1072
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:16,860
If you get those up, your RACADONATE levels will go down. That's the best way to lower. If you want

1073
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:23,020
to lower RACADONATE is to take fish oil. And so your ratios will change. You can change ratios

1074
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:29,660
all day long by just changing the denominator. And what I don't like about AA-EPA ratio or

1075
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:35,180
Omega-6 to Omega-3 is it distracts people from the real problem, which is the lack of EPA and DHA.

1076
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:41,740
It lets them run and say, okay, well, I can fix my ratio by eating less Omega-6 and not eating more

1077
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:48,460
Omega-3. That doesn't help. Whereas if you just look at the Omega-3 index, EPA DHA, that's your focus.

1078
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:52,860
It's too low. Fix it. Raise it up. Everything else will settle out.

1079
01:44:53,740 --> 01:45:02,380
What do you think is the best case for and against the notion that, I mean, the REDUCE-IT study,

1080
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:08,940
in addition to at least one or two other studies, makes a pretty compelling case that you don't

1081
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:16,220
have to eat fish to get these benefits. You can get the supplements. I know that prior to a year ago,

1082
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:22,140
when REDUCE-IT came out, there was still a piece of me that wondered, did you have to actually eat

1083
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:30,140
the fish? And is the consumption of fish itself and the EPA DHA level that rises with it more of a

1084
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:36,780
proxy for some subtler thing that we're not measuring? Is the Omega-3 content of fish and

1085
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:40,860
hence of your blood levels really just a marker of fish intake and there's something really

1086
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:46,140
beneficial in fish other than Omega-3 that's really doing the good work or something?

1087
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:51,340
Or even complements it. Yeah. So even if you posit that the EPA and the DHA are part of the benefit

1088
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:56,700
from eating fish, is there something else in the fish or other things that one would eat with it

1089
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:02,140
that augment or transduce that benefit that you could be missed? And REDUCE-IT now makes that

1090
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:07,580
question much less likely, makes the answer to that question being yes, much less likely. But

1091
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:11,180
just I want to round that out and make sure that you haven't forgotten anything you wanted to talk

1092
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:15,740
about there. I agree with you. I think it can be done with we prefer to do with fish if possible,

1093
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:21,420
but there's a lot of challenges with that. Not only just personal taste and cost and ecological

1094
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:26,700
issues. So yeah, you can do it from EPA and I think you can do it from EPA plus DHA supplements.

1095
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:32,300
I think we need to talk about the other study though, the vital study, which was reported out

1096
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:38,460
at the same meeting as REDUCE-IT. And it was widely reported. It was not done in people with

1097
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:44,460
high triglycerides. It was done in normal, relatively healthy Americans in about 20,000,

1098
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:47,820
25,000 of them. What was the dose that was used?

1099
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:52,700
It was one low vasocapsule, so 850 milligrams of EPA DHA.

1100
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:55,980
Yeah. And that study didn't find a difference, did it?

1101
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:01,580
Well, that depends on how deeply you want to look in the study. If you just want to read the

1102
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,100
primary endpoint.

1103
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:07,020
Yeah. Well, my take on that, well, who cares what my take is? Tell us your take,

1104
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,540
but starting with the dose.

1105
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:13,180
You're not a standard doctor, but the typical doctor, his take on it is it didn't work

1106
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:18,700
because that's what the press said. That's what the abstract said because they were looking for

1107
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:25,740
an effect of less than one gram a day of EPA and DHA. And they were looking at a composite endpoint

1108
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:30,700
of four or five different elements of cardiovascular disease, stroke, non-fatal stroke,

1109
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:37,340
stroke, non-fatal heart disease. A composite endpoint, which three of the elements maybe

1110
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:41,820
were not affected, but one was affected tremendously. And it was heart attacks were

1111
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:48,300
significantly 20% reduction in heart attacks and 20% reduction in fatal heart attacks were

1112
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:54,940
one of the findings. I mean, that's impressive for 850 milligrams a day. It's amazing to me

1113
01:47:54,940 --> 01:48:01,180
that you can even do that now. And they found that if you look at people who report eating

1114
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:08,780
less than 1.5 fish meals a week, there was a significant benefit on the primary endpoint

1115
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:14,940
of cardiovascular disease by taking just one capsule of a vasa. There was some really positive

1116
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:20,780
stuff in this study, but it was buried in the press headlines that fish oils don't work

1117
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:28,140
without any caveats. If you exclude the composite metric and you just look at the CHD metric,

1118
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:34,380
how did the magnitude both in absolute and relative risk compare to reduce it? This is

1119
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:39,980
one of the things I like doing to sense check studies, which is kind of do my own analysis

1120
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:46,380
of them and say, well, like that, again, an example would be comparing Odyssey and Fourier

1121
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:52,380
and saying, well, based on the fact that one came in heavily statinized, the other was not heavily

1122
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:57,980
statinized, durations are about the same. Where would we be fooled versus not fooled on this?

1123
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:01,980
Can you do that sort of analysis between these two studies as well and say, did they at least

1124
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:07,260
have a dose response with respect to the reduction in MI, for example?

1125
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:11,420
Yeah, that's a good question. I never looked at it that way. I've never broken it down,

1126
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:19,180
done the math that way. I know that there was a 9% or 10% reduction in, maybe it was 20%. I can't

1127
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:24,780
remember at the moment, of risk for heart disease. But again, these were not people at high risk. So

1128
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:30,140
your absolute risk reduction was pretty small. Relative was pretty big, but also the dose was

1129
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:37,260
very low. Yeah. So you had normal triglyceride, low risk people on one fifth of the dose. So it's

1130
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:43,260
very hard to compare those two studies. Do you have a sense of what they were really trying to

1131
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:51,100
find out was the goal of that study? Does a low dose of an easily accessible supplement matter in

1132
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:55,740
people who are healthy? I mean, I assume that's at the most basic level. That was the question.

1133
01:49:55,740 --> 01:50:00,700
First primary prevention study, really, that's been done. So they wanted to use it,

1134
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:07,740
was planned 10 years ago. And at that time, one gram of low VASA. So they didn't use a supplement.

1135
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:13,180
They use low VASA, pharmaceutical, but they just use one gram instead of the four grams

1136
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:18,940
indicated by the FDA. And they were looking at cardiovascular disease and cancer. I mean,

1137
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:24,620
it was a huge thing in primary prevention. So they found no effect on cancer. And they found

1138
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:29,980
in their composite endpoint, no statistically significant. It was reduced, but it wasn't

1139
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:35,180
significant. But if you look at certain elements of the composite, they were strongly benefited.

1140
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:41,500
20%. I'm trying to think if there's a 20% reduction in MI, that's what sticks in my mind.

1141
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:45,980
Do you think the most important takeaway from that is if you believe that the study

1142
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:52,140
had a methodologic issue that prevented it from reaching the clinical and statistical significance,

1143
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:57,180
one would want to move forward. Is the bigger knock on that study, the dose,

1144
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:02,940
the patient population that was studied, or the composite endpoint?

1145
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:09,260
All of those together can conspire to have a neutral study when there really are some good

1146
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:15,660
effects that are overlooked. I mean, what people don't balance is the extreme safety of these

1147
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:22,060
products and cheapness. We're looking at something, even one capsule of VASA. It's cheap, completely

1148
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:28,220
safe. It doesn't interact with anything. And if there's even a hint of benefit, why wouldn't

1149
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:33,900
you promote it? Do you think that if a person's listening to this and they're deciding, hey,

1150
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:41,340
this has got me over the goal line as far as I should be using EPA and or DHA, is there an

1151
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:48,540
advantage to using the pharma grade product versus a reputable supplement company? Again,

1152
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:53,180
the two that I like are, and I have no financial ties to any of these companies, just like them

1153
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:57,420
through reputation and having read analyses of their product, but like Carlson's or Nordic

1154
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:02,460
Naturals, for example. I don't think there's a substantial difference at all in quality.

1155
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:09,180
There's a lot of Omega-3 supplement companies that make very high quality stuff that they just

1156
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:14,060
aren't going to the trouble of going through an FDA approval to get it treated and developed as a

1157
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:19,980
drug. But it's the same chemistry. And sometimes, if you get the EPA covered, it might actually be

1158
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:23,980
cheaper than the supplement. The supplements are actually not that cheap. They're actually on the

1159
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:29,980
spectrum of supplements that I take when you compare something like magnesium oxide versus

1160
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,900
fish oil. These fish oils are pretty darn expensive supplements.

1161
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:37,980
It's a lot of work to get them to be that pure. One thing I'd say about reduce it,

1162
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:43,980
and back to that one again, you can't buy a pure EPA dietary supplement as far as I know.

1163
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:48,620
No, I think the best we can do, Carlson's does make something called EPA gems.

1164
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:58,540
I'm going to get it wrong, but the gist of it is it's probably 75% to 80% EPA to DHA. So it's heavily

1165
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:04,700
skewed in a direction that's concentrating EPA, which is not the way it normally occurs, of course,

1166
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:09,340
but that's the closest you can get. And is there anything that we haven't talked about, Bill,

1167
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:14,140
on this topic that you would like to add? Is there any other trial that you think it's just really

1168
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:19,340
important that we get to? Well, I don't think there's necessarily a trial, but if I can just

1169
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:25,580
get into what I do now over the last 10 years is I think measuring blood omega-3 levels are really

1170
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:32,220
important. And whether it's the test we do with the omega-3 index, which is red cell EPA, DHA,

1171
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:38,220
or a plasma test or a plasma phospholipid test or whole blood test, whatever, I just think we

1172
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:45,340
need to see more doctors measuring omega-3 status because it means a lot. Low omega-3 means something,

1173
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:52,700
and you know this, but I really want to encourage people to make the assessment of omega-3 status

1174
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:57,980
in their patients as important as measuring cholesterol. Your company is called OmegaQuant,

1175
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:02,460
correct? Right, right. And you've been at the helm of that for about a decade, right?

1176
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:08,700
Yeah, this is our 10th year, right? Yeah, that tells me how much time has flown because I remember

1177
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:13,580
when you had just sort of started that. That's a tough business to be in, right? Because just

1178
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:18,140
laboratory, specialty labs, anything that's not sort of garden variety off the shelf tends to be

1179
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:23,820
sort of misunderstood by the payer environment. And this tends to be a tough place, isn't it?

1180
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,700
Yeah, but we're not in the payer environment. We're all cash pay.

1181
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:33,500
Are you? Okay, got it. That's where the quests and the lab cores in the Cleveland's and the

1182
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:38,460
Boston's are. And you used to be health diagnostic lab, of course, back in those days.

1183
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:42,940
So can patients come directly to you or do your tests have to be ordered by physicians?

1184
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:46,860
People can come directly to our website and order the tests. It's $50.

1185
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:53,340
So for $50, a patient can basically receive a kit from you that they take into it. I assume

1186
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:57,100
it's a blood test, not a saliva test or something. It's a finger stick test.

1187
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,340
I got it. So they don't even need to go into a lab.

1188
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:02,060
No, no, they just do it at home and send it to us.

1189
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:06,460
That's the same test that I'm getting embedded within my much broader panels, I assume,

1190
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:10,220
where I'm seeing the percent of EPA, DHA, or is that a different company?

1191
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:14,300
What lab is doing it? Well, for example, what was True Health Diagnostics using?

1192
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:18,860
Okay, True Health. So that, yeah, True Health took over from Health Diagnostic Lab and Health

1193
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:23,020
Diagnostic Lab took my test. So they're using my test.

1194
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:28,540
I see. Okay. Do you think there are other tests out there that are directionally comparable or,

1195
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:33,020
I mean, I guess you're a bit conflicted to say that there's other, yeah, it's a loaded question.

1196
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:36,140
Yeah, they're certainly directionally comparable. It's just the number.

1197
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:40,860
Don't do a plasma omega-3 test and expect to get 8 to 12% EPA, DHA.

1198
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:45,820
Plasma doesn't go that high or it's very hard to get that high. So plasma levels are lower

1199
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:52,220
numbers. They correlate pretty well, by and large, with red cells. But red cells are much

1200
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:58,380
more stable long-term marker of omega-3 status than plasma is. So I like the red cell test for

1201
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:03,900
that purpose. So that's pretty much what we use in our research studies is red cell. I'd rather

1202
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:07,180
see a doctor measure a plasma omega-3 than not measure anything.

1203
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:10,380
That's something that people can also get through LabCorpQuest and all of the sort of

1204
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:14,540
more generic labs, I assume. Yeah, I'm not even sure they can get it at LabCorpQuest. It has a

1205
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:19,180
plasma phospholate assay they do. What does Boston Heart do? Do you know?

1206
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:25,660
I think they do a whole plasma. I see. Okay. So going forward, if we're not using THD,

1207
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:29,980
we'll have to figure out a way to come do directly. That'd be great. Love to do it.

1208
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:36,220
We've got a lot of doctors who do it. But I don't know what kind of reimbursement is being paid

1209
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:40,540
for these tests in the insurance world. I think it's not much.

1210
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:45,100
I was about to say I'm going to go with the not much box on that one.

1211
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,060
Yeah. Yeah. So.

1212
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:50,220
But again, these aren't tests you have to get every two weeks, right? I mean,

1213
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:54,860
this is the type of test where you get it maybe once a year and you make a change and you look

1214
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:58,300
and see, hey, am I taking enough of this supplement or am I eating enough fish?

1215
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:02,380
Yeah. You see about every four months. It takes about four months after you make a change,

1216
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:04,860
your omega-3 intake to see a new steady state.

1217
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,220
Oh, okay. Well, actually that's very interesting. I'm glad you brought that up. I wasn't aware it

1218
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:11,180
was that long actually. I thought you could see a change quicker, but

1219
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:14,460
it's the life of the red blood cell, I guess, to fully turn them over.

1220
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:15,020
Red cell, exactly.

1221
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:16,860
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that makes sense.

1222
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:23,020
Bill, is there anything else that we didn't discuss on this particular nuanced and super

1223
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:23,900
enjoyable topic?

1224
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:31,740
Golly, I think we ran down the omega-6 stuff. We talked about EPA and DHA alone. There is a big

1225
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:37,980
study that's going to come out, should finish a year from now called Strength that is bigger

1226
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:42,940
than Reduce It and using the same dose as Reduce It, but it's EPA plus DHA.

1227
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:45,500
What dose approximately? So that would be four grams total?

1228
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:53,500
The drug is called Epinova or Epinova. It's from AstraZeneca. It's a 13,000 patient trial,

1229
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:59,180
virtually the same inclusion criteria as Reduce It. It'll be about a five-year follow-up. The

1230
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:04,940
same as Reduce It. I'm pretty sure they're going to get much higher omega-3 index levels than Reduce

1231
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:05,500
It did.

1232
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:11,180
Again, their drug is four grams EPA plus some amount of DHA or four grams total?

1233
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:19,180
It's very much like Lovesa, EPA plus DHA at around about 85 percent, but they're not

1234
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:23,820
ethyl esters. They're free fatty acids. They're unasterified.

1235
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,900
Do you think that actually makes any difference?

1236
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:28,700
They're much more readily absorbed.

1237
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:35,980
Because the esterified ones presumably, is it like cholesterol where esterified

1238
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:40,140
variants are much harder to absorb and you risk actually not absorbing them at all?

1239
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:44,300
Well, yeah, that's the problem. It's been shown pretty clearly that if you take an

1240
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:50,700
ethyl ester of omega-3 on an empty stomach, the absorption is quite low, almost none,

1241
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,780
as opposed to taking it with food, which improves the absorption quite a bit,

1242
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:59,180
but a triglyceride-based oil or a free fatty acid, more to the point,

1243
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:03,180
free fatty acid doesn't require any enzymatic conversion to get absorbed at all.

1244
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:09,020
The triglyceride has to have, and the ethyl ester both have to have enzymatic conversion in the gut.

1245
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:11,980
Well, that's actually really interesting. I'm glad you brought that up because,

1246
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:16,940
as you know, a lot of people these days are fasting more and more or time restricting

1247
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:21,980
their feeding. It does pose a little bit of a problem the way I've always got around it.

1248
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:26,380
If I don't eat breakfast, which I don't, a lot of the time is I sort of take my fish oil at night

1249
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:31,020
as close to dinner as possible, but it's easier to forget that way. But you're saying another way

1250
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:34,460
around that is if you really just want to take these things in the morning and be done with them,

1251
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:37,980
you basically have to take one of the pharma grade versions because they're the ones that

1252
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:42,140
come as free fatty acids. Right. It's only experimental. I mean, it's not experimental.

1253
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:46,060
It's approved by the FDA, but it's not being marketed. It's the only one that's a free fatty

1254
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:52,380
acid right now is this epanova. The Vasipa and Loveza are ethyl esters.

1255
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:59,260
So basically it'll be about a year before we even have the option to get a free fatty acid version.

1256
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:04,060
That's when their study will finish. And I think it'll be as or more successful than,

1257
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:10,540
than reduce it. That's my guess. And that will be released at the American Heart in 2020.

1258
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:16,780
On their clinicaltrials.gov website, it says the studies will finish in October of next year.

1259
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,460
So whether they'll be able to

1260
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,740
Scramble an abstract.

1261
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:22,620
We'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Whether, I don't know.

1262
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:27,660
Well, maybe when that study comes up, Bill, we'll have to sit down in early 21 and discuss it.

1263
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:29,100
Love to.

1264
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:32,460
Well, Bill, thanks again. This was really interesting. For me personally,

1265
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:37,180
I learned a lot talking with you about this kind of stuff. I just know that this episode will be

1266
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:40,300
one of those episodes that a lot of people end up coming back to over and over again,

1267
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:45,900
because it is so confusing. So thank you for the historical context, the overview,

1268
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:51,420
and perhaps most importantly, just the sort of nitty gritty details on the health benefits of

1269
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:56,060
these things. Oh yeah. My pleasure. Thank you very much for inviting me. I've really enjoyed it.
