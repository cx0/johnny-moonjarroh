00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,200
In you go, it is so great to be sitting down with you again. Last time of course we did this in

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,280
person, but these days I've become too lazy to travel around and do podcasts in person. So do it

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,200
by video. But that said, I really hope you can get out here to Austin so we can train together

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,800
and do some cool ex-fizz. And also I need to get out there to sort of do some of the ex-fizz

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,800
stuff we've talked about. But you know, I almost don't know where to begin because there's so much

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,040
stuff we talked about last time that we want to double click on this time. There's so much that

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,640
has changed in the interval from when we spoke, gosh, probably two years ago, a little over two

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,120
years ago. I thought one place we could pick it up, something we didn't really talk about last time,

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,320
was your work with Tadi Pogacha because of course I don't think anybody knew who he was two years ago

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,880
or two and a half years ago. And of course now he is, I don't know, I mean I think it's safe to say

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,640
he has the potential to potentially go down as the greatest Tour de France cyclist of all time,

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,240
given how young he is, not to put that expectation out there, but to win the tour at such a young age,

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,040
to not just win the yellow jersey, but the white jersey, the polka dot jersey repeatedly. He looks

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,520
like something of a different species almost. And I say that not in the way that people typically say

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,960
those things of cyclists in a way that's suspicious of anything. So I don't know, maybe for the listeners

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,280
who are not familiar with the Tour de France, not familiar with your work with the UAE team and your

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,880
work with Tadi Pogacha, maybe give folks a little bit of an update as to what you've been doing with

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,880
in professional cycling over the past couple of years.

20
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,960
Yeah, well, first of all, thank you very much for having me here. It's an honor and really excited

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,560
for this and I appreciate the opportunity. I had a lot of fun last time and I hope to have fun again.

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Yeah, my work with Tadi started in late 2018 when he signed up for the team. And yeah, I was introduced

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:24,440
to him by our CEO, Janetti, and our general manager, Machin. And they told me, hey, just start working

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:32,120
with this guy. And he was what at the time, 19, maybe? Yeah, 19. It was 19 at the time.

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,240
Just turned 19, in fact. And yeah, so I started to work with him. And right away, I realized

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,160
that he had very good potential. And I think like a couple of months earlier, no, or later,

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:57,720
I forgot when we had that podcast already told you about him. And yeah, and I told that, yeah,

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,200
we have a guy that has good potential. And yeah, that was today.

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,600
And to put it in perspective, I mean, has good potential is one thing to then go and do what he

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:16,120
did is would make that statement the understatement of the century for folks who maybe don't follow

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,360
cycling as closely, right? Yeah, I mean, I try to be cautious, right? And I don't usually say

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,320
that a lot of people who have. We talked about it over dinner that night.

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Yeah, yeah. When I say someone has good potential is very good potential. I don't usually say that

34
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:43,480
lightly of anybody, right? What did you see in him in 2018, 2019, that led you to believe that

35
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,960
even amongst that class, because professional cyclists, you know, from a physiologic standpoint,

36
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,800
are all very special individuals. What did you see in him that made you think he has potential in

37
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:03,480
your understated way? Well, first, the physiological testing that we we started doing right off the

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:14,440
bat, I saw like that he had amazing capabilities, you know, the oxidative capabilities, like ability

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,920
to clear lactate and and to put out create amount of power output for long periods of time.

40
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:31,160
So when you say that, was it specifically his FTP that impressed you? Or was it his, as you said,

41
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,400
lactate clearance, was it shorter bursts of power that were higher than FTP, but the speed with which

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,040
he could do with the successive repeats that he could do? I mean, tell me some of the testing you

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,600
were putting cyclists through and how he stood out. So it's kind of like similar tests that I did to

44
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:57,160
you. Right. And this is kind of like where I saw that at a given power output, his lactate levels,

45
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,880
blood lactate levels were extremely low. And since I've been doing this specific protocol for 20 years

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,400
with professional athletes, professional cyclists in this specific case, that's where I have my

47
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,080
cheat sheet, right, where I know I can categorize where people are. And I was like, he was like,

48
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,080
whoa, wait on the other side, you know, way above almost everybody that I had tested or around the

49
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,000
same category. And for that age, that's what I saw. Like, whoa, first of all, he is at a different

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,200
category and he's his first year pro, he's pretty much a junior. And and then that's where like,

51
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,520
I could see he could sustain a high amount of power with very low lactate compared to the rest.

52
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,800
And then throughout the trainings, looking, we use training peaks, the software, looking at training

53
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,160
peaks, that's where I would see his different abilities to sustain a given power output for

54
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,440
the whole day, or for a specific effort, a glycolytic effort and a climb. And it would see

55
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,800
the power output that he would be putting out. And so altogether, then I saw his trainability,

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:20,200
how easy he would get the concepts, how easy he would be comfortable with the training, how easy

57
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:28,440
he would recover. I, you know, I like the feedback, I talk to him once, twice a day, and over WhatsApp

58
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:37,320
too, you know, the feedback. And I know very well when a hard week is or what a hard week is.

59
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,600
And when you see this kid telling you, pretty good, I'm recovering very well. When other ones

60
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,920
are telling you, woof, I had to take it a little bit easier today because I couldn't do this effort.

61
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,880
And we're talking about high level pros. And you see this kid telling you like, yeah, no problem.

62
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,880
That's where you start putting together things. And also, around the same time, with my two

63
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,120
colleagues at the university, Angela D'Alessandro and Travis Netcov, we developed, we started to

64
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,160
developing a platform for metabolomics where we can look at, you know, hundreds, if not thousands,

65
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,200
of metabolites in the human body. And we did it at the Tour of California in 2019, which was like

66
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,080
around April. That's where he wanted. And that's where when we analyzed all his metabolites. And

67
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:33,240
we did already at the training camp in January 2019. And we already saw, wow, this guy has different

68
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:41,640
metabolites at the glycolytic level, oxidative level, recovery level. And we confirmed that at

69
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,600
the Tour of California. And this is where putting all together. So like, yeah, this guy is different.

70
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,960
So going back to what you said about lactate, I assume that one of the data points that is

71
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:01,960
most telling of a cyclist is if you plot on the x-axis watts per kilo and on the y-axis

72
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,400
lactate production, that would be a very, I mean, that might be one of the most telling

73
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,920
graphs you could generate to predict success in the Tour, correct?

74
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:20,440
Absolutely. Absolutely. You see someone at, you know, for example, a normal temple climbing in the

75
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,720
Tour de France, Temple, that is the whole peloton going up.

76
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,240
It's got to be four.

77
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
It's about five watts per kilo.

78
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,200
Is it five watts per kilo? I was about to say, wow, yeah, I was going to say four and a half.

79
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,280
Okay, so wow, the whole peloton is going up at five watts per kilo.

80
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,080
Yeah, something like that. And that's what you see, like someone at that intensity might have

81
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,960
already six millimoles. So you can tell it's going to be very tasking. And others might have one

82
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,200
resting levels, you know? And this is where like, this is it really, really predicts performance.

83
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:59,240
And you can really predict performance in an incredible way. In fact, when we go to these

84
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,520
training camps, like I'm going to go next week for the first training camp of the year for the team,

85
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,720
we do this physiological testing. And I do this protocol, and I get this data. So right away,

86
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,600
I tell the team managers, this guy is way above the rest. These three guys are really, really good

87
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,440
immediately behind it. These two guys are the third level. And then we have all these guys

88
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,080
that they're like really, really bad form. And it pretty much works, you know, then we do different

89
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,040
training, racing simulation, and the teleboom right away. This is how it is. So this is why

90
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,000
it's very predictive. And the same thing too, moving into the season, you see, okay, all these

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,960
three guys are going to be at a very good level when we start the season. This guy who we thought

92
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,360
that he was going to be a very good level, he's not there at all. So and that when the season

93
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,600
starts, you see that it reflects very well what's going to happen. Yeah, it's one of the things about

94
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,280
cycling that I really love. I mean, I don't know if you saw, but I interviewed Lance Armstrong back

95
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,640
in, oh, gosh, probably back in June, or maybe it came out in September. But, you know, one of the

96
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,680
things that we talked about was both on and off EPO or blood transfusions. You sort of knew where

97
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,680
you stood before the race based on your FTP in watts per kilo. So, you know, when he was, he talked

98
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,360
about when he was off EPO, he could hold 450 watts for 30 minutes. So that would be slightly below

99
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,440
FT, that would be slightly above FTP at 70, I think he was 70 to 75 kilos, but it was in the

100
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,920
ballpark of six watts per kilo. And then of course, on EPO, it was 7.1 watts per kilo, a huge

101
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,720
difference. But you knew that number going in. And you sort of knew like, only the GC contenders

102
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,840
could do that. I think that's the thing that a lot of people don't understand about cycling,

103
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,680
which is there's relatively few moments in the tour when you need to sustain that level,

104
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,600
but they always occur at the most important strategic times, right? And that's sort of where

105
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,960
the race is won and lost because the race is won and lost by minutes. It's for a race that is,

106
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,200
how many hours does it take to complete the tour? A hundred hours or something?

107
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,800
That's a good question. Yeah, an average about four and a half, five hours a day.

108
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,640
Yeah, so it's something like that.

109
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,160
It's about a hundred hour race. And yet the difference between the first, second, third guy

110
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,800
will be in some cases seconds, in some cases a few minutes for someone to win by five minutes

111
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,440
is considered a blowout. And so what it really tells you is that there are a handful of minutes

112
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,240
in that race. There are a handful of climbs and time trials that set apart the winners from

113
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,680
everybody else. And that's to me, that's one of the beautiful things about cycling physiology,

114
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,320
is you have these metrics and now I think it's not just FTP, it's watts per kilo with

115
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,800
lactate production. So it gets even more into kind of the critical physiology of recovery.

116
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,640
Yeah, and in EFI we use this metrics a lot for the competition. And we did it this year through

117
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,880
the France. So knowing the power output that he could sustain for, as you very well said,

118
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:31,400
for specific times and climbs, we knew his capabilities. And one of the things that we

119
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,680
knew was that in the Alps, he was at a very, very high level. So, you know, like that famous stage

120
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,600
where he broke away and called the Rome 35 kilometers to the finish line, we are seeing

121
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,880
not only his data, but we see by knowing our writer's data, you can also guess the other

122
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,840
writer's data too, right? It's not rocket science. So we knew that he was at a very high level

123
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,120
and discussing the tactics, you know, because it's part of the thing that we do. We observe

124
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,160
the data that we have, the data that we think the other ones have, and we structure a strategy for

125
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,480
the next day. And hey, does he have the legs to attack? Should he be holding back? Or what

126
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,400
should he be doing? Clearly, it was like, well, tomorrow if he attacks 35 kilometers to the finish

127
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,200
line, he's going to get there with three minutes because the other guys, they're not at that level,

128
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,480
you know? So, wait to the end of the tour where we can try to solve the situation. So we knew his

129
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,640
capabilities very well and discussing this with him and the manager. Yeah, that was the strategy.

130
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,560
First test the legs and like if you had in fact good legs, boom, try to go for it and that's exactly

131
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,960
what he did. Now, how much of that are you going to determine after a night of sleep, right? Where

132
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,680
you say, we're going to look at his resting lactate first thing in the morning. We're going to look at

133
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,280
his heart rate overnight. We're going to look at his heart rate variability overnight.

134
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,360
So in addition to the subjective, for example, how he felt during the previous days attacks,

135
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,800
coupled with some of that objective data, does that partially formulate the strategy also? Or is

136
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,400
it mostly based on historical data from training where you say, I know that when he's at this many

137
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:29,000
watts per kilo for this many minutes, he has the capacity to recover. Yeah, I see it. It's more the

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,440
latter, right? Where we have all that physiological data and the trends and how it is. And what we

139
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:47,080
see at this level, these guys, they're so good at ignoring their feelings. Sometimes it's just

140
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,680
kind of how they wake up. You know his capabilities. So if he wakes up fresh and say, how are you doing

141
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:02,360
today? Like, oh yeah, it's like a baby. Like boom, then you're ready. And sometimes, yeah,

142
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,120
it's just we try not to focus on many other metrics the day off because we have already

143
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:17,160
things. And sometimes heart rate variability might not be very precise. And we don't want to

144
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:24,520
put some ideas in the head. And if I'm speaking with him, and I'm not going to mention any brand

145
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,040
or anything, but looking at heart rate variability someday, he said, look, today, he told me that I

146
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,840
was fatigued, that algorithm. And I went out there and beat my record, right? And the clients,

147
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,520
obviously, I'm not fatigued. In other days, it tells you you're in top form and I feel a little

148
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,400
more fatigued. So this is what these algorithms, we need to be careful sometimes and might work with

149
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,960
maybe general population, but with this type of athletes, at this level, I really feel that

150
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,280
it's better once you have all the work done. And they know, you know, their capabilities,

151
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:10,280
like, are you ready to go? It's like a top performer at a theater, right? It's like,

152
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,400
you have worked very hard. Now it's up to like, are you ready to go? Do you have a good net lead?

153
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,320
Are you ready to perform? And a good performer will say, yes, I'm ready to go.

154
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,480
I agree with you completely. Even for me, and I'm not at top level anything, I have not found

155
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,960
the predictors of, you know, readiness to be very accurate or to necessarily reflect how well I'm

156
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,920
going to perform. I've had amazing performances by performances, I mean workouts, right? Like,

157
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,240
that's, that's the only metric I'm performing in. I've had amazing workouts. When my prediction

158
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,400
was that it would not be good. And I've also had the prediction saying, you're on top of the world

159
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,040
and I've not performed well. So, you know, I wish I could say with more clarity what the frequency

160
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:07,320
of those deviations or discordances are, but I can agree that putting the wrong idea in somebody's

161
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,640
head, when the predictive, when there's nothing you can do about it. I mean, that's the other thing

162
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,840
too. It's sort of like, at best, if it was perfectly accurate, it would be great because

163
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,120
you could say, look, today maybe we shouldn't attack. Today it's damage control day. You know,

164
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,280
one of the things I want to ask you about here, and you've spoken about this publicly, so it might

165
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,080
be that you're just going to restate the views that you've shared publicly. But I've always felt

166
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:41,800
that now that we have such great transparency from the sort of that high octane era of sort of the

167
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,960
maximum, probably cheating in cycling, which, you know, in my view is kind of that two decades of

168
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,400
the 90s and 2000s. And we pretty much know now what kind of numbers cyclists were putting out

169
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,760
when they were being assisted by EPO and blood transfusions. And we sort of know that the best

170
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,480
of the best were able to put out somewhere between about 6.8 and 7.1 watts per kilo at FTP.

171
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,880
We also know today that cyclists are not doing that, right? Those numbers are nowhere to be found

172
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,920
in the peloton. Now that's information you and I share confidentially, right? That's not public

173
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:28,680
knowledge, but I know it, you know it, and anyone coaching people at that level know that nobody's

174
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,440
putting out 7.1 watts per kilo. You don't need to be at 7.1 watts per kilo to win the tour today. You

175
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:43,400
could probably win the tour today at 6.1 watts per kilo. Do you think that making that data public

176
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,880
would put to rest a lot of the criticisms that say the sport is still, you know, they've just found

177
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,000
new ways to cheat, but it's still basically a dirty sport because I think when you look at the data

178
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,600
objectively, it would be very hard to say that today based on what we know from the era when

179
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,000
drug use was rampant. No, I think you make a very good point. And it's something that,

180
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,840
yeah, it frustrates me, right? When people think that they're doing 7 watts per kilogram, you know,

181
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:25,000
or 7.2, you know, and then you have the real data from the day. And it's way lower, you know,

182
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,000
you see like, you know, for example, like the short climbs where they would do maybe 7.2,

183
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:40,600
now they're doing 6.3 maybe. And the longer climbs, they're doing 5.5, 5.8. So it frustrates me

184
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:50,120
because I see this data and I always like, gosh, I wish I could just boom, release it. And I have

185
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:57,240
absolutely no problem. I know Tade has no problem with that. It is more of that. And we debated it

186
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,040
with the team. Let's do it, you know, like why keeping all this. At the end of the day, people

187
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,360
can figure that out. And some people, when I see an internet, because you can see the, you know,

188
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,000
like the weight of the cyclist, the grade of the climb, the grade, the stars, the time,

189
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,320
and the wind, you know, you can be very accurate at knowing that. And I see some people that are

190
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,320
quite accurate on the internet, but I see other ones are all over the map, you know, otherwise

191
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,920
they say, I did the formula and it's 7.2. Like, my gosh, I wish I could show him, hey, this is the

192
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:40,760
real data that we're seeing. But I guess like two points there is like, one, it's private data that

193
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,920
the team considers, like, release it. That's team policy. But the other one, too, is like,

194
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,960
you know, even if you release that data, there are always going to be people that are not going

195
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,040
to believe you. Or they might say, oh, they probably altering the data. Or they're tricking

196
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,880
it somehow. Or putting more weight to the data so it looks like there's less power output. And I

197
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,160
don't know if it will be an endless fight, you know? But I don't know. I don't have the answer.

198
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,600
I just have that frustration that I wish that I could really show the data and people can see it,

199
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,480
you know? But there's always going to be someone who is not going to believe it and going to make

200
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,680
it a lot of noise out of that. But yeah. But yeah, that's the other thing, too, is like,

201
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,880
other teams and other writers are releasing their data. Right? So by releasing their data,

202
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,640
you can see pretty much where Pogacar is, you know? Like, okay, if it's a minute ahead or 30

203
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,640
minutes seconds, or sometimes with the same time, you can see, you know, like, whoa, if whatever the

204
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,640
writer has done and has entered in Pogacar's group or 30 seconds later and has done 5.9,

205
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,000
Pogacar is going to be in that neighborhood, right? Not going to be seven, you know, with 30 seconds

206
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,960
ahead. You know, in the spirit of releasing data, the other thing it would potentially do,

207
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,280
especially if you could see it in real time. I don't know if you watch Formula One, but one of

208
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,480
the things about Formula One that I think the sport has been able to do because of the advances

209
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:23,880
in technology is make more of the data available to the viewer. So if you're watching Lewis Hamilton

210
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,040
driving a lap, you know, you see what he sees now. You can see, and it's not like the end of the

211
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,520
world data, but you see his speed, you see what gear he's in, you see the difference between

212
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,720
throttle and brake pressure. They could show even more data, certainly, and someone who drives

213
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,680
would appreciate it if you really saw brake bias and if you saw brake pressure and lockup and things

214
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,360
like that. And you can hear the drivers speaking with their race engineers. So, you know, it

215
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,680
basically allows you to come more and more into what they're doing. This year they introduced a

216
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,280
new camera angle, which is what the driver sees. And I think it's fantastic because historically

217
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,160
you see above them and it looks so smooth, but that's not at all what it feels like to be in a

218
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,520
race car. So now they just literally put like a camera at their shoulder and now you see how

219
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,360
restrictive the halo is, you see the bumps and it looks a lot faster. You know, I've had this

220
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,920
discussion with a number of people, which is if you could show the same sort of information in

221
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,880
cycling, if every time the camera went over to a cyclist, you saw their heart rate, their watts per

222
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,920
kilo, their speed, you know, all of these other things, and you could hear some of the communications

223
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,520
back and forth with their teams. Yes, that changes the sport. Strategically now you have to be careful

224
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,960
what you say on the radio, but it also allows you to see kind of the human element of this sport a

225
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,680
little bit more. Do you think that will ever happen where you'll be able to flip on the Tour de France

226
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,760
and you'll be able to actually see real time physiology? I would love to see that that day.

227
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:04,120
I would love it because it would be so much fun right for the viewer and as you see, I mean cycling

228
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,320
has so many possibilities, you know, to engage people more and be fascinated by the physiology

229
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:18,600
and looking at these numbers. You know, there's this, it's already in a way, you know, you see

230
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,520
some cameras already installed in the front and the back. So it's called with Velon, right? So you

231
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,080
can see really cool when that, I mean, images when they're preparing a sprint that is like what feels

232
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,880
inside. And you can see it's really scary. Sometimes you can appreciate how difficult it is to be at,

233
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,240
you know, like 40 miles an hour sprinting or 35 miles an hour leading to a sprint or in a descent.

234
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,400
Or 70 mile an hour descent. 70 mile an hour descent, exactly. And then you can see the power

235
00:24:51,400 --> 00:25:00,920
also output in real time. It's still in that, I think it's a great step. You don't see no

236
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:07,000
the riders, but it's estimation only the riders will wear that Velon or the Velon decides to do

237
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,440
that. I think that they're still not doing that with all the top contenders. But I think it's

238
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,760
a first step and I really haven't spoken with them, but maybe it's like, Hey, let's see what's

239
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,520
the feedback. And I think that people are loving it. And I would expect that this will increase,

240
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,240
you know, and I mean, I would love at some point, you know, and as you know, very well,

241
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,680
in the world of biosensors, right? It's going to revolutionize sports where we're going to be able

242
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,080
to see, you know, so many different parameters of us. Imagine you could see lactate and glucose in

243
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,640
real time, which of course is technologically feasible already. So it's just a question of,

244
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:54,040
yeah. So I think that would love for all sports too, right? Imagine you can see an NBA basketball

245
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,640
game, right? And see that the lactator of LeBron James compared to the other ones, right? I mean,

246
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,800
I would love to see that as a spectator and I hope that someday we were able to see these parameters.

247
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,800
So last thing on the tour, talk to me about Vantu this year. That was a tough stage.

248
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,640
Also, I mean, kind of showed, it looked like his toughest stage. Was that a fair assessment?

249
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,880
Yes, probably. Yeah.

250
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,440
And what's amazing, I think, is the poise on that stage. It's hard to tell if he was really

251
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,400
struggling on the ascent of Van 2 or he was just deciding strategically, I'm going to conserve a

252
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,480
little bit of energy here. What was your take on that? Or what can you say about that?

253
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:48,440
Well, it was a very difficult climb and a very long climb. So, you know, Tade, his mentality

254
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,560
is wired like a champion. And he, when someone goes and they were full gas in the last part

255
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:02,920
when we knew they were attacked. And Tade knew that, okay, this is not going to be the top of

256
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,960
Van 2. It's not going to be the end of the stage. I have a long descent where I can make it.

257
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,520
Very, very long descent. And I have some partners with me that can help me out. So I'm not going to

258
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:22,120
panic at all, but I'm not going to also try to waste a lot of energy because I need to. Now,

259
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,360
I have, he also had a big gap. The whole different thing would have been if he had

260
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,800
20 seconds. But having a big gap and knowing that you have a big descent and how calm he is,

261
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,320
that's one thing that is a very important strategy. And this is what happened.

262
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,680
This reminds me in a way what happened the first year that he was pro when he was 19 at the

263
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:57,640
Tour of California. It was the previous stage before what's called Bear Lake. No, what is the

264
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,440
mountain? Bear Lake. I think it's Bear Lake. Yeah, it's the top mountain in the Tour of California

265
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,800
where it's going to be decided. So the day before, two cyclists, George Bennett and Ygitta,

266
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:17,640
attacked in a short but very steep climb. And there were only like 12 riders left and Ygitta

267
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,280
and Bennett attacked. Then there was a descent and a long highway all the way to the finish line. So

268
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:31,640
there was plenty of time to catch them up. But Tade didn't follow them up. Another rider would

269
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,080
have just followed their wheel and Tade decided, no, I'm not going to follow them. We have time

270
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,440
and I'm going to take the chance because I'm confident for tomorrow. And when I asked him,

271
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:51,720
as soon as he crossed the finish line, I'm asking, are you okay? Why you didn't follow their attack?

272
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,720
And he said, well, I just wanted to know who is going to be good tomorrow. So I know those two

273
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,600
guys are going to be good tomorrow, but I wanted to take my time and see the other 10 guys, how

274
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,840
they're breathing, what's their body language, and take my time to observe, to start preparing

275
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,760
my strategy for tomorrow. And in fact, that's what he did. So they were then caught up, you know,

276
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,480
like two or three kilometers to the finish line. So all those 12, 13 guys, whatever they were,

277
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,640
got together and the next day, in fact, he noticed those two guys attacked, he just followed them and

278
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,840
he just eliminated one by one. But that's how this guy thinks, you know, his strategy, like,

279
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:42,120
no panic, plenty of time today. I have a good gap in the GC. Why am I going to go full gas when I

280
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,680
know that he's going to go full gas and he might lose energy for tomorrow. Because he might pay

281
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,640
for this at this time of the two of the friends, we have plenty of time to catch him up. So that's

282
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:04,200
kind of the strategy that he had, too. How much time does someone like Tadi spend in Zone Two,

283
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,200
which we're going to talk a lot about, right? So and let's do it more as percentage of training

284
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,760
time, because I think absolute numbers will be very large, given that that's his job. But when

285
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,400
you think about the percentage of time he spends in that energy zone, how does it change over the

286
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,520
course of the year? So presumably, during the winter months, a greater amount of his time would

287
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:34,440
be spent there as he's base building right before a race when he's kind of sharpening, maybe less.

288
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,160
But what would be the range of time? Yeah, that's a good question. So yeah, when and you're right,

289
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:48,680
when we talk about percentages, I like to put it this way more like a percentage of days dedicated

290
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:55,960
to cultivate that energy system. Obviously, if you put in just every single minute together,

291
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:06,680
like the majority is going to be that. But I would say more in days. So yeah, in the winter

292
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:16,280
months might be about 80% or 70 to 80% of the days as the season gets closer, he starts increasing

293
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:23,320
more than 10 city days and sessions. And then you have you start the season. So when the start of

294
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:30,840
the season, racing and you have it depends, right, you might have one stage race of five, seven days,

295
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,120
and then you have a five day block or one week to recover, and they have the next stage rate. So in

296
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,840
that week, we do a lot of recovery, we may do some sessions here and there. And then after a few

297
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:52,360
blocks of races, that's where you have another long time to train period to train, going to altitude

298
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,680
towards the Tour de France or towards the next goal. And that's where you may revisit, you know,

299
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:07,400
those different energy systems and train specifically. But yeah, we alternate and I

300
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,200
think it's each energy system has a time in the year and in the calendar where it's built

301
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,800
in order to try to achieve what we want. So let's remind people now with this, you know,

302
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,280
I've put out a few posts on social over, gosh, the past year, and even in the past little while,

303
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,280
and anytime I'm talking about zone two, it's really one of the topics that generates the most

304
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,160
curiosity, the most the most inquiry from people. I think people really intuitively kind of resonate

305
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,520
with this. And then of course, a million questions follow because there's there's so much minutia and

306
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,720
detail around it. And a lot of that we're going to cover today. But let's start from a place of maybe

307
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,960
someone hasn't heard the first podcast where we go through some of the semantics of this. Define

308
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:07,640
zone two. Okay, so zone two, right. I started using it like about 25 years ago. And I just

309
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:19,320
have a very simple name. So it is from my point of view, it is the exercise intensity at the one

310
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,320
you are stressing the mitochondria and oxidative capacity to the most. This is where you're

311
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,960
recruiting mainly type one muscle fibers. This is where you are mobilizing the highest amount of fat,

312
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,000
both from lipolysis from adipose tissue as well from fat oxidation inside the mitochondria.

313
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:47,560
And this is also where you stimulate all those energies that enter that bioenergetics, which is

314
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:57,000
oxidative phosphorylation. This is where you burn both the fat inside the mitochondria, as well as

315
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,640
the glucose inside the mitochondria. There's not a very high glycolytic flux that it's going to be

316
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:11,000
transforming to pyruvate and reduced to lactate. But that flux still is oxidized inside mitochondria.

317
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:18,600
And this is looking at from bioenergetics standpoint, this is what I would consider the

318
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,680
zone two. And what I have seen is that throughout the years is that this is the exercise intensity

319
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:33,320
that achieves or stimulates that mitochondrial function and fat oxidation and lactate cleanse

320
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,600
capacity the most. Because that's the other thing too. This is where there are other things

321
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:47,080
involving lactate. So lactate is a great fuel to the cells. It's in fact, it's probably the preferred

322
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:53,960
fuel for the cells, for most cells in the body. This is a work that my colleague and mentor and

323
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:00,920
friend George Brooks discovered. You should have him someday in the podcast because he's fascinating.

324
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:10,840
I mean, I will not be surprised someday soon. We hear that he wins the Nobel Prize. He's amazing.

325
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:18,040
And every time I talk to him, I still learn a lot of things. And I've been translating a lot of his

326
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:25,720
research. But yeah, that's how I see that you have within the mitochondrial function, you see

327
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:34,600
how lactate is oxidizing the mitochondria back to energy. And that happens in those muscle fiber

328
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,080
types. Those muscle fiber types and the mitochondria, those fiber types also develop these

329
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:49,080
transporters, which are MCT1s, which are the ones that transport lactate inside the cell and inside

330
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,520
the mitochondria. So when you stimulate that training zone, you stimulate all these energy

331
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,240
systems and the components that come with them. So let's talk about the different ways that one

332
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,000
can go about estimating this. Based on the definition you've just given, it seems to me

333
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:12,360
that the purest way to estimate this would be via indirect calorimetry because that will actually

334
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:18,120
tell us the fat oxidation. Is that a fair assessment? Yes, it's a very good assessment.

335
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:27,320
And that usually correlates with the fat max. That's how we call it too, right? With fat

336
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:35,160
oxidation. When you see this, you start oxidizing fat and my increase in cases and gets to a point

337
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,360
that it maxes out, which is the fat max. And then it starts going down sharply. As exercise

338
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,360
intensive increases. So let's tell people how that's measured because I think it's, we do this

339
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:57,800
with all of our patients and I find it to be not that easy to explain because there's some physiology

340
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,440
involved and there's some math involved. But let me try to see if I can explain this to folks. So

341
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,080
you hook me up to an indirect calorimetry. So you're going to put a little plug on my nose,

342
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:17,640
you're going to put a mask over my nose and mouth. That mask has the ability to measure

343
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:25,640
the amount of oxygen that I consume because it has a sensor for O2. So it knows that the O2 that's

344
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:33,080
coming in is at 21%. The air is coming in at 21% O2 and whatever I exhale is the difference between

345
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,040
that. So you can now tell how much O2 was consumed and you can have a similar sensor for carbon

346
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,640
dioxide. So you know how much carbon dioxide is produced. So it's very easy to measure consumed

347
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,680
oxygen and produced carbon dioxide provided you can completely isolate around the nose and the mouth.

348
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:56,840
As you hook a person up to some form of ergometer, usually a bike, but it could be a treadmill,

349
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,640
a rowing machine or something like that, you can increase the demand on the muscle. So you

350
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,960
increase the wattage or the speed or the something. You then get out these numbers,

351
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,120
VO2 and VCO2, which are what we just talked about. So consumption of oxygen production of carbon

352
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:20,600
dioxide. These numbers fit into a relatively straightforward linear equation called the Weer

353
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:29,800
equation. And it tells you three things. It tells you total energy consumption in kilocalories per

354
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:38,360
minute. And then the ratio of VO2 and VCO2 tell you how much of that energy is coming from fat

355
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:47,640
oxidation and how much of it is glycolytic. So at any moment in time, you can look at a VCO2 and a

356
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:54,520
VO2, which are usually measured in liters per minute. And you can convert that into a total

357
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:03,320
grams of fat oxidation and a total grams of glucose oxidation per minute. And so you could

358
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:12,360
then plot on the X axis work or power, and on the Y axis, you could plot fat oxidation.

359
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,200
So again, describe for people what the shape of that curve looks like and what differentiates

360
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,600
Pogaczor from the average human being. Yeah. So again, I mean, you explained it very well.

361
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:34,760
And yeah, those are based on stoichiometric equations based on the combustion of carbohydrates

362
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:45,240
and fatty acids are done in the body. Already in the 1920s, Francis Benedict was one of the first

363
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:55,960
ones who started to look into this at this level. And obviously, we have evolved into

364
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,520
doing it in a more automatic way with this indirect color imageries, machines or colds or

365
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:15,000
metabolic cards. So yes, as exercise intensity increases, you need more oxygen. So you review

366
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:25,000
increases, and then you produce or give up more CO2. So this is kind of what it shows when you're

367
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,560
in a more like politic state, more, more fatty oxidation state, you still consume oxygen, but

368
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:41,080
you do not produce as much CO2. When you are more into a more glycolytic state, which is higher

369
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,280
exercise intensities, when you're recruiting the type two muscle fibers, and therefore using more

370
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,560
glucose for energy purposes, you're going to consume more oxygen and you're going to produce

371
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:00,920
more CO2. So plugging in all these numbers into these stoichiometric equations, it's going to

372
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:09,240
give you that profile in the x and the y axis, and it's going to see what is the

373
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,200
the fat oxidation throughout a ramp state, a ramp test. And this is where you're going to see

374
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,240
that elite athletes like Bogatr, they have an amazing fat oxidation capacity compared to

375
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:32,520
other competitive athletes or recreationals or people with even type two diabetes or metabolic

376
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:39,160
syndrome or in a recent study we have published with COVID patients. So it reflects in a way

377
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,920
ultimately what happens in your mitochondria and how the mitochondria oxidizes those fuels

378
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:55,160
at different exercise intensity. So for example, let's say at an intensity of 200, let's say 200

379
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:04,520
watts, like an elite athlete doesn't need to incur in that glycolytic capacity as much as someone who

380
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:12,280
is not very well trained. So the elite athlete, they can still recruit the slow twitch muscle fibers

381
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:19,000
and rely a lot on fat to produce ATP because they have an amazing mitochondrial function

382
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,400
and they're very efficient metabolically speaking. Therefore, they're going to be oxidizing a lot of

383
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:34,120
fat. However, someone whose mitochondria are not working as well, whether you are like a

384
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:40,200
recreational athlete or sedentary individual or someone with type two diabetes, which is one of

385
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,840
the hallmarks of the disease, that mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction at 200 watts, you fully

386
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:55,240
rely on glucose pretty much because you cannot sustain that effort with fat alone.

387
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,480
And this is what you're going to be seeing in this gas exchange, the CO2 and the VO2,

388
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:09,080
you can just plot it into the equation and it's going to give you all that what I call metabolic

389
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,680
map where you see the fat oxidation, the carbohydrate oxidation, and then I plug in

390
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,680
also the lactate and that's where everything comes together quite well. And you can then

391
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:27,800
first, in an indirect way, calculate the mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility,

392
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,240
how flexible they are at using fats or carbohydrates. And also you can determine

393
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,800
training zones. And this is what I've been using this methodology for,

394
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:44,600
poof, about 16 years, 17, something like that. I didn't think to ask you this earlier, but

395
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:53,240
if you have it handy, do you want to pull up a graph of what fat oxidation looks like versus power

396
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:00,840
so that people can see the difference between a highly trained individual, a reasonably trained

397
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,920
individual, an untrained individual, and at the other end of that spectrum, somebody with type two

398
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,080
diabetes? Sure. So let me share a screen then, right? And hopefully this works. Okay. So this

399
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:19,800
is from a publication, right, that my colleague George Brooks and I published in 2017. So this

400
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:26,920
is the formula and we have realized that this is flipped. So we need to, we're working now with the

401
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,760
editor to change it because the formula is flipped here in the method section. Which is so funny by

402
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,360
the way, I like seeing that. I'm embarrassed to say when we do this for our patients, we do it in

403
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:45,480
two steps, which yields the same result. But we first calculate energy expenditure using the

404
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:53,720
Wir coefficients of 3.94 times V02 minus, or plus one point, I think it's one two times VCO2.

405
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:02,520
And then we convert that to fat ox and carbohydrate oxidation using the ratio of

406
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,560
VCO2 to V02. And I never even thought to do what you've done here, which is so much more logical,

407
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:15,720
which is combine them into a single equation for each. Well, we use what Freiand observed already

408
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:23,800
in 1983. And this is Freiand's equation. And it's been validated with tracers, with

409
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,600
stabilized top tracers. And yeah, and that's what it shows. There's a very high correlation. Now,

410
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:37,080
furthermore, in study that we were going to be publishing soon, we have validated this

411
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,320
fat oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation directly with mitochondrial respiration.

412
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:52,760
So in muscle biopsies, we inject directly fatty acids, pyruvate representative of carbohydrates,

413
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,280
right? And glutamine representative of amino acids. And then we can see that there's a very high

414
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,680
correlation between this indirect methodology to look at mitochondrial function and the direct

415
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,280
methodology, which is through muscle biopsy and injecting the substrate and see how it's oxidized.

416
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,320
So these two graphs are really powerful. So let's talk about what the first graph is showing us.

417
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,280
So both of these graphs, it's important to note, have the same x-axis. In other words, the

418
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:31,320
independent variable here is the workload in watts. That's the metric that matters in cycling,

419
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,600
which is, I think, the easiest way to do this test. And so you're increasing wattage. This is a

420
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:43,640
progressive increase in workload. And what you're plotting on the y-axis, your dependent variable

421
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:51,720
here in the first graph, figure one, is blood lactate. So what stands out to me is a couple

422
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:59,320
of things. So you have the triangles represent metabolic syndrome, the squares represent kind of

423
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,120
a modestly trained athlete, and then the little diamonds represent a professional athlete.

424
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,840
The first thing that stands out to me, and we're going to talk about this later, so I'll put a

425
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,720
little pin in this, is that the people with metabolic syndrome have a resting lactate that's

426
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:23,720
almost two millimole. Yeah? Yes, we see already this. And I think that it's going to become more

427
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:30,200
and more as a biomarker, like resting blood glucose levels. What is your resting lactate?

428
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:36,440
And you can see already in patients with type 2 diabetes or profound metabolic syndrome,

429
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:43,560
that yeah, as you said, perfectly resting levels are in the neighborhood of like 1.8

430
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:51,240
to even 3. Right? Yeah. So one of the metrics that we've discussed at length, and we'll revisit it,

431
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:58,040
of course, is using this lactate level of about two millimole as being that threshold. So once

432
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:04,840
lactate exceeds two millimole, the individual is now escaping out of zone 2, and they're actually

433
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,920
now into zone 3. So when you look at these data here, you can see that the individual with

434
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,880
metabolic syndrome is basically tapping out zone 2 initially. So any incremental workload that is

435
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,400
placed on them takes them right out of zone 2. So they're, for all intents and purposes, by the time

436
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,560
they're at 100 watts, they're already at the threshold of their zone 2. Now conversely,

437
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:37,480
when you look at that sort of medium trained or reasonably well trained individual, or what we,

438
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,560
I think it's referred to as moderately active, healthy individuals, you know, they start out

439
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:48,840
with a lactate of about one, and it's not really until they hit about 175 watts that they pass that

440
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:55,400
inflection point. And then when you look at the professional athletes, the professional endurance

441
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,880
athletes specifically, you know, they're starting out at a lactate level of 0.5 millimole, and they

442
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:11,960
stay relatively flat until they hit about 300 watts is when they finally cross over that threshold.

443
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:20,760
Now what's not captured here is that as you move from left to right, the athletes are getting

444
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:27,720
lighter. So this graph, if I'm going to be critical of it and you go, I would say it should be done in

445
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,920
watts per kilo. And that would show a much starker difference between these. And in our patients,

446
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,440
when we benchmark them, we benchmark them in watts per kilo for this reason so that you normalize by

447
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:46,680
weight. And yeah, and I'm certain, Robert, you're absolutely right. It is that, and that's how we

448
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,840
do it also. Yes, of course. It's like one of the reviewers didn't allow us to use watts per kilogram.

449
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,400
So that reviewer was an idiot. So that's fine. I won't hit it against you because you have an

450
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,280
idiot reviewer. But yes, how it is in review papers, you want to show something and eventually

451
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,080
it's changed and it's not exactly what you want to show, you know, because otherwise they don't

452
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:15,640
allow you to publish it. But anyways, so what's amazing here is that person with metabolic syndrome

453
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,920
is probably about one watt per kilo easily, right? Or, you know, one to 1.3 watts per kilo

454
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:29,080
is their zone two. When you look at the modestly trained individual, they're about two watts per

455
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:38,120
kilo, right? They probably weigh maybe two to 2.1, 2.2 watts per kilo. That professional endurance

456
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:44,200
athlete probably weighs in the neighborhood of 70 kilos. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, they're in

457
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:53,320
the ballpark of four watts per kilo. For our patients, Inigo, we typically want, we set the

458
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,560
aspiration at three watts per kilo. So again, our patients aren't professional athletes, but we

459
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,520
think that three watts per kilo would be kind of the elite level that we would want to see people.

460
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,800
And then of course we stratify from there. Okay, let's look at the lower figure,

461
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,360
figure two, just beneath this. So here we're looking at the same group of individuals.

462
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:24,040
We have the same independent variable, which is work, but now we're calculating fat oxidation

463
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,440
as a function of that work. So now your dependent variable is fat oxidation, which again,

464
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,560
very easy to calculate via indirect calorimetry. Two things stand out again. The first is the

465
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:41,800
obvious, which is the fitter the individual, the higher their absolute capacity for fat oxidation.

466
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,520
But something else stands out to me, Inigo, and I have now seen this repeatedly across multiple

467
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:57,160
datasets, which is a fit individual actually increases fat oxidation to a local maxima

468
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:04,600
before beginning that decline. Whereas most mortals begin at a maximum and decline from there.

469
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:11,400
Can you explain why that's happening? Yes. Yeah, it's something that I agree. I see this all the

470
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:21,640
time. I think that on one hand is how you start a protocol. In this case, we started like a one.

471
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:29,160
We start about one to 1.5 watts per kilogram. And that obviously for a elite athlete is

472
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:36,200
trivial. Low resting levels. This is why they're very low. And they don't need to use much fat for

473
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:43,320
energy purposes until you push them more. And that's when you get to like 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 watts

474
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,680
per kilogram. And again, this protocol comes originally from the work that I've been doing

475
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,640
for 20 years. This is in protocol with elite athletes. Now, when you do the same protocol

476
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,880
with other populations, especially people with metabolic syndrome or not very fit,

477
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:06,680
and you start at 1.5 watts per kilogram, that might be too much. And I'm sure you have observed

478
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:14,200
that if you start at 0.5 watts per kilogram, you might see a higher fat oxidation. And then you

479
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:19,640
might see the same phenomenon. So on one hand is that protocol, but on the other hand, yeah,

480
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:27,400
sure, it's like 0.5 watts per kilogram. It's like nothing. It's close to resting levels almost. So

481
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,400
it will take you for a long time. But that being said, I think that one thing that we're doing with

482
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,160
populations, more clinical populations is really starting at a very low level, even up to 50 watts

483
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:45,720
or 25 watts sometimes. So we can start with this point because if you start at 2 watts per kilogram

484
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:52,440
or 1.5 watts per kilogram with someone with a significant metabolic dysregulation, you're

485
00:53:52,440 --> 00:54:00,360
going to miss the fat max. Yeah, I agree. We have been struggling to tune our algorithm to

486
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,120
exactly that because I actually think that, and I had this discussion with our team a week ago,

487
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:12,200
which was the physiologists who are doing this with our patients are probably over-cooking the

488
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,520
people who are not fit during the warmup. So they do a warmup and the warmup is actually too

489
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:24,040
stressful and it over-cooks them and then we're missing kind of the true max fat.

490
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,800
Okay, so the next thing I want to point out here is that the, and let's just look at the fittest

491
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:38,440
person, but it's true for all of them, but it's easiest to see here. Fat max, so fat max ox,

492
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:45,480
right? So maximum fat oxidation is occurring earlier than lactate is 2. And that's true for

493
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,960
all of them, except for the met sin person because it's so low. But if you look at the

494
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,200
moderately fit person, they're hitting maximum fat oxidation at about 130 watts,

495
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:05,320
but they're hitting lactate of 2 at 175 watts in the upper figure. And the professional athlete

496
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:13,000
is hitting an absolute fat oxidation maxima at a little shy of 250 watts,

497
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:22,600
but they're hitting lactate of 2 closer to 300 watts. So I guess the question then becomes,

498
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:29,080
which one of these do you think, well, you've already answered part of the question, which is

499
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:35,640
we're really defining zone 2 as the place where maximum fat oxidation occurs. But I guess this

500
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:43,000
would suggest that using a lactate level of 2 is maybe overestimating where that is. And should we

501
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,400
be using a lower level of lactate, such as 1.5 or something like that?

502
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,560
Yeah, that's an excellent question. And this is what I've been learning all these years,

503
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:04,040
is that the blood lactate levels might change between different groups. And it's everything

504
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:12,760
related to the lactate kinetics and lactate oxidation in the mitochondria. So for example,

505
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:20,600
elite athletes, and I did this, it was part of my doctorate thesis and some of this that

506
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:27,720
I never published it 20 something years ago. But the same blood lactate concentration

507
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:35,080
does not correspond to the same, in an elite athlete, this not correspond necessarily to

508
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:43,320
the same lactate concentration in a recreational athlete, the metabolic stress. So for example,

509
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,840
2 millimolts or 2 millimolar lactate in these elite athletes might be

510
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:58,520
a higher metabolic stress than 2 millimolts in a metabolic patient. So this is why,

511
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:06,600
and it would be very difficult. For example, you can have, let's say 2.5 millimolts, you can have

512
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:13,720
a metabolic syndrome patient exercising for a couple hours without a big deal. You try to do

513
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:19,240
that with a professional athlete, and they're going to be hurting. And in fact, one of the

514
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:25,800
things that I observe is like I used 4 millimolts or millimolar, which is kind of that gold standard

515
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:32,840
has been forever like the lactate threshold, etc. And if you put a world class athlete at 4 millimoles

516
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:41,320
of lactate, at the intensity in power output that elicits 4 millimoles, and you put a recreational

517
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:49,000
athlete at the power output that elicits also 4 millimoles, and you say now go, right, and see

518
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,240
who lasts the most, intuitively we're going to say obviously it's going to be the professional

519
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,160
athlete, it's the opposite. And this is the data that I saw 20 something years ago, where the

520
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:06,600
recreational athletes at the same blood lactate concentration would go about 30% longer period of

521
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:15,560
time. And that's because metabolically is not a stusking. And the main reason is that the lactate

522
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:23,800
that we see in the blood, it reflects the mitochondrial oxidation. So someone who has,

523
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,120
obviously when we're talking about, you know, high power output, when you need a lot of glycolysis to

524
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:37,160
produce energy, you're going to produce lactate. Lactate is the mandatory obligatory byproduct,

525
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,880
not waste product, but byproduct of glycolysis. So the higher the glycolysis, the higher the lactate.

526
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,720
Now that lactate has two routes mainly. One is going from the fast twitch muscle fibers,

527
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:57,000
to the slow twitch muscle fibers. It's the lactate shuttle that George Bush discovered,

528
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,680
and it's oxidizing the mitochondria of those slow twitch muscle fibers. If you have a very good

529
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,280
lactate clearance capacity, right, you're going to be oxidizing it very, very well for fuel.

530
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:17,080
Therefore, you're not going to incur in the second step, which is exporting it to the blood, right.

531
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:22,840
When you have a poor mitochondrial function, it's going to get to a point that that

532
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,400
capacity is going to get saturated at a lower power output, and therefore you're going to be

533
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:35,560
forced to explore that to the blood. So that's why looking at blood lactates might not mean the same.

534
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,360
I'm not saying that these parties are huge by no means, right, but as you very well said,

535
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:46,200
those two millimoles might not correspond in a little athlete with a fat max, but might be

536
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:52,280
more maybe towards 1.5, whereas maybe in someone with a more recreational metabolic syndrome,

537
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,960
it might correspond fair. I don't know if it makes sense.

538
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,240
It completely makes sense, and this is definitely the level of nuance that I don't think we captured

539
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:08,600
in the first podcast. I want to now ask a more telling question specifically for the middle

540
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,320
person here, so the one that's called the moderately active individual, where again,

541
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:18,040
we have a disparity, right, so based on these data, the moderately fit individual

542
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:26,920
hits a lactate of two millimole at 175 watts, but hits a max fat oxidation at,

543
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:35,080
gosh, 125 watts, so it's a 50 watt difference. So now the question for you is, when that person

544
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:42,120
comes to you and says in you go, I want to improve my metabolic function, I want to improve

545
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:48,280
my mitochondrial performance, I want to improve my fuel partitioning, my flexibility, all the

546
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:56,120
things we talk about, are you going to train them as a zone two of 125 watts or as a zone two of

547
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:03,160
175 watts as represented by these deltas? That's a very good question, and normally I would try to

548
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:11,160
do something in the middle. Normally, and again, this, yeah, it might not coincide perfectly,

549
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:19,400
but normally they do quite well. And another parameter that if you allow me, I can show you

550
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,640
in this paper, this is what when decided, we see individually, right, the lactates,

551
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,280
and then we see the fat oxidation. But then where I decided to cross them over,

552
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:38,520
right, and this is what we saw in this graph over here. So this is, can you see it okay?

553
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:45,160
Yes. So this is where you see that the lactate versus, I mean, sorry, the lactate versus the fat

554
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:55,480
oxidation, right, in the elite athlete, and the R is 0.97. This is true both for running equations.

555
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:02,280
So this is an average, right, of all of them. And this is where you see the same pattern,

556
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:08,840
the same graph for the moderately active. And this is also what you see in the people,

557
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,960
person with metabolic syndrome. The correlations are very, very strong. They're almost perfect,

558
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:20,920
right? So this is what normally fat oxidation and lactate, they go together, right?

559
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:26,120
So for people who are going to be listening to this Inigo and not able to see what we're seeing,

560
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,560
can you describe the differences between these graphs? These are obviously showing the same data

561
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,560
that we discussed earlier, but now we're using two y-axes. So let's even just talk about it as

562
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:46,920
looking at the elite athletes. So you're basically plotting the decline in fat oxidation, or in their

563
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:52,360
case, the initial increase in fat oxidation followed by a decline in fat oxidation. And on

564
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:58,120
the same graph, you're showing the increase in lactate production, again, both plotted to the

565
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:06,200
same x-axis of power. Does the cross point here indicate any significance? So they're crossing at

566
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,320
about 325 watts. Is there anything about that that means anything? I mean, to me, I think it's an

567
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:16,040
artifact of the graph because it's really just a function of how you scale it, correct?

568
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:22,760
Yes, yeah, exactly. I mean, it shows to me that the crossover point for blood lactate and fat

569
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,680
oxidation, it's very high, obviously, in the elite athletes, very far to the right.

570
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:36,360
Right. So and then of course, in the moderately fit people, it looks like it's closer to 180 watts.

571
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,000
Exactly.

572
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,120
And in the unfit individual, it's about 125 watts in person with metabolic syndrome.

573
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,720
Yeah. And again, I mean, if you started, and I'm sure you have seen this, but if you started with

574
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:54,520
the metabolic syndrome, for example, at 25 watts, you might see, or even in the recreational athlete,

575
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:00,120
even earlier, you might see a similar pattern as you would see in the elite athlete, but a much

576
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,600
lower watts, obviously. It is that we just did the same protocol for everybody just to show the

577
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:16,600
concept, right, that both fat oxidation and lactate go together. And also, when we look into,

578
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,240
and I'm sorry, I should have gone to this directly, when we look into fat oxidation and

579
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:27,480
carbohydrate oxidation, we see the same concept, right? So we see as exercise intensity increases,

580
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:34,040
you need to oxidize more carbohydrates. And then as exercise intensity increases,

581
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:39,160
you may get to the fat max. And then when you moment you switch to the glycolytic fibers,

582
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:47,480
you cannot use much fat for energy purposes. So you see a sharp decline, and eventually fat

583
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:53,560
oxidation disappears. And it's all food glycolytic. And the same pattern we see in the rest of

584
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:01,480
populations, with also very high statistical significances and correlations. So that's where

585
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,640
all these elements, fat oxidation, carbohydrates, and lactate, they're very well connected.

586
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:12,920
If we look in the other graph, this is the correlation between lactate and carbohydrates,

587
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,480
right? We see that overall, the correlations are quite good, because, yeah, lactate is the

588
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:27,640
byproduct of glucose utilization, right? You may see that in the elite athletes, though, the gap

589
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,120
is wider here. And this is for the same reason that we've seen earlier, they use a lot of glucose.

590
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:38,440
They're using so much fat there as well, is really the point, right? So the bigger the gap

591
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,320
between the blood lactate curve and the carbohydrate oxidation curve, the more efficient

592
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:50,600
the individual is, the more they're able to oxidize fatty acid, then they have to require glucose.

593
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:59,640
And clear lactate. Yes. Again, the mandatory byproduct of glucose oxidation is lactate.

594
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:06,120
So here, the lactate doesn't show up in the blood. Yeah, that's interesting. It's hard to

595
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:12,760
disentangle those two, because you mentioned a good point that I omitted. This in part reflects

596
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:19,480
the lactate shuttle. This in part reflects the ability for them to reuse lactate as a fuel,

597
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:27,560
as opposed to just letting it get out there with hydrogen and start to poison sarcomeres.

598
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:33,720
So let me see the other slide that you wanted to show that explains, I think, how the MCT

599
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:40,120
transporters work. Yeah, so this is a little bit more of the bioenergetics of the cells, of the

600
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:47,800
main two substrates, which are fatty acids and lactate, I mean, and pyruvate, and also lactate,

601
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,480
right? So normally glucose goes through glycolysis and it ends up, and this is the cytosol, this is

602
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,960
the outside of the mitochondria, the inside of the cell. And glucose, once it enters the cell,

603
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:06,840
it's oxidized to pyruvate. That pyruvate needs to enter the mitochondria through what's called

604
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:14,040
the mitochondria pyruvate carrier, and it's oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which enters the crep cycle,

605
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:20,040
right? This is a complete oxidation of glucose through oxidative phosphorylation in the crep

606
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:28,280
cycle and electron transport chain. Then fatty acids have the same mechanisms to, I mean,

607
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,400
they also get converted to acetyl-CoA, but through different mechanisms. Fatty acids are transporter

608
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:41,160
through CPT-1 and CPT-2, go through beta-oxidation, acetyl-CoA, and enter the cell, right? But every

609
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:48,040
time that you use glucose, you produce pyruvate, and every single time that pyruvate is going to

610
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:55,960
be reduced to lactate, always, right? And this is the key concept. So when you have a constant

611
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:03,720
glycolytic flux, right, you're going to, in one of the steps of glycolysis, you're going to utilize

612
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:15,480
NAD, right? And it's going to be transformed to NADH plus hydrogen. So if you use this mechanism a

613
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:21,720
lot, you're going to replenish NAD. I mean, you're going to deplete NAD. The only way that rescues

614
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:29,080
NAD is the reduction of pyruvate to lactate, which replenishes NAD going back for glycolysis,

615
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:33,800
and this is absolutely necessary for the continuation of glycolysis. But anyways,

616
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,960
this was an aside note, but this lactate enters the cell, right, through a specific, I mean,

617
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:46,840
the mitochondria through a specific transporter, MCT-1, and has a specific enzyme, LDH, that

618
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:55,160
oxidates lactate back to pyruvate and going back to the Krebs cycle. So again, this is an extra

619
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,520
fuel, but for that, you need to have these transporters very well developed.

620
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:06,120
Yeah, let me try to explain this to people who aren't able to see the graph, because this is

621
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:12,520
such an important point, right? So you're showing a picture of the mitochondria, and we're looking

622
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:18,200
at the outer mitochondrial membrane. We're talking about three transporters, three things that let

623
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:26,440
substrates from the outside to the inside, where they will undergo the most efficient form of ATP

624
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:32,040
production. So the first is we have the fatty acids, they enter directly, and they undergo

625
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:38,600
an oxidation where they get truncated into little two carbon chains, and they enter the Krebs cycle.

626
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,040
We get that one, and we know why that one's very good. What I think is very interesting here is

627
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:51,400
when you contrast the two different fates of glucose byproducts. So the traditional way that

628
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:58,360
we think about this, glucose being reduced to pyruvate, pyruvate directly entering the cell

629
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:04,360
through its own carrier, and then being converted to acetyl-CoA, which follows the same fate as the

630
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:10,920
fatty acid. Now, when energy demand increases, and we just looked at graph after graph that

631
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,800
demonstrate that no matter how fit you are, at some point, you have to produce more lactate.

632
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:24,520
So you now don't have sufficient cellular oxygen to go down that first route, so you start making

633
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:33,160
lactate. But if you have enough MCT1 transporters on the outer mitochondrial membrane, you can now

634
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:38,680
bring that lactate in the cell and actually do the reverse of what just happened. Turn that lactate

635
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:44,280
back into pyruvate. Pyruvate becomes acetyl-CoA, and everybody wins the game again, the game being

636
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:51,400
won, of course, because now you're making 32 units of ATP instead of just the two units you would make

637
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:57,640
converting pyruvate to lactate. So it begs a very important question, which is, earlier when you

638
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:06,200
spoke about what makes Bogacar so remarkable physiologically, one of those things is he must

639
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:13,240
have a boatload of MCT1 transporters on his outer mitochondrial membrane, and that must

640
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:19,960
explain in part why his lactate levels are so much lower than everybody else's at a comparable work

641
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,800
level. How much of that is genetic, and how much of that is a result of his training?

642
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:33,960
Exactly. So you're right. He has a much higher level to oxidize lactate, right? So there's a

643
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:40,680
genetic component, no doubt about it. But there's also an epigenetic component, right? And as we

644
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:49,560
know nowadays, the genes are not your fate necessarily, right? From the genes to be

645
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:57,480
able to be transcribed and form a protein with biological action,

646
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:06,920
the probability is less than 20%. That's kind of what the science is showing roughly, right?

647
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:15,160
This is the whole from genetics to transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, right? It's about

648
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:20,600
20% chances that one gene is going to be ultimately expressed. Obviously, we're still trying to

649
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,000
understand all this. So these elite athletes, probably they have a much higher possibilities,

650
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:31,960
right? But there's a long journey. And this is where epigenetics occur, right? It's like what

651
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:37,960
you eat, how you rest, how you train. And I think that the training is also an important component

652
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:43,960
of this. This is, for example, why we train very, very specifically this energy system.

653
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:50,280
And we try to dial in as much as we can specifically to try to stimulate this bioenergetics

654
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:58,920
system and increase the MCT1s, the transporters for lactate, as well as all the components in the

655
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:05,080
Krebs cycle, right? Which is the mitochondrial respiration. And also to increase also the

656
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:10,840
mitochondrial pyruvitic carrier, because as we might discuss later, this is already dysregulated

657
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:18,280
in people or downregulated in people who are sedentary, right? But the thing is like, if you

658
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:25,160
see this next slide, can you see it? Okay. So this is what makes the difference in these

659
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:30,600
athletes, right? So this is a fast twitch muscle fiber, and they use glucose. So this is when you

660
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:37,480
are like a high exercise intensity climbing or running at a high intensity, or swimming,

661
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:43,800
or whatever the activity you do, you need glucose. Because glucose is, as you said very well, it

662
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:53,160
yields less ATP, but it does it much faster, right? Than the diesel gasoline, which is the fat.

663
01:13:53,800 --> 01:14:02,040
But when you use glucose, you always produce pyruvate. So the higher the intensity, the more

664
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,520
glucose you need, the more pyruvate you will need, and the more lactate that you will produce.

665
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:14,280
So that lactate has, as I said earlier, two routes. One route is like, it's exported through

666
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:20,920
the MCT force, which is the transport of lactate outside the fast twitch muscle fibers, something

667
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:26,600
that also is strainable, right? The capacity to export lactate through high intensity exercise.

668
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:36,280
And then it travels to the adjacent slow twitch muscle fibers. And if we blow up this mitochondria

669
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,640
in the slow twitch muscle fibers, this is what will happen. The entrance of that lactate, it goes

670
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:47,800
through another transporter, MCT1, it's the same family, but instead of four, it's called MCT1.

671
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:53,480
And as I mentioned earlier, that lactate is converted to pyruvate in acetyl-CoA and goes

672
01:14:53,480 --> 01:15:00,440
into the crypt cycle. So in these well-trained athletes like Porgatsar, for example, they have

673
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:07,480
an amazing ability to oxidize the lactate inside mitochondria, right? At some point, every single

674
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:14,200
human gets to a point that they cannot sustain the effort anymore, right? But what makes the

675
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,480
difference is, oh really, it's like these guys can do 400 watts for a long time versus a mere mortal

676
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,480
who can not even do two strokes at 400 watts, right? So what happens is like when you have a lot of,

677
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:32,360
when you don't have the right MCT1 and mitochondrial function, this lactate is going to

678
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:39,160
increase and accumulate, right? And it's not lactate per se, but the hydrogen ions associated

679
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:45,240
to lactate elicit an acidosis of the microenvironment of the muscle, which is something

680
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:50,280
that we know and we have learned also from cancer, the famous cancer microenvironment,

681
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,240
which is very acidic. And that's going to interfere with different functions in the muscle with both

682
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:02,360
the contraction of the contractive force and the velocity of the muscle fibers.

683
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,240
I'm not saying that this is the cause of fatigue by no means because there are multiple theories

684
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,000
and we're still trying to understand the central fatigue as well and everything probably is

685
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,800
interrelated or it must be interrelated. But the bottom line is like when this lactate cannot be

686
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:23,240
oxidized, it is exported to the blood. And this is why you see that people with metabolic syndrome,

687
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,120
for example, or type 2 diabetes who are characterized by having a very poor mitochondrial

688
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,800
function, they cannot do an exercise oxidized this lactate. In the moment, they start using glucose,

689
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,360
which is very fast also because they don't have the fast twitch, the slow twitch muscle fibers

690
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:43,560
mitochondria to use fat. They need to rely on glucose. That's that metabolic reprogramming or

691
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,680
partitioning they have. They produce lactate, but they cannot oxidize the lactate. That's why this

692
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:54,360
lactate chooses, mandatory, the route of being exported to the blood and in the blood, then it

693
01:16:54,360 --> 01:17:00,840
goes to any tissue in the body. So this is what I meant earlier about what is 2 millimoles versus

694
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:08,280
1 millimole. Whereas pogat's are, for example, he oxidizes a lot of this lactate. So by the time

695
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,280
the pogat's saturates this transporter in this mitochondrial capacity to oxidize lactate,

696
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:20,840
it's a tremendous amount of power output and a tremendous amount of glucose that he puts out.

697
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:26,840
So this is why that the 1 millimole or 1.5 millimole in a world class athlete doesn't

698
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:34,520
necessarily represent the same metabolic status of a 1.5 or 2 millimoles in the blood of a normal

699
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:41,080
person. Does it make sense? It makes complete sense. This is a fantastic tutorial in muscle

700
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:48,760
physiology. And again, this very important distinction between lactate production

701
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:57,080
at the local level and lactate that we measure at the global level. That's the challenge we have.

702
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:03,720
When we are measuring lactate, we cannot impute lactate clearance and lactate production. We can

703
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:10,360
only impute the sum of those. Exactly. And we think, I mean, it's originally thought that

704
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:16,520
these athletes, they don't use as much glucose. Well, in fact, the Richard Shoe's and Brooks and

705
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:22,440
his team showed it, and others too, that well-trained athletes, in fact, they use more glucose

706
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:29,960
because they have to. You cannot do 400 watts with a massive amount of carbohydrate oxidation.

707
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,320
And this is what we also see in the indirect colorimetry, that you see people, recreationals

708
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:40,840
for people with metabolic syndrome, they have like four grams per minute at max carbohydrate

709
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:46,360
oxidation, whereas elite athletes, they can get to six and a half, right? Cramps per minute. It's

710
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:53,800
massive amount of glucose and they produce a lot more lactate. But the key is like, it doesn't

711
01:18:54,600 --> 01:19:00,520
show up in the blood. It's the rate of appearance in the blood because it's oxidized in the muscle.

712
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:06,680
So it doesn't show up in the blood. It's the balance of lactate production and lactate oxidation

713
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:14,760
without getting to the blood. And this is what it correlates a lot also with the fat

714
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,520
oxidation as well. And the graphs that I was showing earlier.

715
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,720
So one of the things I want to ask you about here that is a bit of a confounder when we do

716
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:30,440
this type of analysis is the carbohydrate content within the diet. So I'll share with you

717
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:37,720
my data, but I've now seen this with multiple people, including one individual who's remarkably

718
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:45,160
fit. So God, it's how many years now 10 years ago, I was on a ketogenic diet for three years.

719
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:51,160
And part of that three year window overlapped with the very end of that three year period was

720
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:59,720
when I kind of got back into cycling. So at my fittest as an adult cyclist, I was back eating a

721
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:07,080
lot of carbohydrates, but there was about a six to 12 month period when I was still in ketosis

722
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:15,400
and I was kind of getting back into cycling shape. And I do have one VO2 max test from that window

723
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:22,200
of time, probably six months after getting back to cycling and still on ketosis. I've gone back

724
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:29,160
and looked at the data and they're very interesting. So what I would observe is maximum fat oxidation

725
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:40,840
was 1.3 grams per minute. And that occurred almost immediately. And it sustained until I hit my,

726
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:52,440
well, let me think. It was sustained until about, so at the time my FTP was about 4.1 watts per kilo.

727
01:20:53,160 --> 01:21:01,080
This would have been sustained until about 3.5 watts per kilo. So at 3.5 watts per kilo,

728
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:08,920
I was still oxidizing about 1.2 grams per minute. And then that sort of fell off and glucose

729
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:15,640
became then the dominant fuel source. At the completion of the test when I was done,

730
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:24,520
when I failed, I was obviously not oxidizing any fat and glucose oxidation was just under

731
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:33,320
six grams per minute. Yeah, about six grams per minute, about 24 K cal per minute. So

732
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:40,120
I've also seen this with another athlete who's been in ketosis for seven years.

733
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:50,280
He's a very fit cyclist. Actually, he just sent me his data. And it's comparable, right? So he's,

734
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:57,160
in fact, he's much fitter than I was. So his FTP, his 20 minute FTP test is about 412 watts for 20

735
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:05,400
minutes. And surprisingly, he has decent glycolytic power. So that's the other thing is I never really

736
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:10,040
had good power at the low end because I only cared about time trialing. So it didn't matter

737
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,560
how much I could hold, how many watts I could hold for two minutes or three minutes. I only

738
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:22,600
cared about one hour. But this guy could still hold 1,200 watts for 15 seconds. Even for three

739
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:31,480
minutes, he's north of 500 watts, 600 watts. And again, fat oxidation is well is, you know, 1.5

740
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:40,600
grams per minute. So it becomes a bit confusing because it would be very difficult to define

741
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:48,680
zone two by maximum fat oxidation. So ketosis is an extreme example. But given how much our Q,

742
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:54,120
respiratory quotient, the ratio of VCO2 to VO2 depends on baseline carbohydrate intake.

743
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:00,680
How do we make the adjustment so that we understand and we're not being misled? Because

744
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:07,080
if you just looked at my data, you would dramatically overestimate my mitochondrial

745
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:13,400
efficiency. Is that a situation where you say, well, actually the lactate might be the more

746
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:17,640
and unfortunately, I don't have lactate data from that test. So I can't tell you

747
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:23,800
what my lactate levels were doing. But again, there might not be a problem in the peloton

748
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,800
because you're not going to be in ketosis if you're trying to win the Tour de France. But

749
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:35,640
we do see a great degree of carbohydrate and fat variation in the diet amongst people that we're

750
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:42,360
trying to test. So how do you make that correction? Yes. So I, in my humble opinion, what we see in

751
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:48,920
these cases, because I see them all the time too, is that there's an artifact in the metabolic heart.

752
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:56,840
The metabolic heart measures gas exchange. And then through the equations, it kind of says,

753
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:02,920
okay, this person must be burning fat or burning carbohydrates. Right.

754
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:09,800
But it was calibrated, the equations are calibrated on high carb diets, presumably.

755
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:16,040
Yeah. And so the thing is like, as you exercise, no matter what fuel you're using, you keep

756
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:22,360
increasing oxygen consumption. Right. But if you don't have much carbohydrates, you're not going

757
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:33,320
to produce much CO2. So that's going to tweak, you know, mislead that my stoichiometric equation,

758
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:40,120
because the algorithm is going to think that, oh, whoa, he's using a lot of oxygen and not

759
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:46,600
producing enough CO2. So he's got to be burning a lot of fat. That's when you see fats in north of

760
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:52,440
one gram per minute. Right. So those are fat oxidation that I think they're an artifact.

761
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,120
And I see this because three days later, you know, when you change the diet of that person,

762
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:06,120
three days later, that person's fat oxidation might be 0.35. Right. So there's no way that

763
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:12,280
the mitochondria adjusts, you know, first, like it reflects a very high fat oxidation capacity.

764
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:18,040
In someone who we know very well, who is not an elite athlete, whose mitochondrial function is not

765
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:23,960
incredibly high to be able to oxidize so much fat, right. And in three days,

766
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:31,400
it reduces like by three or four times. Right. So I attribute this to an artifact of the gas

767
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:40,040
exchange. And this is where looking at lactate, it should give you those parameters. You know,

768
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:47,240
normally what I see in this individual is that you see maximum lactate of two, three,

769
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:53,800
minimals. Right. Because simply they don't have carbohydrates. Also the thing where you see that,

770
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:01,240
yeah, my maximum grams per minute of carbohydrates were in the six, but you're in ketosis. Right. So

771
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:07,240
how can you have enough glycogen or glycolytic capacity to elicit such a high carbohydrate

772
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:11,080
production? Well, I mean, I think even when you're in ketosis, you know, you're you still

773
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:18,040
remember my blood glucose is still, you know, four to five millimole. Right. I mean, it's it's

774
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:26,520
it's so so I would really like to see this studied because again, even if you're only eating 50 grams

775
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,600
of glucose a day, think of how much glycogen you're making from all the glycerol from all the fat

776
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:38,200
that's being converted to ketone. So I mean, I think Jeff Volek and Steve Finney have looked at

777
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:44,600
this and when they put people into very, very strict ketosis, but do muscle biopsies, they're

778
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:51,160
still seeing 60 percent of the glycogen content in the muscle that was there under high carb

779
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:58,440
conditions. Yeah. So I mean, I think my capacity to oxidize five and a half to six grams of glucose

780
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:03,800
per minute was still there. It just wasn't, you know, it just took a long time to get there,

781
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:11,800
I think is the difference. So I guess the question is, if the VCO2 estimation is off

782
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:17,480
because of the stoichiometric coefficients, do you think the V02 estimation is off also?

783
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:23,240
I don't know. I don't think so because, you know, I just hit very well, you know, like other, you

784
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:29,800
know, like ketones are used for energy purposes. And then we have a third element which is absolutely

785
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:36,920
key in bioenergetics, which is glutamine. Right. Glutamine lysis is highly expressed and utilized.

786
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:43,560
We have learned that from ICU patients. ICU patients is a great model to study metabolism

787
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:52,920
or stress metabolism. ICU patients, they utilized for wound healing about three times more glucose

788
01:27:52,920 --> 01:28:00,520
at rest than what we have. Right. And it's part of the healing process. Glucose is instrumental

789
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,960
for cell proliferation, wound healing. And part of it is lactate too, as a by-product in a single

790
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:13,480
molecule. But we see that, and this is a study that we published looking indirectly at methodology

791
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:20,120
to look at glycogen. And we did it with a pilot study. We did it with ICU patients. They don't

792
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:26,200
have glycogen. And it makes all the sense in the world because if you enter ICU, first of all,

793
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:32,440
normally... Sorry, when you say they don't have glycogen, you mean liver glycogen, muscle glycogen,

794
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:39,560
depleted by how much? Yeah. And depleted to what level? Yeah. So let's say that you have 500 grams

795
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:47,560
of glycogen if you have a full high carbocation diet. So that might not be the case of someone

796
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:52,680
entering the ICU. First, because they might not be elite athletes, or they might have maybe 300

797
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:58,120
grams, or they might not have that adaptation to homework glycogen. So let's say they have 300

798
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:05,800
grams or so. And then by the time they get into that condition, the body uses about three times

799
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:15,160
the glucose at rest. Now, an athlete used that same glucose, but a higher intensities, but only

800
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:21,080
for a reduced amount of time, two hours, three hours, four hours, whereas the ICU patient is 24

801
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:28,120
seven. So eventually, the body is going to run a glycogen in the muscle, or it's going to be in

802
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:34,600
their huge stress. So the body has evolutionary mechanisms. This is a wonderful machine,

803
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:41,160
and it needs to continue. So it increases another route, which is glutaminolysis.

804
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:49,000
So glutamine is an excellent source of fuel. It enters directly the mitochondria. We have seen in

805
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:56,200
the publication that we're going to show now that when we publish it, is that when we inject

806
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:04,840
mitochondria with glutamate, it's incredibly well oxidized. And what's the source of glutamate in

807
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:11,880
these ICU patients? Are they breaking down muscle? Exactly. So this is where Cacexia comes into

808
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:19,400
place. We know that pretty much every single ICU patient becomes Cacectic or suffers from muscle

809
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:25,080
waste. And this is the syndrome, right? For ICU muscle waste syndrome. And this is where like,

810
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:33,000
why do they get Cacectic or catabolic, right? And why they overexpress tremendously levels of

811
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,840
glutamine because they need it for either enter the Krebs cycle for energy or for gluconeogenesis.

812
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:46,600
So this is one of the things that we learn a lot from ICU. These ICU patients, they have

813
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:53,320
hyperglycemia, right? Yet they're not giving them usually because they have hyperglycemia. It's true

814
01:30:53,320 --> 01:31:01,240
too that in the acute ICU phase, they also have insulin resistance, right? But obviously,

815
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:06,760
this hyperglycemia and ICU doctors historically have seen this. It's like, whoa, this patient has

816
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:13,080
hyperglycemia of the chart. So obviously, we're not going to give them IVs of farias, of glucose.

817
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:18,280
We're going to give more protein and farias. And in fact, glutamine has shown that increased

818
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:26,440
survival in these patients, right? But where is this hyperglycemia coming from when you do not

819
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:34,040
have glycogen? It comes probably from proteolysis, right? Where you break down protein from your

820
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:39,560
muscles to release glutamine. But I mean, I think we could, we would only know that if we understood

821
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:44,600
hepatic glucose stores, because regardless of how much glycogen is in the muscle, it's never going

822
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:49,800
to make its way into circulation because the muscle can't fully dephosphorylate it. So do we

823
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:56,360
have a sense of what the hepatic glycogen content is? Because I can't imagine the body would ever

824
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:04,600
let anything compromise that, given that if the liver can't produce glucose, continuously,

825
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:11,240
the brain dies. So it might be that this is true, true and unrelated, right? It could be that the

826
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:18,440
muscles are depleting glycogen because of high utilization. But the liver through gluconeogenesis

827
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:25,960
has plenty of glucose. That's what's making it into the circulation because of hypercorticillemia,

828
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:32,040
because of other acute phase reactants. And so we have hyperglycemia, but it's all being mediated

829
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,920
by the liver, which has no trouble maintaining glycogen levels. And again, from an evolutionary

830
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:43,640
perspective, you much rather err on the side of hyperglycemia than hypoglycemia under a period

831
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:48,520
of stress. Absolutely. And it's necessarily, and that's I think what's the source of that

832
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:54,760
gluconeogenesis, right? So it's probably glutaminolysis, right? Coming from the muscles.

833
01:32:54,760 --> 01:33:00,280
So this is what, this is my hypothesis, right? That those muscles, they eat themselves to feed

834
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:06,520
themselves or to feed the rest of the body, right? This is why- So that would suggest that exercising

835
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:12,440
ICU patients would be important, right? Absolutely. So getting some load-bearing resistance,

836
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,640
even of course they're in a bed, but sort of moving their extremities against a load,

837
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:24,520
supplementing with amino acids could actually improve outcomes. Absolutely. There's a lot of

838
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,880
research in this area. My colleague Paul Wishmeyer, who used to work here with me at the university,

839
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:36,360
now he's in Duke. He's doing a lot of research and practical work with that. But with this,

840
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,200
it's like, yeah, this hyperglycemia probably comes from gluconeogenesis.

841
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:48,760
And again, this is what, going back to where we started, yeah, could be that there's a lot of

842
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:55,640
glutamine released, you know, when you're also in a ketoacidosis state as well, especially in the

843
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:01,400
first phases of that, right? We know cortisol is very high at first. The same thing that we see in

844
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:08,040
ICU patients, that the two main parameters that are predictors of mortality at the ICU

845
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:14,040
is hypercorticellinemia, high cortisol levels and high lactate levels, right? They both are

846
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:21,560
completely related, right? Yeah. Anyways, yeah, I think this is fascinating. It's a great model

847
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:28,440
to understand metabolism, stress metabolism of these patients and the ICU patients. And those

848
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:33,560
are the two ones, once you exercise, and this is a very important concept for people with type 2

849
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:41,640
diabetes, with type 1 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia, is that you have insulin resistance, right?

850
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:48,200
And you have difficulty to translocate, therefore, to translocate the group for

851
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:54,440
transporters to the surface of the muscle, the sarcolemma. And we know that probably the first

852
01:34:54,520 --> 01:35:02,120
tissue or organ where diabetes debuts starts is the skeletal muscle. Absolutely. Because about 80%

853
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:07,720
of the carbohydrates that we have, they're oxidizing in skeletal muscle. And because we're

854
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:13,880
at risk, should be oxidized within the mitochondria of the skeletal muscle, that pyruvate, right? This

855
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:22,360
is what we're doing research, I think, clearly. But when you have insulin resistance, you cannot

856
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:29,560
translocate those transporters. Now, we have a second way to translocate those transporters that

857
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:34,760
not many people know about, and that's muscle contraction. Right. This is the insulin

858
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:40,600
independent glucose uptake, which also seems to be heavily dependent on fitness,

859
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:48,440
right? The fittest athletes here require virtually no insulin to translocate glucose into the muscle

860
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:54,120
through the insulin independent pathway. And actually, I think we may have even discussed this,

861
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:59,480
I don't know, over dinner one night, but you look at the type one diabetics who are highly,

862
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:10,600
highly active require very little insulin. Exactly. And this explains hypoglycemia

863
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:15,000
in this patient shortly after they start exercising, right? They might have something

864
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,800
to eat and they inject themselves with insulin and there's nothing you can do once you have

865
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:24,920
insulin on board, right? So that insulin is going to translocate those transporters and it's going

866
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,800
to start bringing insulin inside. But in the moment, I mean, sorry, glucose, thanks. In the

867
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:35,640
moment you start exercising, you do the same function through contraction of the muscles.

868
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:41,960
So you have two mechanisms acting at the same time, pooling more glucose inside the cells,

869
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:47,400
leading to hypoglycemia. So this is what we learned a lot with type one persons with people

870
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:53,080
with type one diabetes and exercise, but this concept and then we can prevent them. So for example,

871
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:59,720
do not inject yourself before exercising, right? Because exercise alone is going to take care of

872
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:04,920
that glucose, right? But we can take these concepts also with people with type two diabetes

873
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,880
that they have an insulin resistance or pre type two diabetes. Like why not exercising right

874
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:21,720
after you eat, right? Because that carbohydrate you have, you have insulin resistance already,

875
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:26,760
but when you exercise, you're not going to need that insulin and yet you can translocate those

876
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,600
transporters and you bring glucose levels down. And I'm sure that you see this all the time where

877
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:38,600
your glucose sensors, where your texts come, right? Yes. And I've gotten periods of time when I've

878
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:44,520
done incredibly frequent lactate testing. So, you know, lactate testing every 30 minutes for a day

879
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,680
or something insane like that, which is incredibly expensive and incredibly painful on your fingers.

880
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:59,160
But you learn how much, for example, a meal impacts lactate. So when I wake up in the morning,

881
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:06,760
my resting lactate level varies between, and this is, I've been tracking this over a period of

882
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:16,360
probably 40 days. So 40 days of tracking. What range do you think my morning resting lactate

883
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:21,000
level has been over a 40 day period? How much variability do you do in the morning? First thing

884
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,880
in the morning? I would say, you know, like in the neighborhood of 0.8 to 1.2, 1.3.

885
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:35,720
A pretty good guess. So 0.3 to about 1.1. Okay. But that's a pretty big variation.

886
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:42,600
And probably median level of about 0.8. Yeah. Would be the median. The median of wine,

887
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:48,040
which is normally in the feeding individual, right? Yes. So then what I can do is I can eat a very

888
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:55,800
high carb breakfast and go and do a zone two ride, or don't eat anything at all and go and do a zone

889
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:03,720
two ride. Very different lactate performance curve. Absolutely. So the high carb meal raises lactate.

890
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:10,680
So it becomes a bit of an artifact in a way, which now gets me to some of the, we've talked

891
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:17,000
about this at the level of the most precision possible, the way in which I would measure it

892
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,240
in a patient, you would measure it in a world-class athlete, where we have the ability to do indirect

893
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:29,320
calorimetry and lactate testing. But now I want to talk about it in the way that we train people,

894
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:37,480
normal people. So we've talked about this, call it, you know, difference, right, between

895
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:43,640
the lactate level that you measure in the blood, which is now heavily influenced by production

896
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:48,120
and clearance. And then we've talked about the gold standard, which would probably be fat

897
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:53,560
oxidation, but even that can be confounded. But let's take off the table the people who are

898
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:57,080
consuming a high fat, low carbohydrate diet, because that confuses things a bit.

899
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:05,320
If I have a patient and I'm looking at their biometrics and we do a zone two test based on

900
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:11,160
looking at their fat oxidation during an escalated test of part of a VO2 max test,

901
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:18,680
and it comes back that their maximum fat oxidation, which is, you know, 0.3 grams per minute,

902
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:25,800
occurs at a wattage of 1.5 watts per kilo. That's a pretty average person.

903
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:32,360
And I say, I want that number higher, both the absolute number of fat oxidation,

904
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:39,240
but where it occurs on the graph. Now I want you in a year to be 2.5 watts per kilo.

905
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:46,520
Let's talk about two things. One, how they should train, and that means duration,

906
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:54,680
intensity, frequency, et cetera. And secondly, what we should use as the readout to know where

907
01:40:55,400 --> 01:41:00,440
in the right training zone, given that they won't be able to train daily or weekly or whatever

908
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:06,280
frequency with indirect calorimetry. And by the way, let's assume that some people will want to

909
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:12,040
use the point of care lactate meters and some people will not. So let's start with what's our

910
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:20,360
surrogate for training zone. And starting with what we knew. So we learned that 1.5 watts per kilo

911
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:27,400
was maximum fat oxidation, but we want to increase that to 2.5. So what metric do you use to train

912
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,920
them? So yes, normally what I do is like starting with the metabolic test, I translate that

913
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:41,320
information into whether it's watts or speed or heart rate. All of it normally they correlate

914
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:47,080
quite well. And you can individualize it. There are people that don't have a power meter. You can do

915
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:53,080
heart rate, for example, or people that just obviously they run or they walk. You can do speed

916
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:59,800
or heart rate as well. They're very good surrogate. So that's a first metric, the surrogate. Then

917
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:07,320
it's about, at least from my experience, the three main principles that I've learned over the years

918
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:13,000
on how to apply this. So first is frequency. How many?

919
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:17,960
Before we go to the frequency and the duration, I do want to go back and ask you another question.

920
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:23,800
We have some patients who don't want to use a lactate meter, either because it's cumbersome

921
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:30,280
or somewhat intimidating. We also add another metric, which is relative perceived exertion,

922
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:37,960
RPE. I'll tell you what my rule of thumb is, but I'd like you to sharpen it, refine it, throw it out,

923
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:42,840
make it better, whatever. I tell patients based on my experience, so I don't know how

924
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:53,080
extrapolatable that is, when I'm in zone two as confirmed by lactate levels. So call it 1.7 to 1.9

925
01:42:53,080 --> 01:43:00,280
millimole, which is what I target. I can carry out a conversation. So I can spend my entire,

926
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:04,200
because I do most of mine on a Wahoo KICKR. I put my bike on a Wahoo KICKR.

927
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:12,120
I can spend the entire 45 minutes on a phone call. Yes, absolutely. But it's not as comfortable

928
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:18,840
as this discussion here. Exactly. I'm a little more strained. Yeah. But if I can't talk, if I

929
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:25,080
feel like I can't talk, I'm too high in the intensity. Yeah. Do you think that that's a

930
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:32,440
reasonable surrogate for people to use across the spectrum of not particularly fit all the way up to

931
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:40,440
Progacha? 1,000%. And I use the same metrics also with people who, like you mentioned, they

932
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:48,120
don't want to do a Wahoo KICKR meter, or they don't have access, or I get hundreds of emails about

933
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:55,000
where can I do this test? Or is there anything that I can do? And I agree 100%.

934
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:03,400
That with everything that we know at the granular, cellular level by injecting fuels and

935
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:07,640
frustrates directly into the mitochondria, we cannot get more cellular level and scientific

936
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:13,960
like that. The surrogate or the precipice exertion, it works beautifully. I know that

937
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:19,720
people are coming out with different algorithms based on higher variability or the DFA, 1 alpha,

938
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:27,560
you know, etc. But honestly, I agree 100% with you. If you can always tell people if you can

939
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:32,520
exercise whatever the exercise you do, and maintain a conversation like you and I are doing,

940
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:39,480
you're way too easy. You're probably zone one. If you can talk, but it's some form of strain,

941
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:45,160
you can talk for two hours, right? But we're talking like that.

942
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:49,880
You're just at that threshold of the person put it this way. The other litmus test I tell people is

943
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:53,400
the person on the other end will know you were exercising.

944
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,720
You will not be able to mask from them that you are exercising.

945
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:04,280
Exactly. And in fact, I have many conference calls with, you know, like people that I know

946
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:10,040
to be respectful, but I do on the bike, you know, work, as you said, you know, they call me and I'm

947
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:15,560
on the bike, either outside or in the trainer and it's like you're exercising, right? Because

948
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:22,200
you can feel it. But yet I can maintain a full hour meeting on the bike, right? And without

949
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:26,680
bothering the other person because they can understand it. But is it if you cross to the

950
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:33,400
point where you cannot maintain that conversation, that's where you is because yeah, you need to

951
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:38,360
breathe much faster because you're producing more CO2. And that's probably because you're already

952
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:43,400
transitioning from the slow twitch muscle fibers to the fast twitch muscle fibers, more glycolytic,

953
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:49,640
more lactate, more CO2, more buffering capacity. So it seems old school, but it works beautifully.

954
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:55,240
Agreed. And the other thing I do because I really like people to triangulate and give them a starting

955
01:45:55,240 --> 01:46:00,600
point. So if someone has not done a metabolic test yet, and we're just and that's usually the case,

956
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:06,280
by the way, is that we're starting with just a zone two training protocol. I also give them some

957
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:11,160
ranges on heart rate. Now here I have found much more variability. So the first thing I say is

958
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:16,600
to do this, you do need to know your maximum heart rate, not your predicted maximum heart rate,

959
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:25,240
but your actual achieved maximum heart rate. In my experience personally, so this is I don't know how

960
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:33,160
much I can extrapolate this. My zone two is actually at about 78 to 81 percent of my maximum

961
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:40,840
heart rate. But I know that for less trained people, it's lower. So I tell people a broad range

962
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:48,840
of 70 to 80 percent of your realized maximum heart rate is a good place to start and then make

963
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:55,080
adjustments based on relative perceived exertion. Yeah, I agree. What do you know about heart rate?

964
01:46:55,080 --> 01:47:01,720
And yeah, I would agree that I usually also say the same thing somewhere between 70 to 80.

965
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:05,960
That being said, right, if you want to. That's a big range. Yeah, it's a big range. Exactly. So you

966
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:14,360
can be at 70. Let's say at 1.7 millimoles and then at 80, you can be at five millimoles.

967
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,600
Right. So you're completely away from one zone. But as you said, it's a good starting point. And

968
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:24,440
then as you very well said, and I agree 100 percent with you, is like, yeah, then you tweak it with

969
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:31,320
your perceived exertion. I agree. The other thing too with the heart rate, and this is where

970
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:39,000
the heart rate variability, there are different interpretations. So the modern interpretation,

971
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,920
the heart rate variability is the differences between beat to beat. And that's where there are

972
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:53,560
different algorithms. For me, the heart rate variability is more at a broader spectrum and

973
01:47:53,640 --> 01:48:03,480
is more on the adrenergic activation that you have. So for example, your fatigue today,

974
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:10,040
right, first of all, normally you're going to wake up with your resting heart rate a little bit higher

975
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:17,480
than normally. So that if you're a normal heart rate, let's say it's 50 and you're in fatigue,

976
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:24,440
you might wake up with 65. So that alone is a heart rate variability concept. It varies from

977
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:29,720
the norm to one day. So that's our red flag that you might be tired that day. It might not happen

978
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:34,520
all the day. I mean, it might not be super sensitive, but it is very sensitive for elite

979
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:39,640
athletes without a doubt. The second aspect is like when you go out there and exercise.

980
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:45,400
As you might see, there are days that you are like 130 beats per minute, whatever you think your zone

981
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:54,200
two is 130, 138, for example. But some days it's really hard to get the heart rate, right? Extremely

982
01:48:54,200 --> 01:49:00,040
hard. And you're already struggling at 110 beats per minute or 115 beats per minute, where that's

983
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,320
not the norm. That's another deviation. That's the variability of the heart, right? So this is

984
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:11,400
what I've been historically used for heart rate variability, which tells me a lot more information.

985
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:17,800
This is what all the athletes also tell you, like, man, my heart rate doesn't get up today. You see on

986
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:21,960
training picks, you know, you see when someone is fatigued, they do an interval and they know they

987
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:28,280
always 180, 185, let's say they lack the threshold. And today they cannot get up until more than 170.

988
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:34,440
You see in the competition, the first week of the Tour de France, the maximum heart rate,

989
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:42,760
let's say it's 195. Last week, the maximum heart rate is 170, right? That's what I interpret by

990
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,920
heart rate variability. And I know that a lot of people make to the size of me because all that has

991
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:52,840
nothing to do with, I respect all that. No, I think it's macro versus micro. I agree. I read it as

992
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,160
macro versus micro. I'll share with you an interesting self-experiment I've done a couple

993
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:03,480
of times. It's not pleasant, but it's interesting. If I take a huge dose of a beta blocker,

994
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,680
and the only beta blocker you can do this with, if you have low blood pressure, as I do, you have

995
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:14,840
to be careful, but propranolol is fine because it really disproportionately lowers heart rate,

996
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:20,280
but not blood pressure. But I've done this experiment a few times to test an idea, which is

997
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:28,920
would taking all of the gas out of my heart rate allow me to push harder and generate a higher

998
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:37,000
zone two. And it turns out it does. So my zone two is just under three watts per kilo. I really

999
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,320
want to talk with you about getting over three watts per kilo. I'm still furious because in July,

1000
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:48,200
remember I was at 2.95. I was just kissing on the door of three and I've actually come back a

1001
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:57,400
little bit. I've come back, I'm now at about 2.75 to 2.85. So I've lost a bit. No, I think we're

1002
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:02,600
going to talk about training in a moment. So, but what I noticed, so, and for me, I'm at that upper

1003
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:07,560
end of maximum heart rate. So, so I'm going to be doing that at about 80, 81% of maximum heart rate.

1004
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,960
But when, if I took propranolol, you know, 60 milligrams of a time release propranolol,

1005
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:21,560
I will be able to get over three watts per kilo and I'll do it at a heart rate of 68%

1006
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:30,440
of maximum. Yeah. But it feels horrible. Yeah. I feel like I'm going to die. Yeah. It is the worst

1007
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:38,120
feeling in the world. It is like somebody has, and it's not pain. It's, it's not like,

1008
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:43,720
I don't know how to explain it other than it feels like what it feels like when you're over-trained.

1009
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:49,800
It feels like you just can't, you can't get moving. It's like an engine that's being taken

1010
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:57,000
from 9,000 RPM to 6,000 RPM, but yet somehow is able to generate the horsepower,

1011
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:03,320
but it just doesn't feel right. So, you know, that, that's sort of my, that's, that's my drug

1012
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:08,040
cheating way to ramp, to get over three watts per kilo, but more to illustrate the point, right?

1013
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:13,960
Which is when you put the governor on heart rate, you can, you can get there at a lower heart rate,

1014
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:19,000
but it, but, but there's just some, subjectively it's a miserable feeling. Yeah, no, absolutely.

1015
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,120
It's a, yeah. And this is kind of in a way what happens when, when you're fatigued,

1016
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:30,040
when you don't have enough fuel, right? So again, going back to like my heart, it doesn't get up

1017
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:35,320
today and I'm struggling kind of like, you know, it's like if you were taking some better blocker,

1018
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:41,480
right? But the thing is that it has to do a lot with fuel. And, and, and, and, for example,

1019
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:47,560
and I experiment this a lot too. I, I try to understand how this works. So I do maybe

1020
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:53,880
the intermittent fasting for a few days and I go out there and I'm not good at adjusting at that.

1021
01:52:53,880 --> 01:53:00,440
And I cannot do that. I know others can do it. And I admire that. But I can see in my heart rate

1022
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:07,320
right away, right? When you don't have enough glycogen storage is, it's very possible that

1023
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:13,560
adrenergic activity is decreased. You need to break down glycogen. And we know that what takes

1024
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:19,320
to break down glycogen is for a lace, right? In the, in the muscle. And that's directly regulated

1025
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:28,040
by catecholamines, right? So when there's a decreasing glycogen, this is my hypothesis,

1026
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:34,520
right? When there's a decrease in glycogen storages, because of the evolutionary mechanisms

1027
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:39,960
that humans have, the brain is the boss, right? The brain says like, I don't care about your legs,

1028
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:45,800
but don't, don't use up all the glycogen because you have to give me and the liver has to give me

1029
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:51,320
glycogen as well. So I'm not going to shut you down completely or breaking down glycogen,

1030
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:56,760
but I'm going to slow you down. So I'm going to release less catecholamines so that you break

1031
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:05,480
down. Now the collateral effect of that is the heart because the heart contractility is regulated

1032
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:11,160
by catecholamines as well. So this is why using that, my version of heart rate variability,

1033
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:16,280
it's quite useful. I've been using it incredibly successfully for 25 years with my athletes,

1034
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:23,560
where I see that, Hey, your heart rate is not going up today. You know, usually it's 185, 190,

1035
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:29,160
for example, when you do a lactate threshold, for example, and today it was 170. So tomorrow,

1036
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:34,200
take it easy or pile up on glycogen, I mean, on carbohydrates or take it easy day. And you see

1037
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:38,680
how you're going to be very responsive the next day, the following day. And in fact, that's what

1038
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:43,640
happens. I would say 10 out of 10 times, but let's say nine out of 10 times, right? But I do that

1039
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:51,560
with myself as well. And I see is also that I don't, I mean, I work a lot with the head, you know,

1040
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:57,560
so, you know, you think a lot and the brain uses about a hundred to 125 grams of glucose daily,

1041
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:02,120
right? When, when you go, and I don't know that fact, you know, but when you know,

1042
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:07,240
when you work a lot of hours and thinking and thinking and thinking and stressed,

1043
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:15,160
I'm sure that obviously that the brain might need a lot more glucose. So that's training your,

1044
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,160
your glycogen storage is from the brain probably, and even from the muscles, because the muscle

1045
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:25,720
can release glucose, it can utilize this one. Yes. How the muscle can, the muscle has phosphorylase

1046
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:31,720
and can be a degraded glucose, the glycogen and that glucose can go to the, to the circulation

1047
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:37,400
as well to feed other organs. I didn't realize that we had glucose one phosphatase in the muscle.

1048
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:43,960
I thought the muscle glycogen fate was sealed in the muscle. No, it's possible. There are a few

1049
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:53,000
studies I am happy to send them to you. I cannot refer them out of memory, but the muscles can also

1050
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,760
release glucose to an expert glucose outside. I assume this is a relatively small amount.

1051
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:04,600
Yes. Compared to what the liver is saying. Yeah, absolutely. Exactly. But it's possible too.

1052
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:09,400
But what I mean, and I don't want to say, yeah, so, so those days where I'm thinking a lot and I'm

1053
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:15,960
not very stressed and I'm not, you know, like dieting or anything, I just go out there and I'm

1054
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:20,200
dead. And I'm sure that many people listening to this feel the same way. Like what the hell is

1055
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:26,200
going on today? I don't have energy at all today. You know, so, and you will see that your heart rate

1056
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:33,000
doesn't get up those days. And you can get to that by just training five hours a week or seven hours

1057
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,160
a week. And sometimes people say like, look, I cannot be overtrained because I only trained

1058
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:42,760
five hours a week. Yeah. But you're overworked. Yeah. And that does, that does a big artifact

1059
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:48,040
where you're training. That's what most of us are inspired to pre-retire before 60, you know,

1060
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:54,040
so we can have more time to exercise, right? And less time to work. But, but yeah, that's what I

1061
01:56:54,040 --> 01:57:04,440
do this. I take a day off completely. I sleep more. I increase my carbohydrate intake. And the

1062
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:10,280
following day I can even break my PR on a climb or something, like feel like, like a million dollars.

1063
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:15,000
So resting recovery is key for that. Yeah. I think this is a very important point. And it's

1064
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:21,240
actually something I've only been able to pay attention to in the last year, which is I used

1065
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:29,960
to judge my performance by training load. So, you know, again, we, I used to use training peaks when

1066
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:35,160
I was training. I don't anymore, but the concepts of acute and chronic training balance. And, and

1067
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:41,560
it was, you know, any day that was suboptimal could be explained by training volume in some capacity.

1068
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:46,440
But now, you know, my training volume is relatively low. It's 10 hours a week of total

1069
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:50,600
training. That's both, you know, cardio and strength. So that's, this is not a lot of training.

1070
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:58,680
And yet when I'm under stress, work wise, you know, I'm just doing too much. I don't even use

1071
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:04,200
the word stress. It has a real negative connotation to it. I just mean when I'm overworked,

1072
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:11,480
when I'm doing too much, my performance, I have to either adjust my parameters for what I deem

1073
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:18,840
successful, or I just have to sort of cut back on the actual training a little bit to make time

1074
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:25,880
for more sleep or more relaxation. And so I think that's a very important point that I,

1075
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:31,320
that is easily lost. So, so let's, let's now, so we've got a very good handle on the metrics

1076
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:38,440
we're going to be using. So now let's talk about two scenarios. The first is the person who is new

1077
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:43,960
to this type of training. So they've listened to this podcast, or they're one of my patients,

1078
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:49,400
and I've made the case convincingly to them that you really need to do this type of training.

1079
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:56,280
I want to come back by the way to a justification for that. So let's explain why high intensity

1080
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:01,240
training is not sufficient, but we'll, we'll park that for a moment. But they really don't have much

1081
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:05,880
of a background in this type of training, right? They, you know, maybe they do some high intensity

1082
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:10,600
training, they do some weights, they play some tennis, but they really don't do the sort of

1083
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:18,760
steady state sustained cardio that we're talking about. How would you structure a training program

1084
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:25,800
in dose, duration, frequency for that individual? And tell me a little bit about the choices that

1085
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:33,320
you would make if they're agnostic to running, walking, cycling, rowing, swimming. You know,

1086
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:36,600
again, I have my biases there, but I want to kind of hear what you have to say about it.

1087
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:43,160
Yeah, no, yeah, that's a great question. And I also know before that, I went to apologize to many of

1088
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:51,400
your audience, because I, I get a lot of emails, you know, asking me about these questions. And

1089
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:55,240
it's hard to, well, that's why we're doing the podcast. So yeah, you don't have to apologize.

1090
01:59:55,240 --> 02:00:02,440
It's easier to do it this way. But see, I get emails. And, and before I used to see people here

1091
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:07,400
at the university, but now at the university, you know, we don't have these services. So I'm

1092
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:12,440
trying to convince them that the services are important to offer to the population. But anyways,

1093
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:19,160
I want to apologize, because I cannot answer to everybody. But yeah, so I have the three main

1094
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:25,080
rules or parameters that I have learned over the years. So one is the duration, right? We have in

1095
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:30,440
mind sometimes that this is like endurance training, one day, like, like, I only have it

1096
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:36,360
six hours a week or seven hours a week, most right, to do this type of training or less. So

1097
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:40,840
there's no way I can do that. It's usually less because they might have six hours a week for total

1098
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,720
exercise. Exactly. And we're going to take half of that for strength training. Exactly. Because which

1099
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:53,640
is very important, as you know, it is my it's where I fail, because I should do more of that.

1100
02:00:53,640 --> 02:01:00,360
And I try to get a little bit more of time to do that. But I, it's not easy. But I aspire really to

1101
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:04,760
dial that in. But but yeah, you're right, they might have less than six hours. And then my thing

1102
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:10,920
like, well, I'm not an endurance athlete. So you need to do four hours to do to accomplish this. So

1103
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:16,680
therefore, I'm just going to move to do just high intensity and just get out of the way. Well, that's

1104
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:23,720
not completely true. Right. You can accomplish very important mitochondrial adaptations, and very

1105
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:32,840
important metabolic adaptations by exercising one hour. Right. So this is one is the duration,

1106
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:39,480
let's start by the duration, right. So if you try to do that one hour to one hour and a half range,

1107
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:46,680
you're on target. And is that in one setting hours? I'm sorry, is that total or one setting?

1108
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:51,960
What do you mean? Meaning is it one to one and a half hours per week? Or

1109
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:59,720
does that need to be in one continuous? Yeah, so exercise about? Yeah, I'm sorry. Let me let me

1110
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:05,400
go back to that the frequency, right that the dose. So the frequency that I see is that this

1111
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:11,240
type of training, ideally, needs to be done between three to four days a week, ideally,

1112
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:19,720
what I've seen and how can I know this? I know this because I've seen in the laboratory, everything,

1113
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,760
right, the person who trains one day at these zones for two days or three days or four days or

1114
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:29,480
high intensity, low intensity, and I see the adaptations. How do I see the adaptations? Again,

1115
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:34,760
looking at my account, I mean, that fat oxidation, black ticklings capacity, both surrogates of

1116
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:40,680
mitochondrial function, right. So I've been identifying the dose of that training. So if

1117
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:46,440
you train once a week there, chances are that you're going to deteriorate over time, and especially

1118
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:53,160
as we age, something that I see, for example, in high intensity, exercisers, and bodybuilders,

1119
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:58,920
that they have a very poor mitochondrial function, compared to people who do more,

1120
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:05,560
a little bit of everything, right. So one day a week is not going to work. Two days a week,

1121
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:12,280
it might maintain what you have. But if you're new to an exercise program might not be enough.

1122
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:19,320
Three days a week, now we're starting to see for sure. Four days a week, now we're talking.

1123
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:24,280
Ideally five days a week or six, but not everybody has, obviously six days a week to train. But

1124
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:31,160
I think that we all can, I mean, you are a very busy guy. I'm a very busy guy. And we try to

1125
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:36,440
squeeze four or five days a week, maybe six in the summer, but four or five days, it's achievable

1126
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:43,240
for most individuals and put aside an hour to an hour and a half. So I would say the four days a

1127
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:49,800
week is ideal. That's the first principle. The second principle is the duration, going back to

1128
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:57,880
what I was saying. With one hour, maybe Poratza needs four hours, five hours, to keep increasing

1129
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:04,520
those huge mitochondria for a long time. But a mere mortal, especially someone who might be

1130
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:10,280
prediabetic or might be out of fitness or has an exercise in a long time or someone who's coming

1131
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:17,800
from a disease or a mother who just had a baby and has been out of safe for a while. One hour,

1132
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:27,000
if you walk or if you run, might be very, very good for you. One hour walk or run, you might

1133
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,280
have to bring it up. That's part of the plan too. You cannot start off the bat with one hour. You

1134
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:36,920
might start by 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, increasing it. It may be about an hour. And if you

1135
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:43,640
bike, for example, about an hour, 20 minutes, hour and a half, that's what I see that if you do that

1136
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:50,040
for four days a week, things are starting to move. Even if you bike on a trainer where you can be much

1137
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:55,640
more efficient and you can really get straight to the wattage and stay there, because we tell patients,

1138
02:04:56,520 --> 02:05:00,040
you know, again, it depends where they are in their cycle. But if they're starting out, I mean,

1139
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:05,640
we'd be happy if they give us 30 minutes, three to four times a week of dedicated exercise.

1140
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:12,600
So do you see a difference between, I can't do zone two on the road. I can really only do it

1141
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:18,520
on the trainer. I just can't stay at a constant level on the road with starting and stopping and

1142
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:22,920
wind and hills and stuff like that. That's a very good point. That's why an hour and a half on the

1143
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:28,840
bike, it might actually be one hour or so, right? Because you have all these artifacts. But you're

1144
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:33,320
right. When you're on the trainer, you isolate everything completely. And what I also recommend

1145
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:37,480
is about an hour if you can get there. But again, you know, like, yeah, sure, you might,

1146
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:44,200
to me, it feels like a torture sometimes, you know, to be an hour on the trainer. I hate it.

1147
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:51,000
I like to be outside, but we have to do it. I do it. I watch a movie or just catch up on work. I

1148
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:57,800
have one of those special desks, right, where I can type or read articles or answers and emails.

1149
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:02,520
Valky activity because again, you're not very sharp to think very intellectually.

1150
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:07,720
But yeah, one hour might do the trick. What I've seen is like, yeah, in those people who haven't

1151
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:13,320
done much at all, even 30 minutes, 20 minutes might start moving the needle, but eventually

1152
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:22,120
it's not enough dose, right? It's like the body needs more, right? So if you can get to a goal

1153
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:29,640
about an hour to an hour and a half, that should really work in my modest opinion, in my experience.

1154
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:36,040
So that's the duration. And the third is always the frequency, which we have talked about,

1155
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:43,080
which is usually the zone two. That being said, I think that it's also important to stimulate other

1156
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:49,320
energy systems, right? Like the glycolytic system. And again, continue with the model that we do with

1157
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:55,720
elite athletes. People think that elite athletes, whatever the sport are, all they do is high

1158
02:06:55,720 --> 02:07:01,560
intensity all the time and intervals, intervals, and it's the exact opposite. If you look at the

1159
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:08,920
workload of an elite athlete, whether that elite athlete is, especially in individual sports,

1160
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:13,800
right? It's easier to see this, whether it's a triathlete or a cyclist or a marathon runner

1161
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:19,640
or a swimmer, right? Which is like a hundred meter swimmer is under a minute, right? It's

1162
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:26,120
maximal exercise. If you look at the workload, it's very similar, right? The majority of the sessions

1163
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:31,080
are in the lower intensity. They're not intervals, intervals, intervals. And I always say we cannot be

1164
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:35,800
so naive to think that, you know, like the best coaches and athletes in the world haven't figured

1165
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:39,800
this out when they're always trying new things and they want to try the cutting edge things.

1166
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:46,120
Obviously they have said like, oh, our sport is swimming. It's under a minute. All we need to do

1167
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:50,680
is like intervals, intervals, intervals, intervals, right? Well, if you look at what swimmers do,

1168
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:57,480
they train and if you ask Michael Phelps, you know, hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.

1169
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:01,880
Because if you can travel through the competition in that under a minute,

1170
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:08,120
with a slightly better function to clear lactate, even if it's one millimole or less,

1171
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:16,680
the muscle contraction force might be improved. So all the hours and hours and hours might be that

1172
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:21,320
just to improve a fraction of a second. But anyway, so this is what I'm saying that these concepts of

1173
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:31,240
glycolytic capacity and high intensity training, they're necessary, but they're not what the lead

1174
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:37,960
athletes do. And if the lead athletes have the best metabolic function of any humans, why not

1175
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:44,120
try to imitate their philosophy of exercise? And so just to come back to the frequency duration

1176
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:49,960
question, I think the answer to the following question is going to be the more frequent training

1177
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:54,600
sessions. But if you compared four training regimens that were four hours a week each,

1178
02:08:55,560 --> 02:09:03,480
one of them would be four 60 minute sessions. One of them would be three 80 minute sessions.

1179
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:09,320
One of them would be two two hour sessions. And then one of them would be one four hour session.

1180
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:14,440
So it's the same total volume. Is it safe and notwithstanding the brain damage of one four

1181
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:20,680
hour session, is it safe to say that the four 60 minute sessions because it's a higher frequency

1182
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:26,680
would be the optimal one there? I would say so. I think from my experience that it might be better

1183
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:31,800
because it's the frequency is like it's like if you take a medication, right? If you take a

1184
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:37,320
medication twice the dose and only three days a week might not work as well as if you take the

1185
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:43,000
right dose every day. Right. Because at the end of the day, we're talking about the whole exercise

1186
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,760
as medicine. Right. How do we prescribe that? You know, what's the dose? What's the frequency? I'm

1187
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:54,680
assuming that you will have to take it as many days as possible. Right. So that would say that

1188
02:09:54,680 --> 02:10:01,000
it's better to do that. That being said, obviously, if you have the weekend and you have the possibility,

1189
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:07,640
which I don't have to do three hours, go ahead. Right. And another thing I wanted to point out is

1190
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:14,600
that, you know, for many people there, they need that adrenaline, right, for training. So other

1191
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:19,320
people don't care. Right. Other people say, wow, I love this. I don't like to kill myself into

1192
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:23,480
high intensity. But I think you need to do some high intensity. Yeah. So I want to talk about that.

1193
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:30,120
So how do we bring in the other energy systems of the four pillars of exercise in my world?

1194
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:37,080
Stability, strength, low end aerobic, which I describe really as they talk about this kind of

1195
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:43,880
mitochondrial efficiency and then high end aerobic, which is peak aerobic capacity slash anaerobic

1196
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:51,000
performance. So anaerobic power, peak aerobic, low end aerobic mitochondrial efficiency, strength,

1197
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:58,920
stability of those four. I for some reason struggle to make the time for the peak aerobic

1198
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:06,360
in part because I want it's the least enjoyable truth. If we're going to be brutally honest,

1199
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:11,320
if you're doing it right, it hurts the most. Yeah. It's also no longer as relevant because

1200
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:16,040
I don't compete at anything. Right. Like it was I actually really enjoyed that type of training

1201
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:20,840
when I competed because you have to spend time in that energy system and you see the rewards

1202
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:27,720
of, you know, repeating 60 minute, you know, 60 minutes of repeating two minute intervals or

1203
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:32,920
something like that. So if we're if we're really talking about this from the lens of health,

1204
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:42,040
maximizing health, the data are unambiguous that VO two max is highly correlated with longevity

1205
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:47,080
in a unlike there are not many variables that are more strongly correlated.

1206
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:51,880
So but the levels don't have to be that high. Right. We're not. I mean,

1207
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:57,640
Pogaczor's VO two max is probably eighty five, you know, or it's probably in the eighties at least

1208
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:06,440
in terms of milliliters per minute per kilogram. But someone my age to be considered absolutely

1209
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:10,680
elite, which means the top two point five to two point seven percent of the population,

1210
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:15,800
which carries with it a five fold reduction in risk to the bottom twenty five percent of the

1211
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:24,360
population. My VO two max requirement is about fifty two fifty three milliliters per minute per

1212
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:31,800
kilogram. So the question is, can I use that as the gauge for how much high intensity training I

1213
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:37,640
need to do basically just enough to make sure I maintain that VO two max or do you think about it

1214
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:43,400
in a different way? Well, I think about it more again, the bioenergetics energy energy systems.

1215
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:51,160
Right. I think that ultimately and we know that longevity is also high related with mitochondrial

1216
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:58,680
function and metabolic health. I think that more and more and this is why you see so many fields in

1217
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:06,200
medicine nowadays, right, that everybody is stumbling upon mitochondria. Right. And so there's

1218
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:13,240
an aging process where we lose mitochondrial function and there's like a sedentary component,

1219
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:18,760
right, where we lose mitochondrial function. I wish that we could have a medication appeal.

1220
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:23,000
You could take it and increase the mitochondrial function because it would increase metabolic

1221
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,520
health and longevity. But the only medication that we know is exercise and the medic and within

1222
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:34,440
exercise that the right the dose that we see that improves the most and also is sustainable in the

1223
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:41,560
long term, which is another important concept. You know, very high intensity training is not sustainable.

1224
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:46,840
Very extreme diets are not sustainable. If you combine both, it's even worse. And this is what

1225
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:51,400
a lot of people are doing together. But you need to have some sustainability. But this is what

1226
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:57,400
we see in this. This is important to improve that mitochondrial function. But going back to that

1227
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:02,360
high intensity, I think is necessary because we also lose glycolytic capacity as we age.

1228
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:07,080
And it's important to stimulate it. As you very well said, for all of us who are not competing,

1229
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:14,360
I couldn't care less about being super high intensity because I'm not competing. But that's

1230
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:18,600
it. I want to have also my adrenaline rush, you know, so like many people.

1231
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:23,480
But how much does it feed into it? So for example, if I've often thought about this now,

1232
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:30,120
as I just want to make sure my zone two is above three watts per kilo, would I be better off taking

1233
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:34,600
that extra training? If I have one additional training session per week, should I make it an

1234
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:41,960
additional zone to work out? So then I do four now, should I be doing a fifth one? Or should I

1235
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:47,400
be taking that fifth one and doing a VO two max protocol? And that's that's what we'll typically

1236
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:52,520
prescribe to our patients is a four by four protocol of, you know, highest intensity sustained

1237
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:58,280
for four minutes, followed by four minutes of recovery, and then repeat that four or five,

1238
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:03,720
six times. You know, when you put that when you put a warm up and cool down on either end of that,

1239
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:09,720
you know, that's a little over an hour. So you could, would you spend that hour doing that in

1240
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:15,400
an effort to make your zone two even better? Or would you just do an extra hour of zone two?

1241
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:22,600
No, that's a really good question. So what I what I I agree, I agree that you can, if you have a

1242
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:28,680
fifth day, you can convert it into any type of high intensity session structured. All right,

1243
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:33,400
what I can tell people is, hey, if you're a cyclist or a runner, and you want to go with your friends,

1244
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:39,000
that's your group, right? Yeah, right. Go ahead and boom, go at it. Or if you don't have the

1245
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,600
possibility, what this is my situation, for example, where I don't have the time to train

1246
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:50,040
more than an hour and a half, usually two hours max, right? So what I do almost on every session,

1247
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:56,680
I do my zone two. So it's clean. And at the end, that's what I do a very high intensity interval.

1248
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:02,600
And tell me the duration. So if you did an hour of zone two, yeah, so I do usually let's say an

1249
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:07,560
hour and a half, right? So, and so you'll do an hour and a half of zone two, three or four times

1250
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:14,520
a week. Yeah, I try, I shoot for four or five, but not all the time it's easy. But yeah, I shoot

1251
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:20,280
for five and I try to be strict on that. But let's say that, yeah, the last, and unfortunately that,

1252
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:27,160
you know, I, where I live, you know, like, I live in more in a, it's highlands area. And so you have

1253
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:33,320
to go up. So the last part, I just, I just go at it, you know, sometimes you find another cyclist

1254
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:38,920
and you just compete, you know, to see who's the fastest in that short climb. But I try to do like

1255
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:45,560
a good five minute interval, roughly, where I really like kind of like a go hard at it. And

1256
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:52,440
then I arrive home like, man, I kicked my ass today, or this kicked my ass today, or sometimes

1257
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:57,240
you try it and you don't have the energy, as I mentioned earlier, oh my gosh, I can barely move

1258
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:03,720
the pedals today. I just quit and go home. But when I feel fresh, you know, that's what I stimulate

1259
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:09,560
that glycolytic system. What we know well too is that, you know, that increases the mitochondrial

1260
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:15,800
function, it takes months or years. Increasing the glycolytic system, it takes much, much more,

1261
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:22,760
less amount of time. You can do that in weeks or months. And you can just, if you stimulate on a

1262
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:28,680
regular base, two days a week, or three days a week, at the end of that zone two, that's where

1263
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:35,160
you can target both energy systems, right? The oxidative mitochondrial system and the glycolytic.

1264
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:41,560
And we don't blunt it. We don't, we don't, we don't blunt the benefit we had from the zone two

1265
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:47,240
if we immediately follow it with the zone five. No, because that's done, right? That's not,

1266
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:50,680
why it seems like if you do the same things in the middle. But you don't want to do the reverse order.

1267
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:53,960
Yes. And one of the things like- You don't want to start with the high intensity.

1268
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:57,480
Exactly. One of the things like, because you start having all these hormonal responses,

1269
02:17:57,480 --> 02:18:01,800
and also you see you have high lactate levels in the blood. And what we know very well is like

1270
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:08,120
lactate inhibits lipolysis. So if you have a high interval in the middle or the beginning,

1271
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:13,320
and you don't clear lactate very well, you might have high lactate levels for a while,

1272
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:19,880
and it's going to inhibit lipolysis, right? Also another study we have under review, lactate

1273
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:27,880
the autocrine level, yeah, decreases the activity of CPT-1 and CPT-2. So interfacial with the

1274
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:34,600
transport of fatty acids as well. So that's where like, if you do all these, you might change things.

1275
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:38,920
You have high cortisol, cortisol, and anemia as well. And that's an important point. I'm glad you

1276
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:45,560
raised that because I explained this to patients when they say, I went out and did a two hour ride

1277
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:52,520
today. And it showed me that I spent 45 of those minutes, 45 of those 120 minutes were in zone two.

1278
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:56,120
So I did 45 minutes of zone two. And I say, no, you didn't really do it, because you were going

1279
02:18:56,120 --> 02:19:01,240
up and down and up and down and up and down. And so that's not the same as spending 45 minutes in

1280
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:06,840
the dedicated energy system. You're right. And if you I mean, when I look at training peaks, you

1281
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:12,600
know, like you see the elite athletes, they're like, both power output and heart rate, this is

1282
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:18,280
like goes together. Incredible. You know, whereas yeah, you're right up and down, the average might

1283
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:23,160
be zone two, but actually, you're between oscillating zone one, zone three, zone four all the time.

1284
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:28,360
Right. So tell me what's the difference between so if you don't mind sharing, what is your in

1285
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:35,240
watts per kilo, what is your zone to in Colorado, where you're at altitude? Yeah, so I usually go

1286
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:42,280
and and I'm not very good at, you know, like I understand I mean, doing this, but I'm, it depends.

1287
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:52,360
What I'm saying is like, I don't look so much into this, I have done so many tests in my life, I was

1288
02:19:52,360 --> 02:20:00,600
since I was 15 years old, I was using a heart rate monitor, I'm talking about 1986. When the first

1289
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:04,680
card monitors came out. So in other words, you're what you're getting at is you don't like to have

1290
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:09,720
a lot of data when you're doing no, you're going off RPE. And you're not looking at your power meter

1291
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:14,120
or a heart rate monitor, and you're not poking your finger when you're done. I do it here and there,

1292
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:18,760
you know, because I still want to look at this and I do metabolic testing here and there. Right. But

1293
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:26,200
I've done so much on me, since I was 15 years old, and I was obsessed by this. Now I got to a point

1294
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:33,960
that I know my, my, my body quite well, where I can just go by the sensations and, and, and but here

1295
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:39,320
and there I double check. But it's hard for you to then get at what I've observed the few times

1296
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:46,040
I've tried to do my zone to at altitude, like in Colorado. Yeah. It's an enormous discount. I feel

1297
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:53,000
like it's a 20% discount at altitude. Yeah, I tried to go like around, yeah, mine's around 2.5,

1298
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:01,320
2.8 something that was per kilogram. When I, when I do it, and I, you know, like, about 120. So at

1299
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:07,000
sea level, at sea level, you'd be over three probably, based on what I experienced going into

1300
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:16,120
the first. I would say roughly. And one thing that I'm very proud of is that I have been doing,

1301
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:21,400
because I do sporadically this testing and in all my PRs, because I think we have climbs here and

1302
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:28,040
one day I go, I'm going to go for this climb. And I go full out on that climb. Right. And I'm 50 now.

1303
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:37,640
And I have the same metabolic parameters there when I was 40. So to me, I'm very proud of this

1304
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:43,000
because when you say parameters, you don't mean times up the climbs, which parameters are the same.

1305
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:51,480
Yes. So I look at, you know, lactating power output. Okay, I look at VO2. I look at time as well,

1306
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:56,680
you know, the PR that I had, it was similar. In five the other day, I beat my PR. What's your

1307
02:21:56,760 --> 02:22:06,840
VO2 max now? So my VO2 max now is four liters per minute. You know, so that's about 51, 52.

1308
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:14,200
Okay, I was going to say your weight. But you could easily raise that if you lost, you know,

1309
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:18,280
three kilos, which you could probably do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And the thing is because I

1310
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:26,040
obviously when I was a cyclist, I was 141, 143 pounds. And you were probably your VO2 was five

1311
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:34,680
and a half liters or something. It was 76.7. So that's, let me see, it was 4.5, I believe,

1312
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:44,920
between 65. Yeah, it was about 4.8, something like that. So now, you know, like 40 years later,

1313
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:52,600
30 years later, right, I have decreased only about 0.5, 0.7. Right? Which, well, I'm really

1314
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:58,440
happy about that because I'm not training like I did. But this is one of the parameters, but in

1315
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:05,080
a decade, I haven't decreased my parameters. So this is to me, it's a proving point to myself,

1316
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:13,560
at least that doing this routine, it helps to maintain, you know, that metabolic health that

1317
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:20,680
you had a decade ago. Now, can you do this 10 more years? And when it turns 60? I don't know.

1318
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:28,200
But what I know is that from others, I'm seeing it. So I see the typical person who just retired,

1319
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:36,200
or as I discussed earlier, as prior to pre-retire at the age of 60 or a little before. In the moment,

1320
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:41,320
they are, and these are like people like us, we are struggling to squeeze in time, you know,

1321
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:48,360
and do five hours a year, six hours a week a year, or 10 at max. But then they have the whole time in

1322
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:55,720
the world and they can sleep in, they don't have, they're not overworked, you know, they can

1323
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:04,120
exercise. It's unbelievable and super inspiring how much they improve in their 60s. I've seen

1324
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:13,480
people in their 70s with the metabolic parameters of people active, morally active in their 30s.

1325
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:21,400
I saw the world champion in the cycling who's 81 in the category of 80 to 85, believe me,

1326
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:27,720
there's a category of that, whose metabolic parameters were those of someone in their 30s,

1327
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:34,360
healthy, active. So this is incredibly inspiring. Then I think that we're rewriting what's been

1328
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:40,840
taught to us in the books. Now, in fairness, was that person of an elite athlete, were they a

1329
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:47,560
professional athlete in their 20s and 30s? Never. And this is what struck me. He was a smoker,

1330
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:53,960
hypertensive, and he started cycling because he needed to change his lifestyle in his 40s.

1331
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:58,520
Because that's the same question, like, whoa, you must be doing this all your life. Like, no,

1332
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:03,400
I started writing my bike when I was in my 40s. I was a smoker, I was heavy, I was hypertensive,

1333
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:11,320
like, what? So it's incredible that 40 years later, he's in a better health than when he was.

1334
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:17,720
But I'll tell you what I take away from that as well is the benefits and the importance of

1335
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:23,320
compounding. You see, you alluded to it earlier, and I think the listener could be forgiven if

1336
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:29,480
they missed this point. You can make relatively quick changes in your glycolytic efficiency.

1337
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:38,760
You can take an untrained person with a VO2 max of 20 mils per gig per minute,

1338
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,600
mil per gig per minute, and you could take them from 20 to 30 in a period of months

1339
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:53,640
with the right amount of training, a 50% improvement in a few months. It's very

1340
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:59,160
difficult to see a 50% improvement in mitochondrial function in a few months.

1341
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,720
And you've already made this point, but I just want to restate it because it's important to

1342
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:10,760
set expectations. And it speaks to why this level of training should be thought of in the same way

1343
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:17,400
that you think of accumulating wealth, which is you've got it. It's day in and day out, day in

1344
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:26,440
and day out, small compounded gains over years and years and years is why a 40 year old

1345
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:33,960
overweight smoker can become a world champion at 80. It's because he probably never once again got

1346
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:39,720
out of shape in that 40 years. Absolutely, absolutely. And this is incredibly inspiring.

1347
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:45,880
When I see these people in their 60s just retired, and they come to do their first test,

1348
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:52,440
and one year later they come back, it gives me the goosebumps because it is like, oh my gosh,

1349
02:26:53,320 --> 02:27:02,360
how can you improve so much? And they're like, look, I'm 64 and I feel strong as when I was in

1350
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:13,640
my 30s. And so this is where we're going to be, and of course no medications, really good state

1351
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:21,240
of mind, which is absolutely key for longevity. Normal diet, they're not as strict with one

1352
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:28,760
days, they eat in moderation, but they can have a little bit of everything, which is also in my

1353
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:35,080
modest opinion, is part of the enjoyment of life, eating what you like in moderation as well.

1354
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:41,880
So it's an incredible inspiring to see all these examples. And in a way where we're rewriting what

1355
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:46,120
we've been being thought for years, that once you turn 40, everything is going down,

1356
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:54,360
you can really, really change. And again, you own your own body, and you can really

1357
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:57,640
take ownership of that and improve it at any age.

1358
02:27:57,640 --> 02:28:01,800
So you mentioned drugs. I want to talk about one drug in particular and maybe some supplements.

1359
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:08,520
You and I have spoken so much about this, and myself and another person are committed to

1360
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:18,600
funding a study that we're going to be doing once we get through the backlog of COVID issues at the

1361
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:28,520
university. But the question really arises around the use of metformin and whether or not there's

1362
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:35,320
sort of a true impairment of mitochondrial function or whether the elevated lactate levels we see in

1363
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:41,560
patients taking metformin is an artifact of the drug itself but says nothing of the mitochondrial

1364
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:47,480
function. Do you have any more insight into this question that we struggle with greatly because

1365
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:54,440
we have some patients who take metformin who receive much benefit from taking metformin,

1366
02:28:55,160 --> 02:29:01,400
but it makes it confusing to interpret their zone two data. And it makes me ask the question,

1367
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:06,760
you know, it's a more important in those patients, it's maybe less relevant, but now it becomes

1368
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:13,000
relevant when we think about using metformin as a geo protective agent, an agent to enhance longevity.

1369
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:21,240
Yeah, that's the thing that we need a lot of research on that, I think, to understand this

1370
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:27,240
better. Now, it's strange that it definitely seems to work in many patients, right? Obviously,

1371
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:33,640
for those ones in the pre-diabetic first stage diabetes is that it's a very good medication

1372
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:39,320
that's been used for a long time with good results. But how about the long term results,

1373
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:46,280
right? We know that metformin inhibits complex one, which is key for mitochondrial function

1374
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:53,480
in the electron transport chain. So we don't know the long term effects of metformin,

1375
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:59,400
right? In longevity, this is where I think that we need more and more and more information as well.

1376
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:07,960
We see, I see like someone showing up with a lactate of 3.5 millimoles at rest. And the first

1377
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:13,000
thing I ask is like, are you going metformin? And me times a yes, and I'm sure you see the same thing,

1378
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:20,040
right? Like, wow. So, so it's definitely an artifact. And why do you see at rest 3.5 millimoles

1379
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:26,040
or 3 millimoles of lactate? And by the way, is there fat oxidation commensurantly suppressed?

1380
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:33,560
Because when you when you metabolically test them on the cart, do you see in that individual a very,

1381
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:40,040
very low fat oxidation? If not, it might suggest that that that lactate level of two or three

1382
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:44,840
millimole is an artifact, but doesn't really speak to what's happening in the mitochondria, right?

1383
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:49,400
And that's a great question. I haven't seen people taking metformin as a

1384
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:57,960
medication, you know, for longevity, for example, for health, what I see people on metformin are

1385
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:02,120
already clinical patients. Yeah. So in other words, it's confound. So of course, they're low,

1386
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:06,760
because yeah, so they're taking metformin in the first place because of their clinical condition,

1387
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:12,600
which is driven by a mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction. So it's difficult to discern,

1388
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:16,760
but I mean, I'm sure you have more experience of people taking metformin.

1389
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:22,120
We do. Yeah, but that's why this study that we're eventually going to get around to doing

1390
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:25,480
is going to be so important because it will answer this question directly.

1391
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:30,680
Yeah. And we can do with the muscle biopsies. And as you say, it's like, does it really

1392
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:35,880
mess up with the whole mitochondrial function or can even like the mitochondrial function

1393
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:42,200
overall override that inhibition of complex one and override other pathways?

1394
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:48,200
I don't think we know the answer to that. Do you have an insight into any other supplements?

1395
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:55,400
There's no shortage of supplements that are out there that are touted as sort of, you know,

1396
02:31:55,400 --> 02:32:01,800
longevity boosting agents and mitochondrial health agents. So the most talked about of all of these,

1397
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:09,800
I think, is the precursors to NAD. So the most common of these would be NR or NMN,

1398
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:16,600
both of which are pretty clear that they are precursors to NAD. There's certainly some debate

1399
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:23,560
about how clinically relevant it is. Do you have a point of view on whether or not taking a

1400
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:31,080
supplement that boosts NAD, at least in the plasma? I don't I still don't know how well it's boosting

1401
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:37,560
NAD in the cell. But nevertheless, do you have a sense of if that is beneficial to the mitochondria,

1402
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:41,640
both theoretically, but more importantly, experimentally?

1403
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:46,520
Yeah, well, that's a great point. And this is like, I don't think we have the answer,

1404
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:53,160
but I think we need to be cautious about how we interpret this data. It's definitely been shown

1405
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:59,560
multiple times that NAD levels, the cellular level or any even mitochondrial level decreased

1406
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:05,560
with aging. Right. Therefore, the whole thing, whoa, if it's low, let's take it. Right. But it's not

1407
02:33:05,560 --> 02:33:11,960
only NAD. I mean, if you look at so many metabolites, you know, in the cellular level,

1408
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:17,800
in mitochondrial level, they're downregulated with aging. Right. The question is, why are they

1409
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:25,080
downregulated? Is because mitochondria, per se, to start out with is downregulated. So it doesn't

1410
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:31,880
need so much NAD because cannot take it. Right. Or other supplements or other metabolites. Right.

1411
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:38,840
So this is this is at least how I think of NAD. It's as we mentioned earlier, it's very important

1412
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:46,280
in glycolysis. It's in redox status, right, to maintain redox. And it's very important in the in

1413
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:52,600
in Israel, three phosphate, two, three biphosphoglycerate phosphate, where NAD is utilized

1414
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:00,840
to convert glycerate three phosphate to two, three phosphoglycerate, but it's depleted. And this is

1415
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:06,120
what the only thing that rescues that is lactate. Right. As we mentioned. Now, taking NAD, is that

1416
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:11,560
going to increase longevity? I don't think so. That's my opinion, because longevity is not just

1417
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:16,920
one supplement or two or three or four or five. It's a compendium on an incredible amount of

1418
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:21,400
things that happen at the cellular level. And I don't think that one supplement. I remember those

1419
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:27,640
days where resveratrol was the thing for longevity. And everybody was not everybody. A

1420
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:32,920
lot of people were buying resveratrol and their studies with mice showing that increased 50 percent

1421
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:37,960
longevity in mice. So therefore, this is doing humans. Well, as you probably know, a lot of

1422
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:42,760
people started to take resveratrol when they were 50 and they're dead now. You know, it didn't

1423
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:47,480
increase. It doesn't increase longevity in humans. Right. Yeah. I mean, and I think, you know, I think

1424
02:34:47,480 --> 02:34:52,680
the data in the mice, we can debate the merits of that. I want to ask you about a theoretical risk,

1425
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:59,160
though. You kind of alluded to it. Isn't there a scenario under which too much NAD could be

1426
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:05,160
harmful? If you had an exist, if you took I don't know if this study has been done, but if you took

1427
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:12,120
cancer patients or patients who had tumors that were undiagnosed and gave them if you boost, if

1428
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:19,480
you doubled their NAD levels, wouldn't you actually favor the tumor's metabolism? Well, in fact,

1429
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:26,040
we have done that pilot study with mice. So the whole thing is like looking at in my area of

1430
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:32,280
research in cancer is cancer metabolism. Right. Yeah. And we know that glycolysis is key for cancer.

1431
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:39,320
And any of these absolutely indispensable to feed that glycolysis, as I mean, as we have

1432
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:47,080
alluded a few times, right. So the question is like, as you say, would NAD increase that

1433
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:55,320
glycolytic rate or glycolytic flux therefore would be favoring more cancer phenotype.

1434
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:01,960
So what we did, we have a pilot study, it's a pilot study, which is we're curious about it.

1435
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:09,560
And we had a few mice, we have an NNF8 mice, four and four. So what we did is we transfected

1436
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:15,160
tumors, we had triple negative breast cancer, it's very aggressive, and it grows very, very fast.

1437
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:22,920
And so one group, we give them just water. And the other group, we give them

1438
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:30,200
ribocyte, which is the NAD precursor, because NAD obviously, as you know, you cannot take it,

1439
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:36,520
you need to take the precursor. And we observed the tumor growth over 23 days. After that,

1440
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:44,760
the IRB at the university, because you cannot have animals with high tumors, right. So it was a flank

1441
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:51,720
tumor, and you need to harvest them. So after, and we were measuring, you know, every five days,

1442
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:58,600
the tumor growth. And we saw in these animals that there was about 15% increase in tumor growth

1443
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:02,280
in the NAD group. So again, I-

1444
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:06,600
And you saw that difference with only four mice in each group?

1445
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:13,000
Yes, it's four and four. But all consistent, you know, we have statistical significance,

1446
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:20,440
even with small four, I mean, there was no cross results. All the four mice, they grew cancer

1447
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:27,400
at a higher rate than in the NAD than the control group. Again, that's where like, obviously,

1448
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:31,080
this is not like a publishable, because we need a more-

1449
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:37,640
Is that a study you'll repeat at a sufficiently powered size?

1450
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:42,360
I would love to. And this is why we just did this pilot study. We had, because we have many mice,

1451
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:46,600
and say, hey, let's give it a shot. And let's see, because there's a lot of hype of NAD. And

1452
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:54,520
we saw this. So we would love to do it at a much higher level, because my question, which might be

1453
02:37:55,480 --> 02:38:02,360
a disruptive question is like, you know, what if you have a small tumor that you're unaware of,

1454
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:09,480
like in the pancreas, or in the colon, or in the lung? Could NAD over time, day after day after

1455
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:15,080
day, could favor that glycolytic flux to that tumor and increase the growth?

1456
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:19,000
In the literature, I've never looked, because it just kind of occurred to me when you had that

1457
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:24,840
slide up earlier, earlier, and you showed the mitochondrial slide. It occurred to me that you

1458
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:30,040
have that lactate escape from the tumor. Hey, this would feed it. But has anybody in the literature

1459
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:36,360
examined this question? It seems like a very common, it seems like a reasonable question to ask.

1460
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:43,000
Yeah, there are a couple studies, I think once a review, it's more of the conceptual level. And

1461
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:48,760
this is what got me thinking like, yeah, this is something that for us working in cancer

1462
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:55,880
metabolism, we look into this, right? Looking at, you know, like obviously, one of the things that

1463
02:38:55,880 --> 02:39:02,520
we have shown is that lactate is an onco-metabolite. Lactate, we have shown, we have a first paper,

1464
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:09,320
and we have like a good six, seven papers more to come. We've been working hard for three years

1465
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:16,680
looking into this. But we saw that lactate regulates the genetic expression of the most

1466
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:23,560
important genes in breast cancer. We're seeing the same thing now with lung cancer. And lactate,

1467
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:30,760
as we keep talking about this, is the mandatory byproduct of glycolysis. And as Warburg saw in

1468
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:37,000
1923, the characteristic of cancer cells, or most cancer cells, is the high glycolytic flux.

1469
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:44,360
But what struck Warburg was not the glucose itself, it was the lactate production. So anyways,

1470
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:51,000
we are showing that it's an onco-metabolite. So if you have a high glycolytic rate in a cell,

1471
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:55,720
you're going to produce a lot of lactate, right? If you cannot clear that lactate,

1472
02:39:55,720 --> 02:40:02,440
it's going to drive self growth and proliferation, as we're seeing. And in fact, we're now blocking

1473
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:09,000
lactate production, both through genetic engineering, as well as DCA, for example. And

1474
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:16,040
we're seeing that cancer growth and proliferation completely stops within hours. So again-

1475
02:40:16,040 --> 02:40:23,560
Now that poses an interesting dilemma, right? Which is exercise would increase your capacity

1476
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:30,840
for clearing lactate in the long term, but in the short term raises lactate. So it begs the question,

1477
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:35,480
in a cancer patient specifically, what's the net impact of exercise?

1478
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:40,440
Yes. So this is what we're working on, the hypothesis, you know, with my colleague,

1479
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:49,880
George Brooks. So he's shown that acute response to lactate, it increases overexpression

1480
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:57,320
about 600 and something genes, I forgot right now, right? All these genes are involved in cellular

1481
02:40:57,320 --> 02:41:03,640
homeostasis and in the benefits of exercise, right? So we know very, very well through his work

1482
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:09,160
that lactate is a signaling molecule. Now, the question is like, we know this at an acute

1483
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:15,160
exposure, which is exercise, you do exercise, boom, boom, boom, you're out. But cancer

1484
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:22,360
doesn't do that. Cancer accumulates lactate, and it keeps accumulating. And this is the main

1485
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:28,840
responsible for the tumor microenvironment, which is acidic. And the more acidic the tumor

1486
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:33,720
microenvironment, the more metastatic the cancer is, and the more aggressive, like the more

1487
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:39,000
glycolytic the tumor is, and this is very well documented, the more glycolytic the tumor is,

1488
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:44,920
the more aggressive it is. And the more lactogenic that is more lactate, the more produces,

1489
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:50,520
the more aggressive it is. Now, why is that lactate accumulating? That's what we need to

1490
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:56,840
try to find out. But we know that that is not acute anymore. It's chronic exposure to lactate.

1491
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:05,880
So can exercise counteract that? When we see that exercise might be beneficial for many patients,

1492
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:12,920
but again, going back to the right intensity, we know the particles which are exosomes,

1493
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:20,040
there are microbesicles in the body, they're main responsible for metastasis. We have seen that

1494
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:25,080
and this is another publication you're going to have in breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells.

1495
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:30,920
We are looking at the protein content and the micro-ironase of those exosomes released by these

1496
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:37,400
cancer cells. It's incredible the information that they have there. If you were to genetically

1497
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:48,600
engineer a molecule that can be injected into a tissue and transfer into cancer, you would

1498
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:53,720
replicate an exosome. It has all the components needed. On the other side,

1499
02:42:54,520 --> 02:43:02,200
muscles also release exosomes. And this could be one of the benefits of exercise as an organ

1500
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:10,440
in the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and many organs. We know that if you have a very good

1501
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:17,320
muscle health, your health overall, the metabolic health is going to be good.

1502
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:24,360
Could you be releasing great exosomes? They're very pro-oxidative, which counter the glycolytic

1503
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:33,080
phenotype of cancer and could those exosomes travel directly to the cancer cells and penetrate

1504
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:38,600
inside the cancer cells and transform the glycolytic phenotype of the cancer cells into

1505
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:46,120
more oxidative phenotype and keep cancer at bay? We don't know yet, but we're suspecting that we're

1506
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:50,600
scratching the surface of something that potentially could be a very interesting

1507
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:54,600
thing to understand better the effects of exercise as well as neurotherapeutics.

1508
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:05,480
The deeper I go in the rabbit hole into all things that relate to longevity, the more convinced I am

1509
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:08,680
that if you're going to rank order things, if you were forced to rank order things,

1510
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:17,000
there's nothing that ranks above exercise as the single most potent tool or agent we have to impact

1511
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:24,520
longevity. And yet paradoxically, in the acute setting, exercise seems to do everything incorrectly.

1512
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:31,320
In the very short acute setting, if you look at it in that narrow context, exercise does not appear

1513
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:36,920
to be neuroprotective. But of course, when you look at the chronic impacts of exercise and what's

1514
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:44,120
taking place after the bouts of exercise, the data seem undeniable. I want to kind of pivot from

1515
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:50,840
exercise a bit into a subset of that, which is something you published this year in long COVID

1516
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:59,880
patients. So we'll link to the study so people can see it, but you demonstrated that in people with

1517
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:07,640
long COVID, even previously healthy people, they basically from a mitochondrial standpoint,

1518
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:13,560
end up looking like people with type 2 diabetes when they're done in terms of fat oxidation,

1519
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:20,920
lactate production. Yeah. So first question for you is what fraction of patients recovering from

1520
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:27,000
COVID do you believe are susceptible to that phenotype? That's a great question and they're

1521
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:34,600
trying to understand that. So everything is started by, you know, National Jewish Hospital is

1522
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:40,040
probably, it's been always with Mayo Clinic competing for the top one immunology hospital in

1523
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:48,520
the country. So you have these people with long COVID who are struggling, you know, they go up

1524
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:53,640
the stairs and they can't breathe. So the first thing they do is they go to different doctors and

1525
02:45:53,640 --> 02:46:00,760
they end up going to this top hospital. So they do, you know, a pulmonary function test and it's

1526
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:08,920
completely normal. Then they, okay, the next species is because COVID also affects the cardiac

1527
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:12,680
muscles, right? So let's just do, let's look at the cardio function is completely normal.

1528
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:20,200
And they're very good at this hospital where they do metabolic testing. They do CPAD testing. That's

1529
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:25,960
how I called medically, right? The physiological testing and even lactate. We've been interacting

1530
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:32,040
with them a few times. So they do lactate as well. So they contacted me and say, look, we're seeing

1531
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:38,520
these patients. We have 50, 25 of them they had previously, you know, underlying conditions,

1532
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:46,680
right? The other 25, they were normal people. And in fact, most of them, they were morally active.

1533
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:53,080
Some of them, they were doing marathons, triathlons, you know, and the average is 50. So they're not,

1534
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:58,840
you know, very old either. So, but their pulmonary function is completely normal and

1535
02:46:58,840 --> 02:47:03,000
cardio function is completely normal. So we suspected there's a metabolic issue here.

1536
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:08,760
So they send me all the information, the raw information. And I apply the methodology that

1537
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:16,120
we've been discussing, right? Looking at fat oxidation and lactate production as a surrogate

1538
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:22,600
for metabolic function and or metabolic flexibility and mitochondrial function. And I was shocked

1539
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:27,960
because they were significantly worse than people with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome,

1540
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:34,680
which could explain why these people cannot go up the stairs and where before they were doing

1541
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:43,400
marathons. Now, what are the mechanisms? We know that viruses, multiple viruses are known to

1542
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:51,240
hijack mitochondria for their own benefit, for reproduction. Could COVID do the same thing? So

1543
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:56,760
I'm just, we are suspecting it. And we're trying to understand that at a more of a cellular level.

1544
02:47:57,400 --> 02:48:04,520
Now, unfortunately, the majority of these long COVID, because as you know, there are people with

1545
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:10,040
long COVID syndromes that within weeks, months, they improve, they go back to normal. But there

1546
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:15,560
are a handful of people that I am assuming they're going to be growing, right? That after one year,

1547
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:21,400
they haven't improved a bit. This is the concern. Like can we do, can we use exercise as a

1548
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:27,320
therapeutic way to stimulate mitochondrial function? If in fact there's a mitochondrial

1549
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:33,000
dysfunction, which is severe, because if that's the situation, it's going to expose these patients

1550
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:38,040
to multiple diseases, right? So this is an area of concern.

1551
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:44,040
And this isn't talked about as much as what I think people initially spoke about here, which is

1552
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:52,520
cardio, like basically myocarditis is what, and now of course we know that the risk of myocarditis

1553
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:59,560
is actually much higher in young males through the Moderna vaccine than it's ever going to be with

1554
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:05,720
COVID. But the rate with COVID is not zero. It's, I believe it's 2.3 cases per,

1555
02:49:07,400 --> 02:49:11,960
gosh, it's going to be a big difference. I think it's 2.3 cases per hundred thousand of people

1556
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:18,520
with COVID are getting myocarditis. Most of those are transient. They recover, not all of them are.

1557
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:23,720
So a subset or not. But this mechanism would be distinct from just myocarditis. Myocarditis of

1558
02:49:23,720 --> 02:49:27,800
course speaks to the inflammation of the cardiac muscle that would explain depressed ejection

1559
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:34,920
fraction. But what you're describing is a far more diffuse problem, which is a global insult

1560
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:40,760
on the mitochondria in the skeletal muscle, correct? Yes. That's what we suspect from this

1561
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:45,480
data, which again is indirect, right? From the indirect colorimetry in the lactate that it points

1562
02:49:45,480 --> 02:49:52,680
out towards mitochondrial dysfunction. So that's what we need to do now, biopsies to understand

1563
02:49:52,680 --> 02:49:59,640
this set up better detail. What the heck is going on, right? Could be at the micro-profusion level

1564
02:49:59,640 --> 02:50:06,200
too. It might not be at the muscle per se, it might be at the micro-profusion, right? In the blood,

1565
02:50:07,480 --> 02:50:12,520
in the capillaries. Meaning something like microthrombosis that are preventing

1566
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:19,000
perfusion and raising lactate that way. Could be, could be, you know, that's where we need to find

1567
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:25,320
out. But we know from other viruses, right? That they hijack mitochondria and they interfere

1568
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:34,440
especially with the fission and fission processes, right? Some causes increase fission, some other

1569
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:41,240
causes increase fission, some other causes increase elongation. So we know there's a wealth of

1570
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:49,080
studies out there from virology showing that, yeah, many viruses and bacteria, they also,

1571
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:57,640
they hijack mitochondria and they disrupted significantly. Now, but most of the times,

1572
02:50:57,640 --> 02:51:05,800
you know, it, like myocarditis, it subsides, right? It's restored shortly after, you know,

1573
02:51:05,880 --> 02:51:12,600
the symptoms are gone. Now why this virus is different, that's what we are trying to understand

1574
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:19,480
why people after one year, they are, and by the way, you know, most of these people, they had just

1575
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:24,280
normal mild course of COVID. They were not hospitalized, they were not in the ICU.

1576
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:32,600
Any evidence or inkling that if people go back to exercising too intensely following recovery,

1577
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:38,920
it could exacerbate this problem? And do you also, yeah, do you have a sense of which strains

1578
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:43,960
this was? This, your work would have been predominantly alpha and not Delta and obviously

1579
02:51:43,960 --> 02:51:50,440
not omicron, correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. This is, this was done with patients over, you

1580
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:57,960
know, yeah, yeah, way, yeah, even a mixture between the original variant and the Delta,

1581
02:51:58,040 --> 02:52:06,040
so not omicron. Yeah. So in this population, which again is presumably mostly alpha, maybe some

1582
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:12,360
Delta, what was the distribution of male and female? So it was about, yeah, we had 35 females

1583
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:19,640
and 15 males, so it was more female predominant. 70, 30, okay. Which again, maybe is too small a

1584
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:23,960
sample to know, that could be more an indication of who's seeking out. And again, we don't really

1585
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:29,640
know the denominator, right? We don't know, we don't know what this represents. Is this one

1586
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:35,560
in a hundred thousand? Is it, you know, we, we, it could be one in a million if this was everybody

1587
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:41,400
that's reporting it at the time. Yeah. Our guess is this, is like, it's a rare event, right? They

1588
02:52:41,400 --> 02:52:48,760
can loss that can last that long, right? But, you know, if, you know, we're talking about

1589
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:53,720
millions of people infected, right? If it's one in a million, right? We're talking about, you know,

1590
02:52:54,040 --> 02:53:00,200
population that is going to need help. Yeah. I want to kind of go back to just a few other

1591
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:06,520
questions that we didn't get to. So not necessarily in any thematic order. What's the relationship

1592
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:13,480
between, or how predictable I should say, is the relationship between zone two as defined by maximum

1593
02:53:13,480 --> 02:53:21,560
fat oxidation and VO2 max. So if you run somebody through a CPET and you figure out that their VO2

1594
02:53:21,640 --> 02:53:31,080
max is at four liters, how, how predictably can you say at X percent of that you will be at maximum

1595
02:53:31,080 --> 02:53:36,200
fat oxidation? That's a very good question. There's another study that we're preparing the manuscript

1596
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:44,840
with 225 subjects where we look at a fat oxidation, VO2 and the relationships. Going back to the same

1597
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:52,280
thing. We tend and historically the research studies with exercise have been done based on VO2

1598
02:53:52,280 --> 02:53:59,400
max. That's been the parameter to prescribe exercise. You know, how many times we read

1599
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:04,920
X amount of subjects, you know, they were exercising for six months at 60 percent of VO2 max or

1600
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:10,680
whatever, right? Now that's another thing that I've been thinking of years. And by the way, when they

1601
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:19,560
say that, do they mean the 60 percent of the heart rate that produced VO2 max or 60 percent

1602
02:54:19,560 --> 02:54:26,280
of the power that was produced that that is their max power at VO2 max? They're there. Yeah. I mean,

1603
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:29,240
there's so many different ways you can do this that I've always found it. Absolutely. You have

1604
02:54:29,240 --> 02:54:34,040
to get into the methodology very closely. I agree. I agree. 100 percent. And this is where I think we

1605
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:40,360
need to dial in things in better, right? Because yeah, 60 percent of the power output, I mean, 60

1606
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:45,400
I mean, the intensity might be translated into power output, 60 percent of you to max and then

1607
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:50,520
you translate into power output or you translate into heart rate, for example, or is it 60 percent

1608
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:58,840
of the VO2? So, for example, if somebody is four liters VO2 at and then they hit that at 300 watts,

1609
02:54:59,800 --> 02:55:06,440
would 60 percent be 2.4 liters, which of course is not a very helpful way outside of a laboratory

1610
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:14,840
to prescribe exercise to somebody, or would it be 180 watts, which is 60 percent of the 300 watts?

1611
02:55:15,400 --> 02:55:22,600
Yeah, exactly. I think that normally the studies they look at, okay, where do you hit 60 percent

1612
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:29,240
of VO2 max? And then, okay, how many watts is this, right? Or what's your heart rate?

1613
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:34,840
What's the wattage that corresponds to 60 percent of your max VO2?

1614
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:40,520
Exactly. So, and in your study, what we are seeing, and this is what, because I've been curious about

1615
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:45,240
this, you know, because we look at the cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise and we look at the

1616
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:52,440
cellular adaptations to exercise. Do they really correspond? Right? We know very well that

1617
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:59,800
with athletes, you know, you can improve tremendously at the cellular level,

1618
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:06,920
but not at all at the cardiorespiratory level, at least based on the VO2 max, which is the

1619
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:13,400
representative of the cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise, right? An example that I always give

1620
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:21,320
when I give talks is like an athlete who used to be an average professional, and the VO2 max was

1621
02:56:21,960 --> 02:56:28,920
72.3 or something like that. And then two years later, he is a very good professional. The VO2

1622
02:56:28,920 --> 02:56:35,240
max is the same, but the lactate levels were incredibly better from like, I forgot, at five

1623
02:56:35,240 --> 02:56:43,080
watts per kilogram. He was at five millimoles and now he's at 1.7, right? So, this is where the

1624
02:56:43,080 --> 02:56:47,000
magic happened to this specific athlete, right? It was at the cellular level.

1625
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:53,240
Yeah. And we see this across the board, right? VO2 max at the elite level does not come close

1626
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:58,680
to predicting performance. Not at all. Not at all. And this is exactly so. This is why

1627
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:06,360
we're putting together this study with all this population of different from people with metabolic

1628
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:13,560
syndrome all the way to the France athletes. So, longitudinally, we see that, yeah, sure. VO2 max

1629
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:20,360
corresponds with fitness in the same manner that watts corresponds with fitness, right? So,

1630
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:27,640
we can also imply that, sure, instead of doing a VO2 max to look at longevity and fitness, we can

1631
02:57:27,640 --> 02:57:33,640
also do a power test or a speed test and a treadmill because we're going to see the same thing. Those

1632
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:39,560
ones who are very poorly active, I mean, they have a very poor fitness. They're going to have a lower

1633
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:44,920
VO2 max. They're going to have a lower power output. They have a lower speed, lower lactic

1634
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:51,480
lens capacity, right? So, VO2 max has been forever a great surrogate, right, for fitness

1635
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:57,240
and cardiovascular fitness and longevity. But we wanted to see if, in fact, it's really that

1636
02:57:57,240 --> 02:58:04,760
specific. So, in our study, we see that people in different categories, right? At the same VO2 max,

1637
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:11,400
they might be in different metabolic states. So, some people at the same VO2 max might be

1638
02:58:11,400 --> 02:58:19,560
oxidizing a lot more fat or a lot more carbohydrates. So, that means that that does not correspond to

1639
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:27,560
the same metabolic status. I would have thought that most people, by the time they're at VO2 max,

1640
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:33,240
are, I mean, they would be disproportionately carbohydrate. So, really, you're just saying how

1641
02:58:33,240 --> 02:58:39,160
much fat oxidation still remains there is really what you're saying. And I'm assuming a very

1642
02:58:39,160 --> 02:58:46,760
untrained person has zero fat oxidation by the time they reach VO2 max, whereas a more highly

1643
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:53,320
trained person would still have some amount. They might still be at 0.2 or 0.3 grams per minute.

1644
02:58:53,320 --> 02:59:01,640
Yeah. And for example, we see that, like a sedentary individual at 75% of the VO2 max

1645
02:59:01,640 --> 02:59:09,880
might be around three millimoles, whereas a work-class athlete at the same percentage of VO2 max

1646
02:59:09,880 --> 02:59:17,880
is about one and a half, right? So, metabolically, they're different. Yet, the VO2 max is the same.

1647
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:25,320
So, if we prescribe exercise based on VO2 max, we might not do things correctly. Exactly. And

1648
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:32,120
the same thing with carbohydrate oxidation. At a 75% of the VO2 max, like a sedentary individual,

1649
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:39,720
oxidize is about two grams per minute, or an elite athlete oxidizes about three grams per minute.

1650
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:49,160
So, that's a significant difference. And we also see that at 50% already. So, this is why

1651
02:59:49,720 --> 02:59:56,040
longitudinally, they correspond quite well. And same thing as fat oxidation. Fat oxidation at 50%

1652
02:59:56,040 --> 03:00:11,160
of VO2 max is about 0.0. Yeah, it's at 75% of VO2 max, 0.23 in sedentary, and 0.6 in an elite athlete.

1653
03:00:11,720 --> 03:00:20,280
So, and then we look at the different intensities. For example, an athlete that can have

1654
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:27,000
at one millimole of lactate within the same group, not just comparing group, but we can see that

1655
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:34,440
someone within a very same group, whatever the category they are, the lactate and the VO2 max

1656
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:42,280
don't correlate. The correlations are sometimes 0.2 or 0.1 or 0.3.

1657
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,880
So, while longitudinally- That's the R squared, you're saying?

1658
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:52,520
Yes. Yeah, so basically, no correlation. Very poor correlation. When we talk about individual

1659
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:58,600
groups, when we look at specific bone parameters, which is lactate with the VO2 max, it doesn't

1660
03:00:58,600 --> 03:01:05,960
really correspond. So anyways, this is what I think that we have learned a lot over these last

1661
03:01:05,960 --> 03:01:14,360
decades, where we can really pinpoint more at the cellular level to improve metabolism more than at

1662
03:01:14,360 --> 03:01:19,400
the carrier respiratory function, which is very important. Absolutely. They both are going to

1663
03:01:19,400 --> 03:01:24,840
improve, right? But I think that if we want to prescribe exercise, it's going to be more

1664
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:32,920
specific. If we look at cellular surrogates like lactate, like fat oxidation, for example,

1665
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:43,560
they're looking at VO2 max or meds. I mean, don't get me into there. That's a very prehistoric,

1666
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:48,040
in my model's opinion, I don't want to offend anybody, but the whole med concept,

1667
03:01:48,680 --> 03:01:54,520
used for exercise, prescription, it's hard to swallow in today's times.

1668
03:01:55,560 --> 03:02:00,920
You know, Inigo, when we think about some of the muscle biopsy data, again, this term of

1669
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:08,120
mitochondrial function, it's such an important part of longevity because it is one of the hallmarks

1670
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:14,280
of aging, is declining mitochondrial function. I usually explain to patients that the type of

1671
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:21,160
physiologic exercise that we're prescribing this zone to exercise is the way to measure

1672
03:02:21,160 --> 03:02:27,800
mitochondrial function. It's both the treatment and the test. But I'm guessing on the cellular

1673
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:32,120
level, there's even more that we can talk about here. So the last thing I really want to talk

1674
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:35,800
about today, because we've been, I know we've been going for a while, you've been generous with your

1675
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:41,960
time. When you get into the omics, when you start to biopsy the muscles, when you start to look at

1676
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:48,440
the mitochondria in a way that we can't do it, you know, in a regular clinical setting, what else

1677
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:54,440
are you seeing that's that's differentiating the healthy from the unhealthy mitochondria or the

1678
03:02:54,440 --> 03:02:59,000
the high functioning from the low functioning mitochondria? Yeah. So there's this again,

1679
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:02,360
I keep talking about papers that would have published, but we've been working for three

1680
03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:08,200
years quite hard. And now we cannot continue doing this, we need to start writing the papers, right?

1681
03:03:08,840 --> 03:03:14,360
You need more postdocs, you need more graduate students and postdocs with the writing.

1682
03:03:14,360 --> 03:03:19,800
But we have completed a pretty cool study and they're writing the manuscript now. Looking

1683
03:03:19,800 --> 03:03:25,160
between sedentary and active, we know already there are a bunch of research showing at the

1684
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:30,440
cellular level, the difference between people with type 2 diabetes or mitochondrial, I mean,

1685
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:36,760
metabolic syndrome and active individuals or even sedentary. We want to see also,

1686
03:03:37,320 --> 03:03:44,440
or want to show that people who are sedentary, they already have problems. And we wanted to

1687
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:50,440
compare them with more active people who should be kind of how we should be as humans, right?

1688
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:55,720
So we looked into the mitochondria, into mitochondria. So we looked at their significant

1689
03:03:55,720 --> 03:04:01,000
dysregulation at the mitochondrial level, everywhere you look in the mitochondria,

1690
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:09,480
in sedentary individuals. You see a decreased capacity to oxidize, to burn glucose in terms of

1691
03:04:09,480 --> 03:04:16,440
pyruvate, fatty acids, amino acids. You see a significantly decreasing electron transport

1692
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:23,560
chain as well, all the complexes. And you see also a significantly decreased capacity in the

1693
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:30,440
transporters of different substrates. So one thing that really caught our attention,

1694
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:34,360
and we think that this is something that we really want to emphasize and hopefully

1695
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:41,560
on us in the future, is that we have identified that there is the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier,

1696
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:47,000
which is, as I discussed earlier, that's the transporter of pyruvate into the mitochondria,

1697
03:04:47,880 --> 03:04:55,480
which is dysregulated already, down significantly down regulated in sedentary individuals,

1698
03:04:55,480 --> 03:05:02,600
compared to active individuals. Then we are matching it with the pyruvate flux, the oxidation

1699
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:10,200
itself. So both the transporter and the flux are significantly dysregulated. What does this mean,

1700
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:16,600
potentially? So that's shuttling all that's going to shuttle pyruvate to the other way it's going to

1701
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:24,200
get in the cell, which is through lactate. Exactly. And also, what are the implications

1702
03:05:24,200 --> 03:05:32,280
of this? So again, these people don't have diabetes or pre-diabetes. This could be a healthy

1703
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:37,400
person who's not active. Exactly. And this is what, unfortunately, this being the model

1704
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:45,080
in most research papers out there, comparing the unhealthy with a sedentary health individual.

1705
03:05:45,880 --> 03:05:51,800
I've been pushing for years that the model should not be the healthy sedentary individual,

1706
03:05:52,520 --> 03:06:01,560
because that is the intervention. As humans, we're meant to walk or to exercise, so we need to look

1707
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:08,840
at perfection to understanding perfection. The intervention of human evolution has been

1708
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:17,080
becoming sedentary. And in fact, I had a hard time to get an IRB to study study, I have a

1709
03:06:17,080 --> 03:06:23,320
hard time with the committee to convince them that using active people as the gold standard

1710
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:29,160
to understand imperfection, that's the way to go. Anyways, what we see is that these people

1711
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:34,120
already, they don't have clinic, but yet they have a significant population. They don't have

1712
03:06:34,120 --> 03:06:38,680
clinical signs. Clinical symptoms, sorry. They're not clinical symptoms. They're the healthy

1713
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:45,960
sedentary individuals. So they don't have insulin resistance, and they don't have

1714
03:06:45,960 --> 03:06:52,520
done regulation of good for transporters. Even hyperinsulinemia, are they hyperinsulinemic

1715
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:58,360
when challenged with the glucose tolerance test? These people, they have no symptoms. They haven't

1716
03:06:58,360 --> 03:07:06,600
reported any glucose tolerance test that is abnormal, normal people. And then they have a

1717
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:15,160
significant disruption in this mitochondria pelvic area. So which might mean that the first door that

1718
03:07:15,160 --> 03:07:22,120
might be jammed is that entrance of pyruvium-type mitochondria. Most of the research in diabetes

1719
03:07:22,120 --> 03:07:27,640
has done more at the peripheral level, if you will, glucose levels, more at the surface levels of the

1720
03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:33,400
cell, the glute IV, the insulin resistance, the pancreas, release of insulin, better cells, etc.

1721
03:07:33,400 --> 03:07:40,280
But what's the fate of glucose once it enters the cell? And this is what we're looking to this.

1722
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:44,680
So the fate is pyruvate, but what's the fate of pyruvate? I just said very well, does it

1723
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:52,120
enter the mitochondria or is it shuttled to or reduced to lactate? So I think that this is

1724
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:58,280
important to see because it could be a marker down the road because again, these people don't

1725
03:07:58,280 --> 03:08:03,320
have clinical symptoms yet they have a significant dysregulation in their glucose metabolism.

1726
03:08:03,880 --> 03:08:11,960
So could this be 10, 15 years ahead of clinical symptoms and insulin resistance? So this is more

1727
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:17,800
reason also to consider sedentary individuals to see how they have a metabolic dysregulation already.

1728
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:23,560
Same thing we're doing at the fat oxidation level. The CPT-1 and CPT-2, the transporters of fat,

1729
03:08:24,280 --> 03:08:29,800
they're significantly downregulated as well. So that means they're not going to be able to transport

1730
03:08:29,800 --> 03:08:36,440
fat very well, which also matches to the fat oxidation itself where we inject fatty acids

1731
03:08:36,440 --> 03:08:42,680
into the mitochondria that are not sedated well. So they all match as well. So they have a dysregulation

1732
03:08:42,760 --> 03:08:47,880
already that is significant compared to motor activity individuals at the glucose metabolism

1733
03:08:47,880 --> 03:08:56,360
and fat metabolism. Then we see that many of these people who have diabetes or metabolic syndrome,

1734
03:08:56,360 --> 03:09:01,160
they have what's called intramuscular triglycerides, the fat droplet, and it's

1735
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:08,600
adjacent right by the mitochondria. And it's a type of that in elite athletes, it's also there,

1736
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:14,120
that fat droplet, but it's very active because about 25% to 30% of the fat oxidation comes from

1737
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:20,760
that fat droplet adjusting to mitochondria, which it could probably is an evolutionary mechanism to

1738
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:25,320
not rely on the adipose tissue, which might take time and have something right away there.

1739
03:09:25,960 --> 03:09:30,200
So when you say it's metabolically active, the difference between the intramuscular fat of the

1740
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:35,960
athlete and the intramuscular fat of the person with type 2 diabetes, is it the flux then in the

1741
03:09:35,960 --> 03:09:41,000
person with type 2 diabetes, it's a static source of fat in the athlete, it's constantly turning

1742
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:48,600
over and being oxidized and replenished. Exactly. Whereas in this population, it continues to grow.

1743
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:53,960
My colleague Brian Bergman from the university is working a lot into the content of what's inside

1744
03:09:53,960 --> 03:10:00,120
this fat droplets. But one thing that we know is like, they're very high in ceramides and

1745
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:05,560
triglycerides. And especially ceramides are key in the atherosclerotic process.

1746
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:14,920
Therosclerosis is obviously it's a hallmark of cardiovascular disease. And ceramides are key for

1747
03:10:14,920 --> 03:10:19,800
this process. Historically, it's been thought and it's been shown that ceramides come from the liver,

1748
03:10:19,800 --> 03:10:24,680
they're released. But we're seeing that these intramuscular triglycerides are high in ceramides.

1749
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:31,640
So could this be a connection between also cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes?

1750
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:37,320
But this is only in the high turnover, high flux one, you're not accumulating them as much?

1751
03:10:37,320 --> 03:10:47,720
Yes. People who end up having type 2 diabetes, they accumulate this fat droplet.

1752
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:53,160
Athletes as well, that's the athletes paradox. But athletes, as you said, they keep turning around

1753
03:10:53,160 --> 03:11:02,760
and it's very active. Whereas in people with type 2 diabetes or obesity, it keeps growing and

1754
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:09,080
releases pre-inflammatory mediators. And it also is high in ceramides, which are key in atherosclerosis.

1755
03:11:09,080 --> 03:11:13,240
So this is where we're trying to establish the connections between type 2 diabetes and

1756
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:18,680
cardiovascular disease at the mitochondrial level as a nexus. Because we know that about 80% of

1757
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:23,240
people with type 2 diabetes, they also have cardiovascular disease and vice versa, which is

1758
03:11:23,240 --> 03:11:29,320
what we call cardiometabolic disease. So could the nexus of all that a mitochondrial impairment?

1759
03:11:30,680 --> 03:11:35,080
That's what we believe. Well, what I take away from this is we'll probably have to do a third

1760
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:41,080
podcast in a couple of years because there's going to be a lot of data that's going to be published

1761
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:44,760
then that isn't published now. There's going to be a lot more questions that we're going to have

1762
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:50,440
answered. Again, I'm still really yearning to understand the effect of metformin in terms of

1763
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:58,440
pure mitochondrial function and performance in a trained individual. So as always, I just can't

1764
03:11:58,440 --> 03:12:04,440
thank you enough for your generosity of insight and look forward to talking tomorrow when we

1765
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:09,240
have a call about some other nerdy stuff we're going to get into. But thank you so much Inigo.

1766
03:12:09,960 --> 03:12:17,160
And also congratulations on the remarkable success of your team and Pagachar, who's an

1767
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:21,320
amazing cyclist to watch. He's got everybody very excited about the Tour de France again.

1768
03:12:21,320 --> 03:12:25,080
Well, thank you very much, Peter, and all the listeners. I really appreciate

1769
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:32,760
what you do. I think that the first time I met you on the first podcast, we were two and a

1770
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:37,240
half hours talking about mitochondria. And I first met, I felt like this guy's crazy. There's

1771
03:12:37,240 --> 03:12:40,520
nobody out there who's going to be interested in listening to two and a half hours about

1772
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:49,240
mitochondria and metabolic health. And you showed me that, yeah, the concepts are out there. And I

1773
03:12:49,240 --> 03:12:55,800
was in a moment where I was kind of, not many people are interested in this. And you were

1774
03:12:55,800 --> 03:13:00,680
already an inspiration for me to continue doing this. And there are remarkable work that you're

1775
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:09,080
doing to educate people and inspire people. It's something that, yeah, it's transformational.

1776
03:13:09,080 --> 03:13:11,800
So I really appreciate the invitation, which is an honor.

1777
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:14,600
Well, thanks for being with us today.

1778
03:13:14,600 --> 03:13:15,400

1788
03:14:03,560 --> 03:14:07,960
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1789
03:14:07,960 --> 03:14:13,240
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1790
03:14:13,240 --> 03:14:18,840
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1791
03:14:18,840 --> 03:14:23,400
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1792
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:28,040
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member only benefits,

1793
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:34,280
you can head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. You can find me on Twitter,

1794
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:41,000
