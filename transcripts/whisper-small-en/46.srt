00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,000
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Chris Masterjohn. I've known

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,360
Chris for probably about six or seven years. He's an incredibly bright guy and we've been going back

47
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,200
and forth over the past several months just trying to figure out a date when we could get together.

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,800
And I knew this was going to be an exciting episode. I also want to preface this by saying

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,080
this may rank among one of the more technical episodes that we've done. And that's probably

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,160
saying a lot given our podcast. So this is definitely one where the show notes are going

51
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,840
to be helpful. So Chris earned his PhD about 10 years ago in nutrition science. And after a brief

52
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,360
stint as an academic, he has largely devoted himself to creating just a vast wealth of information

53
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,960
for people to help them understand so many aspects of nutrition. I have learned so much from Chris

54
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,320
over the years. And I must say I probably learned more on this podcast than I learn on many of the

55
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,480
podcasts that I host. Although I do like to learn something on every podcast and think that I do.

56
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,720
What do we talk about? Well, we talk about a ton of stuff. We kick this episode off by going deep

57
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,040
on choline. Choline deficiency is something that as Chris explains predisposes us to a whole bunch

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,520
of bad stuff, not the least of which is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which if you've

59
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,680
heard me rant on this before, you realize is an enormous epidemic and is in fact on pace to become

60
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,640
the leading cause of liver transplant in the United States. Of course, that leads us into a

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,400
lengthy discussion of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and also a detailed discussion about the

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,560
different types of fats and how they may predispose us to different types of illnesses. We also get

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,040
into a topic that I get asked about all the time and I have purposely not gone into this in detail

64
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,280
because I've known that I want to have Chris on and I want to discuss this with Chris. And those

65
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,000
are the enzymes MTHFR and COMT. I get asked tons of questions about these and many of you ask

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,080
questions about methylation. They're great questions and I think it's safe to say virtually

67
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,920
every question you have on the topic of MTHFR methylation will be addressed here. We save the

68
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,040
best for last. And again, many of you have asked this question, Peter, what is your view on

69
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,640
nicotinamide riboside or NMN or NAD, Sirtuin activators, all of these things. Now we talked

70
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,640
about this stuff in pretty good detail with David Sinclair on one of the previous episodes. We go a

71
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,880
little deeper here and in particular that's because since the episode with David Sinclair,

72
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,360
there has been a little bit more research that's been published and we go really deep on some of

73
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,920
those papers. So I would say that by the time you're done with this episode, you will have

74
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,480
as much information as one could say is available on the use of supplemental products that contain

75
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,840
NR or NMN. So obviously the two of these that are most commercially known are Elysium's basis or

76
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,080
Chromadex's true nyogen. Again, I want to just say this episode is a little more technical than most

77
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,240
of our episodes. And again, I acknowledge the irony of that statement. That means it's really

78
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,680
technical. The show notes will be helpful. There may be parts of this that are more interesting

79
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,480
to you than others, although personally I found every minute of this to be like drinking from a

80
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,680
fire hose and truly learning this stuff. You can certainly find out more about Chris and his work

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,080
on his site, which is chrismasterjohnphd.com and that's basically spelt as you would expect it to

82
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,760
be. John is J-O-H-N. Chris is very active on social media, loves to interact with people.

83
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,320
So if you haven't heard about Chris prior to this episode, I suspect you'll become a fan of his

84
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,920
going forward. So I hope you'll enjoy my interview with Chris Masterjohn.

85
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,240
Hey Chris, thanks for trekking in, man. Thanks for having me, Peter. It's good to be here.

86
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,520
Yeah. So you said you've moved. You're no longer in Brooklyn, right? I moved to Astoria. So pretty

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,080
close by. Yeah. It was probably a quicker trek here from Astoria than Brooklyn, I think. Yeah.

88
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,320
It just has less cache, right? Like Brooklyn is so cool. Well, yeah, maybe I would have wanted to

89
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,600
spend more time in Brooklyn, but like, no, just geographically Astoria is more on the edge. Yeah,

90
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,960
it's a heck of a lot easier. Closer to the river. Yeah, yeah. And where'd you grow up?

91
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,680
So I was born in Queens actually. I kind of came full circle back, but when I was 10 months old,

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,280
my family moved to Massachusetts. So I grew up in a small town that almost no one has ever heard of

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,880
that wasn't big enough to have its own high school. And-

94
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,040
Impressive. So not Framingham? No, no, about an hour and a half west of Framingham.

95
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,400
And no accent? Yeah. You can do it on demand? No, just too far away from Boston.

96
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,200
Got it. And what did you study in college? I know you're, we'll talk about your PhD

97
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,680
because it's so interesting, but what did you study in college?

98
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,720
In my undergrad, I studied history. Okay. I focused on completely irrelevant things to

99
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,840
medicine and nutrition, like medieval church history and early American revolutionary history.

100
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,400
I originally wanted to be a social studies teacher. And so in my vision, I was majoring in

101
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,960
whatever was the most efficient way to get an undergrad that would be relevant to being a

102
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,160
social studies teacher. I just had such profound experiences with health in my last year or two

103
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,560
that I, by the time that I was in my last year, I completely changed my mind, decided I wanted to

104
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,160
go to medical school, but I had to finish my degree. And then in order to go to medical school,

105
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,880
which I didn't wind up doing, but in order to go to medical school, I had to take years worth of

106
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,800
undergrad science classes to get the basic prereqs. And while I was doing that, a combination of

107
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,520
my colleagues, my teachers, me falling in love with biochemistry and molecular biology and all

108
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,480
the little invisible things that we couldn't see. And also me starting to come up with my own

109
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,760
scientific hypotheses that I knew no one would ever research them unless I did all of that just

110
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,280
kind of combined to make me decide to go into research instead of medicine. So I think

111
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,080
what I really wanted to do is take my own experiences and pay them forward in some way.

112
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,320
And I think the best way that I can do that is by using the creative part of my brain to really

113
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,680
immerse myself in the research and come up with new ideas. Yeah. And it's funny, I think I've said

114
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,000
this before, maybe on the podcast, but if I haven't, I know I've said it elsewhere. I always

115
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,520
think the worst thing you can do is do an undergrad what you're necessarily going to

116
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,360
do in graduate school. So if you're going to go to medical school, I've never really understood

117
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,880
the logic of studying premed. I mean, I understand the logic, but I think if you can stomach it,

118
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,120
it's better to do something completely different. And then, and similarly, when you're doing your

119
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,360
PhD, I mean, sometimes you don't have a choice. If you want to do your PhD in aerospace engineering,

120
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,120
you have to do something that approximates engineering as an undergrad. But yeah,

121
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,320
your story is pretty interesting in that regard. And I suspect you're in some ways better off for

122
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,080
having done something totally different. If nothing else, it gave you, I suspect kind of a

123
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,600
fresh enthusiasm for what you were studying in graduate school. Yeah, I think for sure. And I

124
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,080
also think to some degree, I actually bring my history mind with me. So I think one of the things

125
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,720
that we often neglect in science is we get so caught up in the latest research that we forget

126
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,360
to study the foundations of where things came from. And so my instinct is always to say, well,

127
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,280
where did this idea come from? What was the origin of this? And that inevitably leads to finding a

128
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,280
fresh way to look at something because you realize that the path that led you there, that there were

129
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,320
details that got left behind because no one knew what to do with those details at that time. But

130
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,920
then 70 years later, oh, now that little detail that we forgot actually makes sense now. And you

131
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,520
can start to just get a fresher perspective than you would have if you only look at what's been

132
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,080
done over the last 10 or 20 years. When I was thinking about us sitting down together,

133
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,320
I was having a hard time figuring out where I wanted to start because I also I realized we run

134
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,440
the risk of once we start on a topic, it's possible we will never get out of said topic.

135
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,400
But there really are several distinct things I want to get into with you. So I actually did

136
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,320
something I don't often do, which is I made a bunch of notes and these notes are going to

137
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,720
kind of keep me honest because they're going to at least remind me of major themes. I've used

138
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,240
different fonts and highlighted things I do. I've really nerded out on this.

139
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,440
Why don't we start with something that you and I have spoken about probably six, seven years ago,

140
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:43,880
which is Colleen. And I think the context in which it came up was when a paper came out of Cleveland

141
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,800
Clinic, I believe it was Stan Hazen's paper that looked at TMAO and it got a ton of attention. And

142
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:57,240
the thesis was this TMAO thing is the arch enemy of your arteries and you're going to get atherosclerosis.

143
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,480
And diets that are high in Colleen are predisposing to this. And I remember you, me,

144
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,760
Stefangayne, Chris Kresser, we were talking a lot about this because certainly at the time

145
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,200
something didn't make sense to me. So we first encountered each other, right? Yeah, I don't know

146
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,720
if it was the first time, but it was certainly early on. Yeah, the first real email discussion.

147
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,200
That's right. Yeah, we had this huge email thread and I couldn't wrap my mind around

148
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,760
how could this be true if the epidemiology, which I'm not a fan of epidemiology, but in the

149
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,120
contrapositive, it can be quite helpful, which is every epidemiologic assessment of people who

150
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,000
consume high amounts of fish would suggest the exact opposite. And yet this paper would suggest

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,400
that there's nothing you could do worse than eating fish outside of Colleen laced sports drinks. So

152
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,640
let's go back in time to that whole thing. So let's start with what is Colleen? Colleen,

153
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,680
you could look at it from a health perspective or a chemical perspective. Yeah, let's start

154
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,400
chemically. Let's just say, yeah. So Colleen is a methyl donor. Colleen is an essential part of

155
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,200
acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter. And Colleen is an essential part of phosphatidylcholine,

156
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,640
which is a phospholipid that is in our cell membranes. And I'm just going to, because I know

157
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,800
just half of our listeners will know exactly what you just said and half of them won't. But because

158
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,920
we're going to come back to these terms so often, what's methyl? What is a methyl group? So I think

159
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,120
the easiest and simplest way to think of a methyl group is to come back and look at the fact that

160
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,360
we are biological organisms. All biological organisms are made of hydrocarbons. And if you

161
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,960
look at any molecule in our body, it's mostly a string of carbons. And if you want to synthesize

162
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,960
one of those molecules or you want to change one of those molecules, you're going to have to put

163
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,440
together carbons or take them apart. And you can either put together carbons in two carbon units

164
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,240
called acetyl groups, or you can put together carbons in one carbon units. And that one carbon

165
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:56,120
unit is a methyl group. And if you just think about it very simply, if you had a molecule with

166
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,160
an odd number of carbons, you'd have to put a methyl group in there sometime because two plus

167
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,520
two plus two plus two never makes an odd number. Or you might have a molecule that has something

168
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,720
else in it like a nitrogen and it's got three carbons attached to it. Well, the only way you

169
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,200
can do that is methylate that nitrogen three times. Right. So we use the term methylation

170
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,600
as a verb to say, to put on a methyl group, right? And we'll talk about that so much. And in fact,

171
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,680
the methylation is also called the one carbon metabolism. So a methyl group and a one carbon

172
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,120
is identical. Okay. So we've got this idea of choline plays an important role in regulating

173
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,040
how that whole methylation thing works. Choline is relatively abundant in certain things that we eat,

174
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,200
right? Yeah. If you look at the diet, you see enormous amounts of choline and liver and egg yolks.

175
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,880
And then you see moderate amounts of choline and many other foods. Most of those foods that are

176
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:56,280
pretty good sources of choline, but not awesome sources of choline are meats, nuts, and low

177
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:03,640
carbohydrate, low calorie vegetables, especially cruciferous vegetables. And in fact, we did not

178
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,840
know for the longest time that choline was an essential nutrient in humans. And still,

179
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,600
they started feeding people on total parenteral nutrition and they weren't putting choline in.

180
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,640
I'll explain to folks what that is. So total parenteral nutrition or TPN is something that

181
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,920
is completely given intravenously, but into large central veins. And it's for people who

182
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,280
have such severe pathology in their gut that nothing that you trickle into their gut could

183
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,160
ever give them nutrition. And so you're feeding them through these large veins. And I guess where

184
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,560
you're going to go with this is when you're feeding someone with total parenteral nutrition,

185
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,640
you have 100% control over what they're consuming. And I know where the story is going. It's so

186
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,320
interesting. It can really expose deficiencies that we take for granted. The same thing is true

187
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,840
of omega-3 fatty acids or a number of nutrients that we just assumed no one needed until we fed

188
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,680
them on TPN without that thing. And then all of a sudden something really, really bad happened.

189
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,520
So what happened with the choline deficient TPN folks?

190
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,280
Those folks developed fatty liver.

191
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,040
Which is very counterintuitive, right? In the sense that they probably weren't being

192
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,480
mainlined a lot of fat, right?

193
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,600
Right. But it turns out that because choline is an essential part of the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine,

194
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,600
and because that phospholipid is not just in our cell membranes, but it's also in the membranes of

195
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,880
the lipoproteins that carry fat out of the liver, then if you don't have enough choline,

196
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,360
you can't make the VLDL particle to get triglycerides out of the liver. And we think a lot about

197
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,720
we want triglycerides out of the blood, but we want triglycerides out of the liver too.

198
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,440
First and foremost.

199
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,680
Right.

200
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,320
Yeah.

201
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,560
So if choline is not there, you get fatty liver. That's not surprising in hindsight if you just

202
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,960
look at the animal research, because you go back almost a century and they had basically

203
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,200
done the same thing to animals. So when they started purifying animal diets,

204
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,200
it was almost the same story. They didn't realize these things were necessary.

205
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,560
A bunch of problems happened. They realized the nutrients that were necessary.

206
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,400
And going back to the beginning of the 20th century, what we have is rodents developing

207
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:19,080
fatty liver on the diets until they were able to either put choline in or reduce the sugar content.

208
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,880
But in those animal experiments, what ultimately was shown was that it doesn't really matter what

209
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,200
the cause of the fatty liver is, as long as you have enough choline in the diet or you have some

210
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,240
precursor to make choline, whether it's sugar, alcohol, fat, as long as you have enough choline

211
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,560
in the diet, you can clear those triglycerides out of the liver.

212
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,240
So that's interesting. And it's something I actually wanted to explore with you because

213
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,840
you know, I'm in the midst of writing this book, which I'm so sick of talking about the

214
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,960
fact that I'm in the middle of writing this book. I can't wait to just be done with the thing.

215
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,680
But one of the chapters is on kind of this spectrum of naphyl D,

216
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,320
NASH, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. So in doing that, you know, I went back and had to

217
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,320
look a lot more at the history of who was the first person to describe it. What was that index

218
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,680
patient who first had naphyl D? And it's this sort of funny story of this character who was drinking

219
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,160
something to the tune of like 20 bottles of Coca-Cola a day. You know, he's just mainlining coke.

220
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,840
This is back in the 50s. So you alluded to this a second ago, which is, you know, sucrose plays an

221
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,080
important role in this. Ethanol plays an important role in this. So the question is, if I understood

222
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,440
you correctly, is it safe to say that you take a person, let's just make it clinical, take a person

223
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,880
who has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second.

224
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,360
But with enough choline, you don't have to necessarily restrict any of the substrates

225
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,000
that are predisposing to more fat accumulating in the liver than exiting the liver.

226
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,160
That's what I would believe based on all of the animal experiments that were done.

227
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,840
It baffles me that we don't have human studies addressing exactly that. I mean,

228
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,080
we have human studies that if you put people on a, if you take what the average person is eating

229
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,680
right now, and then you put them in a controlled lab environment and you take the choline out of

230
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,840
their diet, nine out of 10 of them will develop fatty liver disease. And by the way, does it

231
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,240
progress from fatty liver to the NASH variant where you actually start to see the inflammation,

232
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,640
or is that not necessarily a place that they progress to? Is it just the accumulation of fat?

233
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,440
In those days, you're looking at short term development of statosis and which is just the

234
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,880
simple fat accumulation. Based on how I understand the physiology of fatty liver disease,

235
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,320
what you would expect is that putting a bunch of fat in the liver is kind of like building the

236
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:46,840
kindling for a fire. So you build the fire and you don't light it. Then that person at some point,

237
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,680
they might not ever light that fire. But all it takes after all that kindling, what is put into

238
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,840
place is some hit of inflammation or oxidative stress that suddenly lights that up on fire.

239
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:05,160
And in the literature, that's called the two hit hypothesis of fatty liver. So what you presume is

240
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,600
not that statosis necessarily leads to statohepatitis, but that you can't develop statohepatitis

241
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,400
without statosis, right? So it just puts you now into this new category where there's a fairly

242
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,880
high probability that that will happen. But the point I want to make with these acute studies is

243
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,840
we know that the average person walking around that out there who doesn't have fatty liver,

244
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,520
they don't have fatty liver because of the choline in their diet, not because they're consuming

245
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,800
a paucity of the things that are uniquely fattening to the liver. The two most obvious being

246
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,240
fructose, ethanol, or highly abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids, things like that.

247
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,560
Well, it's both. But what I'm saying is in these studies that were done, I believe this was Steven

248
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,760
Ziesl's group, who's one of the main choline guys. They just took people randomly eating

249
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,760
whatever they were eating and they didn't have any fat in their liver. And then they put them on

250
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,320
this experimental diet where they took the choline out of what they were already eating. So they

251
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,520
probably were eating some sugar. They were probably drinking some alcohol. I don't know

252
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,600
exactly how much. But the point is if you're out there walking around without fatty liver,

253
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,400
and you can see this in the TPN too, like those people at some point in their history didn't have

254
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,120
fatty liver. They went on the TPN, they got fatty liver, but you don't have to put them on TPN. You

255
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,640
can just put them on a low choline diet. And if you look at all the animal experiments, what they

256
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,640
show is you can cause fatty liver with sucrose, you can cause fatty liver with alcohol, you can

257
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,720
cause fatty liver with fat. And no matter how you cause it, you just put in choline or you put in

258
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,280
things that can be precursors to choline and any of them at a high enough ratio with the other

259
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,880
things that are producing the fat in the liver, we'll get rid of the fatty liver.

260
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,360
So if we know in humans that you get fatty liver when you take the choline down,

261
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,960
and we know in animals that you get rid of fatty liver, if you put the choline up,

262
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,240
then I would think that if you took the humans with the fatty liver and you put the choline up,

263
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,400
you'd get rid of it. But for some reason, that hasn't been tested the way you'd think it would be.

264
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,960
Do you have a sense of how much choline is required in that situation? So if you took a patient who

265
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,400
unequivocally had fatty liver disease by say MRI, so we take the gold standard and we could

266
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,480
actually measure, you know, 20% of their liver was now made up of fat. And they were on, let's

267
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,960
say they were not on an especially restrictive diet. So they weren't someone who was avoiding

268
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,000
eggs or anything like that. But presumably, they weren't having enough. How much choline

269
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,840
would you guess you'd have to put in the diet? And would you be able to achieve that through

270
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,240
eating more foods rich in choline? Or would you actually need to supplement it?

271
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,960
I can only give you a wild guess. And my wild guess would be about 1200 milligrams of choline.

272
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,200
And you could get that by eating food, but it would be very difficult.

273
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,360
So how many milligrams of choline in an egg?

274
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,560
130.

275
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,680
You don't know how many eggs I eat.

276
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,520
How many eggs do you eat?

277
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,560
No. Well, I have chickens.

278
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,680
I had four this morning.

279
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I could easily eat six eggs a day.

280
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,440
You can do it, but it's hard and you'd have to design the diet to do that, right?

281
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I'm basing that on a couple things. One is there are human studies where it has been shown that

282
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,200
some people require 1200 milligrams of choline a day. And those studies are not looking at liver

283
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,200
fat. They're looking at other markers. But people who have a genetic predisposition to need what we

284
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,880
know is the highest choline requirement that a human can have is about 1200 milligrams.

285
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,360
The other way I base that is that it's been shown with labeling studies that in, if you take a

286
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,480
random sample of people with NASH, which is the stahedohepatitis, they have inflammation too.

287
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,080
If you take those people and you look at their triglyceride export, it's reduced by 75%. So if

288
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,040
it's 25% of normal, then I look at that and I say, well, you probably want to quadruple the ability

289
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:49,320
to export triglycerides from the liver. And it's my guess that although the adequate intake,

290
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,920
which is the replacement for an RDA when you don't have enough evidence for choline is higher,

291
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,920
I think the average choline intake is probably somewhere around 300 milligrams.

292
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
What's the RDA for choline?

293
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,800
It depends on men and women. I might be wrong on this, but I think it's around 500,

294
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,760
but it's a little bit higher for men. It's a little bit lower for women. I don't remember

295
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,360
the exact numbers. The funny thing with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is it's hard to

296
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,800
know the rate at which it is increasing because like many things, it was so likely underdiagnosed.

297
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,600
In the book, I'm actually writing about sort of the first patient I saw that likely had it.

298
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,280
And it was during a case when I was a resident and we were operating on this guy and prior to

299
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,200
surgery, I had done all the usual things and tried to figure out how much alcohol he drank,

300
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,800
which you do with every patient because you need to understand what their requirement for

301
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,960
benzodiazepines is going to be and if they're going to have withdrawal in the perioperative period.

302
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,120
And this patient claimed he didn't drink any alcohol and I believed him. And then we got in

303
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,840
there and operated and his liver looked like a fat and duck liver. And I remember thinking,

304
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,800
I can't believe this guy lied to me. But after the fact that I went back to him and I said,

305
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,840
look, I'm not here to judge you. You got to tell me how much you drink. And he's like,

306
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,520
doc, I don't drink anything. And I sort of forgot about the whole thing until 10 years

307
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,240
later when I realized, oh my God, that was naffoldy. What year was that? 2001.

308
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,840
So in 1980, the Mayo Clinic published a paper in which they coined the term

309
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,080
Nash, which came before naffoldy. And they coined it because of that. If you read their paper,

310
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,480
their rationale is we have doctors that are seeing fatty liver. They assume that fatty

311
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,840
liver happens because of alcohol. The patients are telling them they don't drink alcohol and

312
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,440
they're saying, you're lying to me. And the best thing that can come from that is an argument.

313
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,560
And there could be worse. Part of it was that it facilitated the growth of a whole body of research.

314
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,080
But the other part of it was it allowed doctors to have a way of thinking and talking about the

315
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,880
person who says that they don't drink alcohol and yet they have fatty liver.

316
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,720
Right. They have a liver that for all intents and purposes looks grossly just like that of

317
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,080
someone who is about to kill themselves through a lot of alcohol. Now, Ron Bucetil, who certainly

318
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,120
one of the preeminent liver transplant surgeons in the world said, and this is probably about

319
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,120
four years ago, in the year 2000, something like 1% of liver transplants were being done for

320
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,120
naffoldy predispose. Nobody needs a liver transplant if they have naffoldy. But if you

321
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,760
get naffoldy, Nash and cirrhosis, you do need a transplant. And that amounted to 1%.

322
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:28,600
And in I think about 2013, 2014, he predicted that naffoldy, Nash, cirrhosis was going to be the

323
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,840
leading cause of liver transplant by the year 2030 in the United States as a result of two things.

324
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,840
One, the sort of undeniable increase we were seeing in naffoldy and of course, the success of treatment

325
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,600
for both hep B and hep C. So it's both those things coming down and the other one going up.

326
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,480
So my question to you, which I apologize for how long winded it is,

327
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,320
even if we are over diagnosing it today or seeing it more than it was there before,

328
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,600
it seems hard to deny that naffoldy is more prevalent now than 20 or 30 years ago.

329
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,480
Would you agree with that? Yeah, I think even though you can't track the prevalence over time,

330
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,840
you can assume that the prevalence has increased over time matched to obesity because that's the

331
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,320
overwhelmingly predisposing risk factor. So do you believe that it is more driven by

332
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:23,080
a fat accumulation in the liver problem or choline being less prevalent in our diets and

333
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,600
therefore more of a clearance problem? It's hard to make an either or question about it because

334
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,280
it comes down to fat in versus fat out and choline is such an overwhelming factor in the fat out part

335
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,960
of the equation. But I think the reason that it's increasing over time, if you had the data,

336
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,440
I really doubt that you could show that there's been a linear decrease in choline intake over

337
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,240
those years. And I think you probably could show that there was a fairly linear increase

338
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:58,040
in naffoldy over those years that tracked with obesity. And I think you can look at it like

339
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,080
what's the percentage of people with obesity who have fatty liver or what's the percentage of

340
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,960
people with fatty liver who have obesity. And I might have these numbers backwards, but I think

341
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:15,400
it's 67% of people who have obesity have fatty liver and 76% of people who have fatty liver have

342
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,880
obesity, something like that. And I think the overwhelming reason for that, and I don't think

343
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,280
it's the only reason, but I think the overwhelming reason for that is that the more obese you are,

344
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,840
the more likely you are to have visceral adiposity and the visceral fat pad directly

345
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,440
empties into the portal vein. And so is a huge factor in fat in compared to the subcutaneous

346
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,440
fat pad. And I think that that's probably a huge factor and why, again, not the only factor, but I

347
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,080
think that's probably a huge factor and why the metabolic health of someone who has relatively

348
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,800
more visceral fat is so much worse than the person who has relatively more subcutaneous fat is

349
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,720
because you're basically pounding the liver fat all the time. You don't even have to eat anything.

350
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
You're always engaging in the policies. You're always freeing some free fatty acids. And if

351
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,520
you have this gigantic tube going right into the liver, just feeding fatty acids in all the time,

352
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,920
then I think that's the major thing. Now, one of the challenges of studying NAFLD is,

353
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,920
and I can say this with some experience because I used to be involved in an organization that was

354
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,240
funding research in this, is removing the biggest confounder of the reduction of NAFLD, which is

355
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,480
weight loss. So the biggest challenge is, so let's say your hypothesis, and I think fructose is

356
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,360
overwhelmingly on a molecule for molecule basis, probably one of the greatest drivers of NAFLD,

357
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,800
when you take fructose out of the diet, very often a person is going to lose weight,

358
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,280
either through some reduction, you know, spontaneous reduction in intake or some other thing.

359
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,920
So it's hard to then say, well, with fructose elimination, you're ridding yourself of NAFLD,

360
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,840
you're dramatically reducing it. And how much of that was due to the fructose reduction? And how

361
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,640
much of that was due to the weight loss? Are you aware of any data that have done a great job at

362
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,320
trying to disentangle those two? And it doesn't necessarily have to be fructose, but it could be

363
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:20,520
an input issue. So ethanol, PUFA, fructose, an output issue, choline, or the way you describe

364
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,400
it is sort of this in between visceral thing, which is visceral fat tends to decrease when

365
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,880
adiposity decreases. So it's almost like there's a third variable. And it is challenging in humans

366
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,920
to figure out how to isolate each of those. I don't think you can do it in humans. Well,

367
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,240
I think you could do it in humans. I don't think anyone will do it in humans. And I don't think

368
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,320
that there's any data out there that do do it in humans. And I don't think anyone will ever bother

369
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,160
to try to figure that out. Because what that would require would be putting people in a metabolic

370
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,240
ward and feeding them precisely controlled diets. And I think this is a huge point that you're

371
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,880
making that applies so much broader than this discussion. Because whenever people make one

372
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,000
change in their diet, and that changes to the foods in their diet, they're actually changing

373
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,360
like 30 or 40 things in their diet. And they have a hype, their driving idea of what they're doing

374
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,360
is only one tiny part of what they're doing. And so if you look at, say, taking the fructose out

375
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,960
of the diet, well, you know, what's the fructose in most cases, it's a bunch of junk food, what did

376
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,120
they eat instead? Well, either they ate nothing instead, or they ate something different than

377
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,560
that, which was probably better. So the average person who takes fructose out or who takes carbs

378
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,200
out, even if you just go on a low carb diet, well, your ideas that you reduced your carbs,

379
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,360
but actually, you probably increased your protein, you probably increased your choline,

380
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,040
you probably increased your riboflavin, you probably increased a button, you probably increased

381
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,480
your zinc, you probably increased a bunch of different things. And I think that the only way

382
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,920
to make sense out of the human data is to take all of the animal data that does have precise

383
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,840
controls on it and say, you know, not assume that the animal data always matches the human data.

384
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:05,080
But if you can take all the animal data and you can say, wow, everything that is in the human data

385
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,080
makes perfect sense. According to what the theory we get out of the animal data is, then that's what

386
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:18,120
you do. So when we're talking about fructose, when I was in graduate school, I fed rats a 60%

387
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,120
fructose diet. And I was hoping that they would get fatty liver. And I was hoping that I would

388
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,920
actually what I was really- Wait, 60% fructose or sucrose?

389
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,920
Fructose. How can they even digest that? I mean, how do they not just get such severe dumping

390
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,600
syndrome with so much fructose? They might have had a little bit less

391
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,200
digestion because they were a little bit leaner. I was going to say, I mean-

392
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,480
But that's not the point. The point is there are studies out there showing a 60%

393
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,680
fructose diet causes fatty liver. And did you see it in yours?

394
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,120
No. Because you had lots of choline, do you assume? Well, I wasn't trying to have lots of

395
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,440
choline, but in my department, we never fed rats, wear mice on casein diets, which is what almost

396
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,520
every rodent study out there is. Casein being the dominant protein that you would see.

397
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,880
Yeah. But every rodent diet is based on casein almost. I didn't even know why we did this. It

398
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,680
was just tradition in our lab and in our whole department that we never used casein. And later,

399
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,480
I talked to my department head about it and he said, well, I've seen studies showing that

400
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,200
casein is inflammatory in rats and it causes copper deficiency, so we just prefer to avoid it.

401
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,840
So then I look into the amino acid composition of my diet versus the casein diets that everyone

402
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,360
else is using. And it's something like six times more methionine, which is a choline precursor

403
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,640
that has been shown in animals to obliterate fatty liver, something like six times more

404
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:47,480
methionine in my diet. So all of a sudden, my negative finding makes perfect sense with

405
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,760
everything else that I'm looking at. And part of the reason that I have a unique perspective on

406
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,760
this goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning about getting a historical perspective.

407
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:05,160
I was writing a review on fatty liver with my doctoral advisor and I was obsessive about

408
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,000
needing to know the origins of the methionine choline deficient mouse model. So I went all the

409
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,880
way back to the turn of the century. And what they found originally was you could produce fatty

410
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,360
liver in rodents if you fed them an 80% sucrose diet. If the nutrients came from whole foods that

411
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,800
they were using before, like yeast and cod liver oil and things like that. Then when they started

412
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,000
producing chemically defined diets, all of a sudden 50% sucrose was causing fatty liver.

413
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,960
And so then they said, oh, we need to reduce the sucrose. So they reduced it further.

414
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,960
But then people who took those same high sucrose diets at that time showed that you could add

415
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,920
choline, you could add methionine, which is a choline precursor, you could just up the protein.

416
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,480
If you just up the protein, which has methionine, which is a choline precursor, right? If you provide

417
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,640
any of those precursors, it just gets rid of the fatty liver. So I take those things and I look at

418
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,040
the human data and I say, well, that person reduced the fructose in their diet. I believe that's a

419
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,880
contributor because fructose compared to starch is more lipogenic. And in fact, one of the animal

420
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,920
models that you use for fatty liver is called the methionine choline deficient mouse model. Well,

421
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,400
it's not just deficient in methionine choline. Yeah, they have to give them sucrose. It's also

422
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,920
got a bunch of sugar in it and it's got a bunch of corn oil in it. And they have shown that you can

423
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:35,720
reduce the fatty liver if you replace the sugar with starch. So when I look at the human data,

424
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,800
I'm going to say I do believe that reducing the fructose is going to reduce the amount of fat that

425
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:49,160
the liver is producing from sugar. But I also believe that if you did that and you replaced it

426
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,160
with protein, then that was part of the results. Or if you replaced it with vegetables or you

427
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,320
replaced it with egg yolks, those were part of the results. Right. And to your point, it's very

428
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,720
difficult. So when you look at the study that just came out in JAMA two weeks ago, which actually

429
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,040
was the one that way at the beginning I was involved in the funding of, but I had no

430
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,240
involvement in the study whatsoever. I had to read about it like everybody else when it came

431
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,960
out of JAMA, but this is the one that Miriam Voss Emery was the first author on. This is the study

432
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:23,160
that took 40 Hispanic boys with biopsy proven NASH and for eight weeks put them on a virtually zero

433
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,760
fructose diet with no instruction to reduce carbohydrate. In fact, the idea was replace

434
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,720
fructose with glucose to your point, right? Glucose is not going to produce fatty liver in almost any

435
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:42,120
quantity. They saw a 50% reduction on MRI in liver fat. But if you want to be technically

436
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,440
rigorous, they lost three pounds on average. Now, I don't know that the three pounds matters that

437
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,120
much, but I think your broader point is they almost assuredly cleaned up the quality of their

438
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,360
diet in ways that's difficult to measure, even just looking at the macros, because I think it's

439
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:04,440
easy to report the macros in a study like that. Well, carbohydrate content was unchanged. Protein

440
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,960
went down a little, fat went up a little or vice versa, but at the micronutrient level or at the

441
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,440
amino acid level, I just don't think that stuff's being tracked. It would be interesting. Again, I

442
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,440
don't know, and it might even be worth you contacting Miriam Voss who I've met twice and she seems

443
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,720
very collaborative and interesting, and it might be worth understanding what other data they would

444
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,040
have with respect to the nutrient, because I'd be curious to dig further into this point.

445
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,600
Yeah, and if they have food data, if they were collecting, what are they eating for foods?

446
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,200
Well, the food was provided. Oh, I'm sure they could go back. If they have what the foods were,

447
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm sure they could go back and- Yeah, this was a very well-controlled study in that the food

448
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:50,440
was provided not just to the children, but to their entire families. The idea was make it so

449
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,600
easy for the child to be compliant for the eight weeks that they were on this diet, that the entire

450
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,840
family is going to get fed the same food. Yeah, so they have to know what they were providing in

451
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,360
order to estimate the macros, so they must be able to estimate the micros. That would be interesting.

452
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,400
Yeah, I'd like to see that because I remember when I read it, I was really hoping that the

453
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,240
results would come out independent, like that there would be no change in weight, that the kids could

454
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,520
maintain their body weight, and then you could ask the question, could this nutritional intervention

455
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:22,440
alternafoldy independent of adiposity? Okay, so now let's go back to where we started, right?

456
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,520
So you've made this great case for choline and its importance, and I've always found the TPN stuff

457
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,960
to be one of the most compelling reasons because you just don't often get in life a chance to

458
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,120
create a truly deficient model in humans. So now let's talk about this thing called TMAO. What is

459
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,000
it and how did it rear its head into this discussion? And all of a sudden, choline became

460
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,040
public enemy number one. Before these studies came out from the Cleveland Clinic, TMAO was mostly

461
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:59,240
known in being found naturally in fish and in being produced in the gut in very rare cases where

462
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,920
there were people with genetic disorders. And I don't even remember off the top of my head what

463
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,920
those genetic disorders were, but they were feeding them absolutely massive amounts of choline.

464
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,360
And so it was known before that that in those cases of enormous choline loading,

465
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:18,280
some of that choline would be converted to trimethylamine by gut bacteria, and that that

466
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,560
trimethylamine. And actually, the interest was largely in the trimethylamine because the

467
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,960
trimethylamine is the more smelly compound. So this would produce fish odor syndrome,

468
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,280
these people are smelling like fish. So that was what was known about it at that point.

469
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,360
But then in 2011, I think was the first paper, the Cleveland Clinic came out with

470
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,520
experiments, I think in first in mouse, but also in humans showing different things. So in mice

471
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,640
that were genetically engineered to have defects in their lipoprotein metabolism,

472
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:00,440
they showed that TMAO was directly atherogenic. And in humans, they showed that there were two

473
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,600
different papers, the first one looked at choline and the second one looked at meat. But what they

474
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:14,200
were showing was that TMAO levels in humans correlate with heart disease risk. And when humans

475
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:22,280
eat either choline or carnitine, they will metabolize both of those to trimethylamine

476
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:29,480
in the gut and the liver will convert it to TMAO. And so the argument is the TMAO in those humans

477
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,680
will cause heart disease the way that it causes heart disease in the genetically engineered mice.

478
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,640
And if I recall, there were basically three ways that they were suggesting you could get

479
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,320
too much of it. One was too much fish. If you eat fish, you're getting the TMAO directly.

480
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,680
I don't think they mentioned fish.

481
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,320
Maybe I'm confusing it with a different paper, but I thought one argument was too much fish is too

482
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,520
much TMAO, too much carnitine, which is found in sports drinks is going to be converted and too

483
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,800
much choline. So basically any of those three that were too many were problematic. Now maybe

484
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
this was stretched across a couple of different papers.

485
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:09,400
So my recollection is that I brought the fish up because my argument was it's really easy to

486
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,800
just look at this stuff and repeat what we already believed about eggs and red meat being

487
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,560
bad for you. And if you isolate it to that, it kind of makes a clean story, but it makes a really

488
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:27,320
bad story if you bring fish into the equation because fish have so much TMAO that you're

489
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,040
probably literally getting hundreds of times more TMAO exposure when you eat fish than when you eat

490
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,520
those foods. So my point was always, how can you not bring fish into the discussion?

491
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,240
And yeah, so now it's coming back to me. You wrote a piece on this that I think we'll be

492
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,160
sure to link to. I think the reason I had seen this fish issue separately was I was actually

493
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,960
at an advisory meeting for a company that had asked me and a dozen other people a question,

494
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,240
which was, should we be using TMAO as a new biomarker for cardiovascular disease? And so

495
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,440
it was part of this two-day meeting where we're sort of in this room looking at all of the data

496
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,080
that somehow this someone else, and I don't remember who it was, came up with the idea of,

497
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,280
well, wait a minute. I mean, we got to take a step back here. I mean, if fish has more TMAO than you

498
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:26,600
could ever get from all of the red meat and eggs in the world, it converting to TMAO, it just seems

499
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,800
to fail on first principles. Yeah. And there were later papers that happened after those first two,

500
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,800
where there was some observational data showing that people who eat more fish have more TMAO in

501
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,240
their blood. I still get asked about this, I don't know, twice a year a patient will bring in

502
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,560
a copy of that paper. I think it was in Nature or Nature Communications or something like that and

503
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,040
say, oh my God, Peter, like, what do you think about this TMAO thing? And it's just always one

504
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,880
of those things where I kind of eye roll and I just sort of send them a link to what you wrote

505
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,080
or what Chris Cresser and say, go and read this and then come back to me and let's discuss why I

506
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:05,000
am not particularly impressed by this thesis. On a scale of one to 10, I wouldn't say that

507
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,640
my opinion that TMAO has negative properties in humans is zero. I think it's maybe one or two or

508
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,080
something like that. And I'm willing to see what they come up with there. But on a scale of one to

509
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:27,320
10, my view of the overall story that eating eggs and meat are bad for you because they alter the

510
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,760
microbiome in a way that makes you take the choline and the carnitine in those foods and convert it

511
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,360
into TMAO and make you as a red meat and egg eater uniquely vulnerable to heart disease.

512
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm very close to zero on the probability of that story being true. I'm totally open to seeing new

513
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:55,000
studies on the ability of TMAO and plasma to be a biomarker and the potential for maybe eventually

514
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,480
altering the gut microbiome in a way that generates more TMAO. And actually I incorporate

515
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,200
this on a practical level in some cases. So when I'm looking at choline supplements,

516
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,160
I overwhelmingly prefer that someone would get phosphatidylcholine, which is the overwhelming

517
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,360
form of choline that's found in food, for two reasons. One is it's the overwhelming form of

518
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,920
choline found in food. And the second is that it's the form of choline that's least likely to

519
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,240
generate TMAO in the gut, almost exclusively driven because its absorption is better.

520
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Do you dose it milligram for milligram? In other words, if you believe that 1200 milligrams of

521
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,440
choline is necessary. No. And actually that's very confusing on supplements because most

522
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,800
supplements of phosphatidylcholine tell you the amount of phosphatidylcholine in them and they

523
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,120
don't know how much choline is. No, you do. You can estimate that it's about 15%. Just by molar

524
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,840
weight. It's about 50%. Yeah. I mean, it's probably an imperfect number because probably

525
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:51,080
most of the time the fatty acids are different in each molecule, right? So it's just an average,

526
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,320
but it's close enough, right? But directionally then you would want like

527
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,600
nine or 10 grams to hit your 12. It's only practical if you're taking tablespoons of

528
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,320
less than, but you can get food so you could eat eggs, right? Yeah. So eating eggs and eating

529
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,280
foods is the best way to get choline in my opinion. But if I were to take someone in a particular

530
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,720
situation where for some reason they had one or two dietary restrictions in this way that made

531
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,160
them not be able to get choline and you, but they needed choline for these other reasons and you

532
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:28,040
had to supplement, I would do it with less than for those reasons. And one of the reasons is that I

533
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,720
don't know whether the increased TMAO that's generated when you take choline by tartrate

534
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,720
is problematic. Bob, the show notes guy, he sent me a paper that was just recently published where

535
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,840
they fed people 500 milligrams of choline by tartrate over the course of two months. And they

536
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,760
did an in vitro assay on their blood and showed that it was more sensitive to clotting. So it's

537
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,640
the level of that evidence isn't super strong, but it's an indication that maybe having that

538
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:05,160
level of TMAO in your blood is bad. But you cannot get that level of TMAO in your blood

539
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,240
by eating four eggs, which supplies the same amount of choline. How do I know?

540
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,520
Because Steven Ziesl's group did a study looking at plasma TMAO response to eggs. And if you eat

541
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,680
enough eggs, you get a plasma TMAO response, but it's three or four times lower than when you eat

542
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,160
the same amount of choline as choline by tartrate. And it's only anecdotal, but at the time that I

543
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,760
was involved in this discussion around developing an assay for TMAO, it was during that three,

544
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,680
three and a half year window when I was on a really strict ketogenic diet. And I was so, I mean,

545
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,600
relatively speaking, hyper caloric, because I was also really active at the time, I needed about

546
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:44,280
4,000 calories a day. Now, 4,000 calories a day on a ketogenic diet means you are really

547
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:51,080
having to limit your protein and carbohydrate. So I was about 2% to 3% carbohydrate and about 8% to

548
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,360
10% protein and the rest was fat. So it was on a, you know, what we would now call a four to one

549
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:02,040
ketogenic diet. Although I didn't at the time think of it that way. My point is, one of the ways that

550
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,760
I would, I had to make eggs is I couldn't just take 12 eggs and make scrambled eggs. That was too much

551
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:13,400
protein. So I could only eat, you know, I'd have like maybe four whites, eight yolks, and then I'd

552
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,440
have to fluff it with heavy cream. So the point is I was main lining this stuff. And when the lab

553
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,160
was sort of kicking around the idea of developing the assay, I said I had already done some work

554
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,600
with them where we had done like nine blood draws on nine consecutive days under various conditions

555
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:36,280
and they already had the serum. I said, well, let's look at the TMAO levels in there. That should be a

556
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,120
pretty good positive control. And interestingly, I had virtually none.

557
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,200
Hmm. Yeah. Well, in that study that I mentioned, looking at the plasma TMAO response to eggs,

558
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,600
there was enormous variability. And some people didn't really get, I think everyone got some

559
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:59,400
response to six eggs, but there was a lot of variation on the four egg mark. So half the

560
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,160
subjects didn't get any response at all until they ate four eggs. But some of the people got a very

561
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:10,200
significant response to the four eggs, which is what you'd expect based on what the Cleveland

562
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Clinic Group is arguing, which is that the gut microbiome is a big determinant.

563
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,160
Well, and that was sort of my conclusion, which is, again, it was a very deep look into one

564
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,480
individual, me, and that's irrelevant because any one individual is irrelevant. But the thinking was,

565
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,960
I gotta be honest with you, I still don't know what gut health means. Like the concept is so,

566
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:36,520
you know, it's so difficult for me to, in amorphous to describe, but my intuition was

567
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,080
something in my gut was really preventing this from becoming problematic. I didn't know what

568
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:47,080
it was. I didn't know if it could be replicated, but the story seemed a lot deeper than it was

569
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,960
being presented. Yeah. I think one important point is that it's not about how many eggs you eat in a

570
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,880
day. It's about how many eggs you eat at a sitting. So the only reason eggs generate TMAO is because

571
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,240
there's some poorly characterized absorption cap to phosphatidylcholine. And even though it's

572
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,880
better absorbed than the other choline that's sold on the market, there's some cap to how much

573
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,160
choline you can absorb and no one really knows where it is. Where is it absorbed? Which transporter?

574
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,800
Is it an enterocyte transporter off the top of my head? I don't know, but it's gotta, yeah,

575
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:24,200
it's gotta be in the small intestine. Does it come as a single phospholipid or is it

576
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:30,280
esterified in some way? I mean, how does it actually come in from food? You mean how it's

577
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,440
absorbed or how you eat it? So if you're eating a food that's high in phosphatidylcholine,

578
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,160
does it actually show up like the analogous free fatty acid or does it show up more as the

579
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:46,360
analogous triglyceride where you get, say two or three of these bound to a glycerol

580
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:52,920
bound to other fatty acids? Do these things actually show up as free phosphatidyl molecules?

581
00:50:53,560 --> 00:51:00,280
So I believe that most of the phosphatidylcholine in most of the foods is going to be as phosphatidylcholine

582
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,040
that are in cell membranes. I see, okay, no, you've answered that question. Okay, so that's what I

583
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,680
was wondering if it came in a more whole state or if it ever actually showed up like, so first of all,

584
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,800
does it come in through a chylomicron? I assume so. I haven't looked at the absorption pathway for a

585
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:21,400
while, so I might not be remembering the details here, but my guess is that you're going to have

586
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,680
partial hydrolysis of some of the fatty acids and then the phosphatidylcholine is mostly going to

587
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,120
wind up making its way into the mixed micelles and it's going to become probably part of the

588
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:38,200
membrane of a chylomicron would be my guess. Right, but coming in the lumen of the gut,

589
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,720
and I get, probably not even that relevant at this moment, why? I guess I'm just trying to

590
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,880
figure out what the, if the bottleneck is at the enterocyte transporter and that's why you're

591
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,360
limited in how many of these things you can get into the enterocyte, which then on the backside go

592
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,840
into the chylomicron. Right, that makes sense. I mean, back when I was trying to figure this out,

593
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,680
I asked Steven Ziesel about this, who if anyone knows about choline absorption or anything else

594
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:08,280
about choline, it's him, and he wrote back and was like, I really don't know. I assume that there's

595
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,400
some absorption cap in the small intestine. I have no idea what it is. Interesting. So the

596
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,120
choline story is interesting and I think if you look at it overly simplistically, you could say,

597
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,200
well, it's a good guy and a bad guy, but it seems to be more of a good guy than a bad guy, huh?

598
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,360
Yeah, I think so. I mean, certainly from the perspective of fatty liver, that's clear.

599
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:34,440
Yeah, now we don't see, I'm assuming, although I've never looked at this, in people who you would

600
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,160
expect to have huge choline deficiencies, which would be someone who's eating a very strict vegan

601
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,720
diet, right? So by definition, they're not eating any liver, they're not eating any eggs. They could

602
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,640
certainly be eating lots of nuts. Nuts and cruciferous vegetables they could be eating.

603
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,600
Now, but let's assume they're on like the college vegan diet, right? Which is like, you know,

604
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,520
they're eating as much crap as possible that has no animal matter in it. Is there data that would

605
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,760
suggest we would see a higher incidence of fatty liver in that population? I have no idea if that

606
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,520
data is out there. My guess is you probably wouldn't because probably those vegans aren't

607
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:17,080
too fat, but I don't know. And this comes back to your point, which is there's just something

608
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:23,400
about adiposity if it's accompanied by visceral fat that is really stoking the fire. Yeah, I mean,

609
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,320
if you take out all the fat in parts of the equation, then there's just the choline is not

610
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,600
going to matter that much. It's just that it becomes the bottleneck to getting fat out when

611
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,480
you have a buildup of fat in. So what do you think are the role of different fatty acids in this

612
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,560
problem? And I guess we'll just define it for the listener, right? So we sort of loosely

613
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,960
characterize fatty acids as either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. We can further

614
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,960
divide the polyunsaturated into a number of constituents. I always think it's important

615
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,080
that people sort of demystify this stuff and we're so quick to demonize one versus the other. But it's,

616
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,960
as you said at the outset, it's really just a bunch of really fun biochemistry. A saturated

617
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,480
fatty acid is specified by the number of hydrocarbons. The number of carbons it has,

618
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:16,360
that's the chain. So a C8 versus a C12 would have eight versus 12 carbons. But being saturated just

619
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:23,160
means there are no double bonds. Every carbon is fully saturated with a hydrogen. And then of course,

620
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,720
you can finish the explanation for what a mono and polyunsaturated is. Right, a monounsaturated fat

621
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,160
has one double bond, a polyunsaturated fat has two or more double bonds. That introduces a couple

622
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,880
things. So one thing is that whenever you introduce a double bond, you create a kink in

623
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,080
the molecule. So saturated fats are really, you can imagine them as it just being straight and

624
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,680
linear and you can pack them together very well. So saturated fats tend to be solid.

625
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,880
Less saturated fats, fats that are higher in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat tend to

626
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,560
be more liquid. So olive oil is more liquid than butter because it's mostly monounsaturated fat.

627
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,640
If you take olive oil and you put it in the refrigerator and you take corn oil or sunflower

628
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,040
oil and put it in the refrigerator, eventually the olive oil is going to harden and the sunflower

629
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,520
wouldn't. And that's because the sunflower oil is more polyunsaturated and that has even more

630
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:19,160
resistance to packing together. The other thing is that in a fatty acid with two or more double

631
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:25,800
bonds, so polyunsaturated fat, the carbon that's between two of those double bonds is very unstable

632
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:31,720
and it is uniquely vulnerable to being damaged. And we call that damage lipid peroxidation.

633
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:38,680
So that fatty acid is not harmful in and of itself. And in fact, there are polyunsaturated fatty

634
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,000
acids that are absolutely essential for us. You alluded to these earlier, we'll come back to them,

635
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,520
which is the omega three. Right? Well, I know omega six, there are omega three and omega six,

636
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,800
both polyunsaturated, they're both essential to human physiology. But it's also the case that the

637
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,400
more of these that you have in your cell membranes, the more of a liability it becomes

638
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,760
because if you have oxidative stress, if you have inflammation, then all of a sudden those

639
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:09,960
fats are more vulnerable to damage. And it's very, very tricky when you're talking about fatty liver,

640
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:16,200
because there was a human study that was about two weeks long that was published when I was in

641
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:23,640
graduate school. So maybe 2010 or 2009, this was, they showed that over the course of a couple

642
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:30,920
weeks, polyunsaturated fats compared to saturated fats lead to less liver fat. And it was very,

643
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:39,080
they used MRS. So it was, you know, highly reliable data that they had. And if you just take that at

644
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,320
face value, you say, well, there's one study that looked at it in humans, there's a couple

645
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:49,480
observational studies overall, PUFAs are what you want to eat for fatty liver. There's a problem

646
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:58,360
with that, which is that if you have fatty liver and it's mostly PUFAs, you are way more vulnerable

647
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:05,000
to progressing from staetosis to staetohepititis because you have more oxidative targets. Right.

648
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,280
Yeah. So if you look at the animal data, it depends on the model. Generally, you get more staetosis

649
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,600
with longer chain length and more saturation, and you get less staetosis, the shorter chain length

650
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:25,800
or with less saturation. But if you have the staetosis, you have a dramatic increase

651
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:32,120
in the risk of progressing to staetohepititis. However, in the alcoholic model, there are

652
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,200
studies showing that you get less staetosis with saturated fats and with polyunsaturated fats.

653
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:45,160
I think the reason for this is that oxidative stress does not just cause you to go from

654
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:52,680
naphyl-D to NASH. It also can cause staetosis because you get oxidative destruction of the

655
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,240
ABOB particle. And so it's not just choline that allows you to export triglycerides from the liver.

656
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,480
You also need sufficient antioxidant protection in the liver because if you damage that particle

657
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,760
before it ever exports to triglycerides, then you prevent it from doing so. I think the way you

658
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,600
reconcile these different animal models is you say, well, in the alcoholic model, there's so much

659
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,480
oxidative stress already that's provided by the alcohol because the alcohol isn't just a way to

660
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,960
get fat in the liver. The alcohol's metabolism generates oxidative stress. So you're taking

661
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:30,680
a liver that doesn't yet have fat accumulation, you're putting a bunch of fat into it, and you're

662
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:38,840
adding on top of that an oxidative flame. So you actually wind up causing staetosis by causing

663
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,600
oxidative damage to the ABOB particle so that they can't leave the liver in that model.

664
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:50,040
So PUFA's, I think, are very complicated to think about because in the short term,

665
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,400
in someone who doesn't have a lot of stuff going on in their liver, they're probably going to be

666
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,200
better if you look at a two-week study. And we have the data in humans showing that. But I think

667
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,960
in the long term, if you're talking about the progression from staetosis to NASH, they're a

668
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:09,160
clear disadvantage. And I think if you're not talking about the healthy person who's got nothing

669
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,680
wrong with them, then they're, who knows? It's like 50-50. But in this two-week study you're

670
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:21,000
talking about, presumably the subjects were fed disproportionately high amounts of PUFA versus SFA.

671
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,120
Yeah. Do you recall the magnitudes that they had to be fed to produce this phenotype?

672
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,280
I don't recall the magnitudes, but they weren't ridiculously out of proportion. They weren't

673
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:36,360
super physiologic. No, no, no. They were basically the typical amount of fat that someone would eat,

674
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,720
but they controlled the fat intake. So maybe people would prefer to mix the types of fats that are

675
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:48,280
in their diet. But in that case, it was atypical. But they weren't feeding them 80 or 90% fat diets.

676
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:54,680
You know, it's interesting. You mentioned the APO-B issue. APO-B is used, obviously, in two ways in

677
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:01,560
the liver. The first way we've talked about, which is VLDL export, which is our main way to

678
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:08,120
get triglycerides out. But also we make de novo LDL in the liver. And so in those patients, do we

679
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,680
see a reduction in LDL as well? I don't remember. That's interesting. I feel like I want to start

680
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,600
paying a little closer attention to this. I certainly haven't- I can't even remember if

681
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:24,200
they measured that. I just haven't clinically seen that, because I do see NAFLD all the time

682
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:31,160
in the practice. Usually you suspect it with an elevated ALT disproportionate to AST, and then

683
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,960
an ultrasound will confirm the diagnosis. Very rarely do you need an MRI and certainly never a

684
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:44,280
biopsy. But I haven't seen the association with an alteration in VLDL, which we can estimate. And

685
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:50,200
obviously we can measure triglycerides in LDL. It's also confounded, by the way, by different

686
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:58,520
ethnicities. So when you look at African American patients, even with type 2 diabetes,

687
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:06,440
will still have very low VLDL and triglycerides. A Hispanic patient with diabetes will generally

688
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:13,000
have a high triglyceride and a high VLDL. And actually they're far more susceptible to NAFLD

689
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,960
than African American. And Caucasian is in the middle. Are you familiar with any of the data on

690
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,880
some of those differences as it pertains to the lipidology of these folks?

691
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,760
I just haven't paid attention to it. No, I'm not. I'm not. And can we

692
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:30,440
rewind a minute? What have you observed with VLDL? You said you haven't observed the association

693
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,760
between blood levels of VLDL and- And NAFLD. Yeah.

694
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,760
What would you expect to see that you didn't? I would have expected, based on what we're saying,

695
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:44,440
to see a reduction in VLDL. The more NAFLD they have, the less VLDL based on this idea.

696
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,000
Well, I think the problem with that is that- I mean, I have an explanation for why that might

697
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,400
not exist. And here's the explanation. In an ideal world, that might make sense. But there's

698
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:00,520
another thing that's going on. If you have NAFLD, you are very likely insulin resistant.

699
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:08,120
If you are insulin resistant, you are upregulating APOC3. If you are upregulating APOC3, your VLDL

700
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,960
are going to stick around a hell of a lot longer than if you do not. And that's why we see these

701
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:20,280
pathologic remnant VLDL particles that become atherogenic. So when you or I, presuming we're

702
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,800
both insulin sensitive, our VLDL really don't pose much of an atherogenic risk because they stick

703
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:30,360
around for such a short period of time. So we don't have many of them. They don't stick around long.

704
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:38,040
Our APOC3 is quite downregulated. But if APOC3 is upregulated and it's hard to measure this,

705
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:44,360
although Sam Tamekis is working on an assay to do so, you have VLDL now start to act like LDL.

706
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,880
They stick around long enough. They have a high enough residence time in the plasma that they

707
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:54,760
become atherogenic. And so I do wonder if maybe why I don't- not that this is scientific, but the

708
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:01,480
reason even my Gestalt is not to see that is maybe the less VLDL that's being exported in that

709
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,080
patient because of the reasons you've described is offset by a longer residence time due to more

710
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:14,040
APOC3. Right. And wouldn't you also expect that from lower rate of uptake of triglycerides from

711
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:20,120
peripheral tissues? Yeah, that's a great point. You have a lower peripheral disposal of triglycerides.

712
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,560
So the whole thing could be confe- In other words, it's a great point you raise actually. We should

713
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:31,320
take a macro step back. This is a problem of flux and people struggle to understand flux because

714
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:36,760
you can't understand flux with a snapshot. No. You have to have the goddamn video, right? I mean,

715
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,640
that's the analogy. You can't- You take a picture of something, you don't know the flux. What's in,

716
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,960
what's out, where it's being disposed of. I love this point. And one of the analogies that I like

717
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:51,960
to use is although you can't use the picture, how much information you have in a snapshot can have

718
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,480
a huge effect on your ability to know what's going on. Now, imagine that you have a picture of a car

719
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:03,320
accident. Well, if you zoom in to the tire, you might not- And you look at that, you don't know

720
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,760
what happened. You might not have any idea what happened. The more you zoom out and the more

721
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,200
different angles that you have, at some point, you can start to build a story of what probably

722
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,160
happened based on that snapshot. But if you're looking at one element in the snapshot, you can

723
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:23,400
never even so much as build a story about what probably happened. And I think that, yeah, the

724
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:33,720
idea that mistaking a concentration for flux is one of the overwhelming interpretive problems in

725
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:39,880
science and in popular science in both. Yeah, one of my biggest pet peeves. So every quarter,

726
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,680
when I do one of these seven day fasts, I get a lot of blood work done on myself throughout the

727
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:50,680
process. And I get a real kick out of it because by the time you're five, six, seven days into water

728
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:56,200
only, you start to look like there are things that if looked at in isolation look horrible.

729
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,720
For example, your free fatty acids get into the diabetic range. So if you show that to somebody,

730
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,920
they think, oh my God, you're you're diabetic. And you're like, really? My insulin is unmeasurable.

731
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:15,320
My glucose is 60 milligrams per deciliter. Yes, my FFA is two millimolar, but my BHB is, you know,

732
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:21,960
seven or five millimolar. Isn't it possible that what you're seeing is an incredible turnover of

733
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:27,080
lipolysis? And so, yeah, there's a lot of free fatty acid there, but it's in motion. It's in

734
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:32,440
transit versus what I think is probably happening in the person with high FFA who's got diabetes,

735
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:38,680
which is a much more stagnant form of elevated FFA. And so that's a muscle that's full of fat

736
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,600
that's going nowhere versus the fasted person where that fat is being turned over very quickly.

737
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,240
And would you rather drink water out of a stream or out of a sitting pool with mosquitoes all over

738
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,920
it? Exactly. So no, it's a good point. And I like your point, which is, look, the picture can be

739
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:01,480
helpful, but it has to be taken from a distance, right? So if you just look at one tread of the

740
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,520
tire in a photo, you're probably going to have no clue what caused the accident. If you look at a

741
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,560
huge picture, you could at least see where the skid marks are of both vehicles. Ultimately, there's

742
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:16,520
no substitute for having a video of the accident. And those turn out to be the hardest things to do

743
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:23,560
biochemically is to generate tests that can actually show you the movement. Well, biochemically,

744
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:30,280
what you do know, though, is that we've mapped out elsewhere biochemical pathways. If you know

745
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:35,560
all the possible sequences and you can measure all the metabolites, you can often reconstruct

746
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,760
what a video would have shown with fairly good precision. I think it's just that we're only on

747
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,920
the horizon of being able to do things like that. But even still, if you measure 20 things in

748
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,760
someone's blood, you can have a much better idea of what's going on, what probably happened,

749
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,600
than if you measure one thing in that blood. I should say 20 things in the pathway, right?

750
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:06,520
Yeah. And what you can get by measuring serially, even a few serial measurements can be quite

751
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,240
helpful. I mean, even just looking at something as, you know, simple, I hate to say that, but as

752
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:16,760
simple as an oral glucose tolerance test, you look at somebody's fasting glucose and fasting insulin,

753
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,600
you have some idea of what's going on, especially in extremes, right? So a person who's fasting

754
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:29,320
glucose is 70 milligrams per deciliter and their fasting insulin is one, the probability that

755
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:34,520
they're going to have post-prandial hyperinsulinemia is low, but it's not zero. Similarly, you look at

756
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:40,600
somebody who's fasting glucose is 130 and their fasting insulin is 30, the likelihood that there's

757
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:49,160
not a train wreck there is also virtually nil. But if you're willing to sample 30, 60, 90, and 120

758
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:55,720
minutes after a glucose challenge, you can develop a very interesting kinetic pathway using just two

759
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:02,120
or three measurements. You know, I often get asked, where will machine learning wreak the most havoc

760
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:08,680
in medicine? And my intuition is most likely radiology is the most obvious place for machine

761
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:15,320
learning to, I mean, wreak havoc is the wrong word, but displace human, you know, ability. I've often

762
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:20,440
thought the ICU would be the second most valuable place just based on the reams of data that are

763
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:25,800
coming out. But I've never thought of this particular question, right, which is something as

764
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:33,000
seemingly straightforward as looking at a bunch of biochemical metabolites and precursors and

765
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,720
intermediaries. There may be a very interesting opportunity here from machine learning to also

766
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,520
start to differentiate, but you know, this question of flux. I'm always asking myself that question

767
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,320
when I look at a blood test, which is this is a static test. Can I infer the movement, the

768
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:55,320
velocity or the derivative, the time derivative of this molecule or that molecule? So maybe that is

769
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,400
an interesting place for machine learning to start to play a role, because I do suspect it will do a

770
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:05,480
better job than me. Yeah. And what we do have taking it back to the fatty liver, what we do have

771
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:11,880
is not you'll never see this in your day to day clinical life. But what we do have is studies

772
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,760
where we look at labeled tracers. And that's what shows that in a random sample of Nash people,

773
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:21,080
you have a 75% decrease in able B secretion. It doesn't matter what the ape will be in the blood

774
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:26,120
test. You'd like to know why it's higher, but you know that it's not because it's coming out of

775
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,520
the liver at a higher rate. It's a great point, right? It can be longer residence time at the

776
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:37,080
VLDL, the LDL, the, yeah, that's such a great point. Okay. So speaking of tracers, which just

777
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:42,200
prompted me to think of another thing I wanted to talk with you about, let's talk about the most

778
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,040
sought after, discussed, asked about supplement on the market today, which are NAD precursors.

779
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,840
I know, I know you've got some feelings on this. I have pretty, I have pretty strong feelings on

780
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,360
this topic too. I'm trying to think how we can frame this. So let's take a step back. Well,

781
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,920
let's let me do this for the listener who is contemplating whether or not they should turn

782
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,360
the podcast off now or not. Cause you barely hung on to the biochemistry of Colleen and fatty liver

783
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:19,000
disease. Most people have heard of NR nicotinamide riboside, NAD as the sort of fountain of youth.

784
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,840
And if you've listened to other podcasts I've done specifically when I spoke with David Sinclair,

785
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:31,640
we talked a lot about sirtuins and the necessity of NAD as a substrate to sirtuins.

786
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,840
What many of you have also probably heard of is there were a couple of companies out there that

787
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,560
are making a very popular supplement. One of them is called Elysium. They make a supplement called

788
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,120
Basis. The other was called Chromadex. They make a supplement. I think it's called True Nyogen.

789
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:53,240
If I am I right on that? Yeah. I believe that Basis takes nicotinamide riboside,

790
01:10:53,240 --> 01:11:00,920
combines it with terra stilbene, which is a sirtuin activator and that is their product.

791
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:06,600
And my recollection is that the True Nyogen folks are just giving nicotinamide riboside. I don't

792
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,120
know if they have a sirtuin activator in there, but I could be wrong and it's probably not relevant

793
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:18,200
unless you know the answer. All right. So the thinking goes as follows. We have this little

794
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,920
thing in our cells called mitochondria and they have all these little complexes and these complexes

795
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,320
are basically used to generate reducing agents that move electrons to one side of a double

796
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:32,280
membrane and it builds up a gradient and then that gradient allows us to make a bunch of ATP

797
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,120
and that whole process is called oxidative phosphorylation. The first of these complexes

798
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:47,800
turns NAD into NADH and, pardon me, NADH to NAD. So as the ratio, as we age, it has been postulated

799
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,400
and maybe even observed, I don't know if it's been truly observed inside the mitochondria,

800
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:57,720
maybe it has, that the ratio of NAD to NADH goes down. And if that's happening, then you have

801
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:03,960
presumably less NAD with NAD being an important substrate for sirtuins, which do many things,

802
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,760
but primarily repair DNA damage. It would seem that we would want more NAD.

803
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:15,240
Okay. You also have NAD depletion because the sirtuins and the PARPs, which is the other class

804
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:21,800
of enzymes that are using NAD for the purpose of protecting DNA and telomeres and all the things

805
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,280
that are postulated to be important to aging and longevity, they consume the NAD. They're consuming

806
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,960
the NAD. That's right. Yeah, absolutely. Which I think are two totally different things.

807
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:37,480
Correct. And there's another great example of it's hard to know why NAD levels might be low. Is it

808
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,960
low because of high consumption and high demand, or is it low because of low production?

809
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:46,840
Well, so if you're looking at the ratio of NAD to NADH, then I think that being in the

810
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:53,480
overfed state is the thing that's the problem. If you're talking about NAD amount levels dropping,

811
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:59,400
then you're looking at consumption by the PARPs and sirtuins that are consuming it for the purpose

812
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,760
of repairing damage. Yeah. So in an ideal world, if you could wave a magic wand,

813
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:09,800
you would presumably want more NAD inside your mitochondria. Tell us why that magic wand

814
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,960
doesn't exist. Why can't you just eat NAD in other words? I wouldn't say it doesn't exist,

815
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:23,080
but it's questionable how powerful of a wand this is. So there's niacin in our, these are all forms

816
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:28,760
collectively, we call all this stuff niacin in the diet. It's vitamin B3. And in the foods that we

817
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,480
primarily get niacin in the form of nicotinic acid from plant foods, we primarily get it in

818
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:39,400
the form of nicotinamide from animal foods. Like if we eat a steak, a lot of the niacin that's in

819
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:48,920
the steak is going to be in the form of NAD or NADPH that is in those cells. But all of that has

820
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:55,560
to be digested. And what we're absorbing in the intestines is either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.

821
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:02,360
My guess is if you take a nicotinamide riboside supplement, you are absorbing the NR intact.

822
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:08,360
And if you take a nicotinamide mononucleotide supplement, NMN, you are probably digesting that

823
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:15,960
down to NR or nicotinamide and absorbing them, but we are definitely not absorbing NADH or NAD

824
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:23,000
in the intestines. So when we're eating food, once we go into the enterocyte, we have

825
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:31,320
nicotinic acid primarily being converted over to nicotinamide and the intestinal cell tries to turn

826
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:37,000
that into NAD, but whatever the intestinal cell doesn't turn into NAD itself, it passes on to the

827
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,400
liver. So you're going through the portal vein. Now you have maybe some nicotinic acid left,

828
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,960
depending on how much you ate, you have some nicotinamide in there. In theory, if you took a

829
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,120
nicotinamide riboside supplement, you got some nicotinamide riboside in there. Then it goes into

830
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:57,880
the liver and the liver is the main site that's really metabolizing all these forms for the entire

831
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,600
body. And what the liver is going to do is it's going to try to convert as much of those forms

832
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:08,760
into NAD as possible, not even just for itself, but because it's going to hold a reserve of NAD

833
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,240
for the rest of the body. And then almost everything that comes out of the liver into

834
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:23,960
the circulation is nicotinamide. So the overwhelming thing that gets niacin out of

835
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,320
the liver to any other tissue is nicotinamide. That's the transport form. And then those tissues

836
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:38,040
will convert that into NAD. So what we definitely don't see is we don't see NAD and NADH being

837
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,920
transported in the blood. There's some there, but it's not a physiological transport way to get

838
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,560
something from one place to another. If you take a nicotinamide riboside supplement, you will get

839
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:52,920
some nicotinamide riboside in the blood. Animal experiments suggest that there are trace amounts

840
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:58,760
of that that will get into certain cells like muscle cells and be converted into NAD, but there

841
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:05,560
are a physiologically meaningless amount of the NAD that wound up in that muscle cell from taking

842
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,800
that supplement. Overwhelmingly, if you're talking about a tissue other than the liver,

843
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:14,680
what's happening is that supplement gets converted into nicotinamide, reaches the other

844
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:21,640
tissues as nicotinamide, and increases tissue NAD by that tissue taking the nicotinamide and making

845
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:26,440
the NAD. But the first pass effect is pretty significant, right? So let's talk about-

846
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:31,560
First pass, the effect is basically complete. We'll come back to NMN in a moment, but let's

847
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:38,440
just talk about NR. NR becomes NMN, becomes NAD, I believe in the cycle. If you take it,

848
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,720
NR, yeah. Yeah. So if you take NR, which is the two most popular supplements on the market

849
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:51,560
with respect to this particular pathway, the liver is basically to your point taking all of that NR

850
01:16:51,560 --> 01:17:00,440
and making NAD, correct? Yes. So do we have a sense of how much NAD actually makes its way into even

851
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:07,000
the cytoplasm of a cell that is non-hepatic in that situation? NAD that came from where? That is

852
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,120
derived ultimately from the NR that you ingested. From the liver? Yes. Oh, we know exactly what

853
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,520
happens. The liver turns that into nicotinamide and secretes it for the rest of the cells. How much?

854
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,760
Like a meaningful amount of- As a portion? Yeah. Well, or just-

855
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:25,320
Well, I don't know off the top of my head the amount, but what I can tell you is that

856
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,560
for all intents and purposes, all of the NAD that is in any of your cells that are not the liver,

857
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:39,880
well, actually I should say maybe 5% the kidney synthesized from protein. But aside from that 5%

858
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:46,680
in the kidney, pretty much every molecule of NAD is ultimately derived from circulating nicotinamide

859
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:53,480
that the liver put out. So in other words, it's not the case that NR needs to be brought into a cell

860
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:59,320
to be turned into NAD. It's that nicotinamide gets into a cell to be turned into NAD.

861
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,840
It's not even needs to, it's Ken, right? Because NAD, to my knowledge, does not go from plasma

862
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,480
into cell, but it's hard to know if- It does, it does. It just might be that you don't have enough

863
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:14,200
in the plasma to justify the- Well, you do if you're injecting it. Oh, so this is interesting.

864
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,440
Okay, I want to come back. I'm going to park that because I want to let you finish,

865
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:23,480
but I'm going to come back to that. So nicotinamide is the physiological circulating form of niacin

866
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,920
that all cells will use to make nicotinamide. I mean, excuse me, that all cells will not use to

867
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:37,240
make NAD. Minor exceptions are about five, we can make some niacin from tryptophan and about 95% of

868
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:45,080
that happens in the liver, 5% happens in the kidney. So there is some tiny bit of this that

869
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:52,840
the kidney is making its own, but overwhelmingly with that tiny exception, a tissue is getting

870
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,120
NAD because it took nicotinamide out of the blood that the liver made from its store of NAD.

871
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,800
Now let me expose my ignorance in biochemistry and my forgetfulness.

872
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,720
Nicotinamide is charged or not? I know NAD is, but-

873
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,320
No, nicotinamide is not charged.

874
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,800
Okay, so nicotinamide makes its way into a cell through an active or passive transporter?

875
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,440
Active transport, I believe. I would need to check that.

876
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:19,480
That's okay. We'll figure all that out. Once nicotinamide is in the cell,

877
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,720
how does it combine with adenosine, et cetera, to become NAD?

878
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:29,320
It goes through two steps that are ATP dependent. It gets converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide

879
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:34,600
and then it gets converted into NAD. A portion of the NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide,

880
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,960
a portion of that becomes NR and then comes back to NMN. And I don't know exactly why,

881
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:45,640
but I think it's like a pressure release valve. So if you're trying to hold on to the nicotinamide

882
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:51,400
and get it to NAD more than the rate at which you can make the NAD, you might convert some to NR

883
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,200
to kind of hold on to it. Got it. And then it comes back and-

884
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,640
Wait, to NR or to NMN?

885
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,400
No, to NR. To NR, okay.

886
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:04,120
So you have nicotinamide, you go up to NMN, you go up to NAD. You can go from NMN over to NR,

887
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,880
but you have to go back over from NR to NMN to get to NAD.

888
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,960
Yep, and I think of it as a cycle.

889
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,560
Way easier to look at this in a picture.

890
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:17,800
Yeah, yeah. The picture that I have in my mind is NAD going to NAM to NMN as a cycle

891
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,440
with NR being a pop off of NMN.

892
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:26,360
Okay, yeah. So what you're talking about is in the case of NAD consuming enzymes like

893
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:31,240
sirtuins and PARPs that are using NAD for DNA repair and all those things we were talking

894
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:37,000
about before, what they do when they consume the NAD is they release nicotinamide.

895
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:44,680
So imagine you're a muscle cell. You took originally, to get every molecule of NAD you

896
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:49,400
have. Originally, you took some nicotinamide in from the blood, but then you did things with it.

897
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,720
Some of those things were what you were talking about with oxidative phosphorylation.

898
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,320
You don't consume NAD in that process. You just cycle it back and forth. You use it over and over

899
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,400
and over and over and over again. But some of the things that you did were with the sirtuins and

900
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:09,480
PARPs that are engaging in protection. And those enzymes will consume the NAD to generate nicotinamide.

901
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:18,760
The big problem here is that nicotinamide is an inhibitor of all those enzymes through

902
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:24,680
negative feedback loop. So you have to have to have to have to have to do something with the

903
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:31,640
nicotinamide very fast, or you need to methylate it, bring it back to the earlier discussion and

904
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:38,680
pee it out. So nicotinamide is circulating as the circulating form in the blood, but intracellularly,

905
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:43,800
you don't let it hang out there. You do something with it. So you take in the nicotinamide and you

906
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:49,080
either make NAD or you get rid of it. Yeah, actually, I didn't even realize one could have

907
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,480
free nicotinamide inside a cell, which I guess you're basically saying that that's, but only

908
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:58,280
momentarily. Momentarily, yeah. But it doesn't hang out there in that form. No, it doesn't.

909
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:02,280
Okay, so now let's go back to the question that I'm still trying to wrap my mind around,

910
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:09,640
which is if I give you a gram of nicotinamide riboside, you're saying none of that NR is

911
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,800
basically going to leave the liver instead, just nicotinamide is leaving the liver.

912
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,520
It is found in the blood. So there's clearly, there is some nicotinamide riboside in the blood

913
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:25,160
and we don't have the data in humans, but we do have the data in mice.

914
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,800
Isn't this what Joshua Benowitz did in that trace you're saying over the summer?

915
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:34,520
That's exactly what I'm referring to. So in his paper, what he showed was that there is a little

916
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,920
bit of nicotinamide riboside that gets into the blood, that there's a little bit that gets into

917
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,080
some of the cells, not others. So for example, it can't cross the brain at all. It's fairly

918
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:47,480
decent at getting into muscle if it's there. There's not a lot there, but what is there can

919
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:53,400
get into the muscle and there is a little bit that gets turned into NAD. But the nice thing about his

920
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:58,200
study was he was the way that he designed the tracers was they could see.

921
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,560
Yeah, you want to be able to separate the nicotinamide from the nicotinamide riboside,

922
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:07,880
right? Well, they could see even at the level of detail as like what was the history of this

923
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:13,000
molecule before it became NAD. So they could differentiate inside the muscle cell, they could

924
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,440
differentiate the pool of NAD that the muscle made from nicotinamide riboside. They could,

925
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:23,880
from the pool that it made from nicotinamide, even from the pool that it went through the cycle

926
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:29,080
and then back, right? So they had extremely fine detail. And what they showed was that there's a

927
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:34,440
little bit of nicotinamide riboside that makes it into the muscle intact. It pulled up the graph to

928
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:41,000
try to see the amount and they have to blow up that part of the bar graph to show you what that

929
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,840
tiny trace looks like. It's basically practically meaningless. Now, what they also showed in their

930
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:53,320
papers and also in the same group published one in 2016, what they also showed was that you do

931
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,280
increase NAD in the muscle a lot when you supplement with the nicotinamide riboside.

932
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,480
But it all comes from nicotinamide that the liver had made and circulated in the blood.

933
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:10,520
Let's just make the math easy. You take one mole of NR orally. We've already acknowledged that the

934
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:15,960
amount of NR that escapes the blood is so small you need a magnifying glass to see it. So it's

935
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:22,440
a pico mole or something. How many moles of nicotinamide make their way into the cell?

936
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:29,480
Again, I'm sort of directionally speaking. But order of magnitude, is it more of it or

937
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:35,960
like the majority of it does? Or how much loss is there outside of the first pass effect?

938
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,840
Is there an inefficiency? What are you calling loss? Are you calling increasing hepatic NAD loss?

939
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:48,520
Or are you calling alcohol loss, anything that prevents the actual nicotinamide from making it

940
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:55,240
into the cell? I don't know off the top of my head what those numbers would be. But I can come back.

941
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:02,040
I'll come back to the human data that the chromidex people have published on that point.

942
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:08,360
But what I can say about the physiology is that there's a lot that doesn't get into any particular

943
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,320
cell that isn't actually lost. And I think this is a really important point because in the

944
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:19,880
Rabinowitz group in 2016, they had another paper where they actually, when you're listening to this,

945
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,840
I mean, what's your thought right now? Would NR be more effective than nicotinamide eating it?

946
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:32,280
That's a good question. My intuition would have been NMN would have been the best precursor if

947
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:41,800
you could get it around the liver. So as a thought experiment like SL, sublingual or intravenous NMN

948
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,840
would have been my intuition is the best way to increase intracellular NAD.

949
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:53,640
If you didn't have that choice, if nicotinamide is the circulating form that's getting into the muscle,

950
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,560
would you think that NR is just generating nicotinamide that gets into the muscle?

951
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,120
Yeah, I think based on what you're saying, I would now say nicotinamide per se would be a better

952
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:06,760
substrate. Right, but it's not. And in the two, that's what I would think too. I love how you

953
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,640
walked me down that path. Well, no, because as I'm saying this, it sounds like why on earth,

954
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:16,200
why would you take anything other than nicotinamide? It's just going to make nicotinamide anyway.

955
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,360
And I think this gets back to your waste point too. In the 2016 paper that the Rabinowitz group

956
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:27,800
put out, they showed that, and this was a minor portion of their studies. They didn't have anywhere

957
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:34,680
near as much data as they had on the NR, but they showed that they got a much less NAD response in

958
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:42,360
the muscle with oral nicotinamide than they did with NR. Even though they also showed with very

959
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,080
elegant tracers that it all got there as nicotinamide. Let me make sure I understood what you said.

960
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:54,120
You give oral nicotinamide and you are now asking the question, how much of it goes to the liver,

961
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,240
how much of it leaves the liver, also is nicotinamide and makes it to the muscle.

962
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,080
They didn't have all that data on the oral nicotinamide.

963
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,520
Okay, so they skipped that step, but they're going from-

964
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,280
They're asking the question, in the muscle, our goal is to increase NAD in the muscle.

965
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:04,440
Yep.

966
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:10,920
Is it more effective to give oral NR or is it more effective to give oral nicotinamide?

967
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:15,960
And a minute ago, I would have said oral nicotinamide would make more sense.

968
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,520
But they showed that-

969
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,320
You're saying the opposite.

970
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:22,040
They showed the opposite, yeah. Here's the rationale that, now this is kind of my synthesis-

971
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,000
Did the 2018 paper shed light on that now? Because now they had a tracer.

972
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,960
They had tracers in the 2016 paper too.

973
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,640
But they couldn't see how much tyrosine in the liver was being-

974
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:40,120
Yeah, there was much more kinetic flux data in the 2018 paper. That clarified,

975
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,560
if you had them on to talk about it, I'm sure you'd get better responses about the details.

976
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:47,720
And by the way, I've tried to get Josh on a hundred times and Josh and I are friends

977
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,080
because we went to medical school together and I just can't get him to hop on a train

978
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:56,520
and come up here. So Josh, if you're listening to this, please just come up so we can talk about this.

979
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,800
Yeah, I'll just say what I learned about this paper. Because I read the paper, I took notes,

980
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,960
I synthesized them, I did my own podcast about this. So I think I have a pretty decent

981
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,520
understanding of that paper, but I'm sure there's details that I forgot. So what I learned from that

982
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:14,920
paper is a bunch of things. For example, I know now that the average NAD molecule turns over

983
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,920
every eight hours you consume an NAD molecule in most tissues, but it's every two hours in the

984
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:24,360
liver, things like that. I know that the spleen and the small intestine consume 40 times more

985
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:29,720
NAD than the muscle and the fat does. So there's a bunch of data in that paper, but there's not

986
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,880
infinite data about the proportion that went in in each compartment everywhere.

987
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:39,080
Back to the point about why is it more effective to take the NR? And this is what I think is going

988
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:45,080
on when I think is the most sensible rationale that makes sense of this. So in the liver,

989
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:50,760
you imagine that the NR, the nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, whatever it was you ate gets

990
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:57,560
into the liver. Think about that cycle that we talked about before. So we go from nicotinamide

991
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:04,120
and we go up to NMN, we go up to NAD. If we consume the NAD with sirtuins and PARPs,

992
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:09,960
we come back to nicotinamide. And having that nicotinamide around is a liability because it's

993
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,840
going to inhibit all the repair enzymes. So we either want to make NAD out of it or we want to

994
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:20,440
get rid of it. If you eat oral nicotinamide and you absorb oral nicotinamide into the liver

995
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:28,360
and the liver gets it, that oral nicotinamide is immediately a liability before it ever becomes NAD

996
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:38,040
because it can inhibit all those enzymes, the sirtuins and the PARPs. So the liver has a bifurcation

997
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,760
of what can it do with this? It can methylate it to get rid of it and pee it into the urine

998
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:52,920
or it can make NAD. If you take NR, then you go into NMN, you have to make NAD before you ever

999
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:59,160
generate nicotinamide and expose it to the detoxification process. What I believe is happening,

1000
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:07,000
and I think this is backed up by the animal data, is nicotinamide riboside is a superior way to

1001
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,680
increase hepatic NAD because when it gets to the liver, it can't be immediately detoxified.

1002
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:19,320
It's not immediately a threat to the sirtuins and PARPs and it can only make NAD before it

1003
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:25,560
does anything else. And again, this is a flux thing, right? It's not like the liver says,

1004
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:31,000
okay, cells, tell me what our balance of NAD and NMN is on Friday. And on Saturday, I'll make a

1005
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,520
decision about how much to empty into the urine. This is an immediate thing that's happening right

1006
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:41,080
now. The liver says, oh, got two choices. I either detoxify this or I do something useful with it.

1007
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:46,520
And so if you're presenting it with that thing that's a threat and it has to make that decision,

1008
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:51,560
it can only make so much NAD at once at one time, then you're going to have much more waste

1009
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:58,520
in the detoxification pathway than if you put the thing in that has to make NAD. That is not a threat

1010
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:04,680
when it makes NAD. And that has to actually generate NAD to ever be exposed to the detoxification

1011
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:11,160
pathway. So you have to appreciate the central role of the liver in controlling the flux

1012
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:17,480
throughout the entire body. The liver's not just making NAD for itself. It's making NAD because it

1013
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:25,080
carries all of the reserves for the rest of the body as NAD. So the liver doesn't just have NAD

1014
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:29,960
that's immediately being used in respiration and is immediately being used in sirtuins and PARPs.

1015
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:37,000
It has a reserve pool of NAD that it holds on to for the specific purpose of a slow release of

1016
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,280
nicotinamide to the rest of the tissues that they will take up. And then they will have the immediate

1017
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:48,680
decision to either detoxify it or make NAD. But if the liver can hold on safely to the NAD

1018
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:56,520
and have a better ability to release nicotinamide on an as needed basis and a continuous basis

1019
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:02,760
at a rate that the other tissues can take up and do something useful with, then because you got a

1020
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:10,920
superior way of increasing hepatic NAD, you got a better continuous flux that was optimized of

1021
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,960
nicotinamide to reach the other tissues so they can make NAD. Yeah. So in that sense, it's actually

1022
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:23,800
sort of parallels glucose, right? In the sense that we have to maintain about five grams of glucose

1023
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:29,720
in our bloodstream at all times. So if you have 10 grams of glucose in your bloodstream, you have

1024
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:33,400
diabetes, you've got huge problems, you're going to go blind and get your toes cut off. But not if

1025
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:37,960
you have a hundred grams in your liver. Exactly. But five grams is perfect. And if, by the way,

1026
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:42,200
if you have two grams, you die. You know, it's just, it's an amazing problem where the liver

1027
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:47,480
is constantly titrating. So you're basically drawing a parallel that says it's probably doing

1028
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:56,600
the same thing holding onto NAD. So in this analogy, NAD is to glycogen what glucose is to

1029
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:03,800
nicotinamide. Yeah. Is that a fair analogy? It's a fair analogy, except there's a probably much

1030
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,840
larger percentage of the hepatic NAD pool that's actually being proportionally they're different.

1031
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:14,120
But yeah, in principle, I think that's a good analogy. So let's see if we can go deeper on

1032
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:20,120
that analogy. There are a lot of people out there who, in fact, I have a friend who came to me a year

1033
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:25,960
ago and he said, I've got the greatest idea. I'm going to open up an IV NAD clinic and we're going

1034
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:31,480
to do NAD and ketamine. So we'll give you ketamine to get rid of your depression and NAD to make you

1035
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:36,440
live longer. And I said, well, I'm interested in the ketamine because I do think that's a super

1036
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:42,120
interesting molecule for recalcitrant depression. At least a year ago, I said, my understanding is

1037
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:49,560
giving intravenous NAD is not going to increase intracellular or certainly mitochondrial NAD. And

1038
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:54,360
I don't know that that makes sense. Though I've got many friends who have done IV NAD and they all say

1039
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,600
the same thing. It's the worst feeling in the world. Oh, I know why it's the worst feeling in the world.

1040
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:05,320
Say why? We need to come back and say, what is the role of free NAD that's found extracellularly?

1041
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:11,400
I can guess what the role is. What I can tell you is that one of the things it does

1042
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:17,480
is it activates granulocytes to cause vasodilation and a massively ramped up inflammatory response.

1043
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:22,760
So not unlike niacin. No, it's very different from niacin. So niacin has a very similar response,

1044
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,200
doesn't it, at very high levels? Well, yeah, but biochemically, what's happening is totally

1045
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:31,480
different. Oh, it is. Okay. Yeah. So why is niacin causing a flush? It's not the same as NAD's flush.

1046
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:39,480
So nicotinic acid is specifically nicotinic acid activates the nicotinic acid receptor.

1047
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:46,280
And that is present on a bunch of immune cells that are responsible for the flushing response,

1048
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:53,560
not necessarily granulocytes. Yeah. So NAD is acting on it's a different receptor. And,

1049
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:58,200
you know, I don't know, maybe it's maybe it's more, it might be more similar than I was leading on.

1050
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:01,480
It's a different receptor, but maybe the results are some I've never injected.

1051
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:07,320
I've never had the flushing response and I've never injected NAD. It probably is fair to say

1052
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:11,800
that they're similar in their results and that there are some similarities biochemically,

1053
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:18,680
but it's not the same biochemical mechanism. So if you do inject this NAD, what is it now you've

1054
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:24,360
bypassed the liver and it's sitting there in the plasma. What's clearly happening based on the

1055
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:30,520
anecdotal reports of the immediate response to that is that they're, that they are causing an

1056
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:35,880
inflammatory response. What is not clear is the kinetics of where that NAD is going. Right. But

1057
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:41,400
there's, there is definitely papers that I was able to find showing that there are a variety

1058
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:46,440
of mammalian cell types that do have the ability to take that NAD into the cells.

1059
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:52,280
But I look at this from the perspective of what is the normal physiology? I don't, I don't really

1060
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:56,280
want to know what can happen. First. I want to know what's supposed to happen. Then I'll build

1061
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:00,680
a theory about what I should do based on that. Right. For people who are not injecting it,

1062
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,920
how does NAD get out of this cell in the first place? Well, the details aren't worked out,

1063
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:11,320
but it appears to be that NAD, extracellular NAD is from dead cells, from dying cells,

1064
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,000
and maybe from cells that are undergoing some sort of stress response and are

1065
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:21,960
secreting it to some degree to reflect their energy status. You mean as a signal?

1066
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:25,800
As a signal. Interesting. Oh, yeah. I think it's very clear. You think it can be a signaling

1067
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:30,680
molecule as well? I think it's very clear that there, if there is any role for extracellular

1068
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,320
NAD, it is as a signaling molecule. And I think it's almost certain that there is a role for

1069
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:43,320
extracellular NAD as a signaling molecule because there are fairly decently characterized enzymes

1070
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:48,680
that consume NAD that are found extracellularly. There's a whole class of extracellular NAD

1071
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:54,120
consuming enzymes. So if NAD is not ever supposed to be outside of the cell, why would it be there?

1072
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,840
And it's like, well, what do those enzymes do? They break it down to use it as a signaling

1073
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,960
molecule. So it has to be the case that extracellular NAD is primarily a signaling

1074
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:10,280
function. And so it's definitely not a normal way of transporting NAD from tissue to tissue.

1075
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:16,840
What the signal means, I think will probably be debated if enough people care for a long time to

1076
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:22,360
come. So I have no idea exactly how to simplify and state what it means, but it's very clear that

1077
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:30,680
it's a signaling molecule. So when I look at NAD injection, I'm like, my idea is I'm going to

1078
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:35,800
transport this thing. And that's definitely not the way you transport that thing. And my body's

1079
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:41,400
idea is that that's a signal that means something about what's happening that is definitely not

1080
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:47,080
happening when I. Right, because you're amplifying potentially a signal that's negative.

1081
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:53,320
Yeah. And maybe that has good consequences because maybe it's some kind of rescue signal.

1082
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:00,680
Maybe a stressed cell puts NAD out and says, come help me or come get rid of me because I suck.

1083
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:07,080
Yeah, but if that's the case, gosh, when you took a motherload of NAD in the plasma,

1084
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,920
what are you supposed to go after every cell? I mean, how would you even differentiate where

1085
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,120
that signal, where that alarm is coming from? Well, that's why I would never do that. But I think

1086
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,200
if I'm trying to if I'm trying to explain why are people experiencing reporting benefits from it,

1087
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:27,000
either it's placebo or it's doing something. And if it's not just placebo, my guess is that it's

1088
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,880
probably it's probably having some signaling effect that is by virtue of luck, doing something

1089
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:38,040
that the person is reporting is beneficial. But I'm not going to do that because I have no idea

1090
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:43,000
exactly what that signal means. So what's your take then, you know, kind of going back to where

1091
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:48,440
we were a moment ago, which is doing what seems to be much more commonly done, which is taking

1092
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:58,120
oral NR or oral NMN. Okay, so oral NMN, I would bet money that it's not absorbed intact. And that's

1093
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:07,080
because NMN has a charged phosphate group on it. And generally charged phosphates cannot cross

1094
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:14,520
cells. And so they're hydrolyzed. And even if it were to be true that there were transporters in

1095
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:19,880
the intestines that could take NMN up intact, it probably still would not be absorbed intact

1096
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:26,280
because the phosphatase is in the small intestine that cleave the phosphates off of everything that

1097
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:32,840
all the molecules in the food you eat do so nonspecifically to all of the molecules in the

1098
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:39,000
food you eat. So for example, riboflavin, when you consume riboflavin 5-phosphate, I'm quite

1099
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:46,280
certain that none of it is absorbed intact. Were that because there were a specific riboflavin 5-phosphate

1100
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:51,480
phosphatase that just cleaved that phosphate, then I would say, well, I don't know about niacin,

1101
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:55,880
I need to look for the phosphatase. But that's not the case. What is the case is that in a normally

1102
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:02,120
functioning small intestine, you have this overabundance of nonspecific phosphatases that just

1103
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:07,800
cleave the phosphates off of everything that you're eating. And that's because even though there

1104
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:13,560
might be some exceptions to the rule, perhaps the overwhelming rule is that it's really difficult to

1105
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:20,840
carry charged phosphates across the intestines, across cell membranes in general. So I doubt that

1106
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,440
the NMN gets in there intact. And I think that if anything, maybe it gets cleaved to NR and the NR

1107
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:31,640
does. I believe the NR gets intact because that's what the Rubinowitz group's paper showed, that it

1108
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:36,600
was getting into the liver as NR. And because it makes sense, because NR doesn't have a charged

1109
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:41,560
phosphate on it. Okay, so we can simplify it and say, let's just limit our discussion to NR.

1110
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:47,160
And let's just say now we're taking super physiologic doses of NR, which would be what's

1111
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:53,480
prescribed in these supplements, sort of 500 to 1000 milligrams daily. Using our glycogen,

1112
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:59,880
somewhat oversimplified analogy, we're now increasing our hepatic reservoir of nicotinamide

1113
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,240
that we can slow drip out when it's demanded, because that's going to be the better way to do it.

1114
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:11,400
Right. So there's promise based on the animal experiments, although there are in the human

1115
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:15,080
trials that they've done, they haven't showed any benefit of doing this at all. Now, what you

1116
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:18,120
mentioned Brenner, I mean, you didn't mention him by name, but you mentioned chromodex. Tell me a

1117
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:22,280
little bit about their work. I've looked at a couple of their human studies and they've done

1118
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,360
a couple of studies where they've characterized the metabolites that are produced when you take

1119
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:32,760
oral NR. And they've done a couple of studies where they tried to look for some benefits and

1120
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,560
didn't really find any. So there's no benefits on glucose metabolism. There's no benefits on lipid

1121
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:42,520
metabolism. Now, were they doing these as kinetic studies or were they actually trying to look for

1122
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:49,480
phenotypic improvement? In the first study, they just took one person and they extensively

1123
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:54,840
characterized all the metabolites that were produced in three different compartments. But

1124
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:59,400
then there were two, and I don't know if this is comprehensive, but in the studies that I looked at,

1125
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:05,720
there were two other studies where they were measuring in different populations, they were

1126
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:11,160
measuring things that you would relate to health like glucose and triglycerides. And you're saying

1127
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:16,280
those things did not improve. Yeah. In fact, there's in one of the papers, I believe it was

1128
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,200
the triglycerides went up a little bit and the potassium, the serum potassium went down a little

1129
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:25,400
bit. I mean, nothing that was that you wouldn't conclude anything from it, but it didn't look like

1130
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,960
it was doing anything good. Now I want to make a couple caveats here because these have been

1131
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:35,080
pretty short studies and my suspicion is. Furthermore, they're not even measuring what

1132
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:38,840
we really care about, right? I also don't think they're measuring like what you would

1133
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:44,040
necessarily expect to see, which I think is harder to measure. So if you think about it,

1134
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:49,720
think about the Rabinowitz paper, which showed that the turnover of NAD is, and this is in mice,

1135
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:56,520
but it's all we have right now. The turnover of NAD in the small intestine is 40 times what it is

1136
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:01,880
in muscle. Explain that to me. I mean, that is so counterintuitive. Think about it from the

1137
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:06,280
opposite perspective. So we're thinking about life extension or health span extension with

1138
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:11,240
super physiological doses of NR. Think about the opposite case of pellagra, which is nice and

1139
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:18,120
deficiency. Where do you see that? You see the, if you're an optimist, you say the three Ds of

1140
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:23,400
dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. If you're a pessimist, you say the four Ds and you include

1141
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:31,960
death. And in the brain, what's going on is NAD is actually generating molecules that are directly

1142
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:37,560
involved in immediate neurotransmitter production. So I think that's why you see brain effects in

1143
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:43,400
pellagra, but overwhelmingly, if you exclude the brain, the two tissues where you are seeing the

1144
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:49,240
most dramatic effect are the two tissues that are outside of the body. Okay. So it's interesting. I

1145
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:53,080
was going to say, is it because they're outside the body or is it because of the rapid turnover?

1146
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:56,840
I think part of the rapid turnover is because they're outside the body. I mean, think about,

1147
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:01,960
think about the quality control inside your body compared to outside your body. And like,

1148
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:07,560
think about once we cross the intestinal barrier, ideally we have incredible control over what

1149
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:13,880
passes that barrier, but we have no control with what it encounters. Think about what goes into

1150
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,440
the toilet. Like would we want that inside our body in the number two, right? So I think part

1151
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:23,880
of the reason that NAD is so, and I'm guessing in their paper, if they had characterized it in the

1152
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,680
skin, that it would be high, but they didn't. So what do we know about what causes pellagra? Well,

1153
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:33,480
when you're out in the sun, you're always experiencing DNA damage from that sunlight.

1154
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:38,680
You're always repairing it. So in the skin, you have this very incredibly high NAD turnover in

1155
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:44,360
the skin, because even things that you normally think are benign, like just going outdoors is

1156
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:50,040
actually causing damage that, that you are repairing always. And so when you have the skin

1157
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:55,480
having a very high need to constantly repair itself, and then you take away its ability to

1158
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,600
do that, then suddenly you see this manifestation in the skin in the gut. What's happening is,

1159
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,840
I think part of it is that it's so energy intensive to maintain the cell turnover in the

1160
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:10,120
gut. But it's also the case that just like the skin, the gut is exposed to so many insults

1161
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,560
of just total lack of quality control over the things that come inside it.

1162
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:24,280
And my suspicion is that where you would be likely to see benefits of increasing tissue NAD

1163
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:28,600
over the short timeframe is going to be in those tissues with the highest turnover.

1164
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:33,240
Like you're going to look at skin quality and small intestinal health, both of which are

1165
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:41,160
very hard to wrap my mind around how you would design the ideal study compared to measuring

1166
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:46,120
glucose and insulin and triglycerides and lipoproteins, right? Like you know exactly what

1167
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:50,280
you would measure for metabolic syndrome. I would have to sit down and really think about how I'm

1168
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:54,280
going to measure someone's skin quality or their small intestinal health. Over the long term,

1169
01:45:54,280 --> 01:46:01,160
what you would expect is increased genomic stability, decreased accumulation of DNA damage,

1170
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:05,400
and increased telomere length, none of which have been measured.

1171
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:11,240
But also why, I mean, I could certainly think of ways that those things could not be preserved,

1172
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:21,640
even in the absence of gut and skin dysfunction. In other words, you could still see epigenetic

1173
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:30,600
damage in the presence of perfect gut and skin barrier, right? You're just saying you expect to

1174
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:37,400
see less of it if you created a better barrier. You were saying that over the long haul, you would

1175
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:43,080
expect to see less epigenetic change. Oh, okay. Let me clarify. The point that I'm trying to make

1176
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:47,720
is that if you're talking about a 12 week or 16 week time period, I don't think you're going

1177
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:51,800
to see any results unless you're looking for specific things.

1178
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:58,600
You're saying based on the non-external benefits. In other words, to understand what it's doing

1179
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,400
inside all of the other cells in the body, you're going to need a much longer time period.

1180
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:01,800
Exactly.

1181
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,760
Okay, I got it.

1182
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:09,640
Exactly. And so we basically don't have much data because we have these several week-long studies

1183
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:15,560
in humans. And if we're going to look at things going on inside the body besides those tissues

1184
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:20,680
with super high turnover, I think we're going to have to look at longer studies that have more

1185
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:21,480
relevant endpoints.

1186
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,640
So let's talk about it from the standpoint of harm.

1187
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,440
Okay, yeah.

1188
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:30,920
Because the other way we can think about this is if you're cost-insensitive, what's the downside in

1189
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:36,600
spending 100 bucks a month, which is about what you're going to spend to take the party dose of

1190
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,480
these compounds?

1191
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:42,040
So I think the potential risk is that you're sapping your methyl group supply.

1192
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:50,200
And the reason is that, like we said before, part of this cycle is when you do generate

1193
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:55,480
nicotinamide, you face the possibility that you have to methylate it and you have to pee out

1194
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:01,640
the methylated metabolite. And then the question is, well, if you're taking 1000 milligrams or

1195
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:09,080
2000 milligrams of NR a day, which for the sake of putting some numbers on it, the RDA for niacin

1196
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:13,080
is around 15 milligrams. So we're talking a hundred times.

1197
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:19,400
You are losing a lot of methyl groups. And we know this in humans because the two papers that I found

1198
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:26,040
where they did measure methylated metabolites of the nicotinamide riboside. And what you see is that

1199
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:32,520
in urine and in blood cells, you see incredible increase in the methylated metabolites of

1200
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:33,560
nicotinamide.

1201
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:41,320
But wait, so wouldn't a quick and dirty test be homocysteine should go up, for example,

1202
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:44,760
in a patient taking NR if they're losing methyl donors?

1203
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:49,080
No, I don't think so. I don't think that would be the most sensitive thing. And I think we will

1204
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:54,280
eventually see a paper showing that that's not true because I've heard Brenner on a podcast say

1205
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:59,720
that he measured homocysteine and he measured acidenazylmethionine levels in the blood and

1206
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,160
showed that it doesn't have any effect. So I didn't see that paper.

1207
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,080
Publish it up and I think it will come out.

1208
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:12,120
You're saying that you're always able to methylate folate even like we just prioritize the

1209
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:18,120
methylation of folate high enough that even if we're losing methylation capacity to NR,

1210
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:21,080
we're still going to preserve it at the folate level.

1211
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:27,080
So yeah, I don't know if we might need to back up and talk about the methylation cycle to make this

1212
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:32,920
clear, but you tell me. So the most sensitive thing that changes when you have a change in

1213
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,080
the methyl group supply is your creatine synthesis.

1214
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:40,520
Interesting. So I want to come back to that. If we jump to methylation, can we remember to come

1215
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,120
back to finish this? Because we do need to talk about MTHFR and COMT and all of our other friends.

1216
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:50,680
If we're going to do that, I think it would be much easier to talk about the methylation of NR

1217
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,960
and what you would want to measure in a study to test that. I think it would be way easier to do that.

1218
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,160
Once we've done that.

1219
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:59,480
All right. So now we're going to hopefully I'm going to write this down. We're going to come

1220
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:04,520
back to this. Let's talk about that five letter acronym that pretty much everybody's heard of by

1221
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:12,280
now, but nobody really knows what the heck it is. What is an MTHFR gene and what is an MTHFR mutation

1222
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,640
and should anyone care?

1223
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:20,520
All right. So as we had said before, a methyl group is a one carbon unit and the methylation

1224
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:28,360
cycle uses the amino acid methionine to donate that one carbon to dozens of different things.

1225
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:35,400
So what we do there is we activate methionine to S-adenosyl methionine using ATP.

1226
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:40,520
And S-adenosyl methionine is the universal methyl donor. So no matter what we're talking

1227
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:45,000
about synthesizing, what we're talking about regulating, it is always S-adenosyl methionine

1228
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,520
that donates that one carbon, that methyl group, it becomes through two steps. It becomes

1229
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:57,720
homocysteine, which is the inevitable byproduct of using it. And once we have homocysteine,

1230
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:03,960
we have two choices. We can either get rid of the homocysteine if we have an abundance of methyl

1231
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:09,240
groups, or if we don't have enough methyl groups, we will recycle the homocysteine back to methionine.

1232
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:18,440
There's two ways to do that. One is that folate, which is vitamin B9 can take a methyl group from

1233
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:25,080
amino acid metabolism and can pass it on to B12. B12 passes it on to homocysteine.

1234
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:33,400
Homocysteine regenerates methionine. Or choline can be oxidized to beta-ene, which can be

1235
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:40,120
then the methyl donor to recycle homocysteine to methionine. Those two pathways are equivalent.

1236
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:44,840
In the average person, they're probably 50-50, but it's going to depend on their dietary intake.

1237
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:54,760
To your question about MTHFR, the MTHFR enzyme is one of the enzymes that is involved in constructing

1238
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:59,800
the methyl group that came from amino acid metabolism that went on to the folate molecule.

1239
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:06,520
That's how folate passed the methyl group on to B12 and then on to homocysteine to recycle

1240
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:14,280
methionine. There's a lot of people going around saying, I have MTHFR. Well, we all have MTHFR.

1241
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,480
I have ATP.

1242
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:21,000
Exactly. It's not just misleading because we all have MTHFR. It's also misleading because

1243
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:28,600
if you look at the two common polymorphisms, which are gene variants in the MTHFR gene,

1244
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:34,120
they are so spread out in the population that what you actually see is a gradient of MTHFR

1245
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:38,840
activity that's fairly even spread across the population. You could basically divide the

1246
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:45,560
population into quintiles of MTHFR activity and you'd see it wouldn't be exactly 2020, 2020,

1247
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:52,680
2020, but it would be fairly close to that. If you have limited ability to use folate for

1248
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:58,920
methylation, there are several things that happen. The first is that you use up more choline

1249
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:06,520
and you do that because you suck at using folate and you have no problem using choline.

1250
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:11,560
So you basically say, I'm not that good at using this pathway. I'm going to use the alternative.

1251
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:15,800
And that nutritionally, that makes the choline requirement go up. At the very beginning of this

1252
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,280
podcast, I said that I'd seen some studies where some people need 1200 milligrams of choline.

1253
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:24,920
That's the people with the worst MTHFR activity. What happens is there were two different

1254
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:28,600
populations that were studied and exactly what happened to their choline metabolism was different

1255
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,480
in each population, but the commonality was- And the worst function is, remind me, it's

1256
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:43,720
ACCC, which or TTCC, which SNPs would be the quote unquote worst? The worst case for MTHFR is the C677T

1257
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:50,280
homozygous. Homozygous A or- Homozygous for T instead of C.

1258
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:56,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's the TT and then on the A1298C, it's like the-

1259
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:04,840
Yeah, for the A1298C, that one is less significant than the C677T, but you can have both of them.

1260
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:10,680
So in the best case, you have neither of them. That's like 10% or 15% of the population. But the

1261
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:16,600
next step up to have a little hit is to have- You're basically a CA or a CT and you're

1262
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:20,840
functionally pretty close to normal. I like the way you describe it actually, which is

1263
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:25,800
think of it in quintiles. Yeah. And I would even say it's less than quintiles because to your point,

1264
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:34,520
in my experience, I only see maybe 10% of people that are wild type in both. That's pretty freaking

1265
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,240
rare. I mean, I would be surprised if it's 10%. No, that's exactly what it is. I would be surprised

1266
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:42,840
if it's 10%. No, it's not exactly quintiles, but it depends what population you look at too.

1267
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:48,760
It's going to vary, but basically there's a little bit in each category and there's not a category

1268
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:54,360
that even has a large minority of the people. That's right. It's not even like ApoE where you

1269
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:58,600
can say, well, the two twos are basically unheard of and the three threes, the wild type. There's

1270
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,480
no one that's unheard of. Yeah, yeah. It's almost like I don't really know what the wild type really

1271
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:09,800
is. Yeah. I think it's misleading to call it even wild type and to say you have the mutation.

1272
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:16,280
It's really like there's a spectrum that's even more convincing than gender, right? In this case,

1273
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:23,160
it's like a very even literal, even spread. No one could make a case for binaryism in MTHFR.

1274
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:28,440
So let's for the sake of being overly simplistic, which is not necessarily a good thing,

1275
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:34,280
but to illustrate this point, let's compare the best methylators to the worst methylators,

1276
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:40,120
meaning let's take the top and bottom quintiles of MTHFR function to now illustrate the point

1277
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:44,600
you were making a moment ago before I interrupted you. Right. That's really where we have most of

1278
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:49,400
our data from. So if you compare the best, and I don't even want to call them the best methylators.

1279
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:52,840
Because they're not bad methylators. They're pretty good because they're using up their

1280
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:58,200
choline to do it. So if you compare the people with the best methyl folate status compared to

1281
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:02,520
the people with the worst methyl folate status, the people who have bad methyl folate status

1282
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:07,320
are the people who are doubling up the amount of choline that they're blowing through for the cycle.

1283
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:12,440
Now, that said, Chris, it's hard to deny. I mean, I'm getting to the point where one of my favorite

1284
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:16,600
games to play, because I just love to play games with myself when I'm reviewing a patient's labs.

1285
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:23,800
I like to predict a homocysteine based on an MTHFR. And there's an undeniable correlation,

1286
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:28,760
which is not to say I can always predict it. But when I look at your MTHFR status,

1287
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:35,560
the lower you are in your capacity to efficiently do so, the higher your homocysteine is,

1288
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:41,960
all things equal. Now, wouldn't we expect that if they're truly as efficient at methylation,

1289
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:44,920
even using choline, shouldn't they be able to compensate for that?

1290
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:53,240
Okay, so right. I think I probably misspoke when I said they're just as good methylators,

1291
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:57,960
because they're using choline. Yeah, it's a compensatory response. But the thing is,

1292
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:04,680
what you see in the literature, at least, is that studies that can show a statistically significant

1293
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:12,200
rise in homocysteine is generally limited to the people who are in the worst case scenario.

1294
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:18,040
What's interesting that I think no one is talking about, and I didn't even realize this until

1295
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:24,440
last week, is that if you subdivide those people by their riboflavin status,

1296
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:32,120
all the people who have the MTHFR genotype that look bad, that have high homocysteine,

1297
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:40,040
have bad riboflavin status. And the thing that lowers MTHFR activity with those polymorphisms

1298
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:47,240
is that MTHFR is a riboflavin-dependent enzyme, which is vitamin B2, and it has a lower affinity

1299
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:53,400
for the riboflavin as a cofactor. And so you need better riboflavin status to optimize your MTHFR.

1300
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:58,920
This is so counterintuitive, because the thing that we find clinically that is the best hammer

1301
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:03,800
is B6. Because you're not thinking about optimizing the MTHFR activity, you're thinking

1302
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:07,480
about getting rid of the homocysteine. That's right. And do you think that's the wrong way

1303
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:10,760
to think about it clinically? Yeah, I think it's the wrong way to think about it. I think it's too

1304
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:15,560
simplistic. But if someone has high homocysteine, it goes away with B6 supplementation, that person

1305
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:19,880
probably needed high B6. We should talk a little bit more about how this pathway is regulated.

1306
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:23,640
I have a feeling this is going to be a set of show notes that's going to have

1307
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:30,040
some really awesome diagrams. I actually sent Bob 30 slides on this. Awesome. Thank you.

1308
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:35,560
Okay, so let's say that you eat a steak. There are some good things and bad things about that. One

1309
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:40,600
thing is that you have a bunch of methionine in there, and you can use that methionine for

1310
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:46,920
methylation. One of the negative aspects of that is that if you have this boatload of methionine

1311
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:52,120
that comes in, you're going to generate a boatload of homocysteine. And you also don't have the

1312
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:56,840
problem of needing to recycle that homocysteine because you got a boatload of methionine coming

1313
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:00,520
in. In fact, it's probably dripping into the liver. And you can probably predict that if you

1314
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:04,200
have a lot right now, you're going to have even more coming in 10 minutes from now and even more

1315
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:10,360
coming in 10 minutes from now. So what do you do? You totally shut down MTHFR. You totally

1316
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:16,280
shut down the enzyme that uses choline. So you're not recycling it anymore. And then you flip on

1317
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:21,800
this other enzyme that's not usually active, that gets rid of the homocysteine by just breaking it

1318
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:29,400
down. And then on top of that, you want to get rid of the extra methyl groups. And you turn on

1319
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:35,480
this other enzyme that is going to use the amino acid glycine as a buffer. And then that glycine

1320
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:41,240
is going to, if it can, hold on to the methyl group for later use. But if you methylate too

1321
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:48,360
much of that glycine, you wind up peeing it out. So in this context, what the B6 is doing is it's

1322
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:53,080
activating the enzyme that kicked on when you ate the steak that helped you break down the

1323
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:58,680
homocysteine. So if a person has high homocysteine that goes down, the part of the point that I want

1324
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:05,160
to make here is that they're not different parallel ways to do the same thing. Your MTHFR shuts down

1325
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:09,400
in the fed state if you ate protein. The enzyme that uses B6-

1326
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:12,360
And when you say protein, do you mean specifically methionine or do other amino acids-

1327
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:18,760
Well, there's methionine in every protein. There's more methionine in eggs. There's more methionine

1328
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:23,160
in meat compared to plant foods, but there's enough methionine that if you just eat a meal

1329
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:26,520
that has a reasonable amount of protein, you're going in this direction.

1330
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:32,760
So take the opposite situation, which is the amino acid that falls most quickly when you fast

1331
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:36,680
is methionine. We don't preserve methionine the way, for example, we preserve branched

1332
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:43,960
chain amino acids in a non-fed state. So three days into a fast, you should have very high MTHFR

1333
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:52,200
activity. Yes. How this ties back to the patients with the B6 is that it's proof of concept that

1334
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:58,680
the B6 worked that the problem you addressed was not MTHFR. That means that part of their high

1335
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:05,560
homocysteine, it was a result of fed state homocysteine that should have been broken down

1336
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:09,480
using the vitamin B6 that wasn't broken down because they didn't have enough B6.

1337
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:15,400
The B6 is working because people need more B6. So this is actually very interesting, Chris. So

1338
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:22,040
it's almost like we should define how much methyl folate and how much methyl B12 one needs,

1339
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:29,240
even in the presence of MTHFR mutations that are quote unquote bad. And if they're still not

1340
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:34,680
lowering homocysteine, flogging them with more of that is not the answer. You have to move to TMG

1341
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:39,560
or B6 or something like that. So I think the typical supplement we would give a patient

1342
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:45,720
would have 400 micrograms of methyl folate and maybe 800 micrograms of methyl B12.

1343
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:50,920
Does that seem like even overkill, reasonable, more than sufficient? I think it's reasonable.

1344
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:54,600
And if that's not fixing the problem, you've got to look elsewhere.

1345
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,080
Well, you're not going to fix MTHFR with methyl folate.

1346
02:01:57,080 --> 02:02:00,520
No, no, that's right. If that's not fixing the homocysteine, you haven't identified what the

1347
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:01,160
deficit is.

1348
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:08,840
Yes. But we went down this direction because we were talking about is homocysteine a good indicator

1349
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:14,120
of whether you're messing up your methylation. So I think homocysteine, yes, there's data saying

1350
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,680
maybe the homocysteine is a problem in and of itself because it causes oxidative stress and

1351
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:25,880
might contribute to cardiovascular disease. But it's also just a marker that things aren't

1352
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:31,000
working right in that cycle. But it's not the only thing that goes wrong in that cycle.

1353
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:36,520
You have other alterations. So for example, what I had said at the very beginning of this about

1354
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:42,520
some people need 900 to 1200 milligrams of choline, that's because people with... And you're not going

1355
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:48,760
to fix this by fixing homocysteine. People who have low MTHFR activity are doubling the amount

1356
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:53,560
of choline that they blow through and they have problems that are a result of not having enough

1357
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:58,920
choline that have nothing to do with homocysteine whatsoever that need to be fixed by putting more

1358
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:03,960
choline into the system. So I'm not telling you that their homocysteine is going to go down when

1359
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:08,280
you put the choline in, maybe it will. This choline is a methyl donor. But what I'm telling

1360
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,680
you is that the data indicate that those people have a higher choline requirement. And the way

1361
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:18,760
that you address that is by consuming enough choline. Is there then a relationship between

1362
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:24,040
MTHFR and propensity to fatty liver disease given that a subset of patients are going to be burning

1363
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:30,280
through choline quicker and therefore have less choline to do its job in the liver? I would expect

1364
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:35,880
that that could be the case off the top of my head. I don't know if data on that. What I do...

1365
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:39,720
Hopefully there's a graduate student listening to this who's going to pick... Because that'd be a

1366
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:44,440
really interesting and elegant experiment that demonstrate that. What I do know there's data on

1367
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:51,480
is showing that 900 to 1200 milligrams of choline will do two things. One, it will minimize

1368
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:56,840
markers of oxidative DNA damage. And I'm not even sure what that mechanism is. And the second thing

1369
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:04,520
that it does is it brings choline utilization markers back down to what you would find in someone

1370
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:10,440
who didn't have the MTHFR polymorphism. And it comes back to everything that we said before

1371
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:15,480
about the relative fluxes. So if someone's using up their choline more for that process,

1372
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:19,240
I wouldn't necessarily expect them to have fatty liver, but I would expect them to have a higher

1373
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:23,480
probability of developing it if you put the other conditions in. And again, just going back to what

1374
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:28,360
you said earlier, you would generally recommend people supplement with phosphatidylcholine versus

1375
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:32,840
choline. I would prefer food. And if you're going to do a supplement, I would prefer phosphatidylcholine

1376
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:41,640
over a choline salt. So where does COMT fit into all of this? Because it's another enzyme,

1377
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:49,000
it's involved in the catabolism of catecholamines. Talk a little bit about that. So part of moving

1378
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:55,240
beyond homocysteine, one whole side of this equation is what are you methylating, right?

1379
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:59,800
Because homocysteine is a byproduct of the methylation cycle. What you're methylating is

1380
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:05,400
90% of it is to synthesize creatine and to synthesize phosphatidylcholine.

1381
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:12,440
And then the other 10% is a gradient of a handful of things that are fairly sensitive to methyl groups

1382
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:17,960
of probably and a lot of things that aren't. If you look at the next most sensitive thing to

1383
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:24,520
creatine synthesis, it's dopamine. And COMT is the enzyme that methylates dopamine. Basically,

1384
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:32,520
what it does is it modifies dopamine metabolism in a way where if you methylate more dopamine,

1385
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:38,120
you are mentally more flexible. And if you methylate less dopamine, you are mentally more stable.

1386
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:44,600
And if you're in the middle of that, it could just be a variation of your personality. But as you

1387
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:51,080
start to get to the ends of that spectrum, you start to get into the possibility of psychiatric

1388
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,960
disorders that could be a result of being in the extremes. But in the middle of that spectrum,

1389
02:05:55,960 --> 02:06:01,880
they talk about the worrier phenotype and the worrier phenotype. So the person who's the

1390
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:08,840
worrier, W-A-R, is the person who has a higher rate of methylating dopamine, is more mentally

1391
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:13,640
flexible. And that's the person that picks the battle, faces it, picks the battle, faces it,

1392
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:18,360
defeats, and just moves from one thing to the next. The worrier gets stuck on things they're

1393
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:24,920
worrying about. But you look at just like MTHFR activity, you look at COMT activity,

1394
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:29,560
and it's a perfect spread. There aren't as many different types. It's basically like 50% of people

1395
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:34,440
are in the middle, 25% are in one end, 25% are on the other end. Why is it spread like that?

1396
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:39,480
Because there's a trade-off. And so I think the worrier, worrier phenotype is a bad way to talk

1397
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:44,840
about it because actually the people with the so-called worriers, the so-called people who worry,

1398
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:52,200
W-O, yeah, it's hard to pronounce that exactly right. So the people who have a low rate of

1399
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:57,560
methylation, they're also better at doing a lot of things that require sustained focus. So better

1400
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:03,160
at academics, there was a recent study that came out that showed that competitive swimmers who are

1401
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:09,640
the low methylation phenotype get better results, they appear to do better competitively. And there

1402
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:14,120
was another study in elderly people that found that if you do an exercise intervention, the people

1403
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:21,560
with the low COMT phenotype are more likely to do more exercise because you told them to.

1404
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:26,600
So these are people where things get stuck in their mind. And things getting stuck in your mind

1405
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:33,640
is great if it's the right thing. So you are predisposed to worry more, because if you get

1406
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:37,480
an anxiety-producing thought or depression-inducing thought in your mind, it gets stuck there more.

1407
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:42,360
But also, if you're going to focus on work that needs to be done, if you're going to focus on

1408
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:49,240
goals, you might be better at that because you've put the right thing in your mind and you had a

1409
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:54,200
better ability to make it stick there. Is the other group, the warrior group,

1410
02:07:54,200 --> 02:08:00,440
more susceptible to addiction? Yeah, so if you look at the associations of the genotypes with

1411
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:10,840
different psychiatric diseases, the ones that are most clearly related to impulsivity or getting

1412
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:16,600
stuck on stuff are the ones that seem to be most consistently correlated. So obsessive-compulsive

1413
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:24,280
disorder is associated with the low methylation phenotype, whereas substance abuse and ADHD are

1414
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:30,120
associated with the high methylation phenotype. Then when you start looking at other psychiatric

1415
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:35,000
disorders, you start to get into a lot of noisy data when you look at depression and anxiety and

1416
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,240
panic disorder and things like that. But just taking the extremes, how strong are those hazard ratios?

1417
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:44,040
Off the top of my head, I don't know. Directionally, are they meaningful? Are we

1418
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:48,360
talking about hazard ratios of four and five or are we talking about like 1.17s?

1419
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:53,080
I genuinely don't remember. I can put a meta-analysis of this in the show notes that I have.

1420
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:58,360
Okay, that would be great. I mean, because this is one of those things that only once have I ever

1421
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:01,320
been asked about this, and I didn't know the answer, of course, but one of my patients

1422
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:09,800
asked me to go back and look through his genetic data to look at which SNPs he had for COMT

1423
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:14,920
specifically because of this question. Oh, yeah, I don't think it has much diagnostic utility.

1424
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:20,920
I find it interesting from creating a theoretical model of how this stuff works.

1425
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:27,000
And I think part of the reason some of the data is so noisy about, let's say, things in the middle,

1426
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,920
like depression and anxiety, which they do correlate. There are studies that show it one

1427
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:35,480
way, but it's just very noisy data. I think part of the reason it's so noisy is that it's not really

1428
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:40,360
about the genetics. You see really strong associations with genetics when you have a

1429
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:45,400
monogenic disease. Of which there's like 73, right? I mean, there's virtually none.

1430
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:50,280
It's not the norm, right? When you're talking about this, it's like, COMT is not a gene for

1431
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:56,120
a mental state. Right. It's a gene that has a partial influence on the stickiness of your mind.

1432
02:09:57,080 --> 02:10:02,680
And the way that COMT methylates dopamine is with all the methyl donors. So nutrition is going to

1433
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:08,360
play directly into that. And so your CMT genotype isn't even going to tell you the rate at which

1434
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:13,000
you're methylating dopamine. It's going to tell you the rate at which you could methylate dopamine

1435
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,080
given a certain supply of methyl donors. You've put a lot of time into this, Chris, and we'll

1436
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:22,120
make sure we link to this, but you've basically done probably a better job than anyone I know of

1437
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:28,440
at codifying the, if you have this mutation, this would be a great dietary strategy. It would take

1438
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:33,640
us another 12 hours to go through all of them. Let's touch on three of them. You pick, but it

1439
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:38,120
seems to me that the COMT MTHFR would be an interesting one to at least start with. Sure.

1440
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:44,200
So MTHFR, I think what you want to do is, number one, you want to get between 900 and 1200 milligrams

1441
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:49,320
of choline a day. That is the... And your preference, clearly. Fossil total choline. But get it from

1442
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:54,680
your food. Get it from food. Like if you can eat enough eggs and... Yep. Okay. So there's that,

1443
02:10:54,680 --> 02:11:00,520
and that has the most data backing it out of everything else that I'm going to say. But

1444
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:06,440
supplementation with creatine makes a lot of sense because 45% of your methyl demand is to synthesize

1445
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:11,480
creatine. And just to put this in perspective for the listener, when people think creatine,

1446
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:15,960
these days we think about creatine monohydrate versus creatine phosphate, which used to be the

1447
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:21,400
supplement. Creatine monohydrate. Right. So creatine monohydrate is something that most people take for

1448
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:26,440
exercise. They take about five grams a day. Back when I was in high school, we used to load it. We

1449
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:31,480
would take 20 grams a day for five days, then five grams, and we'd cycle on and off. You're

1450
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:35,880
probably not old enough to have been in that meat head phase. But the most recent literature I...

1451
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:44,040
No, I did that. The tradition lived on. It's still on the label. Is it really? Yeah. Although the most

1452
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:49,800
recent literature I've seen said just monohydrate, five grams a day is plenty. But again, for most

1453
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:56,760
people, we think of that as creatine is a phosphate donor. And in certain types of exercise, i.e. the

1454
02:11:56,760 --> 02:12:03,480
most high intensity, so weight training, for example, that burst is really a phosphate donation

1455
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:09,400
from creatine. It's not an ATP driven process. I actually wasn't really aware of the role of

1456
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:18,280
choline in synthesizing creatine. It's a role of methylation in synthesizing creatine. And so

1457
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:21,720
that whole cycle, whether you're taking the methyl groups from choline or you're taking the methyl

1458
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:27,320
groups from folate, what you do when you synthesize creatine is you start with guanidine acetate,

1459
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:30,680
which you make from the protein in your diet, and then you methylate it, and that makes creatine.

1460
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:37,800
So literally, creatine is the only thing that is super sensitive to the methyl group supply.

1461
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:43,800
So you ate that steak, you synthesized creatine. Five hours later, you're synthesizing nowhere near

1462
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:49,480
as much creatine. And the whole system is designed. So creatine tracks much more closely to say

1463
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:57,800
methionine than leucine. Yeah, because the rationale is that some things are so essential

1464
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:03,480
to the body that you don't want them to ever change with the methyl group supply. So DNA

1465
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:10,360
methylation for gene expression, you don't want to regulate thousands of genes, because you ate a

1466
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:14,440
steak and you had a bunch of extra methyl groups, you want to control that for totally different

1467
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:21,560
reasons. So that's designed to almost never change. Then there are other things that have to be fairly

1468
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:26,680
acutely stable, like your dopamine and other neurotransmitters, you don't want that to go up

1469
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:34,360
twice as much because you ate. But your creatine, you average person has 120 grams of creatine in

1470
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:38,600
their body, and they lose two grams of creatine every day in the form of creatinine that they

1471
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:43,720
pee out in their urine. And so the whole point of creatine synthesis is to keep the accounts balanced.

1472
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:51,720
So if you synthesized no creatine for an entire day, your creatine in your body is going from 120

1473
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:58,920
grams to 118 grams. It's like barely a dent. So creatine is the ideal thing to vary with the

1474
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:03,800
methyl group supply because you can eat a steak, you can do all your creatine synthesis when you

1475
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:09,000
had enough methyl groups, then five hours later you're in the fasted state and you don't synthesize

1476
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,680
creatine anymore. It doesn't matter because it's not a neurotransmitter, it's not doing an acute

1477
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:19,400
thing. You just have to make sure that in 60 days from now, your creatine isn't zero, it's still 120

1478
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:24,280
grams in your body. What determines the phosphorylation status of creatine? About 120 grams,

1479
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:28,920
how much of it has an inorganic phosphate? Oh, that's completely unrelated from the synthesis.

1480
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:36,120
That's a matter of the energy state of the cell. So just like ATP gets used when you use energy,

1481
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:41,240
creatine phosphate, so instead of kinastics- But do we have an enzyme? So the way that,

1482
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:50,600
for example, AMPK is a great surrogate for ATP, ADP, AMP, it really gives you a sense of the

1483
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:57,800
energetics. Do we have similar enzymes that give us a sense of CP versus C, creatine phosphate versus

1484
02:14:57,800 --> 02:15:01,880
creatine? I don't think there's an analogous enzyme, but there's a completely analogous energy

1485
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:06,920
state. So when you're exercising, for example, your ATP levels go down, your AMP levels go up,

1486
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:11,800
your creatine phosphate levels go down, your creatine levels go up. When you recover,

1487
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:18,600
everything reverses. So this is most studied in muscle, but in an exercising muscle, if you do

1488
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:24,680
weightlifting to failure, you're going to see the creatine phosphate go from about 100% down to about

1489
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:29,240
40% at the point of failure, and then you rest for five minutes and you're going to see most of it

1490
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:35,640
recovered. So by that logic, I mean, the reason athletes like to use creatine is for

1491
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:41,480
increasing that maximal performance or the duration of short maximal performance, right?

1492
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:45,320
It's not going to have an impact on your ability to run a marathon, but it certainly could have an

1493
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:50,280
impact. I think it will have an impact on your ability to run a marathon. You do. Yeah. Interesting.

1494
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:55,720
Because creatine does things in muscle that are independent of that. Independent of its phosphate

1495
02:15:55,720 --> 02:16:00,520
donation. Yeah. So the another thing that creatine does in muscle is that it hydrates the muscle

1496
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:05,080
more. And so you literally have. That's for sure. Yeah. I mean, that's a given just based on the

1497
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:09,000
amount of water that travels with it, right? That is a direct factor in strength in a way that has

1498
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,320
nothing to do with the duration of the exercise. Yeah. So for the listener, they should know that

1499
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,960
for anyone who's taken creatine knows this, you're going to put on about four or five pounds

1500
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:23,480
and it looks sort of like muscle. I mean, it shows up in the right places, but a lot of it's just

1501
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:28,440
water moving to the muscle, right? That's water that directly increases your muscular strength.

1502
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:32,520
Interesting. So it's not just, you know, cause a lot of guys will say, well, that's great because

1503
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:37,480
I look bigger, but the reality of it is actually functional and they're stronger. Yeah. You know,

1504
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:40,280
you could get that amount of creatine if you just ate a few pounds of meat every day.

1505
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,760
And apparently there's a diet going around these days where people are doing just that,

1506
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:50,120
but I'm not willing to commit to it. The extent to which is important to kind of modify your diet

1507
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:57,400
around MTHFR really depends on what problems are you facing and what goals do you have and to what

1508
02:16:57,400 --> 02:17:02,520
degree do you want to be anal about doing things that have theoretical payoff, right?

1509
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:10,120
So I think that for someone who has either high homocysteine or they have psychiatric difficulties,

1510
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:16,040
what you would expect from the low methylation state is for someone to be overly ruminating on

1511
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:20,760
things. And so if you feel like that's a problem for you and you feel like what you would typically

1512
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:25,160
do to be psychologically healthy is an uphill battle because of your physiology, it might be.

1513
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:30,360
And so in that case, I think you would stick more to that protocol. So obviously,

1514
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:36,120
taking creatine, increasing your choline amount is the most data-backed thing, but taking creatine

1515
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:41,400
makes a lot of sense because if you cut your methyl demand in half, then it's probably going

1516
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:47,640
to matter half as much that you're not that good at methylating, right? So you increase choline

1517
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:53,160
because that's the alternative methyl donor. You put creatine into the system because that's

1518
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:59,960
decreasing the demand. But there's another overlooked thing here, which is that methyl

1519
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:05,400
folate is, I don't know if you want to go into the reasons why, but let me just state as a fact for

1520
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:11,320
faith acceptance. Methyl folate is the thing that controls whether you pee out glycine as a methyl

1521
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:17,080
buffer. If your methyl folate level is low, I'm closing my eyes because I'm now trying to figure

1522
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:21,480
out how trimethyl glycine will fit into this because I have an anecdote to share with you.

1523
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:25,240
Well, trimethyl glycine is beta-E, which is a thing that you make from choline.

1524
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:28,520
Finish your story. I'm going to come back to this interesting anecdote because I'm looking forward

1525
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:31,560
to you explaining to me why I observed this case, but keep going with this.

1526
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:38,600
When your methyl folate level is low, your body thinks that you are in a state of methyl abundance

1527
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:42,920
and that you need to methylate glycine and pee out the methyl groups on the glycine into the urine.

1528
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:50,680
And so you probably need more glycine as well. No one's quantified it. No one's actually shown

1529
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:57,000
that that's the case, but what we know is very, very data backed in terms of how does the system

1530
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,400
work. And everything that we know about the system, how the system works says if you have

1531
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:07,160
low methyl folate levels, you'll lose glycine in the urine as methylated metabolites. And so that

1532
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:12,440
means that you do want to put methyl folate in there because you want to try to have some there

1533
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:19,640
to stop that, but you probably need more glycine. And what we know is that we can synthesize glycine,

1534
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:24,920
but the average person probably falls short of their ability to synthesize glycine by 10 to 60

1535
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:31,080
grams a day in terms of optimizing collagen turnover in the skin and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1536
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:35,000
We also know that there are studies showing that people get better sleep if they take three to six

1537
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,160
grams of glycine before bed at night. People have better blood sugar if they take three to five

1538
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:45,720
grams of glycine with a meal. So it's entirely reasonable that the average person could use

1539
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:51,240
more glycine. And so I think it's entirely reasonable to say, maybe throw some bone broth

1540
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:57,640
in here or throw some collagen in here or some gelatin or some glycine. Do you think it matters

1541
02:19:57,640 --> 02:20:05,160
whether you're getting it in bone marrow bone broth versus a supplement? It would be in the bone

1542
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:13,560
broth. And I think the big differences are between getting collagen in versus getting glycine powder.

1543
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:21,400
So for collagen and collagen is what you would get in bone broth. It's been shown to be better at

1544
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:26,040
increasing collagen synthesis. Is that see, I've never understood why that's the case. I've always

1545
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:31,400
kind of thought that that makes no sense because you eat a bunch of collagen. What basically emerges

1546
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:37,960
from your gut is free amino acids. No, there's some collagen peptides or some dipeptides in there.

1547
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:42,200
I mean, how robust are the data on that? I don't know how robust they are. I've actually told

1548
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:45,800
patients on a couple of occasions that have insisted that they take their collagen that I

1549
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:50,040
just don't think it's helping them. Well, I can believe that. For the benefit of replacing their

1550
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:54,440
own collagen. I've always been like, I just don't see how that works. I mean, the other things

1551
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:59,640
interesting more. Right. There's no good data showing that you will have less wrinkles if you

1552
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:04,200
take collagen. I've never heard of any doubt on bone health. The other stuff's more interesting,

1553
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:09,160
frankly. If you tell me that five grams of glycine in the form of collagen will produce better

1554
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:14,520
glycemic control and better sleep. That's more interesting. I'm pretty sure all of the blood

1555
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:20,440
sugar studies were done with glycine powder. I might be wrong about that. I know the sleep

1556
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:25,880
studies were done with glycine powder. All I can think of off the top of my head for a study that

1557
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:30,360
was done, and this wasn't even with collagen. It was with the gelatin, which I would assume would

1558
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:36,120
be the same. Yeah. His last name is Barr. I forget his first name, but there was a study that showed

1559
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:44,600
that before you exercise, if you take 15 grams of gelatin, but not five grams with a little vitamin

1560
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:51,400
C, you will increase collagen synthesis in the tendons. And the rationale for the study, and

1561
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:55,560
actually I didn't even look at this paper. I just listened to an interview that he did about it.

1562
02:21:55,560 --> 02:22:00,600
But the rationale was that in your muscle, your muscles met very metabolically active,

1563
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:05,400
very good at taking things up when it wants to, but the connective tissues in your joints

1564
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:10,200
are very dependent on you just pushing more blood supply there. And so when you exercise,

1565
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:16,440
you have the amino acids coming in before you exercise. And then when you're exercising,

1566
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:20,920
there's an increased blood flow that gets the collagen peptides into those tissues.

1567
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:28,120
So part of my ideas here are speculation based on why this works. And so I'm using the reasoning

1568
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:33,640
that we would expect those, like probably if you were measuring plasma glycine levels and those

1569
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:39,000
people, you'd find lower levels of plasma glycine and you'd find higher levels of the

1570
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,320
methylated metabolites of glycine. Probably if you looked in the urine, you'd find those things.

1571
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:48,280
And so it makes logical sense to say that you may need more glycine and so you can put into your

1572
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:53,080
diet in these ways, but ultimately this is like... What foods would be high enough in glycine if

1573
02:22:53,080 --> 02:23:00,200
someone was sort of opposed to... Skin and bones. Yeah. Including like chicken skin and things like

1574
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:05,480
that. So bones are the highest and skin is intermediate. And bones, to your point,

1575
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:09,160
it's not the marrow, it's the broth you make from the bone. Yeah, it's not the marrow,

1576
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:14,200
it's the broth and it's dependent on the protein content. So if you're making it homemade, you

1577
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:18,040
don't know exactly what the protein content is. I would use the metric of whether it's well gelled.

1578
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:23,800
If you assume you can trust the label, there are several bone broth products on the market where

1579
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:28,680
they say they have 10 grams per cup. And if they... And that's 10 grams of protein or 10 grams of

1580
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:33,000
glycine. 10 grams of protein, which should be about three grams of glycine. Oh my God. So you

1581
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,760
got to drink quite a bit of this stuff. Well, a cup is three grams of glycine. Yeah. But if you want

1582
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:43,240
to... That's the bottom of your three to five. Yeah, you're going to drink that before bed every

1583
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:48,600
night and it might help you sleep, right? In theory. Okay. So now that we've walked through

1584
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:54,600
the methylation stuff, I still want to go back to this NR, N-N-N thing because this is what got us

1585
02:23:54,600 --> 02:24:03,320
down this path. Right. So in the studies done by Brenner, what we do know is that an enormous amount

1586
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:11,800
of this NR is getting methylated as nicotinamide. I don't think it's possible to extract the data

1587
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:16,840
from those papers and say exactly how much because they're in concentrations. And when they're in

1588
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:20,920
urine, they're not in a 24 hour collection, they're in spot urine. I don't know exactly like what the

1589
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:28,360
up and down flux is over time. But what I can say is that just as a rough calculation to get a sense

1590
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:36,280
of how much impact you could have if the impact were maximal, for every thousand milligrams of

1591
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:43,720
nicotinamide that you detoxify, you are in theory decreasing your synthesis of creatine by 500

1592
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:51,080
milligrams. So you're synthesizing two grams of creatine in a day. So if you're taking 2000

1593
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:56,520
milligrams of nicotinamide riboside, if all of it were detoxified, you'd be cutting your creatine

1594
02:24:56,520 --> 02:25:01,560
synthesis in half. But in theory, I mean, that means that you're going from 120 to 116 instead

1595
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:06,680
of 118, right? In a day. You're talking about whole body creatine stores. I'm talking about synthesis.

1596
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:11,080
You're talking about the cellular level too. First of all, no one's taking this for a day. They're

1597
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:16,120
taking it every day if they're taking it, right? And you don't need your creatine to go to zero

1598
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:20,840
before you have problems, right? Like the bodybuilders and the athletes are taking creatine

1599
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:27,240
because they're hoping to maybe increase their body stores by about 30%. So just leveraging a

1600
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:33,640
little bit marginal increase creatine makes big results in your strength. We should clarify that

1601
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:39,000
although 90% of creatine is in your muscles and although the most famous reason to take creatine

1602
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:45,320
is to support your exercise performance. It's also been shown that five grams of creatine a day

1603
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:49,640
improves depression in women with major depressive disorder. And if you just look at the physiology

1604
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:54,920
of creatine, for God's sake, you're using it to make your sperm swim and you're using it to pump

1605
02:25:54,920 --> 02:26:02,280
acid into your stomach. So creatine is important in all kinds of areas that you would not expect

1606
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:07,480
to think about it in. So if one was going to take creatine, which I probably haven't taken since

1607
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:11,800
NAMM, you wouldn't just take it during exercise. Like if you wouldn't just take it on the days

1608
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:15,320
that you were lifting weights, which let's say you're doing that three or four times a week,

1609
02:26:15,320 --> 02:26:18,760
you would presumably want to take it daily. Take that five grams daily, correct?

1610
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:24,840
Yeah. I mean, I think on the whole, although you could say that it might be better if you take it

1611
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:30,680
after exercise with a carbohydrate bolus, it might be better if you split it up into two doses.

1612
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:34,920
On the whole, if you just take it every day and you take five grams a day and you just always do

1613
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:39,960
that, you're eventually going to get to the... Yeah, you'll hit that steady state. Yeah, exactly.

1614
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:43,640
Yeah. It's something to take daily if you're doing that, but let's steer away from the person who

1615
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:49,160
doesn't care at all about creatine supplementation. They're not even thinking of that. What I'm

1616
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:54,920
thinking about is what would you want to do in an NR study to show that you're not impacting

1617
02:26:54,920 --> 02:27:01,320
methylation? So I expect that sometime rather soon, we're going to see a paper coming out

1618
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:05,640
showing that it doesn't elevate homocysteine and showing that it doesn't affect the

1619
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:13,880
acidenosyl methionine in plasma. And my position is not that this stuff is really dangerous.

1620
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:19,320
That's not my position at all. However, I've been exposed to anecdotes of people who are taking this

1621
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:27,000
who experienced things that were really seesawing in their energy levels and were really seesawing

1622
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:32,120
in their mental and emotional states that are anecdotes that could be explained by a

1623
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:37,560
thousand other things. But to me make it sound like, geez, this thing is really sapping the

1624
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:42,440
methyl group supply. It's exactly what I would expect to happen in someone whose methyl group

1625
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:48,600
supply is being set. And would that person be better off supplementing with choline or creatine

1626
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:56,520
if they were going to pick? I would say take a lower dose of this stuff and match it with

1627
02:27:56,520 --> 02:28:01,560
a methyl donor. Yeah, in theory, you could do creatine. You'd have to test it, right? But my

1628
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:06,120
recommendation, I actually put out the recommendation. I made a video about this. I said-

1629
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:06,840
We'll link to it.

1630
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:10,840
I said match at milligram for milligram with TMG, trimethylglycine.

1631
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:13,800
Oh, that reminds me. I want to tell you about this anecdote. So we've got a patient who

1632
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:20,280
you just couldn't get his homocysteine to budge. So on our lab scale below nine or less is what

1633
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:27,560
would be normal. He's in the 13, 14, 15 region. On your standard dose of methyl folic, methyl B12,

1634
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:33,560
nothing. Even doubling it, which always makes me a little uncomfortable, nothing. Adding 50

1635
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:40,120
milligrams of B6 three times a week, which strikes me as overkill, nothing. Going to B6, 50 milligrams

1636
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:48,200
daily, nothing. Add TMG, boom. Homocysteine falls by 50%. What was going on in this guy?

1637
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:54,680
Okay. So the fact that you added B6 and it did nothing indicates one of two things. Either

1638
02:28:55,560 --> 02:29:00,360
that guy's enzyme for getting rid of the homocysteine didn't work that well, or more probably,

1639
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:06,520
this was not a fed state homocysteine issue, right? So the way these things work is you're trying to

1640
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:11,560
use MTHFR or choline to remethylate homocysteine when you're in the fasted state and you don't

1641
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:16,600
have a lot of methionine coming in. You stop doing that entirely and you start trying to

1642
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:19,960
break down the homocysteine, getting rid of it when you're in the fed state.

1643
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:24,600
So we don't know the flux. We didn't have the video. We just had a bunch of snapshots of this

1644
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:31,160
guy's homocysteine. My guess is that unlike the guy whose homocysteine went down with the B6,

1645
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:35,720
this guy, he had a recycling issue. He did not have a problem of disposing of the homocysteine

1646
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:40,280
in the fed state. He had a problem of recycling in the fasted state. He just couldn't do it.

1647
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:45,240
And he couldn't do it because his MTHFR just didn't work very well. And so only when you

1648
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:50,360
added the trimethylglycine, which is the choline pathway. So when you use choline for methylation,

1649
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:56,120
what you do is you convert it into trimethylglycine and that becomes the methyl donor that's the

1650
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:59,560
alternative. I mean, it makes me wonder now if we just supplemented more choline, if we could

1651
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:03,880
have got the same result. Yeah, I'm sure you could have gotten the same result. The only

1652
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:08,280
possibility that would prevent that would be if he had a problem with the enzyme that oxidizes

1653
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:13,480
choline to trimethylglycine. I like that it all comes back to choline. We have four chickens

1654
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:17,320
at home and my kids named them. So they have the funniest names that two of them have pretty normal

1655
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:26,040
names. There's Sarah is one of them and Bang Bang and Go Go. You can almost tell which of my kids

1656
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:32,200
named them. I feel like Sarah would feel left out. Yeah, exactly. So little Bang Bang and Go Go and

1657
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:36,760
Sarah. Now I'm embarrassed to admit on the spot, I forgot the name of the fourth chicken, but it's

1658
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:42,600
a totally normal name that's not funny because my daughter named Sarah and the normal one on my

1659
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:47,720
guy. But now I feel like even more indebted to these little guys. I mean, I've always loved

1660
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:52,040
eggs. And of course, once you eat eggs that are like coming from the chickens that you're feeding,

1661
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:58,120
the leftover vegetables on your table, like the yolks are so yellow, the eggs taste so good.

1662
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:06,360
It's very interesting to see this connection between choline, creatine, methylation. I mean,

1663
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:10,840
this is complicated stuff. And of course, the skeptic will take a step back and say,

1664
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:14,760
well, Chris, what if you're just fixing a bunch of numbers? Like, yeah, you can make

1665
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:20,280
homocysteine go down and yeah, you can do this and you can do that outside of the naffoldy,

1666
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:24,200
which there's no disputing. If you fix naffoldy, you've improved a person's life.

1667
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,120
Does it matter if homocysteine goes down? Does it matter if you're at six instead of 14 because

1668
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:35,720
you've optimized these things? I don't think we're going to. Ginger, by the way, it's Sarah,

1669
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:40,200
ginger, bang, bang, go, go, or our chick. Yeah, I would still feel left out of us. Yeah.

1670
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:45,000
Yeah. No, it's okay. So to the skeptic, no, I don't think the argument is super, super strong

1671
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:49,560
that by fixing a homocysteine, you're reducing cardiovascular risk. That's definitely not an

1672
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:55,000
airtight argument. I look at homocysteine and I say, well, look, young, healthy people have

1673
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,800
a homocysteine on average between seven and nine. That's probably the sweet spot. But yeah, I mean,

1674
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:08,760
if I were looking at that from the perspective of what is the least stuff I can do, unless I am

1675
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:16,760
very compelled by the data to do it, then I would throw out at least everything that I just said,

1676
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:21,320
except the choline. And depending on how hard of a skeptic I am, I'd probably throw out the choline

1677
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:26,920
too. And that's because this comes down to a philosophical question of what is the level of

1678
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:31,640
evidence that you need to take an action. Versus the level of evidence to not take an action,

1679
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:36,760
which people always forget that they have to ask that question just as well. Well, also versus the

1680
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:42,440
level of evidence to state that you have a certain degree of certainty or confidence in something.

1681
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:49,560
So the thing is, I think that we can be fairly, we will debate it, but I think we can be fairly

1682
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:56,440
rational and within a fairly narrow window on what do we believe are the principles

1683
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:02,120
that we need to secure to say we have a certain degree of confidence that something is true.

1684
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:10,200
But we can never create that window for saying, what is the level of evidence that I need in order

1685
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:16,040
to take an action, because that comes back to your subjective values. A lot of this is assumption as

1686
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:21,720
well. Even if you're coming to the question of what is the probability that we should assess that

1687
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:29,080
something is true. For me, I would take as a background assumption that things that have

1688
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:35,160
a proven track record in human history over a long period of time should be assumed as a default.

1689
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:41,560
Someone else may take the assumption that nothing is the default or that the status quo is the

1690
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:46,040
default. So if you're basically saying that we have to have meta analysis of randomized,

1691
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:53,240
of large randomized controlled trials on clinical endpoints in order to have something,

1692
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:57,640
you are assuming that in the absence of that evidence, we will follow the status quo.

1693
02:33:58,840 --> 02:34:04,600
So even in the case of us debating how confident we are that something is true, we have reasons

1694
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:09,560
like that to have a spectrum of agreement or disagreement. But when it comes down to,

1695
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:15,560
should I take this supplement, that comes to like subjective value over what kind of risks

1696
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:23,000
do you want to take? So look, there are some people that want to optimize their metabolism

1697
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,640
to make their body run like a well-oiled machine the best way that they know how,

1698
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:35,800
and they're willing to spend some money or design their diet around doing so. And I think most of

1699
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:41,080
what I said mostly applies to those people. I think for people who are looking for hard

1700
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:47,960
clinical endpoints, in fact, this is why there's Twitter wars over MTHFR sometimes, which is that

1701
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:54,760
they're really... Oh, thank God I missed those. So yeah, so I've gotten into some tussles on the

1702
02:34:54,760 --> 02:35:00,120
internet with some people who looked at this from the perspective of, look, there's no hard clinical

1703
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:06,360
endpoints for which MTHFR is diagnostic. There's no hard clinical endpoints for which people with

1704
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:12,760
MTHFR for whom that population has some specific dietary or supplemental regimen that alters that

1705
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:18,920
clinical endpoint. And I think that's true. Where I come from, if I were in that situation,

1706
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:23,480
I would want to bring my homocysteine down to what by all probability appears to be the healthy level.

1707
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:28,360
If I were that person, I would want to reason, well, I feel like my mind is too sticky and I

1708
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:33,720
want to loosen it up a little bit. If I were that person, I would want to have good energy, and I

1709
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:38,280
would want to use a rational assessment of why my energy might be low and what I can do to bring

1710
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:45,160
it up to normal. And I'm probably never going to convince anyone that if I feel better, that

1711
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:49,560
there's a hard testable clinical endpoint to that. Let's come back to the NR. I did a...

1712
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:53,400
I was just about to say, the one thing I really want to ask you about is in all of this stuff,

1713
02:35:53,400 --> 02:36:01,560
whether it's the increased choline, the glycine, the creatine, I think I get the sense where you,

1714
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:06,760
on your own personal spectrum of risk, fall on those. I haven't actually got a sense of where

1715
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:13,960
you fall on the NR spectrum. Personally? Yeah. Oh, well, if it helps clarify, I took 75 micrograms

1716
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:20,600
of it with breakfast and 75 micrograms with lunch. Micrograms? Miligrams, sorry. Which is still

1717
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:25,560
pretty low. I mean, that's much lower than what's provided in those supplements. Right. I got 150

1718
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:30,680
milligram capsules that I had broken half. Okay. So that's much less than what's being provided

1719
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:35,240
in basis and true nitrogen, right? Yeah, I might go up. I'm just playing around with it. It's just

1720
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:41,320
a tinkering thing. With or without a sirtuin activator? Yeah, it's the true nitrogen. There's

1721
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:48,120
no terrestil being in it. I was studying it a lot, so I figured, let me take it and see what happens.

1722
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:53,640
Which, by the way, to me, is one of the most tried and true interesting ways to do science is to...

1723
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:58,040
You have to become a little bit of a self-experimenter on this stuff. Well, H. Pylori.

1724
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:03,560
Yeah, everybody loves to point to that example. I will say this anecdotally, for the patients of

1725
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:09,960
mine who do religiously take one of those two products, Basis or true nitrogen, the one thing

1726
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:15,320
that seems to, across the board, improve, and it would be very difficult to attribute this

1727
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:23,240
to placebo, is patients who have even an inkling of rosacea seem to have a monumental improvement.

1728
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:27,560
And again, I don't know if that has to do with the skin. You know, we were talking about the skin

1729
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:35,240
again, but... Is it sun sensitive? Rosacea often is, but I don't know if I can say across the board

1730
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:39,240
if each of those patients has rosacea. No, I wouldn't say it's exclusively sun sensitive,

1731
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:44,200
right? So some people, their rosacea gets amplified by certain things in their diet. I have some

1732
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:49,240
patients, when they eat chocolate, it goes off the rails, or alcohol, or stress, or sleep deprivation.

1733
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:54,440
So no, I would say there could be multiple different triggers for it. And I remember once

1734
02:37:54,440 --> 02:38:00,120
even looking it up and finding sort of an old esoteric paper about topical niacin, I believe,

1735
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:05,800
I think it was in the form of niacin that could improve rosacea. I said before, I think that the

1736
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:12,520
skin is one of the areas where I would expect to see fast results. And so it's this question of how

1737
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:16,200
do you design, how do you pick the right people and design the right study to see an effect like that?

1738
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:21,080
And so that's interesting. Maybe a rosacea endpoint in a clinical study would have good results to it.

1739
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:27,160
Yeah, but what I'm basically taking away from you is IV NAD is not a great idea. Just on the

1740
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:32,040
principles we've described, that does not seem to be the way you want to administer it. It's much

1741
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:38,680
better to build up a hepatic reservoir of nicotinamide that's converted through the NR,

1742
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:43,480
that you can then slow trickle into circulation as needed is probably a better bet.

1743
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:48,280
Yeah, I mean, I would consider it fascinating to see studies of what is actually happening

1744
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:53,480
physiologically when people inject it, but nothing about it. But outside of that granulocyte

1745
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:57,720
response, which some people take that to mean it's doing great things like, look at how shitty

1746
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:01,880
I feel this must be doing something right. I've always taken that to mean, I don't know. That's

1747
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:08,680
why Mercury was so successful back in the day. Yeah, I mean, it makes no physiological sense,

1748
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:11,880
but yeah, I mean, a study could prove me wrong, but there are no studies and it makes them

1749
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:17,720
physiological sense. But I want to come back to one little point on the decision making thing.

1750
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:25,000
So the nicotinamide riboside video that I made, it took an anecdote of someone who posted on my

1751
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:30,200
Facebook on something else that I was doing and told like a four paragraph story about how she

1752
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:35,880
started taking the true nitrogen and she felt great for a couple of weeks, but then she started

1753
02:39:35,880 --> 02:39:41,000
feeling the energy sapping off and then dropping. And then she felt like going through a mental

1754
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:46,920
roller coaster. And I used this anecdote that obviously could have other explanations and

1755
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:54,040
clearly has no clinical measurable endpoint. And I got people just came out of the woodwork.

1756
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:58,040
Meaning pissed off. Yeah, troll it like in the YouTube comments.

1757
02:39:58,040 --> 02:40:03,160
YouTube comments should be never read. But no, but I think listen, this is I think this is

1758
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:11,160
an interesting contrast anecdote. So here there are people often pointing out that there's no

1759
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:18,920
hard data in that story who are saying all kinds of great things about the way they feel when they

1760
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:24,200
take a lot of this stuff, not realizing the hour. So not. Yeah. So I think it's irony, but it's it

1761
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:29,320
also comes back to the point where look, people are going to make a decision to take this or not.

1762
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:35,480
And there is no clear data on what it does. And so you either take the position that you're going

1763
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:39,000
to wait 10 or 20 years until we know something better or you take the position that you're going

1764
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,560
to tinker. And if you're going to tinker, you're going to tinker a lot more successfully if you

1765
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:48,760
have a working model of what's going on than if you don't. Yeah. I mean, I think it comes down to,

1766
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:53,400
and it would be impossible for me to say I don't subscribe to that ethos because I mean, look,

1767
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:58,440
I take Rapa Mison for heaven's sakes. And if you want to talk about a much bigger hammer, I mean,

1768
02:40:58,440 --> 02:41:05,160
Rapa would probably be the single most out there thing that I do. But my model is robust. Now,

1769
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:08,520
I also think I have much more data to point to. So even though people could say, well,

1770
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:15,400
oh my God, Rapa Mison is so scary. I get the point to what happens in the yeast, the flies,

1771
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:23,160
the worms, the mice, the rats, the dogs, the kangaroos, the human. So I feel like I'm standing

1772
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:29,080
on the shoulder of much more evidence, even though I'm interfering with a much more important

1773
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:34,520
sensor. I'm actually going after the God sensor, like the single most important nutrient sensor

1774
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:39,160
in our body. But at the same time, you know, you don't feel anything, right? So what's interesting

1775
02:41:39,160 --> 02:41:47,240
is if you're taking nicotinamide riboside for a way you feel, it's very confusing because I don't

1776
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:51,560
see how one can disentangle the placebo effect. I mean, I have, I think this has become something

1777
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:55,320
that has come to the public's consciousness much more. I mean, even the New York Times wrote a

1778
02:41:55,320 --> 02:42:02,760
piece on this several months ago, which is the power of the placebo effect. And I've even spoken

1779
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:08,200
with PIs who have run studies using psychoactive agents and you'd think, how could you placebo your

1780
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:16,360
way out of that? And yet they've told me that the placebo effect in terms of the post depression you

1781
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:20,520
would get with certain psychoactives is actually greater in the placebo group than the treatment

1782
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:27,560
group. So I just don't know that I trust myself to discriminate between something that works or

1783
02:42:27,560 --> 02:42:34,600
doesn't work based on how I feel. I'd almost prefer to experiment with compounds where I'm

1784
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:41,000
just pointing to biochemistry and, you know, hopefully in time some biochemical proxies.

1785
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:47,480
Of course, with rapamycin, we don't have a great biochemical proxy. We can't measure autophagy. We

1786
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:53,240
can't count our senescent cells. You know, we can't look at inflammation within our muscles, things

1787
02:42:53,240 --> 02:42:57,960
that we believe would be improving. But I just don't like the idea of having to rely on how I

1788
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:04,680
feel solely. I mean, look, if you feel like crap, that's a reason whether it's placebo or not,

1789
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:08,760
that's reason to stop. Yeah. Or if you feel like crap and then you take something that makes you

1790
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:13,640
feel great, that's placebo leverage it. Yeah. Although again, look, I mean, you could argue that

1791
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:18,200
taking heroin will transiently make you feel pretty good too. And it's sort of a dumb example

1792
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:23,320
because it's so over the top. But so Peter Thiel has this great question that he poses in,

1793
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:28,840
if he posed it in the book, you know, Zero to One, or he certainly talked about this, which is,

1794
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:34,680
what's the important truth that very few people would agree with you on? So something that you

1795
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:41,560
think is definitively the case or probabilistically very likely to be certain that you would find very

1796
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:46,040
few people to agree with you on. And this doesn't have to be just limited to what we talked about

1797
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:50,440
today. This could be anything. Should it be limited to health and medicine? No. Okay. Then

1798
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:55,400
I think that's easy. The thing that I believe strongly about that the largest number would

1799
02:43:55,400 --> 02:44:00,200
people would think I was crazy for would probably be that I'm twice the libertarian of your

1800
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:06,760
libertarian uncle. I don't know. I think you'd find a lot of people that more and more now are

1801
02:44:06,760 --> 02:44:12,520
losing faith in big government and would probably come to your aid on that. Maybe not. I believe

1802
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:17,240
there would be a few hundred. Yeah. You're that extreme in your libertarian views. All right. Well,

1803
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:20,760
then it's appropriate. I've phrased this question through the lens of Peter. What about within the

1804
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:27,640
world of biochemistry medicine, et cetera? So I think it's a very population specific thing. So

1805
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:34,040
for me, I believe certain things in the alternative health sphere that I think I'm surrounded by

1806
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:39,800
people that disagree with me on. And I spend a lot of time there that other people in the

1807
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:46,200
conventional sphere might think I'm totally right for advice. For example. So as an example,

1808
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:52,600
in the alternative health sphere, it is almost by the way, am I in the alternative health sphere

1809
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:58,680
or not? I don't know where I live. Probably. Yeah. Wow. It's a, so I think alternative medicine,

1810
02:44:58,680 --> 02:45:03,880
it doesn't really have a clear definition. Like the NIH has an arm of alternative medicine,

1811
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:09,160
but alternative medicine is basically the stuff that's not standard practice. And then when it

1812
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:13,720
becomes standard practice, it's not alternative anymore. Okay. Fair enough. So by one definition,

1813
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:19,160
you could kind of encompass everyone who's doing something progressive or on the edge or whatever.

1814
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:22,200
I mean, to the extent we would disagree with that, I would probably just modify my

1815
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:28,280
definition here. But so I find myself in the nutrition sphere, I find myself among many

1816
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:35,080
people who would throw out the RDAs, for example. So I would say people in nutrition that they're

1817
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:39,480
not RDAs, they're fairly progressive or they're fairly alternative or they're into supplementation

1818
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:43,800
or whatever, probably think that the RDAs are trash science. And I think that the RDAs are

1819
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:48,280
actually super good science. They're often outdated. They're often limited by the fact that

1820
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:54,920
if you are a committee who's producing a report that someone else is going to simplify onto a

1821
02:45:54,920 --> 02:46:01,000
four inch square on the side of the boxes of the cereal, that everyone in the 300 million Americans

1822
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:05,640
are going to just look at the number and make some assumptions about that. You have to be a lot more

1823
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:11,480
careful about what you say. But I think that we really throw the baby out with the bathwater if

1824
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:17,080
we don't look at what's been done by the people who are hardcore conventionals.

1825
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:22,120
This is your history coming back to you, right? Your appreciation for the history of how these things

1826
02:46:22,120 --> 02:46:25,400
came about. Yeah. I mean, it's not just history. I mean, for right now, one of the first things

1827
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:30,520
that I did when I started researching Niacin was I read the DRI report for Niacin, which was in 1998.

1828
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:36,200
There's a lot that you could say to criticize it. But I think that wherever you are in controversy,

1829
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:40,920
that you really have to know the core of what constitutes the conventional belief.

1830
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:45,080
Just look at my Twitter feed over the last few days, I'm in an environment where

1831
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:53,400
many people are convinced about the carbohydrate hypothesis of obesity. And in fact, one of the

1832
02:46:53,400 --> 02:46:59,480
interesting things about me is that I think I found myself very friendly with people in the

1833
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:06,040
low carb community because of things that I think are crazy in the conventional community

1834
02:47:06,040 --> 02:47:13,080
that we agree on. So for example, I think the history of the dietary guidelines and the

1835
02:47:13,720 --> 02:47:19,080
demonization of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet is completely wrong. And I've done a lot

1836
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:24,600
on that to the point where I think probably both of us for the amount of eggs that we consume,

1837
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:29,480
there is a very large number of colleagues of ours who might think that we're crazy.

1838
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:36,600
And let's take the example of the carbohydrate hypothesis of obesity. So I went into graduate

1839
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:45,160
school thinking that insulin was the cause of obesity and that you couldn't store fats in

1840
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:50,280
adipose tissue unless you had glucose there available and kind of all these things. And I

1841
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:56,920
also went in thinking that the chain of causality was from metabolic problems to obesity. I couldn't

1842
02:47:56,920 --> 02:48:01,480
figure out why on earth my professors seem to think that the causal chain was opposite

1843
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:09,640
and that obesity was causing metabolic dysfunction. I think I've come to really believe that the

1844
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:16,280
conventional view of obesity being a cause of metabolic dysfunction is true. And that puts me

1845
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:24,040
square in the middle of conventional theory on a lot of metrics. And because of the environment

1846
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:28,360
that I've put myself in with the people that I'm friends with and colleagues with, in that

1847
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:31,560
particular environment, I think it's a truth that a lot of people find me crazy for.

1848
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:36,600
Yeah, that's interesting. I mean, yeah, I've never really thought about where I said,

1849
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:42,920
I mean, you know, so my view is that obesity is actually largely a compensatory response

1850
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:47,080
for something metabolic. So that's the opposite view of you, I think, if I'm understanding you

1851
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:52,520
correctly. But it's also hard to neatly fit these views into a box. I mean, because you're always

1852
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:57,080
going to find a patient that's an exception to your rule, but that's a whole separate story.

1853
02:48:57,800 --> 02:49:01,800
There's a lot more I'd like to go into, but we have been at this for about three hours.

1854
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:07,320
So we might just have to do around two at some point in the interim. What is the best place for

1855
02:49:07,320 --> 02:49:12,040
people to find you? I know you're pretty active on social media. How do you like to engage?

1856
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:18,200
So my website is chrismasterjohnphd.com. Everything I do is posted there. I'm on Facebook,

1857
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:22,840
Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube are the main places to find me. Twitter is a good place.

1858
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:24,600
And your handle is?

1859
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:26,760
Chris, at Chris Masterjohn on all of those.

1860
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:27,160
Yeah.

1861
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:30,520
But not Chris Masterjohn PhD. That's only your website.

1862
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:36,680
Yeah, I would have made it chrismasterjohn.com. But when I decided to buy it, there was someone

1863
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:41,720
who bought it years ago and was selling the domain name for like $50,000 or something. And I said,

1864
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:43,880
I'll just add the PhD.

1865
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:45,400
That's why mine has MD, by the way.

1866
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:45,800
Yeah, yeah.

1867
02:49:45,800 --> 02:49:49,880
I didn't want to pay for the regular one. A lot of the stuff we've talked about, this will be

1868
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:55,640
some pretty robust show notes because we've got to, there's so much stuff to link to. As you pointed

1869
02:49:55,640 --> 02:50:00,520
out, so many of these things are not as difficult to, I don't want to say easy, but they're not as

1870
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:02,760
difficult to understand when you can see the diagrams.

1871
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:03,320
Yeah, for sure.

1872
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:07,640
You've done some really elegant videos on a number of these topics, which we'll link to.

1873
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:10,600
And I just want to thank you for being here, man.

1874
02:50:10,600 --> 02:50:12,120
Yeah, thank you for having me. It was great.

1875
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:14,120
How was that Topo Chico, by the way? That was your first.

1876
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:18,360
It was great. It has a slight taste of beer to me.

1877
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:18,840
Interesting.

1878
02:50:19,480 --> 02:50:24,440
I promise I didn't spike it, so I'm glad. Whenever I can give someone their first Topo Chico,

1879
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:28,920
it is such a feeling of gratification. So I'm really glad.

1880
02:50:28,920 --> 02:50:29,640
Thank you so much.

1881
02:50:29,640 --> 02:50:30,120
All right, man.
