00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Hey, Lane. Awesome to be sitting down with you today, at least virtually. I've been looking

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,680
forward to speaking with you for actually about two and a half years. I know Dom introduced

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,200
us a long time ago. We were trying to do this in person at some point, and then one thing

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,240
led to another. It became COVID, and then all of a sudden I realized you don't have

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,680
to be in person to do a podcast, though I do wish we were in person because I suspect

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,520
this will be a really long discussion and a great one. First off, I just want to say

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,840
one thing that I think people sometimes assume is that people like you and I have so much

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:53,120
in terms of viewpoints that are vastly different. I spent a lot of time reading your material

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,480
and watching your videos, and I followed your work for quite some time. I would actually

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,320
say that there are very few things that I think you and I don't see eye to eye on. Maybe

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,780
some of those things will come up today. I think they'd be very interesting. But I also

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,760
think the level of nuance and sophistication you bring to this subject matter is exciting,

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,000
which is why I want to talk with you about so many things. But I kind of want to start

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,680
by letting listeners understand a little bit about who you are and why I think you're qualified

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,400
to speak on so many subject matters. Let's just talk about, you grew up outside of Chicago,

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
if I recall?

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,160
Actually, in southern Indiana. I'm from Evansville originally. So 20 minutes from Illinois and

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,320
five minutes from Kentucky.

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,640
Impressive. Wow. That's not often you can straddle that many borders, right? What kind

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,160
of sports did you play growing up?

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Baseball was my primary one. I played since I was five and I leathered in high school.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,200
But it was, I would never say that sports came naturally to me. It was definitely something

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,280
I really had to work at. And that may be apparent for my baseball aficionados out there. I was

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:13,560
a five foot 10 right handed first baseman. So that's not your prototypical first baseman.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,920
But I really enjoyed baseball and it kind of stoked my competitive fire. And then I

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,680
also did run cross country in high school as well, which definitely not the sport that

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,480
you would pick as the precursor to strength sports and bodybuilding. But those were at

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,920
the time kind of like the ones that I sucked the least at, I guess is the way I'll put

30
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,160
it in terms of natural ability. And yeah, baseball was my real passion, though, growing

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,280
up. That's what I really enjoyed.

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,320
Was it during baseball and, you know, learning to get conditioned for baseball that you kind

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,320
of discovered the weight room and your talents in the weight room?

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:05,800
So I would actually say no, that was more so I was very, very much picked on. And I

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,200
would say like borderline like emotionally abused by my peers growing up. I was a nerdy

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,240
kid. I had ADHD. I was talkative. I was goofy. And so when you're you know, all that stuff

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,560
can help you when you get older, because being different is good when you're older. But when

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,120
you're young, being different is not so much fun. So I got picked on a lot, didn't really

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,800
get much attention from girls. And just to be quite frank, I started lifting weights

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,120
just to hopefully have people stop picking on me and and get some dates and lifting weights

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,040
didn't do either of those things. But I developed a passion for weight training. And I wouldn't

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,120
say it was something that like really, really came naturally. I was never like a hyper responder

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,080
or anything like that. But I just I really, really enjoyed it. And I'd always been somebody

44
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,400
who in my scholastics, I wouldn't say things really came that easy to me either, because

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,760
probably a little bit because of my ADHD. But I was able I did find at a young age that

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,120
through sheer volume of work, I could overcome a lot of that stuff. And so I really appreciated

47
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,600
lifting weights, I guess from the perspective of the work investment to the payoff, compared

48
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,400
to how much talent was needed, seemed to be a lower threshold. So it didn't, you know,

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,480
if you're five foot 10, right handed, and you're trying to pitch in the big leagues,

50
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,880
you're pretty limited, you know, now, certainly there are limitations in terms of like hypertrophy

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,200
and strength building. But for me, it just, it felt more fair, I guess, in terms of level

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,560
of work you get in versus what you see. And then in terms of, I think the other thing

53
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,720
is, it's very measurable. If you go if you if you lifted a certain amount today, and

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
in two months, you go in and you're lifting, you know, 10% more than that. That's a very

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,480
hard outcome. There's no, there's no I think I'm getting better. It's like, no, I am getting

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,440
better. And so I think, you know, I appreciated kind of that black and white to weightlifting.

57
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,600
You know, I can sort of appreciate so many of the things that you just said, and among them is sort

58
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,240
of an early discovery for training. For me, it was more boxing, that was the thing that kind of

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,120
drew me in young, but but in parallel to that strength training and endurance training, both

60
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,360
became supportive pillars to boxing. I was fortunate, I think, and that I found great mentors

61
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,720
that, you know, introduced me to powerlifting when I was young, they were older men that trained

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,200
in a gym at the university that I trained at when I was 13 and 14 years old. Did you find mentors

63
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,640
like that who kind of took you under their wing to keep you safe and also explain the sport and,

64
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,520
you know, give you some common sense around training? I would say the first few years, no,

65
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,960
actually, when I, you know, I, I always joke that, you know, I think I didn't we didn't have a lot of

66
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,160
money growing up. And, you know, I didn't really have, you know, Southern Indiana wasn't really a

67
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,320
hotbed of fitness information. And I'll go ahead and date myself. I'm 39 years old. So when I

68
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,840
started was, you know, you know, in the late 90s. And so I mean, basically, what you had was,

69
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,960
was bodybuilding magazines. And I really couldn't afford a subscription to those either. So I

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,880
actually the first thing I ever did when I got the weightlifting was I walked down to my local

71
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,760
library, literally walked down to my local library and checked out books on weight training.

72
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,600
Do you remember some of the books you checked out?

73
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,400
Oh, man. I wish I did. But I don't. And actually, I would say like,

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,280
the what I do remember, especially for one particular book, which was,

75
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,840
it's kind of like basics of strength training or something like that.

76
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,120
What that bad actually, you know, we have really advanced our understanding of weight training,

77
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,880
but, you know, the basics, progressive overload, that sort of stuff is still still relatively

78
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,960
similar. And I remember the book did talk about periodization, which at that time kind of was

79
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,440
not a new concept in athletics, but for weightlifting was a new concept. And so anyways,

80
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,880
like that, that was kind of like my first few years was a little bit self guided, or when I had

81
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,680
lifting classes, they did offer a class on lifting in high school. It was kind of just doing what

82
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,920
whenever the football team was doing, basically. But obviously, I still got stronger, just because

83
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,400
if you're consistent, you will get stronger, regardless of what you're doing. And then at 19,

84
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:55,240
I ended my first bodybuilding competition as a teenager. And just by pure serendipity,

85
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,760
I was I wanted to compete in drug tested bodybuilding, I don't have any, I always have to

86
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,240
give this caveat. You know, I've always been drug free in terms of anabolic steroids,

87
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,400
growth hormones, you know, all that kind of stuff. No performance enhancing drugs.

88
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,520
I don't have any problem with anybody who does it as long as they compete in untested

89
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,920
organizations. That's my my caveat. I always just chose to compete drug tested because

90
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I just never felt called to be Mr. Olympia or anything like that. And I, you know, again,

91
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,160
I don't, this is my own personal ethos. I'm not judging anybody who's ever done performance

92
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,600
enhancing drugs. I just wouldn't have felt good about myself. That's, that's the only thing I can

93
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,000
say. And I'm not saying that anybody who's done that shouldn't feel good about themselves. I just

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,880
knew I wouldn't feel good about myself. So with that out of the way, I was doing a drug tested

95
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:53,960
bodybuilding show and pretty much the only natural bodybuilding evidence based natural

96
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,480
bodybuilding coach lived in my hometown. And his name was Dr. Joe Klimzetsky. And I reached out to

97
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,640
him because he wrote for the natural bodybuilding magazines. And he helped prep me for the show.

98
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I won the teenage division and the novice division. And I was hooked, of course. But also

99
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,480
he, I mean, Dr. Joe wasn't right about everything, obviously, but the crux of his information and

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,600
being, you know, being so focused on being evidence based and, you know, not necessarily buying into

101
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,240
dogma, that sort of thing. That definitely did help me. And just listening to him talk about,

102
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,680
you know, the physiology of, you know, for example, a water depletion is something very

103
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,680
common amongst bodybuilders. And, you know, the first meeting we ever had, he's like,

104
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,680
yeah, I don't do that because I don't think it's a good idea. And he listed out all the

105
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,240
physiological reasons why he didn't think it was a good idea. And it made a lot of sense. So

106
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,120
but I remember listening to that thinking, man, I don't know any of this stuff. Like I would love to

107
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,000
to know more about this. And so I think meeting Joe, that was part of the reason that I really

108
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,400
wanted to learn more about the human body and push more in academics. And he had a PhD.

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,360
And I think that was kind of like the first seed of maybe I want to go even further than just like

110
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,800
an undergraduate degree or something like that. So there are actually several things in there that

111
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:36,120
I want to go back and revisit. I'll start with the latter. You mentioned ADHD, were you was school

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,960
kind of hard for you? And was this a big step forward to think, hey, not only am I going to go

113
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
to college, but I'm probably going to want to do a PhD to follow in this guy's footsteps, not

114
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,720
we're not necessarily following his footsteps, but to really go deep into something scientific.

115
00:10:50,680 --> 00:11:00,440
Ah, I think by the time I got to college, I had developed really good study habits. And so let me

116
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,120
back up. Yeah, school was difficult for me. It was very difficult for me to stay focused. But

117
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,080
I think just through sheer effect of my parents basically beating into my head from a young age,

118
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,360
you are going to college and you are going to get an education, you know, that sort of thing. And,

119
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,040
you know, not I don't want to sell like it was an overbearing parent sort of thing. It was just,

120
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,200
they were very committed to my education, but it was never like, oh, you need to go be a doctor or

121
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,640
you need to go do this, you need to go that. It was just, we want you to get educated. And I wanted

122
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,800
to get educated too. I was the first person in my family, even like my extended family,

123
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:51,160
ever to even go to college. And so I think the ADHD made it tough at first. And I never got

124
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,560
bad grades in school, but I struggled in terms of the teachers would really complain about,

125
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,320
you know, how my lack of attention, my lack of focus, those sorts of things. And I,

126
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:13,240
so I found for me, when I had to study, I really had to spend a lot more time than most of the

127
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,080
students my age were doing. So I took, for example, advanced chemistry in high school,

128
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,920
and I'll never forget this conversation. We had a test coming up and I had studied for probably

129
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,080
a total of like 15 hours, I'd say for this test, which in high school is a lot for a test,

130
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,320
at least for me, seemed like a lot. And I remember talking to a friend of mine who got the same grade

131
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,800
I did on the test. And he was like, yeah, you know, I studied a little bit about last night.

132
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,880
And I was thinking, man, if I studied just last night, I would have failed this test, you know.

133
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,520
So it did seem like I had to do more work and it might not even been more work. I just,

134
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,160
if I tried to sit down for like eight hours, I remember my roommate, my freshman year in college,

135
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:11,480
great guy, he's now a head, he was the head of medicine at Naples General for several years,

136
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,440
but he could sit down for eight hours straight, have complete silence and just study the whole

137
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,360
time. If I tried to do that, I'd get about 30 minutes of productive studying in. So I had to

138
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,880
learn to kind of break things up. And I'm not saying this works for everybody with ADHD, but

139
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,040
for me, it worked. So I would get distracted so easily that I just stopped trying to fight that

140
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,800
and I allowed myself to get distracted, but I'd always come back. So I would do 30, but no more

141
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,720
than 45 minutes at a block. I would do that and then I would take 15 minutes and I would let myself,

142
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,440
you know, browse the internet or read something else or watch some TV or something like that.

143
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,040
But I would always put a timer on and I would go back when it was time. And that seemed to really

144
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,680
work personally for me. So by the time I got to college, I had, I kind of had figured out what

145
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,560
worked for me studying wise. And I went to a college called Eckerd College, which is a private

146
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:15,320
school in St. Petersburg, Florida, which was, you know, on the ranking, it was very selective

147
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,920
at a high quality school, all this kind of stuff. And so I was petrified because I'm this kid from

148
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,680
Southern Indiana. I've never been anywhere really. And I have no idea how I'm going to stack up

149
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,320
against, you know, students from other places like, you know, the Northeast and that sort of thing.

150
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,120
So I was so petrified. I studied so hard. I got A's. I still remember this. I got A's on my first

151
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,480
11 tests I ever had in college because I was so petrified about failing. So I think by that point,

152
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,640
I had already had good study habits. You know, I did take like Ritalin and Adderall growing up.

153
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,160
And I do think those helped a little bit. The only, I always joke, like the only problem with like

154
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,200
Adderall is whatever I was doing when it kicked in was what I was going to be doing for the next

155
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:09,000
eight hours. You know, so if I, I remember one day I was, I was looking up fantasy football rankings,

156
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,680
first year I ever played fantasy football. And that I did that all day, all day when it kicked in.

157
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:23,400
And I went from worst to first in fantasy football that year. And so anyways, but by the time I got

158
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,960
to grad school, I was kind of able to wean myself off that. I think the last time I ever took any

159
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,840
medication was 15 years ago. And I think a lot of it, you know, I don't judge anybody who takes

160
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,240
medication for it because like I said, I think it did help. But I think I just got to the point with

161
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,160
my study habits where I didn't really feel like I needed it. And yeah, so I just think the fact

162
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,960
that I had to struggle a little bit when I was young actually really helped me and kind of like

163
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,160
carterized me in terms of like being able to deal with some adversity. And I think that's what really

164
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,680
helped me when I went to college and then grad school. So I'm going to put on the back burner

165
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,080
for a moment some of the stuff I want to come back to with respect to your training history and

166
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,360
continue down this sort of academic thread. Talking a little bit about the decisions you made

167
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,120
to then pursue higher education beyond a bachelor's degree and how you decided to,

168
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,400
for example, pick a PhD and then further decide what what area you wanted to study.

169
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,080
So this is just like one of those things where you look back and you go, wow, I really stumbled

170
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,840
into doing some of the right things having no freaking concept of what I was doing at the time.

171
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,640
So when I originally went to school, I went for I went to Eckerd because I wanted to study marine

172
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,040
science. When I was growing up, I wanted to be a shark biologist. Like I that was my passion with

173
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,280
sharks. I still love fishing and I still love going out and and being in the wild with sharks

174
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,360
and that sort of thing. In fact, one of my goals is to dive with a great white shark at some point.

175
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,480
Did you see that? Did you see that Nat Geo special that tracked or that it was based on something

176
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,960
that happened in Hawaii, I think two years ago where that whale came ashore. They took it. This

177
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,200
was off Honolulu or off Oahu. They took it five miles out and they went out there to study the

178
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,080
tiger sharks that would be feeding off it. And lo and behold, like the largest great white ever

179
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,600
came up upon it. Oh, you must see this. We'll link to it in the show notes. This is one of those

180
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,480
things where one day I was walking through the playroom and my kids were fixated on it. And I

181
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,400
sat down for two minutes to watch it. And then an hour later, I'm still watching it. Couldn't stop,

182
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,440
but I won't spoil it for you then. I'll just I'll just leave it at that and say you will go

183
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,680
bananas watching this thing. And it's it's yeah. Cool. Yeah. I think I watched Jaws about 8,000

184
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,360
times when I was a kid. So I probably will enjoy it. I still get excited for shark week whenever

185
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,920
it comes up. So anyway, I went to Eckard for that. And I remember I interviewed at Florida Institute

186
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,320
of Technology as well. And one of the professors there actually studied great white sharks. And

187
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,200
you know, he I'm very thankful for this guy. I can't remember his name, but he said,

188
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,400
look, I'm not telling you not to do this. I'm just going to be honest with you about

189
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,400
what I do. He said, I've got a job that maybe one in 10 people in the entire world have.

190
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,800
I don't get paid great for it. And it was really hard to get. Now, I'm not saying you can't get

191
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,880
that. But what I would recommend to you is if you're truly passionate about this, go to a degree

192
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,880
in a more general science and then go specialize when you get to graduate school. He said, because

193
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,600
if you start general, you'll still have the base that you need for grad school.

194
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,040
And if you're still really passionate about this, you're going to need the grad school

195
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,200
education anyway. And I thought, okay, well, that's not a bad idea. And so I actually went,

196
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,880
instead of marine science, I started in biology. And then my first year I had a general chemistry

197
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,520
professor named Chris Knobble. And I actually still keep in touch with him to this day here

198
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:13,080
and there. And we were in lab one day and I think he really liked me, like just my attitude.

199
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,680
And he said, Lane, come here. He's like, I know you're doing biology. He's like, what you need to

200
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,960
do is biochemistry. And I was like, well, why do I, you know, I'm a freshman. I have no idea what

201
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm doing. Like, why do I want to do biochemistry? He said, well, let me do it this way. He's like,

202
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,080
if you decide that you don't want to go to grad school and you have a biology degree,

203
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,920
you look like a pre-med who didn't get into med school when you go to get a job. He said, but

204
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,280
if you get a degree in biochemistry, the world is your oyster. You can get any job that you'd be

205
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,080
able to get in biology, you can get with biochemistry and then some. And if you want to go

206
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,400
to grad school, you have that option, this and that, by the way, I'm not slamming on biology

207
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,360
students out there. If you love biology and that's what you want to do, no worries. This is just what

208
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:09,560
he said. So anyways, I was like, okay. So I switched to biochemistry and my second year,

209
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,240
I took organic chemistry and I had a great professor for organic chemistry. It was very hard.

210
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,520
He was not easy, but he was firm but fair. And I, if I look back, my best mentors were always firm

211
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,880
but fair. And I got a B in the class, but at the end of the semester, he asked if I wanted to come

212
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,920
do research with him over the summer. And I was kind of like, well, why do you want me? I, you know,

213
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:41,480
I got a B. He's like, you asked a lot of questions. You were engaged. He said grades matter, but at the

214
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,400
end of the day, I want students who are passionate and work hard. And I saw how hard you worked.

215
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,440
So I went and did research with him over the summer. That was my first kind of foray into research.

216
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,840
Didn't get anything done because, you know, it's 10 weeks and it's my first experience in research.

217
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,120
So I got to deal with a lot of frustration and stuff not working. But I got to do research with

218
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,840
him for two years over the next two summers. And when I got to my junior year of college,

219
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:20,440
I think having that idea of, okay, what happens next? I had started writing articles for

220
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,800
bodybuilding.com. Again, that's another whole other conversation of serendipity. And I knew I was

221
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,560
really passionate about bodybuilding because during that time, like I said, I'd gotten into

222
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:39,160
competing and whatnot. And but I was thinking, well, I don't feel like I'm going to be a

223
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:46,120
professional. I don't feel like I really know anything. I just I had crested the Dunning

224
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,160
Kruger and I was down in the valley, you know. By the way, that's such a great, that's such a

225
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,840
great point to make. Why don't you explain to people who don't understand what the Dunning

226
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,640
Kruger curve looks like and what it means? Yeah. So if you look at any subject and I'm

227
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:08,600
generalizing very much. So if Dunning or Kruger listens to this, I apologize if I butcher it. But

228
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,880
essentially, so the Dunning Kruger curve is basically perceived knowledge versus actual

229
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,880
knowledge. And the really interesting thing is when we start in a subject, since we are aware

230
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,520
that we have no knowledge, our perceived knowledge pretty much aligns with how much

231
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,640
knowledge we have, which is none. But pretty quickly, our perceived knowledge skyrockets.

232
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,800
It goes very, very high, usually after about six to 12 months of being involved in a particular

233
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,520
subject. And we get to this. Some people never get to this inflection point where it starts to come

234
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,440
back down. But eventually, if you keep learning and keep learning and keep learning, you realize,

235
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,040
oh wow, I didn't know as much as I thought I did because I thought I knew that. But then this

236
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,880
contradicts it. And so you start having this like downward turn, even though you're learning more,

237
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,680
your actual knowledge is going up, your perception of your knowledge starts going down. And I would

238
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,160
say my third year of graduate school was where it got to the very bottom. This is where it got to

239
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:20,040
the very bottom. And interestingly, if you look at the Dunning-Kruger effect, you, I have a friend

240
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,080
named Jeremy Linneke, he's a professor at Ole Miss, and he always says, once you drink from the

241
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,080
fountain of knowledge, you will thirst for the ignorance you once had. And you never, your

242
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,880
perception of your knowledge, if you continue learning, will never reach that initial crest

243
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,040
that you had that first six to 12 months where you thought you had kind of everything figured out.

244
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,840
I just can't agree with that more. Bob Kaplan often says, and I'm sure he's paraphrasing

245
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:54,280
somebody that the further you get from shore, the deeper the water gets. And again, it's a

246
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,800
slightly different way of saying basically the same idea. And I, again, what I thought I knew

247
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,160
about nutrition 10 years ago relative to what I know today, in absolute terms, I know infinitely

248
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:12,200
more today, but in relative terms, ie the perceived terms, it's basically to the point where

249
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,880
I pretty much think I know nothing. Now I know that's not true, but there are days when I think

250
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,760
I actually don't know nothing because to your point, you're constantly looking for the example

251
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,280
that contradicts your belief system. And so you have a belief system, which is well, you know,

252
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,960
under this condition or this condition, or these set of conditions, this must be true.

253
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,160
There's always going to be an exception to that. There is something else though, I think,

254
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:45,240
I mean, I think unfortunately, social media has created a lot of people who shout really

255
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,520
loudly from the top of the Dunning Kruger, that initial peak of the Dunning Kruger curve.

256
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,360
And I'm not sure if it's just blind stupidity, willful ignorance or what, but I think there are

257
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,920
a lot of people who have no interest in moving forward, right? And that's unfortunate, but

258
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,080
I think that makes it very difficult for people who want to learn because it makes the signal

259
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:17,240
noise problem very difficult. You know, for example, nobody really wants to hear uncertainty.

260
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,320
Like if someone's in the market for knowledge, do you want to hear it from that person

261
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,120
whose absolute knowledge is high, their perceived knowledge is perhaps low,

262
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,160
and they caveat things that they talk about? Or do you want to hear that person who's nine months

263
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:39,080
into their, you know, resurrection of knowledge and speaks like they know everything, you know,

264
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,640
you're you're you we tend to gravitate more towards that person. So I find this phenomenon

265
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,640
very interesting. And I just had to make sure we spent a moment on that based on your reference.

266
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,360
We had a guy named Alan Levinovitz on our podcast, who's a professor of religious studies, but

267
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,520
not to get too far down the rabbit hole on that. But he he's done a few books about naturalism and

268
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,040
how we kind of even without evidence default to believing that something that's natural,

269
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,000
even though he talks about how we can't really define that is better. And one of the things he

270
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,120
talked about was, if you want to look for people who know what they're talking about, and it is

271
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,480
difficult, as you said, because there's this sea of information out there. Look for people who seem

272
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:31,640
unsure. He's like, it's he's like, it's a complete paradox, right? Because what another friend of

273
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,320
mine, Greg Knuckles said, he said, what we're what if people are really good at when they talk to

274
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,200
somebody quickly, they can determine whether or not that person knows more about a subject than they

275
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,640
do. What we're really bad at is if two people have more knowledge on a subject than we do,

276
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,280
and they're in disagreement, we have a lot of problem picking out who is more knowledgeable

277
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,480
of the two, we tend to just default to whatever our bias is, which, by the way, is why debates tend

278
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:08,520
to be a very unhelpful forum. Yeah, I don't. I always tell people, debates favor people who can

279
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,560
speak well. Debates, debates tend to favor people who can speak well. And at the end of the day, I

280
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,600
mean, it doesn't matter what's talking about religion, politics, nutrition. 95% of the people

281
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
are going to go with whatever their perception was before the debate. And then that little 5% of the

282
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,400
independents are going to make their decision usually based not necessarily off evidence,

283
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,000
because, I mean, if you don't have a PhD in something or an advanced degree, you know,

284
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,520
if two people are citing studies, who do you go with? It's very, very difficult. So,

285
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,480
yeah, so just all that to say, I didn't feel like I really knew anything,

286
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,840
is three years into my biochemistry degree, even though I was getting good grades and

287
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,600
didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I wanted to be in the fitness industry,

288
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,320
like I was very passionate about bodybuilding, but I had no idea how I was going to make a living

289
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,640
doing that because at that time, you know, this is circa 2003, you know, the people who made money

290
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,360
in the fitness industry, either you owned a supplement company, you owned a gym, you were

291
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,360
a personal trainer, or, you know, you wrote for a publication or something like that, you know.

292
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,760
And I didn't have the capital to start a supplement company or the wherewithal to do that. And I

293
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,080
didn't really want to be a personal trainer. And so I just kind of was like, well, if I go to

294
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:41,480
graduate school, I'll learn more. Maybe I won't feel so stupid. And I can delay the real world a

295
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,480
little bit longer, figure out what the heck I actually want to do. And hopefully, I won't be

296
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,240
in the unemployment line if I have a master's or PhD. And that was that was literally my logic.

297
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,560
Now, how did you how did you toggle between because I could see at that moment in time,

298
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,120
you choosing between two paths, right? You could have gone very deep down the exercise

299
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,240
physiology path. And you could have gone very deep down the nutrition path, you chose the

300
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,080
ladder, of course, curious as to how you thought about it at the time. Yeah, I think probably the

301
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,920
magazine shaped some of my bias, there was a lot of focus on nutrition as opposed to training. And

302
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,120
even to this day, you know, this could be a little bit of selection bias. But I get a lot more

303
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,520
questions about nutrition than I ever do about training. And even like me, like people were like,

304
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,320
I hear it, well, it's 80% nutrition, 20% training. And I'm like, Listen, I have a PhD in nutrition,

305
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,680
I will tell you, training is the most powerful thing for your health and body composition that

306
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,720
you can possibly do. You know, a protein you want, you can do all these modifications with your diet,

307
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,360
you want, if you don't train, the changes to body comp are going to be pretty minimal, you know,

308
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,480
in terms of you can lose fat, but you're also going to lose a little bit of lean body mass with

309
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,600
it when you when you diet. And you can gain lean body mass, but you're also going to gain body fat

310
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,320
with it. You know, resistance training specifically is the most powerful tool you have to change your

311
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,960
body composition. And I would actually argue your overall health as well. But at the time, I was very

312
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,480
focused on nutrition and specifically had just started kind of reading studies on muscle protein

313
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,200
synthesis, just I was always a skinny kid growing up, you know, I wasn't a fat kid, I was I was a

314
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,720
skinny kid growing up. And so I was mostly focused on how do I build more muscle? How do I maximize

315
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,800
muscle building? I wasn't really focused on how do I get super late? Wait, let me that that goes back

316
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,920
to a question I wanted to ask you earlier, Lane. We kind of glossed over the fact that at 19, you

317
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,480
win a drug free amateur bodybuilding contest, which happened to be your first. When did you start

318
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,160
lifting weight seriously? How old were you? So I started and stopped because I got my first

319
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,520
girlfriend. So I started when I was like 15 years old, stopped when I was 16, because I got my first

320
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:03,960
girlfriend. And then I picked it back up when I was 17, almost 18, and then never dropped it out

321
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,960
after that. Okay, so when you go to that second pickup, give me a sense of your, your height,

322
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,760
your weight, your body comp, and then contrast that with what you looked at what you looked like

323
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:24,040
at 19. So I actually remember exactly how much I weighed, I was about I was right under five foot

324
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,120
10. I'm now five foot 10 and a half. So I essentially was pretty much stopped growing.

325
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,520
And I was 152 pounds. And I remember that because the day I picked back up weight weight training

326
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:45,000
was in November of I want to say 1998. No, 1999. And it was at a bigger, faster, stronger seminar

327
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,640
that came to my school, because I decided to get back into strength training because my girlfriend

328
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:58,120
had dumped me very shallow reasoning. And they weighed us at the bigger, faster, stronger

329
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,200
seminar. And for whatever reason, I always remember that now when I started originally,

330
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,920
I was 140 pounds as a freshman, I started lifting some weights. But at this when I picked it up

331
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:14,040
and never dropped it, I was 152 pounds. And then for my first show, I, I had peaked in the off

332
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:23,240
season, I guess it would have been two or three years later, two years later, at 200 pounds.

333
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:33,240
And I competed at 175 pounds, probably something like that. And I was by that time I grew an extra

334
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,360
half inch and was five foot 10 and a half. And yeah, so I guess it would have been about two

335
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:47,080
and a half years later when I when I hit that hit that mark. And, you know, I did by the end of my

336
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:55,000
high school career had gotten to be like one of the I was a bigger guys in the class, but a little

337
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,720
more muscular than other people, but other people had started to notice. But specifically my upper

338
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,200
body because my legs were still terrible. Because for the first year, I didn't really train them

339
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,280
because you know, leg training sucks. Was there a point when you just discovered you had a gift of

340
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:18,600
strength, you know, I remember talking to Mark and Chris Bell. And on the podcast with them,

341
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,520
I talked about these brothers that were around when I grew up, they were they were an age above

342
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,320
me. So they weren't my peers. But by the time I was a teenager, they were in their 20s. And they

343
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,600
were always in the gym when I was there. And there were four of them and they were freaks of nature.

344
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Now, they were also all of them taking Herculean doses of anabolic steroids. But I saw them both

345
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,280
on and off steroids. And the steroids simply took their God given abilities and made them

346
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,760
out of this world. But I mean, I'll never forget one of the brothers,

347
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,840
who at the time was in residency, he was doing his residency in emergency in emergency medicine.

348
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:03,000
So he was very he was his training volume was a fraction of what it was when he was in college,

349
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:12,840
he would still come into the gym between shifts, narrow grip 315 for 12 cold, like it was nothing,

350
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:21,240
you know, on his way to squatting 505 for like, unwrapped, by the way. And like, there was just

351
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,400
a genetic gift that these guys had. And I sort of assumed like, yes, they train very hard. But pretty

352
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,960
early on, they knew that they were strong. And it was clear just based on the hereditary nature,

353
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,280
did you I mean, you're you're you're your best totals nearly 1800 pounds, correct? Yeah. So,

354
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,120
again, I don't want to for a moment, take away from how hard you work, because I know how hard

355
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:51,480
you work. But was there something that clicked in and said, I'm way better at this naturally than

356
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,760
I will be at baseball?

357
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:05,000
Um, so I would say actually, no, it never never clicked at that time. There was because I never

358
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,080
had like, I never had a period of time where my gains were just crazy. I never really had that.

359
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,360
What happened was, I saw that when I was very consistent and very steady, I had very steady

360
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,560
increases. And so it was never like, oh, you know, we I put, you know, 50 pounds on my bench press

361
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:33,080
in six months, it's like, oh, this is the thing I'm I'm doing now. It was just a very steady

362
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,840
progression. And I think that was actually good for me, honestly, because I think if I'd had a

363
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:44,680
lot of success right out of the gate, I might not have pushed as hard or been as consistent, because

364
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,080
it's kind of this weird paradox with me, the harder something is the more I want to do it.

365
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:59,800
So, and I do see this as it comes naturally to people, and they don't have those kind of

366
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:07,480
resistance early on, in terms of having to overcome like plateaus and frustration and setbacks.

367
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,200
And I encountered all those pretty early on. And I think having a little taste of that

368
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,640
enabled me to push through much bigger setbacks in the future. So honestly, I can't think of a

369
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,000
time when I ever was like, wow, this is now I will tell you, when I got to college, and was

370
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,360
training consistently and able to really eat consistently, because even though, you know,

371
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,360
it's calorically dense food, I was trying to build muscle like that. I wasn't really concerned about

372
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,600
the fact that, you know, I'm eating more calories, because one, I was using them. And two,

373
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,480
I just wanted to be bigger. Like I didn't care if I put on a little bit of body fat.

374
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,880
So there was a point when I got to college where I was like, you know what, maybe,

375
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,680
maybe I can do this, because I would look at, you know, some of the other, I'd search online to try

376
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,640
and find any like teenage bodybuilders, you know, and I look at it, come to find out partly

377
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,600
delusionally, because people on stage photos always look way less impressive than they

378
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,440
actually look in person. But I would wait way less or way more? Oh, way less. So if you see an

379
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,040
actual like, you know, competitive bodybuilder in person compared to how they look on stage in the

380
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:31,560
photos, usually way more impressive in person, in terms of their girth or definition, muscle size,

381
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,040
muscularity, everything. Oh, that's so that's counterintuitive to me. I don't really follow. I

382
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,840
mean, yeah, basically, I think the last bodybuilder I sort of paid any attention to was, God, well,

383
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,560
let's see, maybe Lee Haney when I was a kid growing up, right? And I paid attention to Lee Haney and

384
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,880
Dorian Yates, probably after Dorian Yates, I stopped paying attention to bodybuilding. So I

385
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:58,600
didn't I've never seen someone of that stature in person. Yeah, blow your mind. It really it really

386
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,800
does. Like, obviously, it's extremely impressive in magazines. And some of the gym photos that they

387
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,800
take with a lighting is set up really well. You can look at that and go, Okay, that's crazy,

388
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,280
compared to even the stage photos. But yeah, so anyway, I had this. I'm looking at these other

389
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,440
guys that are about my age. And I'm like, you know what, he's a little bit better than me. But I'm,

390
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm kind of there. You know, I'm kind of kind of right there. Now, again, take my legs out of the

391
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,320
equation, because my legs were awful at the time. But my upper body was there, basically. And so I

392
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,440
was like, Okay, well, maybe this thing, maybe I could be good at this, right? And, you know,

393
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,400
come to find out, I'm sure genetics are just as important in hypertrophy as they are with

394
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,600
hitting a baseball or shooting a basketball, whatever have you. But at the time, my mentality

395
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,600
was, this is more about work ethic and translates better. And so I was more committed to putting

396
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:00,280
that energy into it. And as far as like, strength goes, and where I felt like I might have a gift.

397
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:09,240
Honestly, I think that a lot of my gift was, and again, this could be just hyperbole on my part,

398
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:17,240
I think a lot of the gift was, I'm just really stubborn. And I could tolerate a lot of training

399
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:24,040
volume, I actually today went back and looked at what I was doing before I went to the IPF World

400
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:31,800
Championships, which is essentially like the Super Bowl for powerlifting. And that was in 2015.

401
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,920
And I was able to get a gold medal in the squat and actually set a world squat record at the time,

402
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,320
which was 668 pounds. And I weighed in at 201 and a half pounds when I hit it. And like,

403
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:54,760
I tallied up how many sets I did that week with over 500 pounds between squat and deadlift. And

404
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,080
it was 34 sets the week you hit that lift. And well, sorry, in the two weeks before that,

405
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,120
so I was kind of in my overreaching phase. And I just remember looking back at that and thinking

406
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:13,240
like how bad I wanted that and just how much volume of work I did. And I think, again, I think

407
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:20,120
I was just able to tolerate some really insane style training. And I think my body was a little

408
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,640
bit more resilient. I think my mind was a little bit more resilient. I think that helped me a lot,

409
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,920
because there was a lot of, there was a lot of setbacks along the way. And that was, you know,

410
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,360
obviously, I was in my mid thirties when I did that compared to being a teenager, but there was

411
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,440
never like a year where my squat just went, you know, it was always just kind of a slow,

412
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,360
steady progression. And this was from the kid who had skinny legs, you know what I mean? And,

413
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,480
but I had, you know, endured, I had two herniated discs in my neck, I had multiple herniated discs

414
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,720
in my lower back, I had hip injuries, you know, everything, you know, you can imagine of lifting

415
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,880
heavy weights and still managed to be able to go do that. But I think the fact that I endured

416
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,280
some of those setbacks really early on in my career, actually, like, really helped me be able

417
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,360
to, you know, deal with it. Because one of my big rants I get off on is everybody's like, have more

418
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,280
confidence in yourself. And when I always tell people like you can't build confidence out of

419
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,040
nothing. If you've failed at everything you ever tried in your entire life, why would you have

420
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:27,240
confidence, right? So I try to tell people like, look, start small, you know, just like say, I'm

421
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,480
going to show up to like, if it's exercise, I'm going to show up every day this week, you know,

422
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,320
regardless of how I feel, I'm going to go do it. Or five days, whatever, pick your number. Okay,

423
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,320
you do that. There's just a tiny smidgen of confidence you get from that. And then you build

424
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,400
that over time. Okay, well, I'm going to, you know, squat 200 pounds, okay, and then you hit that.

425
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,160
And then maybe you get some aches and pains. Okay, well, I'm going to rehab this, I'm going to go

426
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,200
through this. And then you get through that and you get stronger, right? And so if you do that

427
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,480
over time, every little thing that you go through might feel insignificant in terms of what it means

428
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:12,040
to you at that time. But when you look back, you can draw on that. And I think, you know, I always

429
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:19,080
tell people, I don't think I would have had the success I did in business or social media or

430
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,840
academia if I hadn't done weightlifting, because that taught me so much about other things in life.

431
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,960
So I realized I went down a big rabbit hole there. But no, I think that makes a ton of sense. And

432
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,320
I get asked sometimes, you know, what's the most important lesson I learned growing up with respect

433
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:44,920
to ultimately being successful academically. And I was not successful at all in school until my last

434
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,960
year of high school, because I didn't actually plan to go to university, I wanted to become a

435
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:57,000
professional boxer. So that obviously, there was no need to go to university. But I think like you,

436
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:06,120
I had an unusual gift for tolerating a lot of training, and a surprising lack of confidence

437
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,080
in myself, which is what drove the training, it was sort of an insecurity that's like, the other

438
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,720
guy's gonna train three hours a day, I'm gonna train six hours a day. But when I finally did

439
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,840
decide to go to college, it actually seemed really easy, compared to getting up at 430 every morning

440
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,000
and running 10 miles and going to the gym this many hours and sparring this many rounds every

441
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,600
day and doing 400 pushups before bed every night and all of those things. If you know, if you have

442
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,360
to go from doing that to just studying four hours a day, you already have the what I call that kind

443
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,920
of the habit infrastructure and the discipline infrastructure to do that. And I do think that

444
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,320
translates. So that's why I think personally, I just, at least with my own kids, I think, you know,

445
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,560
I'm delighted when they take up an interest in something, whether it be, you know, my daughter's

446
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,560
case, music and sports. You know, even if you never end up being a professional athlete or

447
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,040
drummer or whatever it is, it's really building and wiring a discipline around that, which

448
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:13,640
obviously you've demonstrated. Give me another sense of just in terms of I'm still

449
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,360
you have to forgive me, but I just most people who don't lift won't appreciate the magnitude of the

450
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:26,040
numbers you're talking about, right, like a 700 pound squat when you are 200 pounds and you are

451
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,080
drug free. That's the thing we have to keep re emphasizing. And I appreciate the way you've

452
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,640
talked about this. I've read a lot of what you've talked about with respect to the use of

453
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,560
performance enhancing drugs. And at least to me, it's never come across as haughty or, you know,

454
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,200
holier than thou. It's been, hey, look, this is my choice. And your only real pet peeve is people

455
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,920
who cheat and basically enter drug free bodybuilding competitions while using drugs, which is,

456
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,880
you know, in a sport like bodybuilding, where you truly have a choice that strikes me as nonsensical.

457
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,920
Exactly. But let's go back to when you're 19. How much could you squat, deadlift and bench?

458
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,120
With clear, I mean, under, you know, and I don't mean bench where you're bouncing off your chest.

459
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,120
I mean, under clear guidance and rules. So the interesting thing was I was a really good bench

460
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,880
presser in high school. And as a competitive power lifter, 15 years later, bench press was my worst

461
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:31,160
lift. So I peaked early. I hit a 300 pound bench press in high school. Now that was not with a

462
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,320
pause. If I'm thinking about what I could pause, probably would have been like 285 or something

463
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:46,840
like that 280. My squat, I managed so I didn't really train squat that much because legs hurt.

464
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:59,480
And I I'm I have so my body type, I have a very long femur to shin ratio as well as a shorter torso.

465
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,120
And essentially what that's going to mean is when you squat, the bar must stay over your mid foot if

466
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,920
you're going to not fall forwards or backwards. And so that means that I have to lean forward quite

467
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,200
a bit when I squat. And so it's not it's not a pretty squat when I was when especially when I

468
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,560
was in high school, it didn't know how to use, you know, hinge correctly and use my hips and whatnot.

469
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:27,720
So I mean, basically, I was able to squat 315 folded over as a as a as a high schooler. So

470
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:34,120
I mean, that's pretty strong for a high schooler, but it wasn't it was barely to depth if that.

471
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:41,800
And definitely not the way you would teach it to somebody. And as far as deadlift, I didn't really

472
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,080
deadlift in high school. I don't think I I'm trying to think about if I ever actually deadlifted.

473
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:54,280
I think maybe sporadically, maybe I could have hit three plates, but I'm not sure. I do know that

474
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,480
I kind of started doing it in college. And I think I hit like a 405 pound deadlift, you know,

475
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:11,080
before I left college. And I think when I I want to say that I hit like a 385 pound squat when I

476
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,960
finished college. So there's no again, you can see like it's not that's amazing. Yeah,

477
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:23,640
that's those are very mortal numbers, right? That's a that's a very slow and steady trajectory.

478
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,600
To obviously where you are now, and it probably reflects

479
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,440
kind of muscle maturity and also technique maturity. You mentioned earlier in passing

480
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,320
that you had a couple of herniations, both cervical and lumbar. Did any of them require surgery?

481
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:48,600
No, and actually, I, you know, I'm full disclosure, I'm not a pain expert or, you know,

482
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:57,480
an orthopedist. I think I got some really good advice to not get surgery by the initial person

483
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:04,840
I saw from my neck. And actually, so Dr. Joe, my coach, he was also a physical therapist.

484
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,120
And he said, Listen, because the so the first doctor I went to when I had my disc herniation,

485
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,960
I played rugby in college. And that's what I got it from. I had two disc herniations. And I had

486
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:23,240
lost, I remember, basically, I had a stinger. And I couldn't even pick up a chair with my left hand

487
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,560
in my dorm room without slipping out of my hand, I lost about 40% of my strength on this left side.

488
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,160
And I mean, the first doctor I went to was like, Yeah, you know, you probably won't get back all

489
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,120
the strength that you had. And I remember thinking, why don't you just stab me in the heart instead,

490
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:44,600
you know, like it'd been easier. But you know, I talked to Dr. Joe and Joe was like, Listen,

491
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,040
you know, you have to understand these doctors are used to dealing with your average person who's

492
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,960
not going to do the rehab, who's not going to do the work, who's not going to push themselves,

493
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:00,360
he said, that's not you, you will get back, you will hit PRs in the future. You know, this is,

494
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,240
this is not a death sentence for your lifting career. Okay. And sure enough, six months later,

495
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:13,000
I was, you know, I did the rehab and I was I was hitting PRs again. And then my lumbar herniations,

496
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:23,240
I actually saw Stu McGill, who's one of the more well known experts on on lower back pain. And,

497
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,840
you know, he did an in person assessment of me and he basically said, Listen, you know, you've,

498
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:34,520
yeah, you've got, you've got some herniations, but so do about 60% of all people who are over

499
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,200
the age of 30. Did you have any loss of strength going down your legs? Did you have any true sciatic

500
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,640
pain or I never had radiating pain. I was very localized. But I mean, when it flared up,

501
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:53,080
it was like 10 out of 10 could not get up off my floor. I mean, I, I tell people at my lowest

502
00:49:53,080 --> 00:50:00,200
point, I went from literally not being able to move off my side on my floor to squatting 668

503
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,720
pounds, you know, at a point later in time. What was the what was the delta between those time periods?

504
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:14,040
Uh, so with my lower back, it's it has kind of been a little bit of an ongoing issue. So the first

505
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:22,280
time it really hit me was in 2015. The first really bad incident I had was actually a week

506
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:29,480
out from the Arnold Pro. And I had been crushing weights in training. I mean, I was, I was very

507
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:37,560
convinced I was going to squat like 680 or 690. I had hit 600 for five in training on squat. I had

508
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:46,280
hit 675 deadlift for four. I mean, I was smashing weights. And the last heavy training session

509
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,720
before the Arnold so I was going to compete on the Friday of the Arnold classic. And the Friday

510
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,480
before was my last heavy training session. And I finished my squats, I went to go do bench press,

511
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:03,080
and I still remember, like I laid down, I was like, little tight, that's weird. And it kind of

512
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,680
progressively got worse through the day, to the point when I woke up the next day, I couldn't move.

513
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,960
And I was like, Oh, my God, I have to pull all this meat, you know, this and that.

514
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,200
And once the initial kind of inflammation went down, you know, a few days later, I went in,

515
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,400
I was like, all right, basically, three days before the meet, I said, I'm going to go in and try to

516
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,400
hit my openers. And if I can't hit them, then we're just going to call it. And I hit them. I went

517
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,640
and did the meat, I actually won. Just so people know what we're talking about. This was a bodybuilding

518
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,320
meat, not a powerlifting meat, correct? No, this was power was this. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. So I

519
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:46,360
went in and hit a long story, but I actually ended up tying the world record at that meet, due to an

520
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,840
error by my coach in terms of attempt selection, no hate towards my coach, everybody makes mistakes,

521
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,840
but in any case, I actually did end up winning the meat and squatting 661 pounds that meet.

522
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:06,520
But then that lower back issue kind of dogged me, it was never as bad as it was the initial time.

523
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,040
But I had so that was the Arnold's that was in March, I had the world championships coming up

524
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:21,240
in June. And that injury kind of dogged me on and on through my training. And I got to a point

525
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,880
where I had to take four weeks off squatting and deadlifting. And I got I started back squatting

526
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:35,560
and deadlifting with four weeks to go for the world championships. And again, I don't want to

527
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:43,720
belabor too long, but essentially, I like I was missing weights early on in that training, that

528
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:49,880
final training cycle, there were like 100 pounds less than what I needed to squat at world. But I,

529
00:52:49,880 --> 00:53:00,200
you know, thankfully, again, had so many setbacks, you know, early in my lifting career, that I just

530
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,400
kind of convinced myself that, okay, well, we're just going to keep showing up, we're going to see

531
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:10,200
what happens, you know, and ended up going in and hitting a world record on squat and actually got

532
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,480
a got a gold medal in squat, got a silver medal overall. And, you know, obviously did really well.

533
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,080
And then a couple years after that, during training, this was during a very stressful

534
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,640
period of my life. And actually, they have shown that like stress, lack of sleep,

535
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:38,600
all that plays into your level of pain sensitivity. I hurt my back and had

536
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,240
some other things happen. And I mean, that basically got to the point where I couldn't

537
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:51,480
move for a couple days. And that's when I kind of took it this is in December of 2017. And I took a

538
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,280
step I didn't really take a step back, I took pretty much nine months off of any kind of spine

539
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:05,480
loading, probably excessive probably didn't need to go that long. But then built back up and in

540
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:13,480
2019 hit a 666 pound squat, the 727 pound deadlift at nationals. So, you know, I think,

541
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,960
I think a lot of people get injuries, especially like these soft tissue injuries, and they

542
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,760
they, you know, hear doctors or, or, you know, people that are operating off of pain science from,

543
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:30,360
you know, decades ago, say, well, just stop lifting, or just stop doing whatever, you know,

544
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:37,320
athletic thing that you do. And I don't think it's a death sentence for most people. I mean,

545
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:43,480
if you look at, especially with regards to back injuries, I mean, if you go MRI 100 people that

546
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,760
are over the age of 35, about half of them will have herniated disc that they don't even realize,

547
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:56,280
because they're asymptomatic. So I think, you know, obviously, if you're having pain, you know,

548
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:06,760
trying to trying to treat the source of that in terms of is it is it could I don't want to get too

549
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,120
far down the rabbit hole, because this isn't my area of expertise. But well, let me ask you this

550
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:17,800
question. In your case, do you have a sense what it was about the lifts that was specifically

551
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:26,360
causing the pain? So, you know, sometimes you can actually identify what the issue is in the

552
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:33,400
individual that is through an axial loading pattern driving the pain. So it could be, you know,

553
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,600
one of my favorite examples is right people who can't generate enough intra abdominal pressure,

554
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:46,360
or who can't create, you know, who might have too much lordosis in the spine. When they're under

555
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:53,560
an axial load, or they can't, they can't generate enough articulation between l one and T 12. Right,

556
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:59,320
so they don't have the segmental control within the spine. So they sent it they tend to generate

557
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,360
disproportionate load at hinge points, like, were you able to look at yourself and say, Okay, well,

558
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,360
like, you know, presumably, I'm hurting my making this up, right, but I'm saying presumably, I'm

559
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,720
hurting myself under the height, you know, when I'm over 500 pounds, I'm not really hurting myself

560
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:20,280
when I'm, you know, doing 405 for 10. And when I'm and this is how my form changes when I go from

561
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,880
doing 405 to 595. And I think that's what it is that's precipitating this injury. And I'm going

562
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,920
to work on not just rehabbing the injury, but modifying the form. I mean, was there were you

563
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,960
able to do some sort of an analysis like that? I mean, lumbar flexion definitely was kind of

564
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,840
a triggering for the pain. But if we look at like, the biopsychosocial model of pain,

565
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,480
it gets really murky, because I mean, they've shown that you can have tissue damage and no pain,

566
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,960
and you can have pain with very little tissue damage. So I think part of it was just, I had

567
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:05,000
that initial injury to the disc, but then I probably didn't give myself enough time to

568
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:11,320
desensitize myself to that pain and just kept hammering at it. And the research, it's interesting,

569
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,520
the research actually shows that one of the best things you can do for low back pain is resistance

570
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,560
training. Like that's actually one of the best things you can do. But if you are so if you're

571
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:30,200
doing it with a load that increases that pain, then it's going to make it worse. So I think that the

572
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,480
the what people probably need to take away is that if you're having pain, and again,

573
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:44,200
this isn't my area of expertise, I take this from people I've learned from, but modify the load and

574
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:54,280
see if that reduces your pain, modify the tempo, modify the the range of motion. And then if none

575
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,960
of those things do then try to modify the exercise selection. And my problem was I was so dogged

576
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,920
about I need to do squat, bench press and deadlift, I need to work through this pain,

577
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,840
and I made it worse for a period of time. Now, you know, like to think I'm a little bit wiser

578
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,600
in my old age. Now I don't just try to work through it, I say okay, you know, if I'm having

579
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:23,080
a great example is I had some hip pain that I'd been dealing with for about six to seven months.

580
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:29,720
And the way it finally got better was I said, okay, I'm going to stop doing full range of

581
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,440
motion squats full speed, I'm going to try and take it back to what can I do with kind of a

582
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,560
minimal amount of pain, like a two or three out of 10, right, something that doesn't cause pain,

583
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:45,560
but I can still get some work in. And for me, that was like, above parallel pin squats. So basically,

584
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:51,880
I bring it down, nice and slow, pause at the pins and then come up. And I started out doing those.

585
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:59,800
And then the next week, you know, I'd either increase the load, or I would lower the pins.

586
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,000
And I did that for probably about six weeks. And then I got to the point where, okay,

587
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,720
it's not hurting as much, I'm going to try and do without the pins, above parallel regular squat,

588
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,440
with tempo, like three second descent, right, taking that that speed away from it.

589
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,160
I did that for like three, four weeks, pain went down, and then basically got to the point where

590
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:29,320
I could do a full squat with no pain. And so again, I'm not, you know, I don't have a randomized

591
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,200
control group to compare this to, it could be I could, if I would have just done nothing, I would

592
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:40,840
have gotten the same benefits, who knows. But I think just because you have pain doesn't mean you

593
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:46,760
can't do something. And I based on what some of the pain specialists have said, you're probably

594
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,800
better off doing something than nothing if you can, because if you just take time away from training,

595
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,360
you end up detraining. So when you come back, you're not as practice at the lifts,

596
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,560
and you might end up hurting yourself again. So that's kind of the approach I take is modifying

597
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,600
those variables and seems to be seems to be working okay. I'm you know, I always tell people like this

598
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:11,480
stuff's like a puzzle. And I'm still, you know, I've spent the last few years working through some

599
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:16,360
injuries and just trying to figure out, okay, how can I make this puzzle work so that I can be,

600
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,680
you know, you know, compete as an athlete again? Yeah, I agree with that completely. I think the

601
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,760
worst thing one can do under virtually any circumstances completely stop the activity.

602
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:33,800
I find that moving from two legs to one leg becomes a great tool in my toolkit when I'm hurting.

603
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:40,840
So moving to much more split squat, you know, single leg activity, I mean, even something,

604
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,960
even if you look at something like a leg press, right, so you know, you're sort of an inverted

605
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,560
doing a leg press, that's an exercise where you can load up stupid amounts of weight.

606
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,920
If I'm feeling anything that's not right there, I'll happily go to a single leg where you're

607
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,240
going to typically use not half, but a third the weight at a single leg. And, you know, all of a

608
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:04,200
sudden, those things that were hurting when you were doing it with two legs kind of stop hurting,

609
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,280
in my opinion, you're getting virtually the same benefit potentially more because you're

610
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:14,840
evening out any thing that wasn't right there. And I've noticed that I think I can say without

611
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,880
exception, things get better. Again, for me, it also requires a very careful examination of what

612
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,360
the root problem was. I guess the last question I have for you on this very specific topic before I

613
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:31,320
get into a whole bunch of other things that we're going to talk about is the overlap and or

614
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,000
detraction between powerlifting and bodybuilding. So you've competed at such a high level in these

615
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,320
two sports that have a very clear overlap, but also have a pretty different point of optimization.

616
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:49,800
I mean, bodybuilding is a very subjective sport, where it's about how you look. And at the end of

617
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,840
the day, nobody cares how strong you are when you're standing on that stage. Conversely,

618
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:00,600
powerlifting, which of course requires a lot of strength, nobody really cares how you look. So

619
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:07,240
both of those athletes pay unbelievable attention to how much weight they lift. But they're serving

620
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,320
a very different purpose. You're one of the people who has excelled at both. I've met people who are

621
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:17,400
excellent at one or the other, more on the power side, I should say than the bodybuilding side.

622
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:24,360
So I'm curious as to what some of the trade offs are that you have to make and and sort of a

623
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:32,440
hypothetical lane. If you what would be the closest length of time you could have between the two if

624
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:43,800
you wanted to be at your best in each? Great, great, great question. So I think the overlap is that

625
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:52,040
the obvious one is that to look muscular, you have to have a lot of muscle and contractile

626
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:58,440
tissue is what's needed to move weight. Right. So the more there is a little bit of debate about

627
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,880
this, but the consensus is is that hypertrophy does matter for strength training. So the more muscle

628
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:10,360
you have, the more weight you're going to be able to lift. I think that the trade off is that

629
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:19,880
bodybuilding is a much more forgiving sport in so far as. I mean, you can you can skin the cat

630
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,440
a thousand different ways. If you don't want to squat, you can hack squat. You don't want to

631
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:31,080
hack squat. You can split squat. It is simply about creating tension on that muscle, getting

632
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:38,440
the requisite volume in and progressive overload. Now people hear progressive overload and they

633
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:46,440
think weight, but progressive overload takes many forms. And the major one of which is volume

634
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:53,400
in particular volume load, which is basically for all intents and purposes, number of hard sets,

635
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:59,400
number of sets that approach failure. So you can do that many different ways. If you're hurting

636
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,400
on a certain exercise, hey, change it up. Try something different. Find something that you can

637
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,480
do without pain or find something that you really enjoy. Right. There's a lot of different ways to

638
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,480
skin a cat. When it comes to powerlifting, you can do some accessory movements and whatnot,

639
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,000
but you still have to do the major lifts. You still have to be very well trained. The major lifts.

640
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,720
Otherwise you're not going to perform your best on meat day. And so I think that

641
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:35,880
bodybuilding in a way is a little bit more demanding mentally because the hug, like

642
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:43,800
if you've never, if people out there listening, if you've never been like insanely shredded,

643
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,560
you cannot imagine the levels of hunger and low energy that these people go through. And that I

644
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:57,720
have been through. I'm talking about so hungry that you literally think about it from the moment

645
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:04,520
you wake up to the moment you go to sleep. And then it wakes you up at night. I'm talking about

646
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:09,080
such low energy that I can remember one time I was like, I had finished my training session. I

647
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:15,320
was probably a few weeks out from a show. I was sitting on my couch and the remote control was

648
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:22,200
and the remote control was probably five feet away from me. And there was a terrible show on

649
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:27,400
that I did not want to watch. And I watched the entire thing because I did not feel like getting

650
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:35,480
up to get the remote. And that kind of serves into like metabolic adaptation and reductions in

651
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,960
non-exercise activity, thermogenesis. And just give people a sense, Lane, of how many calories a day

652
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,800
you might be ingesting during that period of your training cycle and for how long that would last.

653
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:57,400
Yeah. So I, you know, my last, my last show I did, I competed as a pro natural bodybuilder in 2010.

654
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:04,520
So it's been a while. And I won the IFP international, the heavyweight division,

655
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:09,000
and then I, I ended up doing the IFP world championships and placed top five in the heavyweight

656
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,360
division. And it's difficult because it's like the amount of calories you start on is not going

657
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:25,000
to be what you end up finishing on. I think the lowest my calories got was just around 1900.

658
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:31,160
Now that may not sound that bad, but keep in mind, you know, we're talking about somebody who is,

659
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:38,280
you know, probably over 185 pounds of lean body mass, you know, quite a bit of lean body mass.

660
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,600
And training how many hours per day?

661
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:46,600
Two hours a day, you know, minimum. So I mean, that was pretty much all I had energy for,

662
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:52,360
you know, I'd go in the gym and train for two hours. And that would be all she wrote, you know,

663
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:58,120
and I'd muster up. I can remember going in and doing a cardio session one night.

664
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:06,280
I got on the elliptical, I started going and the only way I can describe this is it felt soul

665
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:12,920
sucking. And I went for what I felt like must have been 40 minutes. And I looked down at the

666
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:19,320
clock and it said three minutes, three minutes. And I just remember thinking, how, how can I do

667
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:26,280
this? I mean, like, so tired that like, or even like I would stand up and I would get lightheaded

668
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:31,480
because my blood pressure was so low, you know, it's a very, so I think bodybuilding is very

669
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:36,760
difficult in that that that doesn't leave you, right? Powerlifting is difficult in that it beats

670
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,720
your body up. But once you're done at the gym, other than you're like rehab work and some other

671
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:47,240
stuff, I mean, you can kind of leave it at the gym, you know. So they're really difficult sports,

672
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,400
but for for slightly different reasons, you know, again, bodybuilding is more forgiving in that

673
01:07:52,120 --> 01:08:00,200
it doesn't really matter what exercises you do, as long as you get in enough, right? And you can

674
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,880
kind of skin that cat multiple different ways. I mean, we've we've seen bodybuilders be successful

675
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,560
through every different methodology. You know, Dorian Yates never squatted. I mean, he talked

676
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,600
about it. He only did leg press, right? Leg press and leg extensions. Whereas Ronnie Coleman,

677
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:23,800
you know, squatted, you know, tons of weight. So I think that the the appeal for me for bodybuilding

678
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,600
was that mental challenge, you know, basically how much could you suffer?

679
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:36,920
And then the appeal and powerlifting was this is not subjective. I mean, it is a little bit

680
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,240
subjective, because you can argue squat depth is subjective, you can argue that deadlift lockouts

681
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:46,680
are right, but far, far less subjective, far less subjective. And I mean, I've had that,

682
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,000
you know, the order of the competition is you get three attempts on each lift,

683
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,440
and it goes squat bench press deadlift. And it's progressive, meaning, if you pick a weight,

684
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,520
and you miss it, you can't go down. So you can only go up. But I've been I've been in those big

685
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,280
meets where it comes down to the very last deadlift. And it's like, either you pull it or you don't.

686
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:12,600
And that determines if you win or not. I mean, I've had that experience. It's unbelievable.

687
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:23,560
And so to me, I probably prefer that only because I'm, I'm doing what I trained to do, right? Like in

688
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:29,400
bodybuilding, I'm doing something different than I trained to do. What I needed to do to get to that

689
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:35,080
bodybuilding stage is way different than what I'm going to do on stage. Whereas powerlifting,

690
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:42,680
I'm just doing what I've done, right? Like this is just a showcase. So now to your question,

691
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:48,120
how far apart could you do well in them? And let me add one more question, which is what order would

692
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:54,200
you pick? You get to pick the order of which you do the two contests and what the minimum space is

693
01:09:54,200 --> 01:10:01,560
to optimize both. So that's going to be so individually dependent, right? Because, you know,

694
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:09,400
for me at my weight class in powerlifting, 93 kilograms or 205 pounds, I'm pretty lean at that

695
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:16,440
body weight. So what I would say is that I would probably, if I was going to do this, I would do a

696
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:23,880
meat. I maintain this body weight with some level of effort, but mostly pretty easily. I would do

697
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,760
the meat and then I would start prepping for a show. And how much longer would you need after

698
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:35,800
that meat? How long would it take for you to be stage ready? It depends on how hard I wanted to

699
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:42,200
push it and what level. If I was wanting to really maximize lean body mass retention,

700
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:51,160
I'd probably want six months, I would say. Because what people don't realize is we look at like,

701
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:57,080
we look at these diet studies and we see how much lean body mass gets lost versus fat mass.

702
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:04,280
And people don't realize that a lot of this depends on how much body fat you're starting with,

703
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:09,000
and then it changes, the curve changes. So if you're somebody who's overweight or obese,

704
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,760
you don't really need to worry about losing too much lean body mass because you have such a

705
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,440
reservoir of energy to pull from that your body doesn't really see the need to start pulling from

706
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:24,280
lean body mass. But if you're somebody who's at, and I'll use my caliper measurements for all the

707
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,920
internet experts out there, I realize that the numbers I'm going to give you are not the true

708
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,520
numbers, but I don't care. It's what I'm referring to. I'm just using it as a reference point.

709
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:41,320
I always have to qualify this when I get body fat numbers. So I can go from 15% body fat to 7% body

710
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:49,800
fat, and it's extremely easy. No problems. I lose very minimal lean body mass from 7% to 5%. Now,

711
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,320
I'm probably losing 20% to 30% of that weight is lean body mass. When you get down to the

712
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:01,960
shredded area where you're just when you literally tried to squeeze off that last little bit of body

713
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:10,040
fat, you might be losing just as much lean body mass as you are fat mass. So for me, what I would

714
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:16,040
do, and I didn't do this years ago because I didn't even know about this tool, is I actually

715
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:21,160
implement a lot of what's called diet breaks. So those would be periods of eating at maintenance.

716
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:28,840
So basically a level of calories where you're not going to add back fat tissue, but you can eat more

717
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:36,760
than you did previously. So I had pretty good success with this the past year because I dropped

718
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:43,400
30 pounds. I went up a weight class in powerlifting and then came back down. And so basically I would

719
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,600
diet for two or three weeks pretty aggressively, try to lose like a pound and a half, two pounds

720
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:55,320
each week. And then I would take one or two or three weeks and eat just at a maintenance

721
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:03,000
level of calories, which for me is about 32, 33, 3400. And that worked extremely well for me,

722
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,880
extremely well for keeping my strength. And so if I was getting ready for a bodybuilding show,

723
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,840
I probably wouldn't use those too much if I was like coming down from a higher body fat. But as

724
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,400
I approach, as I would be approaching that lower level of body fat, I would be starting to put

725
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,640
these in more and more frequently. So that's why I would give myself so much time, even though I

726
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:33,080
only need to drop about maybe 12, 15 pounds from where I'm at right now. I would probably spend

727
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:40,440
more time at maintenance than I did in a deficit. Because when you get to those low levels of body

728
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:46,920
fat, the best way I can describe it is like if you have a wet towel, when you start squeezing,

729
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:53,080
water comes out very easily. This is this acts almost a perfect example of adipose tissue,

730
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:59,320
because if you take somebody who's overweight obese, what do you have? You have a lot of free

731
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:05,880
fatty acids getting released into the bloodstream. You have very, very expanded fat tissue. So when

732
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:12,840
you start, you start reading that rag out, it comes off very easily. But then when you get down

733
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,080
to the ends, and you're just trying to get that last little bit of water out, to get the same

734
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:23,560
amount of water out, you have to put in monumental levels of effort compared to what you did at the

735
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:28,680
beginning. So I guess that's kind of a huge qualifier of why I want so much time to be in my house.

736
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:32,920
I mean, the one thing that you said, Lane, that actually surprised me, and I want to think about

737
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,560
this through the lens of some examples, because I thought we could use examples of people like,

738
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:43,400
you know, kind of people that hypotheticals are patients of mine, I was surprised that you said

739
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:52,680
going from 15% to 7% body fat could be done without much loss of lean tissue. That is really impressive.

740
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,360
Yeah, for me. And is that is that just a function of how hard you're training at the same time?

741
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:06,040
Is that just something that you would attribute to your genetics? Because it's, you know, it's not

742
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,600
due to exogenous testosterone, which would obviously be one tool that would enable that

743
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,520
kind of lean mass retention. Yeah, so I think the first thing is,

744
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:23,720
it probably depends a lot on what your body fat set point is, or settling point. So for those

745
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:29,320
who aren't familiar, body fat set point theory is essentially that you kind of have this

746
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:38,760
relatively tight range of homeostatic body fat that your body will defend. And once you start to

747
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:44,680
drop below that range, it's when you really start to feel the negative effects of caloric restriction

748
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:51,720
in terms of your hunger goes up, your BMR drops, your non-exercise activity, thermogenesis drops,

749
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:59,240
your libido drops, you start to have those negative side effects. For me, you know, I would say that

750
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:06,200
my again, on calipers, that the low end of my body fat set point is probably around 7%. And the high

751
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:12,760
end is probably around 11. And how does that correlate with DEXA for you? Do you do you know

752
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:18,520
how the caliper numbers correlate with DEXA? Probably about 3% more on a DEXA, I would say,

753
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:25,560
kind of 10 to 14% is your DEXA sweet spot. So yeah, something like that. And in a show,

754
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,680
by the way, you're below 4%. Is that what I would infer from what you said earlier?

755
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:40,680
On calipers, the lowest I've caliper, it was like just over 2% body fat. So so call it 45% by DEXA,

756
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:46,120
potentially, probably maybe five or six. Yeah, something like that. And again, that's something

757
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:50,040
I don't really I let the internet worry about that. Because at the end of the day, it's just

758
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:55,000
about the visual aspect, right? Although I would guess I would guess below that lane, because

759
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:03,720
as recently as 10 years ago, I was 7.1% on DEXA, I mean, repeatedly, like 7.1 to 7.8 by DEXA.

760
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:08,520
And I still remember what I looked like then, nothing like what a bodybuilder looks like. So

761
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:15,080
I would easily believe that by DEXA, a bodybuilder could be 4%. Possible. I just I remember, so there

762
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:19,800
was a guy, he's another natural bodybuilder named Alberto Dunez. And if you ever saw pictures of this

763
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:28,200
guy, like I'm talking like veins visible vascularity in his glutes, right? Yeah. So like that. Yeah,

764
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:33,560
that's crazy. And he was going he went and got a DEXA done. And I remember he was asking people

765
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,840
like, what do you think I'm going to be and people were like, Oh, 2% 3%. And he and he was six,

766
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,760
you know, on a DEXA. So the question is, then I'd have to ask how much of that was visceral versus

767
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:48,520
subcutaneous. Possible. The other thing is people though, people need to appreciate is the level of

768
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,600
air that's in those measurements. Yeah, you know, there is an inherent level of error in those

769
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,520
measurements. But yeah, that's, that's, that's counterintuitive for that level of what you

770
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:04,680
describe in terms of vascularity. Yeah. Yeah. So, so who knows? But I think if you are somebody who

771
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:12,200
your body naturally likes to be at a little bit of a higher body fat percentage, you may see some

772
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:19,240
lean body mass loss, you know, add a similar body fat to what I am able to retain more at. Right. So

773
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,160
now this is me just completely speculating, because there's so little data on this,

774
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:31,720
because studies are just so restrictive in terms of what you can actually measure. And I think that

775
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:37,480
this is this is another point that people don't fully appreciate is that, you know, scientific

776
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:43,960
studies are really big blunt instruments. Like you, you, you can, you are really, if you're doing

777
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:50,760
a scientific study, you're only supposed to modify a couple of variables, if that, because otherwise

778
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:56,760
you just have no idea if what you're observing is due to the, the, the variables that you want to

779
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:03,320
test. Otherwise you might as well just go to observational data. And so they're just, when it

780
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:09,880
comes to this kind of stuff, there's so little data out there. And so this kind of is pulling from my

781
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:17,640
opinions based on some randomized control trials, I've seen some case studies I've seen and some

782
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:23,160
mechanistic data, some animal data, you know, and I'm, I always like to tell people when I'm,

783
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,040
when I'm kind of going out in a limb, because I don't want to state it as fact if I, if I'm not

784
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:33,400
sure if it's fact, but I would say that, you know, the differences we see and how much people can

785
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,920
retain with lean body mass. I think part of it's due to what their natural body fat set point level

786
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:46,920
is. Because as we exit that lower end of our body fat set point, if the body likes to keep a certain

787
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:53,320
level of body fat, then it makes sense that it might start pulling a little bit more energy from

788
01:19:53,320 --> 01:20:01,000
lean tissue compared to fat tissue if it's starting to defend that body fat. Now, there are

789
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,160
quite a few things we can do to overcome this, like resistance training, right? Like that's a big one.

790
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:13,880
And I think some of the decrements we see in lean body mass with dieting is one, a lot of these

791
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:19,560
studies don't do resistance training, or when people are dieting and they're starting to feel

792
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:25,080
worse because their lower energy, their training volume drops, their training intensity drops,

793
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,960
and that's probably part of it. And I think the other thing is too, like, I will say going from

794
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:35,560
like 15% to seven on calipers, I did lose some lean body mass, but you know, my relative strength

795
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:40,920
didn't really change. So what's likely is, you know, a lot of people don't realize lean body mass

796
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:50,440
is not the same thing as muscle mass. Lean body mass is all non fat tissues, that's skin, bone,

797
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:56,360
organ weight, all that stuff, and including your body water. And a lot of I think what we see with

798
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:05,960
lean body mass loss is water, gut tissue, liver, those those tissues shrink in response to caloric

799
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:12,280
restriction. And so I think most people don't appreciate the glycogen, the amount of glycogen

800
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:18,040
you can lose and how much water tracks with glycogen. So you lose, let's say you lose half

801
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:23,560
your glycogen volume. Do you take the mass of that multiply it by three to four, that's the total mass

802
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:28,920
that's lost given the water as well, not to mention the plasma loss that comes with plasma contraction.

803
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,400
Yeah, I mean, we see that like in ketogenic diet studies, like Kevin Hall's study, you know,

804
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:39,720
there was a loss of lean body mass, but even I in, you know, you know me, I'm very critical of,

805
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:46,680
of, you know, zealots and nutrition. And so when I've criticized, you know, ketogenic diet stuff,

806
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,480
I've even still said, you know, in this Kevin Hall study, well, that's most of that is probably water,

807
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:57,400
you know, because if like you said, if you lose glycogen, you're losing quite a bit of water with

808
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,200
that, right? No, I wonder if you would agree with an observation that I have found for which I

809
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,000
haven't found data to support, but truthfully, I haven't been on a huge hunt for it, but it's

810
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,840
been very empirical for me. So I've gone through various different phases of fasting, where I'm

811
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:17,000
doing it for different purposes, right? So I'm not doing it for body composition or anything other

812
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,440
than, you know, sort of ramping up autophagy. So basically kind of periodic fasting for health

813
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:28,440
benefits. And the thing that I've noticed is, and let's just use, I would typically do like a seven

814
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:36,360
day, five to seven day water only fast each quarter. And what I noticed was, provided I did

815
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,560
resistance training every single day during that fast, so I dramatically changed my training,

816
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:46,280
because I would normally be alternating between cardio and resistance. But if on those fasting

817
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,800
days, the only thing I did was resistance training. And specifically, I focused on the biggest lifts

818
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,920
possible. So deadlift is my favorite lift. So I would even deadlift every other day,

819
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:04,360
and mostly just focus on the biggest muscles. I had to go a lot slower. So I had to take, I needed

820
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:09,560
much more rest between sets, but I could actually still move the exact same amount of weight. So I

821
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:17,240
didn't get any weaker. It seemed to minimize the loss of lean mass, certainly muscle. I shouldn't

822
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:25,080
say that I lost water weight, but I did not appear to lose muscle mass. My thinking was that that I

823
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:31,960
was at least counter balancing the effect of mTOR reduction that was coming through the nutrient

824
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:37,000
pathway through a different stimulus. Does that, and again, we're going to talk a lot about mTOR,

825
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,560
because of course, your work in leucine ties right into my interest around nutrient sensing.

826
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,680
Does my observation fit with your observations and your experiences?

827
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:57,320
So we have to, I always try to put things in context, right? So I think if you're looking at,

828
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:05,000
you know, losing actual contractile tissue, once you've built it, what it takes to maintain muscle

829
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,600
tissue is very minimal compared to what it takes to actually build it. So it does not necessarily

830
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:18,360
surprise me, especially because, you know, this gets into kind of like power of suggestion, placebo,

831
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,800
your own personal feelings about stuff, because you view fasting as such a positive that you

832
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:29,800
wouldn't have a reduction in strength, because you probably really haven't lost contractile tissue

833
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,880
in that period of time. Now, if I take somebody, now it's important to point out that you are a,

834
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,840
I would say, a well-trained person, but not somebody who pushes the, like your goal isn't

835
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,680
to push the upper limit of hypertrophy. Would I be correct in that? Absolutely. Nor strength for

836
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:49,640
that matter. Right. So, and this is where some of the misinterpretations come from what I say

837
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:57,080
to people. So I had this the other day. I'll say, okay, do I think that somebody could build strength,

838
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:02,360
maintain it, doing that sort of thing? Absolutely. A lot of that just comes down to boils down to

839
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:07,800
being really consistent with your resistance training. If somebody says to me, I want to be

840
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:15,240
the most muscular, strongest human I possibly can be, do I think that that is still the best

841
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:20,680
thing that they could do? No, I do not. But again, it's important to qualify both those things,

842
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:25,720
because I realized that one audience, even though I have more of that audience, is a very small,

843
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:32,360
specific subsection of the actual number of people. But when I say that, what people hear is,

844
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:38,360
Lane says you can't get strong fasting. And I have to always say, no, no, that's not what I'm

845
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:45,160
saying. You absolutely can. Do I think that you could get as big and strong doing that as someone

846
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:51,480
who is, you know, consuming nutrients regularly? I don't think so. But we probably will never get

847
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,880
a randomized control lifelong randomized control trial on that. So I can't say for certain.

848
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:01,800
Well, actually, I agree with you on that. And in fact, you know, when the when the when we turned

849
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:07,240
into the new year this year, you know, I went and got a DEXA scan and looked at myself in January of

850
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:15,000
this year. And I was like, God, I'm kind of amazed over the last decade how much muscle mass I've

851
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:25,480
lost. So I am on January 4 of this year, I weighed the exact same amount that I weighed 10 years ago

852
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:31,560
in May of 2011. So for all intents and purposes, over a decade, my body weight was unchanged.

853
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:37,960
I'm embarrassed to tell you how much my body fat went up, right? It went from about 7% to 16%

854
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:45,880
over a decade. So you can do the math, right? Like it's pretty straightforward. I got fatter,

855
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,840
I lost muscle. Now, I'm not going to beat myself up too much. A lot has happened in a decade,

856
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:56,680
right? I used to train four and a half to five hours a day, I now train maybe 90 minutes per day,

857
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:02,440
I have very different priorities, my goals are totally different. But you know, I talked about

858
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:06,200
it with Beth Lewis, who I work with, and I was like, Look, and she was like, Look, we got to get

859
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:11,240
some more muscle on you, dude, it's kind of getting pathetic. So her first thing was no more fasting

860
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,560
for a while, right? That was basically her first suggestion, which is like, we got to take a break

861
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:22,040
from the monthly fasting, because that's probably not helping your lean tissue. And if we want that

862
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:27,160
to be a goal, which is, is there any reason we shouldn't be able to put five pounds of muscle on

863
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,600
you in the next year? Her view is I think we can do this, but you can't be fasting every month for

864
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,760
three to five days. So I think that's completely in line with what you're saying, which is an

865
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,400
optimization issue. It's you know, and I've heard you talk about this with respect to plant versus

866
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:45,480
animal protein, and it gets always taken out of context. I just had this discussion the other day,

867
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:50,920
so again, what I'll let you state the argument again, because you'll probably do a better

868
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,840
job stating your own words than I will, you know, stating your words for you.

869
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,640
Yeah, so I kind of had this discussion with somebody who, you know, was saying, well,

870
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,160
if you look at the randomized control trials, you know, plant versus animal, it just doesn't

871
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:11,080
make a difference if total protein is equated. And what I've said to people is, okay, I understand

872
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,880
that randomized control trials are the gold standard. If we are looking at resistance-trained

873
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:26,120
individuals, eight weeks in terms of looking at actual muscle mass is such a short period of time.

874
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:32,840
Okay, now I understand my bias is I did work in Lucene, I was funded by the egg and dairy councils,

875
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:40,360
all that kind of stuff. So I'm sure that any conspiracy theorists out there will have a field

876
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:45,880
day, but I would never tell somebody you can't build muscle with plant protein. Of course you

877
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:51,080
can. Just go look at those plant-based bodybuilders you can look at who have extremely

878
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:57,480
impressive physique, so obviously you can do it, right? Now, can you build just as much muscle with

879
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,400
plant protein? I think you can. However, it's probably going to require more planning on your

880
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:10,120
part, and just a little bit more attention to detail because of the factors of limiting

881
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:17,480
amino acids, low leucine content, those sorts of things. Do I think all things being equal

882
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:25,240
animal protein is probably a superior form of protein? I do. That being said, that is a small

883
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:31,480
sliver of what actually contributes to hypertrophy. Consistent resistance training and progressive

884
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:40,040
overload is by far the most dominant factor. But we can barely oftentimes not even pick out

885
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:44,760
differences. We know volume is important. We know volume weekly set number is important.

886
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:51,400
We can't even pick out differences in hypertrophy sometimes with different volume protocols.

887
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:57,160
What makes you think we're going to pick out differences in actual hypertrophy in eight weeks

888
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:03,400
from protein sources where calories and total protein are equated? And so what I've said is,

889
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:09,720
I think the studies are probably a little bit underpowered and shorter on time to actually show

890
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:14,840
the differences we want to show. Now, I'm not saying they're bad studies. I'm just saying this

891
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,000
is a limitation. That's all. Yeah. So actually, I was going to say that a second ago, but I didn't

892
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,480
want to interrupt you when you were talking about the limitations of some of these RCTs. And I was

893
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,600
going to add the limitation you just mentioned, which is it's hard enough to control the variables.

894
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:34,840
But the other thing is the tighter you put the grip on controlling the variables, by definition,

895
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:40,760
in a real world, the shorter the study must become. So you look at Kevin Hall's studies,

896
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:47,000
well, Kevin is doing studies at the highest level that they can be done. So these are patients that

897
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,360
are in patients. And I know this very well. I'm very close friends with Kevin. I have a very clear

898
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:58,280
understanding of how the board runs both his ward at NIH and also several others around the country.

899
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:04,520
I've even spent time inside the metabolic chambers personally to experience this. And yeah,

900
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:11,080
we're talking about the highest level of precision inside a chamber that does indirect calorimetry.

901
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:17,960
The reality of it is you can't put somebody in this situation for a year. And so when it comes to

902
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:26,520
going back to exercise, if we think that, you know, the difference in a person over six months might

903
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:33,640
be two to three pounds of muscle mass under perfect conditions, it's going to be very difficult to

904
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:37,960
tease that out in eight weeks. The other thing I would say going back to protein that I've always

905
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:41,240
struggled with, and I want to actually get your opinion on this because this is something that

906
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:46,760
I want to know how much this matters both personally and also professionally for my patients,

907
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:54,200
is I have to suspect at least when it comes to leucine, timing must matter. And I'll in a moment,

908
01:31:54,200 --> 01:32:00,040
I'll come back to why I've been curious about this, just based on what we now understand about

909
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:06,360
how leucine and cestrin two work in triggering mTORC1. So there becomes this whole other variable,

910
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:12,200
which is when we talk about plant versus animal, does it matter where in relation to training we're

911
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:19,160
taking that? Does it matter, you know, meal timing, specifically training timing and all of those other

912
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:24,440
things? So let's actually maybe use this as an opportunity to now talk about kind of your work

913
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:30,360
in graduate school and what it's taught you about muscle protein synthesis and the importance of

914
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:36,840
leucine because I think even the most, you know, sort of casual observer of bro science has heard

915
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:41,400
of a branched chain amino acid. And, you know, if you click one level below a branched chain amino

916
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,920
acid, you'll know that there are three of them. And one of them happens to be called leucine.

917
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:50,920
And people I think would gather that somehow taking those things is good for muscle.

918
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:56,200
But my guess is that's about the level at which most people stop understanding it.

919
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:01,560
So let's talk about what is muscle protein synthesis, what is the role of leucine and,

920
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,200
and I also want to even dive deeper into that, which is how does the body preserve leucine,

921
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:10,600
what do leucine levels look like during the course of a day in response to a meal a fast, etc.

922
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:19,000
Great question. So muscle protein synthesis is basically what it sounds like it is the

923
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:28,600
synthesis of muscle proteins from amino acid substrates. And, you know, you can separate it

924
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:33,720
in terms of like what you look at in research, you can you can do what's called mixed muscle

925
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:39,400
protein synthesis, which is what we did, which is where you're really taking the entirety of a muscle

926
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:45,080
and you're grinding it up and you're homogenizing it and then you're, you're basically using in the

927
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:50,520
studies we use stable isotopes to assess this we used D5 phenylalanine, which is basically a

928
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:56,600
deuterated one of the hydrogens on the phenylalanine is deuterated and you can basically you're looking

929
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:03,560
at how much of that label gets incorporated into the, the mixed muscle of the, of the,

930
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:09,480
or sorry, the mixed muscle versus how much is in the precursor pool, which is the intracellular

931
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:15,640
fluid, and that rate divided by a time factor will tell you what the rate of muscle protein

932
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:26,360
synthesis is. And on a kind of a more broad level protein synthesis starts in your DNA,

933
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:31,880
because your DNA codes for those proteins that are going to be synthesized. So, for example,

934
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:36,520
let's say you go and you do a resistance training session, we know that in response to resistance

935
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:42,760
training you have an increase in muscle protein synthesis, that resistance training is triggering

936
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:51,320
something. It's probably a cascade of things that are telling your DNA, we need to adapt to this

937
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:57,720
stressor. So we are going to increase the transcription of these, you know, specific

938
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:06,200
DNA sequences to the messenger. And I'm really, really abbreviating this, because you get the

939
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:13,160
introns, extrons, mRNA degradation, all this kind of stuff, but it gets transcribed to an mRNA

940
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:21,720
sequence, which is then read by a ribosome. And that ribosome based on the mRNA is going to bring

941
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:27,240
amino acids in and hook them together to build these new proteins. So in the case of, you know,

942
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:33,160
let's say you go and you do resistance training, you know, myosin, actin, these contractile

943
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:39,640
proteins, you're going to need those as part of your adaptation to that stressor. And so those

944
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,680
are going to be some of the things that are going to be built during muscle protein synthesis.

945
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:51,000
Now, my work specifically was in animals, and I'll tell you why, and you kind of alluded to it

946
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,040
earlier. So we actually, I have a research review that's going to be coming out on my website. One

947
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:01,080
of the things I'm very proud of is we have a 50 page guide on how to read research. And we have

948
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:09,560
a Venn diagram in there. And in the Venn diagram, we have highly controlled, high subject number,

949
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:16,440
long duration. And what you find is the only way you can get all those to overlap is if you do

950
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:21,640
animal studies. So if you want, if you want tightly controlled and a high subject number,

951
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:30,600
it's going to be really short in humans. If you want long duration, and tightly controlled,

952
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:36,200
it's going to be very few subjects. If you want, you know, you can kind of get the gist of it.

953
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,080
So for I decided I wanted to do animals because I was more kind of interested in

954
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:50,200
finding out the mechanisms of this stuff. And so, you know, you can do one of the reasons I liked

955
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,440
using rats was one, they're a good model for human protein metabolism. A lot of the stuff in rats has

956
01:36:54,440 --> 01:37:03,800
then been validated in humans. There are some differences. But I can teach a rat to meal feed,

957
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:11,480
meaning they eat discrete meals. I can get them to eat what I want them to eat. And then I can

958
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,160
measure what I want to measure. And I can poke and prod them and do all that kind of stuff,

959
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:22,440
as long as it's okay with the IACUC, which is basically the IRB for animals. And so what we

960
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:27,400
were interested in was what you kind of talked about, like how important is leucine? Because at

961
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:33,080
that time, the you know, the mid 2000s, there had been quite a bit of work done by my advisor,

962
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:38,440
Dr. Don Lehman, as well as the Penn State group, which was Leonard Jefferson and Scott Kimball,

963
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:46,440
looking at, okay, we know if we give purified solutions of leucine, they increase mTOR activity,

964
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:51,800
and we see an increase in muscle protein synthesis. But one, what does that mean for

965
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:57,640
complete meals where you have protein, carbohydrate and fat? What does it mean in the context of

966
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:04,520
different protein sources? And then what does actually even matter for tissue weights? Right?

967
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:11,320
Like you actually actually see differences in actual tissue. And so one of the some of those

968
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:16,200
work we did was one, we looked at the duration of muscle protein synthesis in response to

969
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:21,880
a complete meal. And that was really interesting. Actually, that was one of the things I was

970
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,560
dead wrong about what I thought I was going to see versus what I actually saw.

971
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:32,600
And so we saw like even with weight, so weight protein, which is thought of as a fast protein,

972
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:39,080
basically, we saw an increase in muscle protein synthesis that peaked at 90 minutes post meal,

973
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:43,400
and then by 180 minutes or three hours had gone back down the baseline, which has since been

974
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:48,120
validated in humans. That's about what we see in humans as well. Now, now, Lane, let me just ask

975
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:54,520
you a question there for a sec before you go further. Do we have a sense of after the training

976
01:38:54,520 --> 01:39:02,840
stimulus ends, how long that transcriptional stress is in place to continue muscle protein

977
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:07,240
synthesis provided enough substrate is available? In other words, when do we become substrate

978
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:13,480
available? Substrate limited, I'm sorry. So this is really interesting because it's so hard to

979
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:21,080
assess. Because so part of the reason that this stuff is so hard to measure is in humans, you

980
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:27,320
basically have to have a steady state in order to measure muscle protein synthesis, because there's

981
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:34,520
certain assumptions you have to make about the isotope that you're using to assess it, the precursor

982
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:41,560
pool and the actual protein bound label. And so that requires what we call a nutritional steady

983
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:48,520
state. So if you want to assess a muscle protein synthesis in response to exercise, you're going

984
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:54,440
to be found that. Yeah, but let's say you could give somebody an intravenous infusion of all amino

985
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:59,080
acids. So I guess there'd be two questions, right? We start with one question, which is we don't care

986
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,480
which amino acid is, but we'll give you enough of all of them so that you're not going to be limited

987
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:09,240
by a given amino acid. And then we just going to give you an IV infusion. So the second you finish

988
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:14,360
the highest stress workout, we just keep running it out. And then we're tracking over time muscle

989
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,920
protein synthesis, that would be one experiment that would be interesting. And then the second one

990
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:24,600
would be playing with which amino acids are the most important there. Does that kind of make sense?

991
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:30,680
So we kind of have a pretty good idea of like the time course of muscle protein synthesis in

992
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:37,080
response to an exercise bout when it comes to mixed muscle protein synthesis. So I'm going to

993
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:45,720
make a very important caveat here in a second. And it appears to be pretty similar for, sorry,

994
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:52,280
so the peak, so the change percentage is about, it increases, it's different from study to study,

995
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:56,840
but about a hundred to a hundred and fifty percent increase in muscle protein synthesis.

996
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:06,920
That peak is about the same for trained versus untrained, but the untrained duration

997
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:14,280
lasts much longer. So it's still not back to baseline in studies by 48, well, some studies

998
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:19,000
it's back to baseline at 48 hours. In other studies, there's still a statistical difference

999
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,240
at 48 hours. So we think basically in untrained people, it's about 48 to 72 hour response.

1000
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:33,720
The interesting thing is in trained people, that initial robust response comes back down

1001
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:42,360
about 10 to 12 hours and at 24 hours is basically not different from baseline. So

1002
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:49,800
this is now that's for mixed muscle protein synthesis. Now here's the rub for myofibrillar

1003
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:54,120
protein synthesis, because you can separate that out during your analysis. So we're talking about

1004
01:41:54,120 --> 01:42:01,320
actual contractile muscle proteins, because mixed muscle protein synthesis includes all

1005
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:08,200
cytoplasmic proteins, mitochondrial proteins, all these sorts of things. The myofibrillar protein

1006
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:15,160
synthesis, they actually don't know how long it lasts because they've only assessed it up to 16

1007
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:23,160
hours post. And so far, neither group has returned to baseline, although they have assessed the area

1008
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:27,960
under the curve and it's greater area under the curve for untrained versus trained. Now,

1009
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:34,520
the rub on that is if we look at, I know you're asking about nutrient availability.

1010
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,080
No, no. Yeah, we'll keep going with this point, though.

1011
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:45,320
The rub on that is none of these are addressing the other side of protein balance, which is

1012
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:52,360
protein degradation. Now, what's really interesting is during the first approximately six weeks of

1013
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:58,040
resistance training, you don't see much hypertrophy in people who are training. You see

1014
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:04,200
strength improvements, but you don't really see hypertrophy. And what's really interesting is in

1015
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:12,360
the initial phases of training, you have an increase, a robust increase in muscle protein

1016
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:18,680
synthesis, but you also have a very robust increase in protein degradation. And so the thought process

1017
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:24,600
is because this is such a big stressor, a massive stressor, if you've never resisted to train before,

1018
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,680
I mean, everybody knows the first time they went and did a leg workout, you couldn't walk for a few

1019
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:34,600
days after that. You have to completely, it's almost like your muscles doing a complete overhaul

1020
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:41,880
of those proteins. And so you have such a robust, degradatory response because there are so many

1021
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:50,600
damaged proteins or proteins that need to be, I guess, improved, that it's almost like you're

1022
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:58,440
doing this protein turnover, futile cycle kind of remodeling. And then what we see is after six weeks,

1023
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:04,520
at the end of six weeks, that increase in degradation goes way down. And that's actually,

1024
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:09,400
I mean, again, I can't say for certain, but that coincides with when we start seeing

1025
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:15,240
the big improvements in hypertrophy. So, so all things equal, sorry to interrupt, all things equal,

1026
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:20,520
if a person is consuming roughly the same amount of protein during that phase and their training

1027
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:27,320
volume and intensity is roughly the same, is it safe to say during that first period you described

1028
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:31,960
they are going to be in a negative nitrogen balance versus a neutral, potentially nitrogen

1029
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:36,040
balance? Like if you were evaluating them with a nitrogen cart, like how are you, would that show

1030
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:43,480
up as a nitrogen excretion in that first phase? Or are they recycling it? So probably, probably not,

1031
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,880
probably not. It's probably going to be pretty, they're probably going to be nitrogen positive

1032
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:56,760
a little bit. But here, here's where this stuff gets so, so complicated because we know that in

1033
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:03,480
muscle protein synthesis, about seven out of every eight amino acids used to create a new protein

1034
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:12,680
are recycled from degraded proteins. So when we look at, okay, exogenous amino acids or exogenous

1035
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:17,960
dietary protein, and we think about it as muscle building, I think most people think about, okay,

1036
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:23,880
I'm eating this protein and this is going to get incorporated into my tissue and that's what's

1037
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:33,800
going to make me big and strong. It's a lot more complicated than that. In fact, about the most

1038
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:40,280
amino acids you can deposit in muscle tissue. If you, let me back up. If you look at somebody who

1039
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:47,720
added 50 pounds of muscle tissue in a year, right? That's a ton of muscle. Even for somebody on

1040
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,280
steroids, I think we can agree that's a ton of muscle. When you account for the fact that muscle

1041
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:58,680
tissue is about 70% water and about 30% protein, you're basically looking at about 10 grams of

1042
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:04,040
amino acids deposited in muscle per day. It's very underwhelming. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. That'd be for

1043
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:09,640
about 25 pounds of muscle a year, I think. Still extremely impressive. Sure. But, but there are two

1044
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,560
different points there that I want to get at. The first point is the one you're making, which is no

1045
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:19,000
matter how much muscle mass you put on, it's never going to be impressive relative to the amount of

1046
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,680
amino acids you took in. There's a second point you're making, which I find even more interesting

1047
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:31,480
potentially, which is the actual fate of the ingested amino acid and how much is being recycled

1048
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,880
versus not. So the analog here, but you're going to love this lane. I didn't even think this would

1049
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:41,560
come up and I know you're going to love it. You want to know my favorite thing that drives me nuts

1050
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:48,600
about people when they just rave about a ketogenic diet is the differentiation between

1051
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:57,000
reesterification, lipolysis, and fat oxidation. So here's the example, right? If you're on a

1052
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:07,080
ketogenic diet and you're mainlining fat, you can very easily gain weight because if you're ingesting

1053
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:12,360
so much fat that it exceeds your ability to oxidize fat, regardless of where that fat source

1054
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:19,080
is being oxidized, meaning endogenous versus exogenous, it doesn't really matter. And in fact,

1055
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:27,560
a ketogenic diet can still produce a ton of fat oxidation without oxidizing the endogenous source

1056
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:34,280
that you want to oxidize in the first place. And by the way, a lot of the triglyceride contained

1057
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:40,280
within the adipocyte gets recycled so it can be liberated as free fatty acid and then be

1058
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:45,640
reesterified with glycerol back into it. So actually, it becomes kind of a nice analogy here.

1059
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:46,600
A hundred percent.

1060
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,640
I just don't think I knew it was true on the amino acid side as well.

1061
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:54,760
Yeah. So you're making an analogy that is, I don't know if I've ever used it before,

1062
01:47:54,760 --> 01:48:00,760
but it's bang on. I mean, there's differences, of course, but I think a lot of this boils down to

1063
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:08,520
people think of metabolism as like on and off switches. And it's like, that's think about like

1064
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:16,840
dimmer switches, like nothing. People think like when you're losing fat, that means that fat

1065
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:24,920
burning is ramped up and fat storage is all the way down at zero. No, you are always burning and

1066
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:32,680
storing fat simultaneously. Same thing. You are always synthesizing protein and degrading it at

1067
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:39,240
the same time. Now, it's the relative rates of each that are going to determine if you deposit

1068
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:42,360
versus lose fat or protein.

1069
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:46,680
So let me then bring it back to that analogy because I just did a podcast on this with Bob

1070
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:53,080
Kaplan recently, and we talked about it in terms of fat flux. So we talked about three states,

1071
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:59,320
a person who is in neutral fat flux. So they are neither gaining nor losing fat tissue,

1072
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:03,240
negative fat flux and positive flat flux. So you're either gaining fat mass, losing fat mass,

1073
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:10,120
or maintaining the same. And we talked about it through the lens of de novo lipogenesis,

1074
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:16,040
reesterification, lipolysis. Nope. None of that says anything about oxidation that's happening

1075
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:21,480
outside. And that can feed into substrate pools. What we then talked about was how many hormones

1076
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:27,320
are regulating these different steps. So what happens when insulin goes up and down? What happens

1077
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,800
when epinephrine goes up and down when norepinephrine goes up and down when hormone sensitive

1078
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:37,560
lipase goes up and down when cortisol goes up and down testosterone, lipoprotein, lipase, etc.

1079
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:43,000
So in other words, these are all regulated hormonally, some of them outside the cell. So

1080
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,960
insulin obviously is acting outside the cell. You know, LPL is outside the cell, HSL inside the cell,

1081
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:58,200
etc. Tell me about the hormonal regulation on the same unit of muscle. The most obvious difference,

1082
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:03,320
of course, is that testosterone works inside the cell, right? So let's start with testosterone,

1083
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:07,800
but then I want to talk about all of the hormones that impact this. Specifically,

1084
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:12,520
I want to make sure we at least touch on cortisol and estradiol at some point. But let's start with

1085
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:17,000
testosterone because it plays such an important role in that transcriptive drive.

1086
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:21,720
Yeah, so I think the one thing I want to say before we start on this is keep in mind that

1087
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:26,360
when we're talking about all these hormones, and this goes for fat tissue or muscle tissue,

1088
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:33,560
what you are seeing on the surface in terms of the actual outcome is the result of the summation of

1089
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:40,920
all of those signals, right? So people get hung up on, say, insulin, or they get hung up on leucine,

1090
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:45,880
or they get hung up on, you know, one particular thing, and then they get confused when they see

1091
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:54,360
a paradoxical outcome, right? So a great example of that is Kevin Hall's study on fat loss, looking

1092
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:59,720
at, you know, where they showed that insulin was 26% higher, but those people actually ended up

1093
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:06,280
losing, like, I would call it a non-significant greater amount of actual fat mass than people who

1094
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:12,040
are on a ketogenic diet. People say, well, how can that be true, right? And it's like, okay, well,

1095
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:17,240
you got to remember that insulin is just one input. It's not the only input. And the same

1096
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:23,160
thing goes for building muscle and muscle tissue. So with regards to testosterone, what's interesting

1097
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:31,640
about testosterone is I actually reviewed a study recently where- Yeah, the study by Stu Phillips

1098
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:37,000
that looked at androgen receptor density. Yeah, so that's- Which, by the way, I still don't understand

1099
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:43,240
something, which I'm hoping you can explain. Why would androgen receptor density be higher in

1100
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:49,560
someone getting exogenous testosterone? You would think that someone taking exogenous testosterone

1101
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:54,200
would have a paradoxically negative response in that they would down-regulate androgen receptors.

1102
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:58,440
I'll let you maybe go back and explain it from the beginning, because the listener might not

1103
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:02,760
be familiar with the thesis of the work. Yeah, so essentially, you know, when you have-

1104
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:10,600
When testosterone gets into the cell, it's converted, and then that in-product binds with

1105
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:17,880
the androgen receptor, and then it can attach to the DNA increasing transcription of different

1106
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:24,280
proteins, right? So basically, you're ramping up your capacity for, amongst other things,

1107
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:31,080
increasing muscle proteins. That's different than how leucine acts nutritionally, because

1108
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:37,640
leucine is a signal also that happens inside the cell, but it's more of a short-term signal.

1109
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:47,640
Now, to answer your question specifically, what I've seen proposed is that when you have enough

1110
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:54,600
testosterone available, what tends to happen is the androgen receptors of regulate to meet the

1111
01:52:55,480 --> 01:53:05,800
demand for metabolizing that testosterone, and that the regulation of the excess testosterone,

1112
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:11,800
think about the negative feedback loop, functions more so on like luteinizing hormone and the

1113
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:19,240
gonads and that sort of thing, right? So if I had to hazard a guess, that would be my guess that the

1114
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:27,640
that the regulation in terms of trying to tamp that down, because think about if you're not getting

1115
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:32,920
exogenous testosterone, if you're not getting exogenous testosterone, then there's probably

1116
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:39,320
not that same negative feedback regulation loop. And so I always hate it when people go,

1117
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:42,840
well, it makes sense because there's tons of stuff in metabolism. They say, well, it makes sense that

1118
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:47,560
it ends up not working out in the study. But to me, it would make sense that the muscle might

1119
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:53,320
increase its androgen receptor density to meet that testosterone load or that free testosterone

1120
01:53:53,320 --> 01:54:00,600
load. So long as you're not having so much testosterone, that's not negatively feeding

1121
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:07,320
back to the gonads and limit, reducing luteinizing hormone or increasing aromatization, those sorts

1122
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:12,600
of things. And I will straight up say, I am not a testosterone expert, so I could be getting this

1123
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:20,040
dead wrong. But I think the more to the point of Stu Phillips work is that muscle growth

1124
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:29,400
appears to be mostly intrinsically regulated. And I think in the late 90s, early 2000s, what people

1125
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:35,080
were really focused on was systemic, what they thought was systemic regulation of muscle growth,

1126
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:41,960
right? Your systemic levels of testosterone, IGF-1, and even like the acute responses,

1127
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:47,960
we know, for example, resistance exercise will increase testosterone for 30 or 60 minutes. And

1128
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:55,320
it used to be thought, well, that is what's driving these responses of hypertrophy. And through a few

1129
01:54:55,320 --> 01:55:00,200
elegantly designed studies, a lot of them by Stu Phillips, we know that that's probably not the

1130
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:07,640
case, that this is probably an effect of tension. Now, what's interesting about muscle growth is if

1131
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:13,800
we're going to have that tension that's driving muscle growth, there has to be a translation of

1132
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:22,200
that contractile force into a chemical signal. So we call that mechanotransduction, right? And so this

1133
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:27,880
is where I know you we had talked about it a little bit earlier, mechano growth factor probably comes

1134
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:35,400
in. So IGF-1, systemic IGF-1 and growth hormone are not anabolic to skeletal muscle. People don't

1135
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:39,480
realize this. Let's pause here because this is, I want to make sure people understand what we're

1136
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:45,480
talking about. And this is such an important topic. I don't want to rush it. So let's go back to the

1137
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:50,440
beginning and assume that the listener here doesn't fully understand where growth hormone comes from,

1138
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:57,560
right? And what it does in the liver, what IGF does. So let's go back and explain,

1139
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:02,200
you know, the endocrine versus, well, we'll get to the endocrine versus autocrine function of IGF,

1140
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:09,400
but just back up two steps with where you are, Elaine. Sure. So we know that like growth hormone

1141
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:16,840
increases in response to certain things like fasting, resistance training, exercise in general,

1142
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:23,000
sleep potentially. Sure, sure. All those things, right? And people kind of looked at that as,

1143
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,520
okay, well, we should be aiming to increase growth hormone for these things. And we know

1144
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:31,960
that growth hormone increases the liver production of IGF-1. And IGF-1 has always been thought of as

1145
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:39,880
the master hormone that is increasing muscle mass. When they look at studies, even where they give

1146
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:46,200
exogenous growth hormone, what you see is you see an increase in lean body mass, but not an increase

1147
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:51,480
in skeletal muscle mass. So the increase in lean body mass is completely accounted for by an

1148
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:57,000
increase in body water and connective tissue. So now you can argue there might be some benefits to

1149
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,680
connective tissue and that sort of thing. And I would argue organ weight as well, right? I mean,

1150
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:05,960
we see, we see liver hypertrophy and other things like that as well.

1151
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,240
So when it comes to growth hormone, I actually had an article about this years ago in my site about

1152
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:17,320
how growth hormone was an anabolic. And I got a lot of bodybuilding dogma people getting really

1153
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:22,920
upset about that because they don't understand, and this is pervasive even among scientists,

1154
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:28,920
people who don't understand the concept of a localized response versus a systemic response,

1155
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:33,560
or people who don't understand an acute response versus a chronic response.

1156
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,120
We're going to talk about this with respect to cortisol as well.

1157
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:42,920
And in-tour signaling, I'm not sure. So growth hormone, not anabolic to skeletal muscle. And

1158
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:50,840
the growth hormone response to exercise appears to be mostly substrate driven. That it's that

1159
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:57,080
growth hormone probably increases as a response exercise to increase lipolysis to liberate free

1160
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:07,480
fatty acids for use as an energy substrate. Now, here's where people get confused. The IGF-1,

1161
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:16,280
the autocrine IGF-1 that is released by the muscle tissue itself in response to mechanical tension

1162
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:22,280
is very anabolic. So let me just explain for a moment to people the difference between endocrine,

1163
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:29,880
paracrine, and autocrine. So the endocrine function of something is when a hormone gets released

1164
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:35,560
and its effect is all throughout the body. So insulin is a great example, right? So the

1165
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:40,280
pancreas, the beta cell releases insulin, insulin goes and acts on all sorts of cells in the body.

1166
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:46,280
Paracrine is when something, when a hormone gets released and it only impacts the cells right next

1167
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:51,560
to it. And autocrine is on itself, as you would guess. Now, going back to what you said earlier,

1168
01:58:52,200 --> 01:59:01,320
the one way we explain this to patients is IGF-1 is the integral of growth hormone. So if you want

1169
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:06,520
to get a sense of how much growth hormone is floating around, to a first order approximation,

1170
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:11,800
you get a sense of how much IGF somebody has, you get a sense of how much IGF is being produced by

1171
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:17,560
the liver. And to your point, that's all systemic or what we would really think of as an endocrine,

1172
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:24,120
IGF. Now what you're about to talk about is something that, frankly, never really gets talked

1173
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:31,880
about. Yeah. So IGF-1 autocrine or paracrine IGF-1 that gets released by the muscle tissue itself

1174
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:39,400
is also called mechano growth factor. And that is very anabolic to muscle tissue. But again,

1175
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:48,600
it's a very localized intrinsic response. And it makes sense from, to me, again, here we go,

1176
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:57,080
it makes sense from a teleological perspective. If you place a stress on a particular muscle tissue,

1177
01:59:57,080 --> 02:00:04,360
like your legs, it does not make sense to me that your arms will grow because you may not need your

1178
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:09,880
arms. Like if you're a, I don't know, if you're a tribe and you're having to climb something in

1179
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:14,680
the, or whatever, you know, you're using your legs much more than your arms, muscle tissue

1180
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:22,200
is an energetically expensive tissue to maintain. It takes more energy, more ATP, more calories.

1181
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:27,160
It is a futile cycle, meaning that to maintain it, you actually have to increase synthesis and

1182
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:31,400
breakdown because you're having more proteins that are misfolded and whatnot that need to be broken

1183
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:36,520
down. That whole thing takes more energy. And so that's why we tell people, if you want to be able

1184
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:40,120
to eat more calories, hey, build some more muscle because to maintain that takes more.

1185
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:48,040
So it does not make sense from a evolutionary perspective because evolution doesn't care if

1186
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:54,840
you're jacked. It cares if you can live long enough to pass on your genetic material. It does

1187
02:00:54,920 --> 02:01:01,000
not make sense that you would build a different tissue in response to a localized effect of

1188
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,800
training. And that we see that we see that if you train your legs, your arms don't get bigger.

1189
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:12,280
We know that. And if you train one leg, the other one doesn't get bigger, right? In fact,

1190
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:17,960
some of the best resistance training studies are where they use unilateral training and the person's

1191
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:23,240
non-trained legs serves as the own individual's control because you're accounting for genetic

1192
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:30,600
variations by doing that. So yeah. And then we have another probably component of mechanotransduction

1193
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:38,920
is probably phosphatidic acid. So phosphatidic acid is stored in the Z disc of the skeletal muscle,

1194
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:44,120
which if you look at a... Let's back up. Yeah. Let's remind people how actin myosin work and then

1195
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:49,720
where the Z disc fits in. Because I forgot you and I got so into the weeds. It was my bad. I should

1196
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:55,000
have reminded us that we should go back and... That's okay. That's okay. It's fun for me. So

1197
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:01,400
the contractile unit of a muscle tissue is what's called a sarcomere. And if you look at a sarcomere,

1198
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:07,480
you kind of have these two ends, which are called Z discs. And in between, you have actin and myosin,

1199
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:15,400
which overlap. And then for lack of a better term, when you contract, it's basically actin and myosin

1200
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:21,720
hooked together and pulling. Okay. Now I'm again, I'm really generalizing and I'm sure there's an

1201
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:25,960
exercise physiologist out there who's going to throw up their lunch, hearing me describe it that

1202
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:34,040
way. But for all... I feel that that's a reasonable comparison. Now, each sarcomere is separated by

1203
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:42,040
the Z disc. Okay. The Z disc is where something called phosphatidic acid is stored. And

1204
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:49,960
if you were going to try to transfer a mechanical signal to a chemical signal,

1205
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:55,960
it makes sense that you would store this stuff in the Z disc because that is where a lot of that

1206
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:01,320
mechanical tension is going to be felt. So in response to that mechanical tension, again,

1207
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:06,280
based on mechanistic studies, we believe what happens is that causes phosphatidic acid to be

1208
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:16,200
released and phosphatidic acid is a stimulator of mTOR. So we think again that these two things are

1209
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:23,400
some of the more major regulators of mechanotransduction in terms of how a muscle actually

1210
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:30,360
gets built. And then of course, we have other regulators. Testosterone doesn't really regulate

1211
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:35,800
mTOR that I'm aware of. It works more on the transcriptional level. We have things like

1212
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:40,520
insulin affects mTOR, although it doesn't seem to be a powerful enough signal to actually impact

1213
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:45,320
muscle building if insulin has an effect. It's probably more so on the protein breakdown side

1214
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:52,680
of things. In fact, if you look at studies looking at carbohydrate ingestion, we don't really see

1215
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:57,560
increases in muscle protein synthesis. So if you just give pure carbohydrate, even up to like 100

1216
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:02,680
grams of glucose, even though you get a pretty good rise in insulin, it doesn't seem to affect

1217
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:09,960
muscle protein synthesis, but it does seem to inhibit protein degradation. In fact, there was

1218
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:16,280
a study in resistance training, I think, on a Bob Wolf's lab in like 2004, and they did what's

1219
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:23,560
called AV balance. So arteriovenous balance is where basically you're infusing a stable isotope

1220
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:29,400
and you're looking at essentially how much of that label is going into the muscle and then how much

1221
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:35,560
is coming out, right? And so you can determine the net balance. And if you take a biopsy as well,

1222
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:40,760
you can determine the fractional rate of protein synthesis and then by basically subtraction can

1223
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:45,320
determine what breakdown is. So what they saw was when they gave a large amount of carbohydrates,

1224
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:50,920
people who had resistance trained, they went from a negative protein balance to almost

1225
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:58,360
to big or sorry, they went from having an increase in muscle protein breakdown to basically back to

1226
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:03,400
baseline and muscle protein breakdown and synthesis didn't change. Now, now, Lane, if you did that in

1227
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:08,440
combination with protein, would that be a better strategy to hit it at both ends where you would

1228
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:15,320
reduce degradation and increase synthesis? And is that an argument for combining carbohydrate and

1229
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:23,880
protein after a resistance training as opposed to just protein? So here's where it gets very

1230
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:29,160
complicated because there probably is some degradation that is needed in order to remodel

1231
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:36,600
and actually make things better. However, really, we need to go to the kind of the hard outcome

1232
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:44,200
studies. So there's only really two studies I know of that examined like a protein and calorie

1233
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:52,760
equated low carbohydrate diet versus a protein calorie equated non low carbohydrate diet. And

1234
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:58,120
it was it was ketogenic. So they measured blood ketones and saw they went up. And this was,

1235
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:07,400
I think, 12 weeks by somebody. Vargas was the author. And they did see less lean body mass

1236
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:14,600
accrual in the ketogenic diet group. Now, they still increased lean body mass. That's important

1237
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:21,480
to know. But the group that was getting carbohydrate or more carbohydrates had more lean body mass. Now,

1238
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:27,160
the caveat to that is carbohydrates have make you store glycogen. So was it just water or was it

1239
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:35,400
contractile tissue? Now, in the second study, they did see a difference in like one rep max squat,

1240
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:42,680
and I think bench press as well. So that kind of suggests that perhaps there is something

1241
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:47,240
different in terms of actual contractile tissue. But this is an area that's going to need to be

1242
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:51,160
studied a lot more. And again, I don't want anybody to straw man what I'm saying. I'm not saying you

1243
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:55,400
can't build muscle on a ketogenic diet. You absolutely can. You can probably build a really

1244
02:06:55,400 --> 02:07:00,760
good amount of muscle. But can you build as much as if you're including carbohydrate? Possibly not.

1245
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:05,480
And it may have something to do with carbohydrates effect or insulin effect on

1246
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:10,360
blunting muscle protein breakdown. The other thing I'll add to that, again, based on my experience,

1247
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:15,160
and you've probably talked about this with Dom, is I think one of the challenges of studying

1248
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:21,560
ketogenic diets is the length of time it takes to adapt to them. I went on a ketogenic diet in May

1249
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:28,520
of 2011 as an experiment. And I was committed to doing it for 12 weeks. And I mean, five weeks in,

1250
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:35,080
I had I was so miserable, my wife was like, what are you doing? And why? And you know,

1251
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:41,000
all the standard mistakes I was making, and the first being I made no reduction in training volume.

1252
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:48,680
And I was already training at the level of a maniac, right? So I mean, ridiculous training volume,

1253
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:55,880
and I made zero reduction in it. And I was, I mean, just staggeringly and upsettingly miserable.

1254
02:07:55,880 --> 02:08:03,000
And at 12 weeks, I finally crested the first hill, which was the aerobic hill. So at the time,

1255
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:09,720
it was cycling and swimming were the two sports. And I at 12 weeks, I just got to the point where

1256
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:16,840
I could get my aerobic base back to where it was 12 weeks earlier. But anaerobically, I was nowhere

1257
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:23,400
near what I was 12 weeks earlier. I won't put you on the spot and make you guess. But if I were

1258
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:27,880
going to make you guess how long do you well, first of all, I decided to stay with the diet,

1259
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:34,040
because I became so interested in the physiology of it. And I wanted to see like, what is it going

1260
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:41,000
to take to return back to my previous level of anaerobic fitness, it took 18 months. And I want

1261
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:49,400
to be clear, this is 18 months without one day of deviation. I would end up staying on this diet for

1262
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:56,120
three years with one day of deviation. My wife's birthday, I ended up having a bunch of cake. But

1263
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:02,680
for three years to stay on this one, you know, incredibly restrictive diet,

1264
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:08,920
it took half of that period of time just to get back to where I was anaerobically.

1265
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:16,360
So it speaks to how difficult I think it is to study any of this stuff. And by the way,

1266
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:21,400
was I perfectly controlling my exercise during that period of time? No, it's quite possible

1267
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:28,520
that some of those changes had to do with other variables. So I don't know, sometimes I just think

1268
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:33,640
this this stuff is so complicated, we should we should focus on the biggest picture questions and

1269
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:37,480
try to get at them. But then there's times when we get into discussions like this, and I'm like,

1270
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:41,960
no, these details are the most interesting part of this, right? Especially on this side of the

1271
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:45,640
equation, because this is this is an area I know so little about. That's why I was very excited to

1272
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:50,920
discuss it with you. Yeah, so I think that, you know, for the majority of the audience, I think

1273
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:55,000
that and that's why I try to provide so much context when I talk about this stuff. And I,

1274
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,320
I don't talk about the ketogenic diet study and also not say, hey, you can still build muscle on

1275
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:02,680
it, right? Because I don't want people to take away, like you said, you can't build muscle on a

1276
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:06,440
ketogenic diet, and then they go out and they see somebody who built a bunch of muscle, they go,

1277
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:10,760
okay, well, this doesn't make sense. Right? So I think that's why the nuance is very important.

1278
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:15,000
Like you said, we're in the details, right? Because that's what's interesting to us,

1279
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,160
because we kind of hopefully know some of the like the major things, right?

1280
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:22,200
It's the same as testosterone, right? You could say the same thing. You'd be like,

1281
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:26,520
do you need to take exogenous to talk testosterone to be a bodybuilder? Nope. Look at all the

1282
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:34,280
examples. But if your goal is to be the biggest, the strongest, I have news for you. Go and get

1283
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:39,480
yourself to some testosterone, sip, unite and get ready to start smacking 1000 milligrams every

1284
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:44,280
single week. I mean, that's the reality of it, you know, so and again, that that's spoken

1285
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:51,000
without prejudice, it's simply biochemistry. Yeah. And anecdote plays into this and anecdote

1286
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,240
is important. And I'm about to discuss yours a little bit. But I always tell people like be just

1287
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:59,800
be, be cautious with anecdote. I'm not saying that your anecdote doesn't matter. But what I am saying

1288
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:03,800
is everyone knows somebody who smoked every single day of their life till they were 90, right? And

1289
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:09,160
live to a ripe old age. Does that mean that it's okay to smoke? Or do we think that's the best thing

1290
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:15,560
for longevity? We certainly do not, right? So when we're, when we're making broad recommendations,

1291
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:21,160
we're doing that based on the consensus of the evidence. But we, we also need to understand that

1292
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:25,880
there will be outliers that fall outside that. And that's where you know, individualization comes in.

1293
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:31,320
So I think one of the things that we really are struggling with right now, and I kind of challenged

1294
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:36,760
the low carb community on this a while back, because one of my pet peeves is I'm not saying

1295
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:41,720
that there's not such a thing as ketogenic adaptation or fat adaptation that may take longer.

1296
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:47,080
What I'm saying is we need a hard metric for it. We really need some kind of hard metric to explain

1297
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:51,720
this. Because if we look at things like, okay, let's look at blood ketones, it's clearly not

1298
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:56,760
that. Yeah, yeah, it's clearly not blood ketones. It's not lipolysis. It's not. I mean, my only

1299
02:11:56,760 --> 02:12:01,960
regret because we see fat oxidation, fat oxidation within six days. No, no, it's none of the things

1300
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:06,680
that we understand. I mean, my biggest regret about the experiment I did, because I'm never going to

1301
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:14,120
be repeating it, is I wish at the time I had the thought and wherewithal to have taken muscle

1302
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:22,840
biopsies and collected, you know, ample amounts of tissue for all the future proteomics, metabolomics,

1303
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:27,320
every omic you can think of to have been done down the line. It still would have only been an

1304
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:35,000
N of one. But to me, if that 18 month transition was something beyond psychological, and let's

1305
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,640
be honest, it could have been psychological too, right? Could have been if it was anything other

1306
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:45,720
than psychological, I suspect the answer is far deeper than in any of the things that typically

1307
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:51,800
get talked about. Yeah, so I think if I was going to explain your kind of 18 months to get back to

1308
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:59,320
anaerobic, right. So first off, I think it's important to note that when it comes to when it

1309
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:04,120
comes to exercise, there's some diverging information in terms of the ketogenic diet,

1310
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:09,240
low carb diet, whether or not it's bad for exercise, I think we can pretty conclusively

1311
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:14,120
say that for ultra endurance, there doesn't seem to be a downside to it. It also doesn't seem to

1312
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:20,520
be superior, it kind of boils down to personal preference and what the person likes. When it

1313
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:26,920
comes to aerobic exercise, at least from what I've seen, if you're under 60% of your VO2 max,

1314
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:33,880
you're probably safe in terms of getting the most out of your exercise after you're fat adapted.

1315
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:39,800
When it comes to over 70%, that's where we start to get into where it becomes much more difficult

1316
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:45,480
to perform well or as optimally as you can on a ketogenic diet. And of course, yes, if you,

1317
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:49,720
like somebody sent me something said, well, look at Sean Baker, he's deadlifting 500 pounds for

1318
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:54,200
nine reps, and he's 50 years old, you know, like, how do you explain that? And I said,

1319
02:13:55,080 --> 02:14:00,280
okay, again, this is why we have randomized control trials, because I'm not saying that he's

1320
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:04,920
not strong. And I'm not saying that you can't get strong and that you can't do some heavy

1321
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:11,560
weights for higher reps. What the question you need to ask yourself is, is he as strong as he

1322
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:18,440
possibly could have been if he was doing something different? Because just the sheer magnitude of

1323
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:22,600
resistance training consistently for a long period of time, you will get very strong. It doesn't

1324
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:27,640
matter what diet you're on, you will get strong or relatively strong for what you started at.

1325
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:35,880
So the question always has to be, are we talking about, can you do something? Or was this the best

1326
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:39,720
thing that you could possibly do? Because those are two different questions, right? It's like when

1327
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:44,120
people talk about how much protein do I need? Well, you only need about 50 grams a day if we're

1328
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:50,680
talking about preventing you from being in a negative nitrogen balance. But what's optimal

1329
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:57,000
for health or lean body mass? So that's a very different question, right? So I think that when,

1330
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:02,600
I guess if I could implore the listeners, just always remember that when you see something that

1331
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:08,360
you think contradicts or that you think is it doesn't fit. What is the person saying? Are they

1332
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:12,440
talking about optimizing or are they talking about, can you actually do this? Because if somebody says,

1333
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:16,440
well, you can't get strong in ketogenic diet, I'd say, well, you're an idiot. Of course you can.

1334
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:23,480
Right? I mean, look at Dom. Dom, I've seen him deadlift 700 pounds multiple times with no

1335
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:28,680
carbohydrate intake, right? So it's obviously not true. The other thing I always encourage

1336
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:33,800
people to think about on this front is the relative to what comparison, which is a slight

1337
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:38,520
variation on what you said. So I know you had a great video out there, which we'll link to on

1338
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:44,360
critiquing the documentary Game Changers, which unfortunately, I just think was such a horrible,

1339
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:50,440
horrible piece of propaganda. And I say that not as someone who's against a plant based diet,

1340
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:55,640
I think much like you, but someone who is very much against disgusting science. And I found that

1341
02:15:55,640 --> 02:16:01,320
to be a demonstration of utter nonsense. But, you know, when we wrote something about this,

1342
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:07,480
one of the comments was, or one of the points we tried to make was, you know, one of the biggest

1343
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:12,680
challenges of studying nutrition in general is what are you comparing it to? And if you compare

1344
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:17,960
diet X to the standard American diet, almost by definition, diet X is going to look amazing.

1345
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:25,560
Because the standard American diet is such an awful diet. And I just, you know, I thought it

1346
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:33,240
was such an insincere attempt to talk about a form of nutrition that obviously has many benefits.

1347
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:38,760
But but when it's done in that way, it's pretty bad. And we probably won't have time to go into

1348
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:43,400
it today. But you I thought did such a great job of going into some of the real challenges of that,

1349
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:48,120
with at a level that most people didn't write, like, a lot of the criticisms of that movie are

1350
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:53,160
so obvious and easy, but you actually went deep in them. So we'll make sure people people go and look

1351
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:57,800
at that. I want to change gears for a second and come back to this cortisol thing. Because I think

1352
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:03,800
this is a very misunderstood hormone. And I know you've written about this. And I think it's worth

1353
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:09,240
getting the listener up to speed on cortisol. We tend to look at this very black and white.

1354
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:15,640
So let's give the extremes. So there's something called an Addisonian crisis, right? Someone gets

1355
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:21,000
a bad infection, they have an injury to their adrenal gland, they can't make cortisol acutely,

1356
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:26,680
they're going to die, they are hands down going to die. The only way to rescue that patient

1357
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:33,400
is to give them massive doses of hydrocortisone or hydrocortisone equivalent. And that very much

1358
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:39,160
speaks to the medical necessity of cortisol. Let's look at the other extreme. Let's look at

1359
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:45,000
Cushing's disease. So you can have Cushing's disease or Cushing's syndrome, where either at

1360
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:50,520
the pituitary gland or at the adrenal gland, rampant amounts of cortisol are made and nobody

1361
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:58,520
would dispute the pathology of that state. This is a person who develops basically a ball of fat

1362
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:03,640
on the back of their neck. That's basically the size of a basketball, excessive fat accumulation,

1363
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:09,400
all sorts of metabolic dysregulation. Again, nobody would dispute that that is a problem.

1364
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:17,960
Fortunately, very few people are in either of those states. So let's now talk about

1365
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:24,600
physiologic levels of cortisol and their impact on muscle protein synthesis and something you

1366
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:31,160
said earlier, which I found very interesting, which was tolerating pain, pain threshold,

1367
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:36,840
training resilience and things like that. Yeah, so we have to think about the function of cortisol

1368
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:41,560
on its root, which is a stress hormone, right? So you're secreting hormone,

1369
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:49,560
secortisol in response to some kind of stressor. When it comes again, so this is a great example

1370
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:57,000
of acute versus chronic. Okay. When it comes to somebody who's getting very low sleep,

1371
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:03,800
overall unhealthy lifestyle, smoke, whatever, they're going to have high levels of cortisol

1372
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:08,680
and that can be problematic from the, or very high levels of stress. Because now,

1373
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:13,400
like think about what stress used to mean. Stress used to mean, oh crap, there's that thing that's

1374
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:18,040
going to kill me. I need to run. And so your body would produce cortisol for a myriad of

1375
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:23,160
different reasons. Part of that was just a fuel mobilization response. It mobilizes glucose,

1376
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:27,880
free fatty acids, those sorts of things. It's just trying to get as much fuel in the bloodstream

1377
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:36,680
as it can. Now, when it comes to Cushing's, for example, because, or at least my best guess is,

1378
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:40,920
and there may be studies on this, I haven't looked super in detail on it. My best guess is,

1379
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:46,920
it's not necessarily that you're accumulating fat, you're redistributing it, right? Like it's going

1380
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:53,080
to weird places. That's right. The legs become incredibly thin, the abdomen and the upper back

1381
02:19:53,080 --> 02:20:01,320
become incredibly full. Right. So you actually see this in like, people who have, oh God,

1382
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:09,880
what do you call it? Why can't I think of the name? Oh, like, okay. So your adipose doesn't just sit

1383
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:15,480
on nothing. It sits on the extracellular matrix. If you do liposuction, it destroys that matrix.

1384
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:21,960
And so people go, oh, well you can't gain fat back. You can't gain it back there. But you start,

1385
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:27,640
if you regain it, you start gaining it in very odd places. And so what you're looking at is a

1386
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:32,840
redistribution because cortisol, going back to cortisol, if you have high cortisol because

1387
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:38,200
you're stressed constantly and your, your body is still operating on genes from, you know,

1388
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:43,160
a million years ago, that's telling you we're stressed, must be something coming to kill us.

1389
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:49,320
So we're going to liberate a bunch of energy into the bloodstream. Well, well, then it's still got,

1390
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:53,640
if you're not going to use it, if it doesn't get used, it's got to be put back somewhere. Right.

1391
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:58,200
And so now you can have it started to be deposited in strange places possibly.

1392
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:06,440
Now, when it comes to exercise specifically, it's a stressor. Exercise is a stressor. It makes sense

1393
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:12,840
that it would increase your cortisol. But people have kind of taken the say, well, we need to limit

1394
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:15,880
cortisol as much as possible. So remember, there used to be the old, I don't know if you remember

1395
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:20,920
this, but it was like, don't train more than an hour because at that point cortisol starts to go

1396
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:29,560
up, starts to spike. I miss that entire memo and school of thought, fortunately. So interestingly,

1397
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:35,880
so we've referenced Stu Phillips a few times now. He did the study, I want to say 10 years ago and

1398
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:42,040
looked at different hormones and how they associated with actual hypertrophy. So he looked at

1399
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:51,080
or sorry. So the post exercise increases in systemic hormones. So he looked at testosterone,

1400
02:21:51,080 --> 02:22:00,360
IGF-1, growth hormone, cortisol. And I think that was it. Guess which hormone was most closely

1401
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:04,680
associated with hypertrophy? I'm absolutely cortisol, hands down. But of course, I'm familiar with the paper, but yes.

1402
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:12,120
Right. And yeah, the interpretation is, again, is it that cortisol is producing hypertrophy or is it

1403
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:18,600
cortisol is in response to the stress that is producing hypertrophy? So that's, again, this

1404
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:23,320
seems paradoxical because people see an association, they automatically think, well, there must be a cause

1405
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:29,480
there. Not necessarily at all. These two things are happening in parallel. So what it means is the

1406
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:39,080
resistance training session that is going to produce the most amount of stress, the most amount

1407
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:44,200
of adaptation is probably going to produce the most cortisol and possibly the most hypertrophy

1408
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:51,000
if it's repeated. Right. So cortisol, like we know that it will impede muscle protein synthesis. But

1409
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:59,080
again, that is cortisol acts transcriptionally like testosterone. It is actually a steroid hormone.

1410
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:04,440
In fact, people get confused because they're like, well, he got a steroid injection before his tennis

1411
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:08,680
match. And people are like, they're not just just not injecting with testosterone. They're giving him

1412
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:13,640
cortisol so he can go out and play because it reduces inflammation in that particular area.

1413
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:24,920
Well, cortisol is more of a long term hormone. It's acting transcriptionally. So it's what you need

1414
02:23:24,920 --> 02:23:31,000
to be worried about are long term, low level elevations in cortisol. And people make this

1415
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:36,840
mistake with anything they make it with mTOR. A lot of the vegan doctors get all up in arms about

1416
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:40,600
mTOR, you know, getting stimulated by leucine. And that's going to give you cancer.

1417
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:46,360
You don't understand tissue specifics. And you don't understand acute versus chronic.

1418
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:52,840
I just want to make a funny comment there. I was at a meeting and a very famous vegan doctor who

1419
02:23:52,840 --> 02:24:01,560
I obviously won't name came up to me and chastised me for the idea that I would ever suggest someone

1420
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:10,440
ingest five grams of leucine during a workout because of its negative effect on mTOR. And how

1421
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:16,760
that could be bad for a person's health. And I just had to sit there and smile and see. Yeah,

1422
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:20,520
I just don't have it in me sometimes to tell people to shut up.

1423
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:27,480
A lot of this is really reductionist thinking. You know what I mean? And this happens for all

1424
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:32,440
different. If I can switch gears just a little bit, because I think this is really important for

1425
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:42,040
people here. People want to isolate out nutrients as being good or bad. And I would really implore

1426
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:50,040
people that nutrients are not necessarily good or bad. Context matters. And what really matters

1427
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:58,360
is lifestyle and overall eating patterns. That is what matters. You cannot possibly

1428
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:06,200
think that in a diet where there are thousands of different nutrients that we ingest,

1429
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:11,160
that it's one thing is causing all the problems that we're having.

1430
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:18,680
Right? And this, whether it's leucine or sugar or whatever. Because when you isolate out these

1431
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:25,960
things, you can find mechanistic data to support almost anything you want. But even things that we

1432
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:30,120
think we know, like I remember when I got to grad school and I was like, high fructose corn syrup

1433
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:34,760
independently fattening. It doesn't matter the calories, anything like that. And again,

1434
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:39,000
do I think high fructose corn syrup is good? Absolutely not. I think it's hyper palatable.

1435
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:45,080
I think people overeat it. But if you look at the studies pretty closely, it seems to mostly be an

1436
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:51,480
energy thing that it just provides too much energy. Now people hear that and they think it's a

1437
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:57,320
dismissal of it, you know, like that I'm condoning it or something like that. And I'm not condoning

1438
02:25:57,320 --> 02:26:02,440
it. I'm just saying that if you isolate it out and you keep people's calories the same, it doesn't

1439
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:06,920
seem to have the same effect. But do people who eat a lot of high fructose corn syrup keep their

1440
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:11,160
calories the same? Of course not. They eat more calories than other people. They also usually

1441
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:20,920
eat more processed foods, more fats, all that sort of thing. So a great study that I think came

1442
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:25,720
out a couple of years ago that I think really highlights this point was a study where they

1443
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:33,080
looked at all, I think it was cancer incidents from any form of cancer. And it was in Canada,

1444
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:41,400
100,000 people cohort, and they looked at low meat intake versus high meat intake. And I think it

1445
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:48,200
was in quartiles, so four different levels. And I mean, we know this, if you do that, what you tend

1446
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:52,600
to find is that meat is meat intakes associated with cancer. Now the problem is people who eat

1447
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:57,560
high amounts of meat tend to have an overall unhealthy lifestyle in general. They're less

1448
02:26:57,560 --> 02:27:02,680
likely to exercise and more likely to smoke. They're more likely to eat processed foods because most

1449
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:09,640
of the meat is coming from fast food, that sort of thing. But what was cool about this was they

1450
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:15,480
also compared it with the lowest to highest quartiles of fruit and vegetable intake. And what

1451
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:21,480
they found was that at the highest level of meat intake, but also that also consumed the highest

1452
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:27,960
level of fruit and vegetable intake, they had the same risk for cancer as the lowest level of meat

1453
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:35,320
intake with a high level of fruit and vegetable intake. So basically what that tends to suggest

1454
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:43,560
is that to me, we need to look at eating patterns much more so than we look at individual nutrients.

1455
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:51,320
And that if you're looking for one nutrient to explain disease incidents, this sort of stuff,

1456
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:59,160
you really need to look at the whole diet. And people who eat sugar, like when I say that sugar

1457
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:06,600
isn't inherently bad for you, I mean from a purely mechanical, if I take 50 grams out of somebody's

1458
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:13,720
diet of starchy carbohydrate and I just put sugar into it, or the same equal calories from fats and

1459
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:20,120
I just put sugar in there, do I think anything bad is going to happen? Probably not. But that's

1460
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:26,760
not how people eat. So I'm talking mechanistically and people think I'm making a recommendation.

1461
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:34,760
So all that to say, it's really important to understand how limited nutritional studies are.

1462
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:40,920
And you mentioned it, when you're talking about trying to pick out these really granular details,

1463
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:47,400
you're talking about a study that's so restrictive, it's really hard to generalize the results to the

1464
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:53,640
average person. So when you look at studies that are generalizable to the average population,

1465
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:59,320
you can't control that many variables because it has to be free living. And if it has to be free

1466
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:04,520
living, I mean it's very hard to pick out differences because dietary adherence tends to

1467
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:12,120
be so low. So I know I went off on a really big divergent rant, but acute versus chronic,

1468
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:18,920
localized versus systemic. People just don't understand the differences and this includes

1469
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:26,680
scientists. I mean even like inflammation, a great example of this is on the Joe Rogan

1470
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:31,400
Game Changers debate where John Wilkes was talking about inflammation. He said,

1471
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:39,880
if you're training for exercise and you're having higher levels of inflammation from that

1472
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:44,760
and then you go and eat meat afterwards, like now you're compounding that inflammation.

1473
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:48,680
And I just remember thinking, you just don't understand the difference between acute versus

1474
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:54,520
chronic. These aren't even the same types of inflammation, right? Like your acute

1475
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:59,720
inflammatory response from exercise means nothing. Well, it actually doesn't mean nothing.

1476
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:00,760
It's beneficial actually.

1477
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:06,920
Exercise it. Yeah, yeah. So here's the crazy thing about exercise. If you were an alien and

1478
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:12,360
you didn't know anything about exercise, but you knew about human physiology and I told you,

1479
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:17,880
hey, I'm going to make you do something that increases your blood pressure, increases your

1480
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:22,280
heart rate, increases your free radical production, increases your inflammation,

1481
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:30,440
all these different things, you would go, that's horrible. Don't do it. But what is exercise?

1482
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:40,760
It's almost like a vaccine, right? You give a controlled dose of a stressor and your body

1483
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:45,320
adapts to that stressor by getting better at handling it. So what do we see in people who

1484
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:49,960
exercise regularly? They have lower resting heart rate. They have lower blood pressure.

1485
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:57,480
They have lower levels of inflammation, those sorts of things. And nutritionally,

1486
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:01,720
I question like these studies that look at inflammatory response and response in terms

1487
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:05,320
of post-meal injection. I really go, how much does that actually mean?

1488
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:11,560
Yeah, I think this stuff means absolutely nothing. I think that, you know, when you think about the

1489
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:16,520
time course of something and you tell me that you measured somebody's IGF one or IGF six an

1490
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:22,040
hour after a meal and in two hours. Yeah, I agree with you completely. It's totally nonsense. And

1491
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:27,560
by the way, your point about exercise, I think comes back to what you said when you were making

1492
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:33,160
that decision between nutrition science and exercise science, which was, look, exercise

1493
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:38,360
probably is the best drug we have. I agree emphatically with that. I think that when you

1494
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:46,920
think about the the hormesis that comes from exercise, like I just I don't believe we will

1495
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:52,600
ever be able to develop a drug that is that remarkable. It is simply unbelievable what it

1496
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:59,000
can do. No, I mean, look at it like almost any dietary intervention, unless you're unless you're

1497
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:03,720
okay with just small improvements to see big improvements, you pretty much got to lose body

1498
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:09,480
fat like that. That's that's that's that's what the crux of it is. With exercise, you get massive

1499
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:18,200
improvements with zero loss of weight. You can see big improvements. And so, you know, I just

1500
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:23,320
implore people what are the what are the and this goes for like kind of the two opposing ends like

1501
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:29,320
you're like plant based kind of really emphatic supporters and then like low carb supporters.

1502
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:34,920
I hear a lot of people they'll spend so much time, you know, on these granular details of diet and

1503
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:39,000
they say, well, I don't I don't resistance exercise. I don't have time for it. And I'm like,

1504
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:44,040
you got time to stress over your diet on Twitter on Twitter for two hours, but you don't have time

1505
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:51,160
to go into the gym, or just do some push ups at home like you are missing out on the most powerful

1506
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:57,640
tool you have to improve your health and body composition. And even like there was a study by

1507
02:32:57,640 --> 02:33:07,160
Wolf looking at longevity over age 65 and found a direct association, the most powerful predictor

1508
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:14,040
of longevity after age 65 was how much lean body mass you had. That was the most powerful

1509
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:18,600
predictor of who lived the longest after age 65 was your level of lean body. Yeah, and there are

1510
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:25,960
lots of studies that go beyond just the sarcopenia and look at like grip strength and and things like

1511
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:32,920
that. So yeah, I completely agree. And I love the idea, by the way of in between Twitter feuds over

1512
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:38,520
your nutritional views, you have to do some push ups. That's that could be the solution to this

1513
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:43,720
problem. I want to talk a little bit about I'm sorry, we're just I keep saying we're going to

1514
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:49,000
wrap this up and we're not I'm sorry, we're going to wrap this up at some point. One thing that I've

1515
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:55,560
been really impressed with in following you lane is the what's the right word I want to use

1516
02:33:56,760 --> 02:34:01,400
the the deliberate nature with which you approach things. So I've seen pictures of you

1517
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:06,440
where I think like he doesn't even look like a human being he's so ripped and shredded. And I've

1518
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:10,840
seen pictures of you where you look kind of chubby. And you've been very clear and said,

1519
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:15,560
I'm going through different phases. I'm very deliberate about what I do. This is a phase

1520
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:22,280
where I am adding a ton of lean mass and with it comes some body fat. And right now I'm taking it

1521
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:29,640
off. But one, you're very deliberate. So nothing's haphazard. And two, you really emphasize the

1522
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:37,240
importance of consistency. So how do I stay consistent, because it's it doesn't take nearly

1523
02:34:37,240 --> 02:34:44,120
as much work to preserve muscle mass once you have it. But you and I talked about this with Alex

1524
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:50,040
Hutchinson on a previous podcast. One of the things I fear the most for my patients as they age is any

1525
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:55,320
sort of injury or illness that takes them out of exercise, because the deconditioning that occurs

1526
02:34:55,320 --> 02:35:00,920
when someone doesn't do anything for a month is devastating. So can you can you put some numbers

1527
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:06,120
to that? Because I believe you've spoken about this, which is what is the effort required to maintain?

1528
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:12,680
And I'm not talking about show, you know, like 4% body fat on a stage I'm talking about. And again,

1529
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:18,200
we'll use your numbers as an example, you happen to be, you know, great to begin with. But, you know,

1530
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:25,720
for you to stay at 13 14% body fat is not the end of the world. It's not a huge sacrifice,

1531
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:30,200
but it requires being diligent still. What does that mean to you? And how do you advise your

1532
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:36,600
clients around that? So there's a few layers to this. When it comes to resistance training,

1533
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:40,840
I mean, this is really just anything in life resistance training taught me so much about just

1534
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:47,000
life overall, right? So the same people who come up with bio hacks of how you can like get to your

1535
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:52,200
goal in 12 weeks or whatever, in the financial world, they're the same people who are like,

1536
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:57,160
hey, join my pyramid scheme and earn six figures from home doing one hour of work a week.

1537
02:35:58,280 --> 02:36:04,280
Most reasonable people know that that's not how you acquire wealth, right? You acquire wealth

1538
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:10,040
through if you're, you know, Thomas J. Stanley's I use fiscal examples, because I just find it's

1539
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:16,760
easier for people. But 80% of millionaires are first generation self made. And most of them

1540
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:23,800
got there, not through getting lucky, but the fact that they saved more money than they earned,

1541
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:30,040
they were consistent, and they did that for a long period of time. Now, that is the granular,

1542
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:34,200
mechanistic way of doing it kind of like how we talk about calories in calories out, right?

1543
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:42,440
But what it takes to get that consistency is modification to behavior, right? Because for the

1544
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:48,280
same reason that somebody binges on whatever, donuts, chocolate cakes, cookies, whatever,

1545
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:53,400
is the same reason that somebody who also knows, hey, in order for me to save money,

1546
02:36:54,280 --> 02:37:00,840
I need to earn more than I spend, still goes out and blows 1500 bucks on a shopping spree after a

1547
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:09,640
stressful week, right? Because they have a habit and an association with something. And so I think

1548
02:37:09,640 --> 02:37:17,640
people need to understand that consistency is the most important thing. But to create that

1549
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:25,400
consistency, you have to change your habits. You have to create habits. I read a review,

1550
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:30,200
systematic review by a gal named Marie Shpeckley. And I'm going to give myself a pat in the back

1551
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:33,960
here for a second, because she actually said that she went back to school after reading my book,

1552
02:37:33,960 --> 02:37:37,640
Fat Loss Forever. And it's what inspired her to do her PhD work, which is pretty awesome.

1553
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:45,000
And she did a systematic review of looking at people who lost weight and kept it off.

1554
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:52,040
So some of the commonalities of that. And a lot of it was what you expected, consistency,

1555
02:37:53,080 --> 02:38:00,600
ability to embrace challenges rather than running from them, or viewing challenges as part of the

1556
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:06,360
process. I think a lot of people, when setbacks occur or challenges occur, they feel that that's

1557
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:12,440
abnormal as opposed to embracing it as part of this process. But then something that was in the

1558
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:18,760
paper that I hadn't thought about before, that I think is so critical to developing that consistency

1559
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:27,160
and making a change, forming a new identity. So the people who lost weight and kept it off

1560
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:35,000
said that they had to form a new identity. And I really chewed on this for a while. And do you

1561
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:41,560
know Ethan Suplete? No, but I was just about to say James Clear is the first person who made that

1562
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:49,720
point clear to me, no pun intended. And of all the things in James's book, that one actually

1563
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:56,520
appealed to me the most, which was, it's not about discipline. Well, I always knew it wasn't about

1564
02:38:56,520 --> 02:39:02,440
discipline and willpower, because those things are going to fade over time. But this piece around,

1565
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:08,600
and let's use exercise as the example, it's going from, oh, I have to do this thing, I have to do

1566
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:16,120
this thing too. I'm a person who exercises, I'm a fit person. That's the transition that makes it

1567
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:21,800
easier to do day in and day out. And that's probably why I've never struggled with exercise.

1568
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:26,200
I struggle with the opposite. I really struggle to take a day off. I think to be completely

1569
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:31,640
transparent, I'm always going to struggle with food a little bit. I haven't had the full identity

1570
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:37,960
switch in food, but I think I was born with, or at least it was etched in my brain when I was so

1571
02:39:37,960 --> 02:39:43,800
young due to my insecurities around exercise. So I think you said something very poignant there.

1572
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:50,120
You just put in your mind, this is what I do. This is what I do. This is part of who I am.

1573
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:55,640
And so Ethan Suplete, he's an actor, and he was in, you probably, if you've seen the movie,

1574
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:59,080
Remember the Titans? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yes, yes, yes. I know who you're talking about now.

1575
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:03,480
He lost a staggering amount of weight, like I almost an unrecognizable amount of weight.

1576
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:11,080
He's Jack now, right? So I talked to him pretty frequently. And he has a thing he puts on his

1577
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:16,600
Instagram, he's here, he's say I killed my clone today. And I asked him about that, because I read

1578
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:20,520
Marie's paper. And then I made this connection, because I always wondered what he meant by killed

1579
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:27,000
my clone today. And I said, is this what you mean, that you formed a new identity that you killed the

1580
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:32,360
old person that you were, and he said, that is exactly what I mean. Because you cannot create a

1581
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:37,480
new life, a new identity, or you cannot create a new life, and you cannot have a physical and

1582
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:43,480
overall change in your life without fun, while still dragging those behaviors behind you, right?

1583
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:50,360
Let's take a basic example, an alcoholic, right? If you decide, if an alcoholic decides tomorrow,

1584
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,840
I don't want to be this anymore. You have to change everything. You can't just, okay, I want

1585
02:40:56,840 --> 02:41:01,640
to stop drinking. No, no, your entire identity has been around. I go to a bar, I hang out with my

1586
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:07,000
friends after work, they probably drink, my family probably drank growing up, that's where I learned

1587
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:15,720
it from. Now you've got to change everything. You are not going to be able to be this new person

1588
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:20,440
while still dragging your old behaviors behind you. And I think a lot of people try to do that

1589
02:41:20,440 --> 02:41:26,280
when it comes to nutrition, and maybe even exercise. It's, well, I want things to change,

1590
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:31,480
but I don't want to give up my three glasses of wine tonight, or I don't want to give up this,

1591
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:33,720
or I don't want to give up that. What I always tell people is like, listen,

1592
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:41,080
the great thing about nutrition is you get to pick what you sacrifice, okay? So for me,

1593
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:46,920
what made it easy for me, and I always tell people, you should pick the form of restriction

1594
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:55,160
that feels easiest to you. I don't care what anybody else feels like. For me, if I'm able to

1595
02:41:55,160 --> 02:42:01,400
eat whatever foods I want, as long as I control portion size and track my calories and macros and

1596
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:07,880
whatnot, that feels easy. That is not difficult for me to maintain like a lean physique and athletic.

1597
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:16,280
But for other people, that may be extremely tedious, difficult. It may feel labor intensive.

1598
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:21,320
To me, it doesn't. What feels labor intensive to me is saying, okay, Lane, you can't have

1599
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:28,280
processed food ever again, or you can't have carbs, or you can't have fats or whatever.

1600
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:36,200
But for other people, some people, I hear it all the time, say, I did X diet, ketogenic diet,

1601
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:44,600
and it felt easy. I did intermittent fasting. I was never hungry. I felt easy. Cool. Great. Just

1602
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:49,320
don't assume that what was easy for you is going to be easy for everybody else because this,

1603
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:54,040
you know, I thought flexible dieting was going to be the solution for everybody because it was easy

1604
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:57,880
for me. So I arrogantly assumed that it'd be that way for everybody else. I think everybody goes

1605
02:42:57,880 --> 02:43:02,680
through that. That's sort of like, you know, you seek out your own echo chamber sort of thing,

1606
02:43:02,680 --> 02:43:07,000
right? And you find these people who had the same, that had the same experience as you,

1607
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:10,040
and you assume everybody's like that. It turns out, no, no, people were quite different.

1608
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:17,240
So find the, you get to pick the type of restriction, find what feels easiest and try

1609
02:43:17,240 --> 02:43:25,400
not to get too caught up in, well, this diet increases fat oxidation and insulin and like

1610
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:29,240
all these little things we talked about. Cause at the end of the day, if you've ever lost weight

1611
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:34,040
and then regained it, why did it happen? It didn't happen because you didn't get your

1612
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:39,160
macronutrient ratio perfect or your nutrient timing. Was it down? It happened because you

1613
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:43,320
stopped being consistent with the behaviors that you implemented. That's what happened.

1614
02:43:44,360 --> 02:43:47,560
And the same thing goes with exercise. People tell me all the time, like, man,

1615
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:57,080
Lane, I wish I was motivated like you. I'm like, ha. I would say that I, I love lifting

1616
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:04,200
weights and that makes it easier to be motivated. I acquired that love through years. But I don't

1617
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:11,080
always love it. Just like I'm not always happy with my spouse, right? Like some days we fight.

1618
02:44:11,080 --> 02:44:15,800
Doesn't mean I don't love her overall. It just means some days we get annoyed at each other.

1619
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:21,960
Some days I'm unhappy with weightlifting. I don't want to do it. However, I always tell people,

1620
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:25,800
and I'm not saying you can never take a day off. Of course, you know, if you need a day off to reset

1621
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:30,440
whatever, that's fine. You just got to be careful that that doesn't turn into weeks and months and

1622
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:36,280
years. Right? And here's the comparison I use. I don't have to be motivated to go into training.

1623
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:41,400
It's part of what I do. Just like I don't have to be motivated and pump myself up to brush my teeth.

1624
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:45,800
Do you know why? Because it's a very simple equation. If I don't brush my teeth,

1625
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:51,080
they're going to go to crap. Just like if I don't exercise, my body's going to go to crap.

1626
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:57,000
So it doesn't, it is not for me, it is not a question of motivation. It is a question of

1627
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:01,480
what do I want and what are the actions that are required to get what I want.

1628
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:07,560
And if my actions do not line up with what is needed and the amount of work that is needed,

1629
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:13,080
it's very simple. I'm not going to get what I want. And it's on a fundamental level,

1630
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:22,920
it's that simple. But getting people to one, buy in and two, get past the stage where you start,

1631
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:26,360
you've got that honeymoon phase and everything feels good. You're like, yeah, I'm going to do this.

1632
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:32,920
And then you hit your first challenge or your first setback or your scale fluctuate. Actually,

1633
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:39,400
during the systematic review, participants talked about how seeing the scale fluctuate. Well,

1634
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:44,760
it was a difficult thing to get over. And some people would quit because they would gain three

1635
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:48,840
pounds when in reality, they probably just had a bad weigh in day. That's why this is why I actually

1636
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:53,240
tell people weigh in every single day and take the average because the average is not going to

1637
02:45:53,240 --> 02:46:00,120
fluctuate that much. So anyways, no, I think I think those are just those are those are great

1638
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:06,520
points. Yeah. The point of this all is that consistency is the fundamental you can do.

1639
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:13,720
You could have any diet, you could have any training system. If you're consistent, you're going to see

1640
02:46:13,720 --> 02:46:20,200
results. I use this comparison. I'll throw it back to you on this one. If I said to you, Peter,

1641
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:25,320
I want you to go out and become the best three point shooter you possibly can be.

1642
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:34,120
You cannot get any instruction. You can't read any books. You can't get a coach, nothing. But if

1643
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:40,840
all you did every single day for three hours a day for 10 years was go out and shoot three pointers,

1644
02:46:41,720 --> 02:46:46,600
you probably wouldn't be in the NBA. But I bet you'd be pretty damn good at shooting three pointers.

1645
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:52,200
You know what I mean? I would agree with that. Hopefully better than I am now. Because right now

1646
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:58,360
I'm not joking. My 12 year old daughter is probably the same as me at shooting three

1647
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:04,680
pointers, which means by the time she's 13, she might be better than me. Well, I think that's the

1648
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:11,160
that's the other thing for people to keep in mind is use other people's stories for inspiration, but

1649
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:17,960
be very careful about comparing yourself. Because what you need to ask yourself is

1650
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:27,720
can I get better? Try not to ask yourself, can I be like X person? Because the answer might be no.

1651
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:34,040
But here's the rub. You'll never know unless you put in the decade worth of work, right? Like when

1652
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:39,000
I started out, I had people tell me, why are you lifting weights? You're skinny. You'll never be

1653
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,440
never be jacked. And then even when I got into powerlifting, people were like, look at how long

1654
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:52,280
your legs are. Look at how you squat. You will never be good at this. If I were to listen to that,

1655
02:47:52,280 --> 02:47:56,440
I never would have set a gold medal in the squat. I never I never would have done that.

1656
02:47:57,240 --> 02:48:02,840
Now that world record got broken and I may never get it back. Very good chance I'll never get it

1657
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:11,480
back. But I got a lot farther than I ever could have imagined just through sheer consistency.

1658
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:20,440
I did a lot of stuff wrong, but sheer mass effect of work and consistency can make up for a lot of

1659
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:25,960
shortcomings. And I think a lot of people out there have paralysis by analysis and they never

1660
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:30,600
just start because they're so intimidated by all the information that's out there.

1661
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:38,920
Lane, we actually got through a third of the stuff I wanted to talk about today. And I'm going to

1662
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:42,760
make it I'm going to make an on the field decision that we're going to probably have to sit down

1663
02:48:42,760 --> 02:48:48,120
again. Because I want to talk about a lot of things I want to talk about creatine, I want to

1664
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:54,520
talk about catsu or occlusion training, I want to talk about really nuanced stuff around the

1665
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:59,560
differences between the size of a muscle, the strength of a muscle and the metabolic function

1666
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:03,640
of a muscle. There are a lot of other things I want to go into with you. And I also wanted to go a

1667
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:10,760
little deeper into this sort of leucine signaling stuff. But to even scratch this, I know, I know.

1668
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:16,520
And to go to go into that stuff superficially now doesn't do it justice. So why don't we just agree

1669
02:49:16,520 --> 02:49:22,440
to do this again at some point? Sure. All right, man. Well, listen, this has been a ton of fun for

1670
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:28,520
me. I hope it's been enjoyable for you. And thank you for making the time. Thank you. I appreciate it.

1671
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:33,960
I enjoyed it. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested

1672
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:38,840
in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to

1673
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:44,200
bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure

1674
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:49,480
members get back much more than the price of the subscription. To that end, membership benefits

1675
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:54,840
include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail

1676
02:49:54,840 --> 02:50:00,200
every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's

1677
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:06,040
show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1678
02:50:06,040 --> 02:50:11,800
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1679
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:17,160
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release

1680
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:21,560
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1681
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:26,840
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1682
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:32,440
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1683
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:37,000
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1684
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:41,640
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits,
