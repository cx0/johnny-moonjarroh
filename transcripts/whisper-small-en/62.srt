00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,880
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,720
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce,

45
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,080
please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,640
is Dr. Keith Flaherty. Keith is a physician scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in

47
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,280
Boston, where he's the director of clinical research as well as targeted therapies. His

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,360
research focuses on the understanding of targeted therapies in cancer. And if that term

49
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,680
is a bit nebulous to you, don't worry about it. We define it quite clearly. And he focuses on the

50
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,720
development of responses and predictive biomarkers to define the mechanisms of action and resistance

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,480
of novel therapies. He's researched a lot of stuff in immunotherapy. So this is really the

52
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,440
first podcast that I discuss immunotherapy in, which for me is super exciting because I've been

53
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,560
looking forward to discussing this topic for quite some time. And you'll see why when we get into it,

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,960
because immunobased therapies are basically the most exciting recent development in cancer therapy.

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,200
And we talk quite a bit about these checkpoint inhibitors for which actually the Nobel prize

56
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,720
in medicine and physiology was awarded last year. He's been a PI and a two numerous account

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,800
first in human clinical trials using novel therapies. What else can I say? He's a professor

58
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,720
of medicine at Harvard Medical School and serves as editor in chief of the journal

59
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,200
clinical cancer research. Overall, Keith has really a wealth of knowledge in cancer. We talk

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,440
about a bunch of stuff now. Honestly, the first 20 minutes, we're just talking general life medicine.

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,960
We don't even touch on cancer. So if you're short on time and you really just want to get into the

62
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,080
stuff on cancer, definitely jump ahead to 20 minutes into this stuff. We talk quite a bit about

63
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,600
the history of chemotherapy, what its successes were, why they asymptoted, same with radiation

64
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,680
therapy, surgical therapy, and ultimately what took place and what didn't take place,

65
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,120
more to the point, in the period of time between when the war on cancer was declared in 1974 and

66
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,440
the sequencing of the entire human genome about 25 years later. And then we talk about what took

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,160
place in the two decades since that time. And you'll see that, well, at least even for me,

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,240
I think you'll tell, I was actually learning quite a lot here vis-a-vis how some of those

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,320
changes took place. And again, for that reason, this was a highly enjoyable experience, even if

70
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,480
not one person listens to this podcast. I got a ton out of it. We basically got into this notion of

71
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,960
what's a different approach to cancer. And again, clinically, I found this very helpful because this

72
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,680
is a problem I think a lot about. So I do think people will enjoy this. We talk a little bit about

73
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:40,200
liquid biopsies, even touch on roles of potentially crisper and over-hyped with respect to cancer

74
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,920
therapies potentially, even at the end, talk about stem cell therapy, vitamin D, melanoma, sun exposure.

75
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,640
The list goes on. This is a pretty long episode. So hopefully we talk slow enough that you can

76
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,240
listen to it at a slightly higher speed. And the show notes, as always, will contain a ton of

77
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,880
information, not just links to the studies we talk about, but a lot of the semantics. I wouldn't be

78
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,760
discouraged if you find this topic and particularly this episode to be somewhat challenging based on

79
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,560
how technical it gets at times. I think we both do a pretty good job of remembering that we're not

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,640
just talking with each other. And I try to ask questions to bring us back 30,000 feet and focus

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,520
on the big stuff. But in many ways, I think this will be probably the deepest podcast I've done to

82
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,320
date on cancer, though certainly not the last. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation

83
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:38,040
with Dr. Keith Flaherty. Keith, thank you so much for letting me intrude in the middle of your

84
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,240
living room on a rainy Monday afternoon. My pleasure, Peter. Is this normal Boston, April

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,840
weather? This is the wet season, mud season as they call it, but it's a welcome break from winter.

86
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,280
Hasn't been particularly harsh one, but yeah, it's a good transition time. It was brown last

87
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,720
week, so everything's just finally waking up. Now, you've pretty much spent your whole life

88
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,200
from basically Connecticut to, or actually Connecticut, South of Boston, right? So

89
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,200
sort of basically Boston to Baltimore. This has been most of your life. That's right. Born and

90
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,560
raised in Baltimore, broke away to boarding school in Massachusetts for four years, Connecticut for

91
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,520
college, four years, then back to Baltimore, four years in medical school, Boston for the first time,

92
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,600
three years of residency, and then Philadelphia for nine years, which was both medical oncology

93
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,600
fellowship and my first faculty stint. And now 10 years ago, I moved back up to Boston to Mass

94
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,560
General. So this fall will be 10 years, but as you say, Northeast quarter through and through.

95
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,200
Yeah. Well, you get your seasons, right? Yeah. That's always my defense of the Northeast to

96
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,080
Californians is I need the seasons and certainly during my educational years, I always thought if

97
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,440
I had San Francisco, LA, or God forbid San Diego weather, I'm not sure I really would have been

98
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,280
able to keep my nose of the grindstone. The seasons are good to kind of force you inside and take your

99
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,560
breaks when you need them. Well, I think there's something else about it that I sort of lament,

100
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,240
both my wife grew up in Baltimore, I grew up in Toronto, and there is an intestinal fortitude

101
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,600
that comes from being in a climate that is not particularly hospitable. Yeah. You get a little

102
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,920
tougher as a kid, I think when it's, you have to pay attention. Like if you forget your gloves,

103
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,000
like your hose. Yeah, you're going to pay for it. Yeah. I suppose that's true. I think resilience

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,120
comes from a few parts of one's upbringing, but climate is probably your right. It's at least a

105
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,920
bias of mine that it's a good thing to have. Even as the years keep passing and I think about, well,

106
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,880
where would I want to spend the next 10 years, 20 years beyond? I love it up here. I mean, for me,

107
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,240
it's really the, it gets just brutal enough in the winter, but not Canadian brutal. Although Boston

108
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,040
is its own little, Boston and Toronto are not that different. Oh, okay. Yeah. Montreal might be

109
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,000
worse. Yeah. I just have more figuring latitude drives harshness of winter. I have more respect

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,840
for Canadian winters, but maybe it isn't that different. I feel like, again, just gets harsh

111
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,160
enough and then in the summertime get the payoff for the flip side, which is just so pleasant,

112
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,640
but not like Baltimore burdensome in terms of the heat and humidity. So you're kind of one of these

113
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,880
guys who was exposed to medicine throughout, right? But I know your father was a physician,

114
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,400
your mother was as well, right? Yeah, that's right. My father was an academic cardiologist

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,720
for 25 years and then almost an equal student in industry, pharma and biotech. And my mom was an

116
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,120
academic psychiatrist, actually really still is at the age of now 70, will be 76 end of this month,

117
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,880
very different career in psychiatry versus cardiology, but an academic career nonetheless.

118
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,440
So a bit of research, a lot of teaching, mentoring, and that bit continues. She has

119
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,000
incredible stamina for staying connected with her field. She's retired from patient care a good

120
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,760
long time ago, but couldn't give up the rest. And so continues to haul herself off to conferences

121
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,760
and oral examinations that are still required for psychiatric boarding and so on. So kind of an

122
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,080
inspiration in terms of longevity in the field. You knew pretty early that you wanted to go into

123
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,240
medicine or was that not even clear when you went off to college? Yeah, no, it wasn't clear to me

124
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,440
at all. I mean, I honestly would have to admit that I didn't really understand how my parents

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,440
world's turned. They were perfectly transparent and happy to talk about their careers. I just

126
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,880
didn't know to ask the questions. And two older brothers who then and now had no interest in

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,840
science or medicine. I guess all that I could say from a young age, maybe by the time I was in

128
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,160
boarding school, and going to college was that some way, somehow I wanted to help people. This

129
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,000
is a phrase I recall saying, but I had no idea what that might mean and what the different versions

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,680
of it were. As years passed, I got more and more of the sense that a lot of how the world turned

131
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,600
was kind of transactional business transactions, I suppose, people making careers on some version

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,640
of transaction. I had this aversion, I've been developing this aversion to that idea that didn't

133
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,920
want to be involved in what I broadly construed to be business. Now, we'll come back to this later.

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,840
I was about to say the irony, but okay.

135
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,640
Absolutely. I'm laying that right out there for you. There's so many ways in which I turned on

136
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,600
that. I mean, in a good way, I've turned on those initial principles. But yeah, in any case,

137
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,640
I thought this idea that I needed to find a path where I felt like I was very directly helping

138
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,120
people was going to be the most satisfying career and something that would get me out of bed in the

139
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,000
morning without having to really try. That part, I'd say really did work out. So I think that's

140
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,840
probably the one piece that I think I did get from my parents. So I didn't know exactly what

141
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,960
they did when they got to the hospital. But you had some sense that it involved people and they

142
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,040
were in a probably a more direct way of helping. I mean, you can argue most people are helping

143
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,680
people in some way, but you knew that there was fewer degrees of separation. That's right. And

144
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,720
then that final point that they were super motivated by their careers was never a complaint.

145
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,600
There was one thing about their marriage they would talk about just inside baseball of division,

146
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,720
department, hospital level, politics and issues that were kind of headwind for them. And you hear

147
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,600
them talk about their really mechanistic elements of their careers. And it just was never a complaint

148
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,120
about it. They were very kind of focused on results and group dynamic and so on. But I guess

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,320
my point is that you never had a notion that they did not love what they did. And end of every

150
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,040
vacation, end of every weekend, I mean, they were just like hard charging back at work. My parents,

151
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,360
because they were both building academic careers when we were young, they were oftentimes

152
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,880
alternating evening duty, one of them even for a whole week at a time, tied up either on service

153
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,240
or something that was keeping them in the hospital. So watching that conviction and how much they just

154
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,880
loved doing that thing that I didn't understand, that was probably the very nebulous notion that

155
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,200
I kept with me. So that as I kept kind of crossing off like vast segments of American economy had

156
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,200
to offer in terms of careers, medicine's kind of the thing that remained. Yeah. That's an interesting

157
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,760
point you raise about the fine line for parents in terms of the example setting versus the time

158
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,120
there. I mean, both are really important, right? I mean, I know this now, I have kids, met your

159
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,600
daughter earlier. There's in some ways, no substitute for this term quality time sort of

160
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,360
always struck me as a little bit of a hoity-toity term. I mean, there's time and there's no time,

161
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,360
right? But call it quality time. And there's no substitute for that. But there's something to be

162
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,120
said when a child sees their mom or dad feeling incredibly passionate about what they're doing

163
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,840
and how without saying a word about that, it sets an exam. Yeah. I hear my daughters talk about this

164
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,040
in relation to my wife. She's an internist at Mass General and she's part-time, but because of

165
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,240
Epic, the electronic medical record, she's full-time and then some because for every minute she takes

166
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,080
care of a patient directly, she's taking care of their medical record for three to five minutes

167
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,320
easily. That sounds like an excellent ratio. Yeah. And of course the kids see that side,

168
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,080
right? Because they're not with her in the hospital, but they see the constant overflow.

169
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,480
They know what she does in principle and internists, I guess, maps to a pediatrician. They have direct

170
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,800
experience with that, but they watch her pour herself into the indirect care of patients through

171
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,120
the electronic medical record and constantly reflect that she's the hardest working person they know.

172
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,680
And that example, like that kind of willingness to give, give, give outside of one's personal

173
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,920
time, family time, it's related to what I was trying to put words to, but this very nebulous

174
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,200
notion of what it is that qualified as a satisfying career. I've spent my adult life,

175
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,920
particularly raising kids, making this comment that in my imagination, a number that I often

176
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,320
comes back to is like 95% of people don't like what they do and they're just holding their breath,

177
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,120
trying to get to the weekend or vacations. And maybe I'm vastly off base, but I guess I'm

178
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,920
partly using a high number like that because I just feel incredibly fortunate to have been

179
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,800
brought up in a household and educational environment serially that my parents made

180
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,920
available to me that allowed me to be in that, what I think is a relatively small group where

181
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,720
I just always loved what I did and just, and felt like I had absolute choice and, and could engineer

182
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:07,320
my schedule in every respect in a totally sort of suicidal, not respectful of balanced way. I mean,

183
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,600
I just developed a career that was ridiculously off the rails in terms of being overcommitted

184
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,440
and trying to juggle way too many things in some respects. For me, I defended also and say it was

185
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,320
exactly the optimal amount of chaos that one needs to really feel like you're kind of pushing on all

186
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,400
fronts simultaneously, but how do you both find the outlet and define the scope of a career that

187
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,880
allows you to do that? Man, what a challenge and what a different challenge I think that our children

188
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,920
will have versus what it was like to try to build a career in this case in medicine starting decades

189
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,520
ago versus what they're looking at. And medicine still may be one of the slightly easier places to

190
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,080
do it because the path to quote unquote academic success, non-academic clinical success, it's still

191
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,040
relatively unperturbed from so many other paths outside of medicine or is that not even true?

192
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,960
I don't see it that way, but I'd be interested in your perspective as a surgeon because I think

193
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,040
maybe we have a different angle on that being in medicine versus surgery, which obviously

194
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,360
culturally we've always had some real differences, not just culturally, still don't show skill sets.

195
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,560
So the thing that I've been deliberating on, let's say this, I've had a 20 year oncology

196
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,280
career almost 20 years, a few months away from that. And so I divide my career up into these two

197
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,400
decades and I've watched technology advance and the field wide body of knowledge accelerate in a

198
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,480
2000 to 2010 interval and then these past 10 years. And this is true in so many areas of technology

199
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,160
advance, but in biomedical research and in cancer, which is my only area of any expertise,

200
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,280
I thought 2000, 2010 was mind blowing and I thought we were going to spend time catching up

201
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,600
with the mind blowing advances. That was my talking point coming into the field in 2000

202
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,640
that I thought we've got this huge wave of molecular insights, mostly genetic insights

203
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,720
in terms of cancer that had built up, but hadn't been transformed into medicine. That was my

204
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,720
unbelievably naive, simple minded pitch as I was entering the field. And I said, I want to make

205
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,680
myself useful in that translation of science and medicine. Anyway, 2000, 2010, then you could say

206
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,760
we're the first chapter of translating molecular insights into medicine and oncology. Well, 2010

207
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,720
to 2020 makes that first decade look unbelievably slow and where it was over two years, there was

208
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,640
maybe a monumental event, whereas now it's like six at a time. So that's in terms of crossing

209
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,680
the finish line, but in terms of data generation, ability to produce high dimensional data, analyze

210
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,280
it, try to make sense of it, raise hypotheses, test hypotheses, yet the cycle time is changing a lot.

211
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,640
And the constituents that we now need to interact with are totally different. But the point I'm

212
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,280
coming to, to answer your question is I see medicine now as this terrifying arena in which

213
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,720
to try to assemble a multi decade long career. Like how do you keep yourself relevant in a,

214
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,240
let's say 40 year arc, here I am at 20 years and feel like I'm an absolute dinosaur.

215
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,680
Mentoring is the thing that I think I can still do with some relevance to the younger generation.

216
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,000
And in mentoring them, I tell them, look, you need to learn how to talk to a bioinformatician,

217
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,360
computational biologist. I couldn't have even imagined 10 years ago that I'd be telling my

218
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,560
mentees that much less that I would have this notion that I need to understand the world from

219
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,920
that degree of mathematical modeling complexity. But it's having now mentees who were in

220
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,600
computational biology myself. I've come to realize that it's, I didn't have the skill set at the dawn

221
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,400
of my career. Is it possible for people broadly speaking to actually retrain themselves and grow

222
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,520
a new lobe of their brain? It's possible, but it's going to force a totally different paradigm in

223
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,800
terms of how one thinks about taking breaks, taking sabbaticals, gaining that knowledge base.

224
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,240
So I was actually thinking of something different, but what you're bringing up is more interesting.

225
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,960
So I want to double click on that before we jump into the meat of what we're going to talk about.

226
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,880
Based on the way you're describing it, Keith, I would say doctors coming out of training are

227
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,120
hosed because medical school, and I'm going to really make a lot of enemies by saying this,

228
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,880
but I guess it's my podcast. I'm allowed to say this. I think medical school might be one of the

229
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,040
most anti-intellectual forms of higher education that exists. I mean, when you contrast it with

230
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,680
even the experience that many people have in college, where you really get to think creatively,

231
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,480
you really get to problem solve, you really get to explore the limits of what is known and what is

232
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,360
not known and ask questions. Not having gone to law school, but my brother did. I got to see my

233
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,960
brother do that in law school. Having more friends than I can count who did PhDs in everything from

234
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,560
the humanities to the sciences, they got to do that. Well, I went to a good medical school,

235
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,400
but that's not the way my education was, and I'm not sure it's that much more like it today. In

236
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,280
other words, I'm not sure medical school teaches you how to be a thinker or a problem solver,

237
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,480
or even, and maybe, again, I hope I'm wrong, but if you don't learn how to learn,

238
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,400
and God forbid the people who go into medical school as pre-meds, so then they've missed out on

239
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,240
at least taking an engineering degree or taking a humanities degree where you would have got some

240
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,720
of that stuff. So yeah, then I think you're in real trouble. I totally agree with you,

241
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,640
and the word that you didn't use that I'll use is investigation. That's not taught, and at best,

242
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,560
it's taught in a retrospective, field-wide, introspective way, and by that I mean like

243
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,640
diagnostics. I mean, thinking about how to diagnose illness in medical school is beginnings of teaching

244
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,400
that concept. I actually tell people the one type of statistics that physicians get very well trained

245
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,800
in without explicitly being told what they're doing is Bayesian statistic, because that really

246
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,600
is clinical medicine. Clinical medicine is pure Bayesian statistics. It is learning how to update

247
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,120
your pre-test probability with new information over and over again, and the reality of it is that

248
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,440
doctors get very good at that. It's never codified and formalized such that they understand that

249
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,680
that's actually what's being taught. Yeah, although contaminated by bias, as in recency bias, right?

250
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,080
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. So this is a huge issue in the practice of medicine that you're so clouded by

251
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,480
the last few outcomes. Your pre-test probability is not as accurate as it could be if you were able

252
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,560
to eliminate it. Going back to that point that medical school, it teaches information as fact.

253
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,640
It teaches the known. That known-unknown divide is exactly, it's my pitch in academic medicine, at

254
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,400
least talking to people about cancer as a career. I tell them, look, it's so simple to find the

255
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,000
boundary between what's known and not known. There's so much out there we don't know, and

256
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,520
in any area of trying to understand physiology, pathophysiology in the mode of cancer, you will

257
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,680
so quickly get to that frontier. Then how do you operate in that frontier? Once you're there,

258
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,160
how do you help a patient in front of you the next wave of patients that are coming

259
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,080
in the not too distant future and then a full generation out? How do you help

260
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,600
across that gradient? Well, investigation is the only way you can pose yourself as being helpful.

261
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,280
I didn't get that in medical school, sadly, even though I was at a fantastic environment for

262
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,440
learning the archival version of medicine. That's a great way to distinguish, right? I mean,

263
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,080
you go to a place like Hopkins, you're going to get the best archival education imaginable. You're

264
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,840
walking through the halls where the actual profession came to North America. I actually,

265
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,400
it was one of the things I cherished when I was there, and the few books I brought with me

266
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,040
out of medical school surrounding myself with books that are not medicine as a general sport

267
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,120
were the history of medicine. Osler, particularly, I thought was absolutely an Aristotelian figure,

268
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,760
so I thought those are the roots and we have to figure out how to reimagine ourselves like

269
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,600
those great builders of the medical discipline. It was very retrospective, and it wasn't really

270
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,240
honoring the notion that everybody in the field, particularly these big academic centers that are

271
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,800
given tons of resources to investigate, can and should see themselves as being absolutely on the

272
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,240
frontier. It's a more dynamic frontier now than ever before, mostly because the sensing technology

273
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,960
to be able to actually understand what's wrong in the system and when you perturb the system with

274
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,120
the therapy, how the system responds. Cancer is such a great example of this. Our sensing

275
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,360
technologies have just gone berserk in terms of the acceleration, so there's just so much more

276
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,480
that one can learn. But again, this is the concept that only, even in my oncology training, I didn't

277
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,840
get that. Oncology training was the same notion of learning about how we got here over decades. Well,

278
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,440
my talking point going on oncology was that I was right at this end of the conventional chemotherapy

279
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,800
era, as I was calling it, and the beginning of the so-called molecularly targeted therapy era,

280
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,160
but it hadn't happened yet. I wasn't interested in learning about the past.

281
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,720
In other words, you could see that the futility of chemo, which basically had made minimal progress

282
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,960
over 40 years. It would reach an asymptote. If you blindly develop drugs against cancer cells

283
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,400
to find out what's poisonous to them, and then you filter those in mice to see what kills the mice

284
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,440
at equal concentrations versus what doesn't quite kill them, and you call that your possible

285
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,360
therapeutic, what will you get out of that? This is one of my first lectures that I used to give

286
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,240
to medical students about cancer therapeutics as I was trying to outline a path forward,

287
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,440
is that basically what you get out of that is all these agents that tangled the DNA,

288
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,040
and some microtubules stabilizing and destabilizing drugs. And the blind approach only gave those

289
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,320
types of therapies. Those types of therapies then thrown at cancer, cure a good fraction of

290
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,200
tissue cancer, a respectable fraction of lymphomas and leukemias, and cure almost nothing else.

291
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,280
Let's pause there for a moment because we're going to just dive right into cancer, but in the spirit

292
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,840
of being true to the history, let's just reproduce what you said. So let's take a step back.

293
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,880
Many people listening to this certainly hear the terms chemotherapy, radiation therapy.

294
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,120
It might be a bit of a fog beyond that. So what you just described was chemotherapy,

295
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,640
and what you just described was an arbitrage that must be true. Chemotherapy, it's not hard

296
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,000
to kill a cancer cell. It's actually very easy to kill a cancer cell. Yeah, bleach does a fair

297
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,160
thing. Yeah, bleach, formaldehyde, go to Home Depot, most things on the shelf kill cancer

298
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,880
perfectly. Problem is they kill everything perfectly. So the arbitrage you described

299
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,560
eloquently is it has to kill cancer and almost kill, but not kill, not cancer. So that's a narrow

300
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,680
subset of things. And as you described it, they're targeting DNA for the most part,

301
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,880
which is why they're targeting things that grow, which is why when most people think of a patient

302
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,800
on chemotherapy, the first thing they think about is their hair has fallen out. They've got sores

303
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,200
in their mouth, their nails are brittle. And if you look a little deeper, you'll understand that

304
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,280
their gut is really falling apart. What's common to all those things, right? And their bone marrow

305
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,840
cells. Yeah. Rapidly divided bone marrow cells. That's exactly right. So the analogy I oftentimes

306
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,360
with patients about talking about chemotherapy is it's a bicycle going down the road slowly,

307
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,840
one bike going very quickly, one going very slowly. So the cyclist in this case being the

308
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,160
determinant of that. And you're standing between two cars with your broomstick. And you come out to

309
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,680
throw your broomstick in the front wheel of those two bicycles. One of them goes ass over tea kettle.

310
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,280
And the other one looks at you and says, what are you trying to do here, punk? And it's that fast

311
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:03,000
growing cell concept. It's that filtering system of what can kill a fast growing cell. That's what

312
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,200
generated those hits. We could have come up with other hits potentially. It's a chemical diversity

313
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,880
of probes that were used were broader. Maybe other hits could have been found. For example,

314
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,720
we didn't really look at metabolic distinction between them beyond DNA. That Warburg stuff left

315
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,400
behind. We'll come back to it later, but you're right. How to manipulate it particularly was the

316
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,040
completely lacking this concept of you take cancer cells, you establish this mind blowing

317
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,600
ability to grow them outside of a patient and create so called immortalized cancer cell lines.

318
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,800
Henrietta lacks cervical cancer being paradigm example out of Hopkins, but eventually, dozens,

319
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,200
hundreds, now thousands and hundreds of thousands of these cell lines, which ones taken plastic

320
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,080
versus which ones don't? Well, there's definitely a fast versus slow. So growing just by cancer type.

321
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,960
And then within the cancer cell population, which is always heterogeneous, you've got faster and

322
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,040
slower growing varieties there too. And the ones that take are these hot rod cells. And if you then

323
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,960
use that as your filtering mechanism to ask, but what will kill them, what you come up with are

324
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,240
these toxins to rapidly dividing cells. That's exactly right. So that caps the term chemo. When

325
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,080
I use it is always to describe these things. Now, important piece of nomenclature is that people

326
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,200
will still always say that why cancer therapeutic is a chemotherapy. Right. But now I favor the way

327
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,560
you think about it. I like to think of chemo as that type of chemical immunotherapy is use

328
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,640
chemicals, but they're totally different, right? Metabolic therapies, PI 3k inhibitor. I'm not

329
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,600
really considering that chemo, but I want to put a point on what you said because it's sad, but it's

330
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,920
just the reality of it. So when Nixon declares a war on cancer, it's what? It's about 72? 74.

331
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:44,280
Okay. If you look at 10 year survival for metastatic solid organ tumor, so I'm going

332
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,720
to just take out leukemia and lymphoma. And as you pointed out, we have seen success in some of

333
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:58,040
those and we'll come back to it from a solid organ metastatic perspective from 74 until 10 years ago.

334
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,400
Isn't testicular the only success maybe and just, yeah, yeah. Just was an early targeted therapy

335
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,560
success. So testicular basically seminobus testicular tumor. That's right. You could cure

336
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,600
with doublet chemotherapy. You could cure the large majority greater than 90% even. But if a woman had

337
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,320
metastatic breast cancer in 1974 and a woman had metastatic breast cancer 40 years later,

338
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,560
shockingly little difference. I mean, we had median survival extensions of maybe six months,

339
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,040
12 months per new therapy that might come along at best. And then you could stack a few of those in

340
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,000
a disease like breast cancer. So what actually kills the population of cancer, breast colon,

341
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,720
prostate, and lung, and then pick up some other notables that are still refractory to this day,

342
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,440
like pancreatic cancer and so on in terms of number of deaths, but the common cancers, they are

343
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,760
perturbed at best a little bit by these agents. So some subpopulation of those cells will slow

344
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,640
down and die with conventional chemotherapy, but many of them are pre-wired. They were hardy to

345
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,600
begin with. They got there through a hard earned evolution under selective pressure of the immune

346
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,160
system and adverse metabolic environment. And they used all the tricks up the sleeve of a cell,

347
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,440
of a normal cell to reprogram themselves to be able to survive in these harsh environments.

348
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,200
You throw in another harsh environment reagent in the form of chemo. And not surprisingly that

349
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,240
these things were already basically hardwired to be able to survive yet another insult,

350
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,840
but that's chemo. That's an interesting way you explain that. I think that that's important. I

351
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,400
think for a listener to understand is a cancer cell has to overcome a heck of a lot to get to

352
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,640
be clinically relevant. So how many used to remember all the numbers and the growth rates,

353
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,040
but a clinically relevant mass has how many billion cells in it approximately? Yeah, clinically

354
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,800
relevant that you can find something that you could see like a one by one by one centimeter

355
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:45,400
cancer. You're in a billion cells. So just to get a billion rogue actors, you have to evade T cells.

356
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,000
You have to grow your own vascular supply. You have to overcome, as you said, adverse metabolic

357
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,640
conditions. These things are evolutionary warriors by this point. Yeah. I mean, I usually start,

358
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,960
you're absolutely right. These are the filters. Yeah, no, no, but I start with the analogy.

359
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,080
There's a random spinning of the combination lock where mutations are being acquired over

360
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,400
time through a variety of insults or not even necessarily insults, just bad replication

361
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,520
technology, if you will, where the detection of errors and the correction of errors is not

362
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,920
perfect. Anyway, we accumulate mutations over time, some of which we could limit and control,

363
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,000
some of which we can't. Combination lock is just spinning, spinning. The combination has to be

364
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,080
dialed in the right sequence, just like when you're opening your gym locker, or you don't get cancer,

365
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,640
you've got to get your tumor suppressor early and in the right order before your activated

366
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,240
oncogene comes along. We randomly spinning the lock. You're picking up lots of pass-through

367
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,360
mutations, not just true drivers. So these incidental mutations that happen here and there.

368
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,560
So as that's happening, you finally click important components of the program. But along

369
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,000
the way, some of those are actually mutations that are seen as far in by the immune system.

370
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,680
And if they're too visible, if they're too far out there, then they're gone. So it has to be

371
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,480
the right kind of genetic alteration that will give the cell what it needs to be able to proliferate

372
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,360
abnormally, to be able to sustain a lot of DNA damage as it accumulates and not commit suicide

373
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,000
as a consequence, and be able to handle all the other adverse features and filters of the tumor

374
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,840
microenvironment that you enumerated. It has to be able to do all that, but it has to be below the

375
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,640
radar, as in not detectable is overly far into the immune system. That's a powerful insight that we

376
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,600
only really picked up in the field within the past five years. This notion that this is not just a

377
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,920
cancer cell co-opting its normal cells in the microenvironment in some kind of cocooned way.

378
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,840
There are a few cancers that do develop in so-called sanctuary sites that aren't

379
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,000
subject to immune surveillance, but the vast majority are. So that is a lot to have to overcome.

380
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,520
So there's a chance element on the combination lock spinning, but then there's these, you have

381
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,880
to survive the selective pressures that are being applied, both within the cell and outside the cell.

382
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,120
The relevance of that thought process is highly relevant to how we think about developing therapies

383
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,120
right now, but it's also highly relevant to understanding this asymptotic limit of chemotherapy,

384
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,960
like how it is that you try to poison this DNA replication process and like just sort of shred

385
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,000
the DNA a bit more, radiation the same concept. Yeah, I mean radiation even more limited in that

386
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,280
it's not systemic. Yeah. So basically radiation became a great tool to locally control cancer,

387
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,520
but now you've basically reached an asymptote at the two of the three pillars, and you could argue

388
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,200
the third pillar being surgery also asymptotes at your alma mater. I mean, basically when you look

389
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,560
at one of the most complicated surgical procedures for cancer, which is removing the head of the

390
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,880
pancreas, that was an operation that used to carry a 50% 30-day mortality, meaning the surgery was,

391
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,360
you had a 50% chance of living through the surgery in the post-operative course. Today, that's 0.1%

392
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,240
mortality at 30 days, but long-term survival is still abysmal. So cutting tumors out matters a lot,

393
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,960
especially for colon cancer, I would say is the poster child for where cutting cancer out

394
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,040
really makes the biggest difference in it. Even in metastatic disease. Yeah, yeah, it's a huge

395
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,600
benefit. Other cancers, frankly, I'm still not even convinced not to say we shouldn't be cutting them

396
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,160
out. We absolutely should, but it's not clear to me, for example, when you talk about breast cancer,

397
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,960
if the dye is cast long before the mastectomy is done and that local control, I don't know anymore.

398
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,440
Yeah, we're learning so much more again as our sensing technologies continue to elaborate,

399
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,800
because this issue of how many patients already have metastatic disease at the time of their

400
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,560
initial surgery. And you take 10 women who all have one by one by one centimeter breast lesions

401
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,880
that are all going to be, let's assume, make them all the same stage. Some of them are going to make

402
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,920
it, some of them are not, and it's not clear to me how much of that we could have or

403
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,560
one day might know at the time of surgery and alter our course. Not all hope is lost. I mean,

404
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,240
remember the cure rate from all cancers, solid tumors that are amenable to surgery,

405
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,480
is in my career has never been less than 40%. And it's probably more like 50%.

406
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,760
As we develop more diagnostic technology allows us to understand that there's circulating cells

407
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,080
in the blood. Those have a hard time surviving, right? People think about circulating cancer cell

408
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,400
and assume that it's going to succeed. No, no, it's super hard to launch a cancer cell into the

409
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,040
bloodstream and actually have it find soil, get out of the bloodstream and find fertile soil.

410
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,800
That's a whole different problem. Lung cells aren't supposed to live in the liver. It's not

411
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,160
a happy environment for them. The growth factors there aren't. They're native ones,

412
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,400
super, super challenging bit of biology to overcome. But anyway, the point being that

413
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,360
there are a large number of patients who have curative outcomes from surgery who had

414
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,760
seeding of distant organs, even successful microscopic deposits, at least in animal model

415
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,480
data, you'd say that that can happen. And yet they still outlive the diagnosis, which is to say that

416
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,080
at least it lived decades thereafter and never have a metastatic occurrence.

417
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,560
You alluded to this earlier. What do you think it is about removing the mothership

418
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,240
that harms the satellite ships?

419
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,640
Well, I think they are fragile, the micro metastases. I don't know how much they're

420
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,640
being fed. That's not so much say we have the evidence to support that, but they have a

421
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,400
significant task ahead of them to really take and survive in this so-called dormant state,

422
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,120
and then ultimately awake out of that dormant state. So what I'm getting at is the idea that

423
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,600
there's a larger fraction than we would have thought decades ago when surgery was curing

424
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,960
patients, but we just assumed that they got it early before it had ever traveled. More and more

425
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,680
evidence suggests, no, you didn't get it that early, but you got it early enough because those

426
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,120
micro mets that were established, micro metastases, they didn't have all that it takes. And another

427
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,240
wave, more evolution was going to be needed in the primary tumor to be able to launch now

428
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,360
micro metastases that had all the skills to be able to both set up shop in the first place,

429
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,080
live in a dormant state for not just months, but years and even decades in some cases,

430
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,200
and then make their way out again. So there's those additional challenges that cancer cells have to

431
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,120
overcome or tricks that they have to pick up that clearly just become incrementally more likely the

432
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,720
more time and evolution gets to happen in the primary tumor. So I think you just stop the clock

433
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,000
in terms of that evolution when you come along and either patient and their bodies tell them that

434
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,480
they have a tumor or it's an only found or whatever the diagnostic trick is. So that's

435
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,240
the great hope in an area of cancer research that I watch very avidly, but being a therapeutics

436
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:18,280
oriented researcher and that's where my mind always goes. So let's take Staga where the world was 25

437
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,080
years after the war on cancer was declared. It's the late 90s. The scientific community is on the

438
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:31,400
cusp of fully sequencing the human genome. At this point we know a number of things, right? I

439
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,840
mean that's when I was in medical school. We certainly understood that cancers are initiated

440
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:43,000
by genetic mutations and everything you've alluded to with respect to genes that suppress tumors and

441
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,800
genes that promote tumors, the relationship there is pretty well understood. If you refresh my memory,

442
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,440
I also think people understood that virtually all those mutations were somatic. Did anybody have a

443
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,320
hope that the human genome project was going to give us a whole bunch of germline mutations that

444
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,720
cause cancer? No, I don't think we believe that, right? No, that's right. You're right. The spinning

445
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,240
of the combination lock concept, the right sequence, Burt Vogelstein innovation in colorectal cancer

446
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,480
initially, that was in hand by the late 90s, that basic concept. Now, what was left to be

447
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,040
sorted through and a justification for doing whole genome sequencing in cancer

448
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,440
was that we didn't know what that sequence might look like across cancer. We didn't know what the

449
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,000
spectrum of genetically simple to genetically complex cancers was. I mean that at the individual

450
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,200
cell level, not talking necessarily about across all cancer types. What I'm getting at is, do you

451
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,440
need three mutations to get a cancer? Is eight somehow better a number? By that I guess, I mean,

452
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,280
just look at a distribution of quote unquote true drivers. Wait, because I sort of know the answer

453
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,360
today, but I never actually thought about this then. In 1999, did we know if the average breast

454
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,280
cancer had three versus 30 versus 300 mutations? No. Most importantly, how many?

455
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,960
How many were drivers? True drivers. I mean, I'd say true drivers because that term

456
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,240
drivers thrown around a bit and true drivers. What are the essential building blocks? We'll

457
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,520
come back to what essential ultimately means because I think that has to do with therapeutic

458
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,720
vulnerability. But any case, yeah, this idea of how many hits did you really need? Remember that

459
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Knudsen described this, the two hit hypothesis, right? And it seems reasonably clear that in very

460
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,080
simple tumors, two hits actually might be enough. Now probably then, I think it fair to hypothesize.

461
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Explain for the listener what two hits means in that situation because that's a great teaching

462
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,000
example. Yeah, so two hits, I mean, as it was initially construed really was the combination

463
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,960
of the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene, tumor suppressor gene being by definition,

464
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,960
a gene when its function is disabled, cancer becomes more likely. Nearly all of the genetically

465
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:51,240
inherited cancer types that people are familiar with come from having a inherited alteration that

466
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,360
partially or completely disables a tumor suppressor gene. We know very few of the opposite, which is

467
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,800
the activation of another gene. Oncogene could just mean cancer gene, but in the field, most people

468
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,480
think of oncogene as the thing that gets activated, that tumor suppressor gene is the thing that gets

469
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,480
inactivated. That's the simplistic version of the two of the policies. So you're born with two copies

470
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,880
of each gene and one of them is not working of a tumor suppressor gene and later on in life,

471
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,880
just from a stochastic process, you only have to hit it once, not twice, which is far less likely.

472
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,960
And that's why these are patients that are getting cancer in childhood and adolescence. And multiple

473
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,200
of them over time, new unrelated cancers, sometimes in the same organ. I mean, a patient with- Yeah,

474
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,320
multiple colon cancers. Exactly. They keep starting new cancers over and over again. Now,

475
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,560
even in the most genetically simple cases, I would just quickly assert that we have plenty of

476
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,080
evidence now that suggests that you get these genetic alterations that can dial the combination

477
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,400
lock in the right way. But the simplest genetic defined cancers almost certainly have then a

478
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,040
quote unquote epigenetic as in not hardwired mutation alteration change as well. So it's so

479
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,360
called state change where they occupy a different state of development basically, compared to their

480
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,520
normal cell counterparts. So if we're talking about a pancreas cell, endocrine cell in the

481
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,880
pancreas becoming a cancer, it moves away from its differentiated, fully mature neighbors,

482
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,320
and does so in a way that's important in terms of its cancer biology, makes it more

483
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,640
hardy, makes it be able to survive in cells, makes it be able to adopt programs that it's

484
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,720
not supposed to have like traveling, as in becoming metastatic. More and more evidence

485
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,000
to suggest that yes, a lot of that work is done by mutations, but then the mutations in some cases,

486
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:38,200
actually make the cells more plastic, make them more able to read parts of the genome and use

487
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,320
parts of the genome that that cell type isn't normally supposed to have access to. This is an

488
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,880
insight that I think is only come. Yeah, we didn't know that 20 years ago. I didn't know in the late

489
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,080
90s. This is my argument in retrospect about what it is that the cancer genome Atlas really uncovered

490
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,640
for us. A criticism is that we just relearned a lot of the same things we already knew. We already

491
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,840
knew that RAS mutations occurred in 25% of all cancers, and we knew then and pretty much know

492
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,400
now that we can't drug them directly. So that's an inconvenient reality. The point being that the

493
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,320
catalog of activated oncogenes had actually been largely resolved one by one by one from the mid

494
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,040
80s going up to the late 90s. This was the catalog I was looking at when I was saying,

495
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm going to go into the field and try to figure out how to take this information and turn it into

496
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:32,120
some version of first therapy. I was a student at Hopkins when HIV was absolutely uncountered with

497
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,200
any therapies at all. I did a second sub internship on the service where the HIV patients were cared

498
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,000
for as inpatients usually. That was on the OSILER service, wasn't it? Exactly right. Yeah. AZT was

499
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,160
in humans in clinical trials for the first time. It was talked about actively on that service

500
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,400
because it was definitely a research minded service. So by the time I got finally in through

501
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,120
my medical training into oncology a few more years had passed. So you nadir, I mean the nadir,

502
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,240
meaning the nadir of despair, the peak of hope would have been 96 when heart was introduced,

503
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,600
right? That's right. And that's when you were starting medicine. So I was graduating from

504
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,440
medical school at that time. Yeah, I mean starting your medicine residency, right? As heart was

505
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,240
introduced in 96. And so my talking point was we need to find in cancer as many AZTs as we need,

506
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,800
as the initial foot in the door, we know we're going to see resistance in this much more complex

507
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,240
entity that is a human cell that's gone rogue versus relatively simple virus. But it's when

508
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,000
we poke it with the AZT equivalence, we're going to learn about how it is that it tries to adapt.

509
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,080
And that's going to allow us to develop rational combination therapy exactly the way the HIV field

510
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,600
does. I still say that in 2019. And it still hasn't really happened. I was about to say when

511
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,400
you were saying that a second ago, I was thinking that doesn't sound that naive. Earlier you said,

512
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,080
you had this very naive point of view. It was naive in the sense that with no single example,

513
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:57,480
being able to drug an oncogene, so an activated gene, nearly all of the drugs that people take

514
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,800
are inhibitors of something as opposed to activators. We have some activators in medicine,

515
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,320
but not that many. So if you think about cancer and its genetic assembly, then and now we don't

516
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,960
know how to restore the function of something that's lost, particularly if it's wildly genetically

517
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,640
disabled, to the point of even missing from the DNA of a tumor cell. In some cases, we don't know

518
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,480
how to replace that. This was the hope of gene therapy, the dawn of my career that we might be

519
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,720
able to figure that problem out. We haven't figured it out by a long shot. Inhibiting things

520
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,960
that are activated, that has been where there has been success, A, in all of medicine and B,

521
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,400
in oncology. So could we catalog activated events and target them with drugs successfully and have

522
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,160
these AZT moments? The headwind against that and the reason why people kind of smirked or smiled

523
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,720
at my pitch, this is when I was applying for menac oncology fellowships and saying these very,

524
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,840
I think, truly simple minded concepts was, kid, do you understand how complex cancer is? I mean,

525
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,320
you poke it with a stick. It's not going to care about blocking one thing. I mean,

526
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,960
these things have anordinate number of tricks up their sleeve, like no way. Right. To think that

527
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,720
you're going to poke it once and everything will remain unperturbed except that one thing. And then

528
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,560
the idea that that would actually help a patient and that you could learn from it, both things,

529
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,360
I think we're absolutely not accepted. You remember the first targeted therapy success in cancer.

530
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,160
But the concept, the concept translationally makes sense. I think, I guess what people were

531
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,640
bristling against was the notion that, oh, and by the way, in the next three years,

532
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,200
this is what I'm going to do. Yeah. Right. And doing this in humans as opposed to the laboratory,

533
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,920
wet lab relying on reduced model systems like immortalized cancer cell lines or some other

534
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,680
newfangled approach of a reduced system in the lab, that saying that doing this in humans was

535
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,960
going to be the way to make fastest progress, that job description hadn't been created yet.

536
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,800
So saying that I wanted to do it and I wanted to do it in people, that's what made people for

537
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,440
their brows, which was fine. That really didn't slow me down because I just, I kind of intuited

538
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,640
that at least this is going to be a thing to get out of bed in the morning to do.

539
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,920
So you did your residency at the Brigham and then your med-on quiz at Penn.

540
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,160
Yeah.

541
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,280
Was Carl June there at the time?

542
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,680
He was.

543
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,280
So let's take a detour into immunotherapy for a moment because there's part of me that just

544
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,720
wants to do this temporally because of how much we know today. And I don't want to lose

545
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,880
stuff that we now take for granted, but at the time was so important. So there were a couple of

546
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,600
cancers. Well, let's go even further than that. Based on everything you said a moment ago,

547
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,800
it's pretty clear that we need systemic therapy. We've reached the limits of local therapy.

548
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,440
So surgery and radiation work pretty darn well when they work, but there ain't a lot of ways to

549
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,000
make it better.

550
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,080
Yeah. You can minimize their adverse effects.

551
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,160
Exactly right. You can make them less harmful, but they're about as efficacious as they can be.

552
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:49,240
We take our first type of systemic treatment, which is chemical chemotherapy. And as we basically saw

553
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:55,320
from 25 years of 74 to 99, we basically cured one additional cancer. Somewhere along the way,

554
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,280
there's another idea for a systemic type of therapy. And you alluded to it earlier, which is,

555
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,440
look, I mean, you didn't say it explicitly, but I'm just going to put words in your mouth. Once

556
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,400
the mutations happen to cancer, they cease to be purely self. They start to display a little bit

557
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,360
of non-self characteristic. And we have this branch of the immune system that is, I mean,

558
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,280
staggeringly effective at eradicating non-self things, namely viruses. So we don't have to go

559
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,880
back to Cooley's toxins, but basically if you just go into the nineties, you've got guys like

560
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,040
Allison, who are working on things called checkpoint inhibitors, which we're going to come back to.

561
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,400
You've got Steve Rosenberg at the NIH, who's having limited success in melanoma and renal cell

562
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,880
carcinoma. You've got Carl at Penn and a number of people around the country that are starting to

563
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,520
show little cracks in the armor of cancer. And these results, well, I want to talk about the

564
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:55,240
durability of them, but just for a moment explain what cancers were we seeing this in and what did

565
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,360
we know by the late nineties about immunotherapy? Yeah. So what you just described, one way of

566
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,680
rephrasing it is that you had people recognizing this idea that there's a backup a step. What had

567
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,840
been recognized pathologically decades before was that there are some tumors that at the time of

568
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,320
surgery are evidently visible to the immune system because you can find a ton of immune cells

569
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,680
infiltrating into them. I mean, I like to go back to melanoma. Many instances is a good entry in

570
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,160
there because melanoma is the cancer type that I have focused on throughout my career, fortuitous

571
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,240
for a couple of reasons, that choice, but in any case, it definitely useful for this discussion.

572
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:37,080
So what's useful about melanoma in this discussion, let me just remind listeners that melanoma harbors

573
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,960
just about the largest number of mutations per cell of a tumor that makes it, if you will,

574
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,240
succeeds in becoming a cancer. It flies as high as possible beneath the radar. That's right.

575
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,840
There's a few other cancers out there, but it's a simple reality that they're picking up so many

576
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,640
mutations, these melanocytes, the precursors to melanoma from ultraviolet radiation, the vast

577
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,840
majority of which we think are useless to the formation of cancer. What's the typical number

578
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:04,280
of mutations in a metastatic melanoma? It's high thousands. So you can have in the tens of thousands,

579
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,040
but high thousands. There's a distribution and a limit to that distribution. Aren't there only

580
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,680
about 20,000 genes? Oh, I mean individual. Oh yeah, you'll find multiple mutations per gene

581
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,440
in a melanoma. So under mutations per megabase and then scale that out to the-

582
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,960
And how many of those do we think are playing a functional role? We don't know.

583
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,480
Five, six is a rough estimate based on real functional evidence now. So you have this huge

584
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,560
onslaught of mutations which are useless to the cancer's purpose, probably adverse on the

585
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,960
purpose of immune recognition. And so it's an outlier, it's not a completely separated,

586
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,120
but it's at the far end of the spectrum in terms of cancers that aren't cleared and eliminated by

587
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:46,440
the immune system and survive with all of this mutational abnormality in them, a lot of non-self.

588
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,840
So that's a cancer that at the time of initial diagnosis, a superficial melanoma on the skin,

589
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,320
you will find not in all cases, but in the vast majority, a robust amount of immune recognition,

590
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,640
infiltrating immune cells and T cells that are the variety that can clear a virally infected cell

591
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,120
and can kill a cancer cell when they see that the internal contents being presented on the cell

592
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,440
surface by the so-called MHC complex have enough difference from self. Then that's the cell

593
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,600
population that you will witness in those tumors. And it had been described in the sixties that a

594
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,960
melanoma, notably other cancers by the eighties, you looked at a spectrum of melanomas, those that

595
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,600
had the most robust immune cell infiltrate were going to be least likely to be life threatening

596
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,400
to the patient after adjusting for other factors. In other words, was the experiment ever done when

597
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,680
you took a hundred patients who had a local resection, normalized them for depth. So they're

598
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:46,360
all Breslow five and you add up the till tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and you get a prediction

599
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,760
of who's going to be alive in 10 years. That's right. Powerful, very powerful, that prediction.

600
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,480
And then that was just replicated across the rest of cancer. That finding colorectal cancer has its

601
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,920
own distribution in that regard. And some that are wildly mutated immunogenics. Has anyone

602
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,480
commercialized this today as a diagnostic at the time of therapy, diagnostic or predictive tool?

603
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,320
To a degree. So immunoscore is a commercial assay that's been developed that is about

604
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,240
more complex version of immune recognition than just these T cells. But we can unpack this more

605
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,800
deeply now cataloging the success, the huge waterfall event in the immunotherapy development

606
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:32,120
era when PD-1, PD-L1 interactions were discovered and then leveraged as a therapeutic. That fraction

607
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,640
of cancer patients who are one drug away from clearing their tumor with a PD-1 antibody,

608
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,040
which is the largest impact we've had with an immunotherapy of any kind by a long shot

609
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,680
in terms of numbers of patients helped. These are those patients. Yes, their cancer succeeded,

610
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,360
but they had the immune system nibbling at their heels at every step of the way. So yes,

611
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,800
they developed a true bonafide cancer. We just had to block this one checkpoint inhibitor.

612
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,120
This one break on the immune system where the foot was being expressed by the tumor cell and

613
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,640
literally reaching across the divide and repelling or making quiescent a T cell that had succeeded

614
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,800
otherwise in making it into the environment. That's a swath of cancer. Now it's interesting

615
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,880
too when you go, like I'm much more familiar with CTLA-4 because that was the work what I was doing

616
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,000
when I was doing my time in the lab, both in medical school and later and residency. It was

617
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,360
interesting the amount of autoimmunity you saw as well, suggesting that boy, when you took the breaks

618
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,680
off the immune system, it didn't just want to kill cancer. It actually wanted to kill a bunch of

619
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,680
things. Yeah. So this reminds people these systems were not created purely to survey for cancer and

620
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,720
eliminate it. So the purpose of dampening effects on the immune system are that you don't just

621
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,200
mount an immune response and have it just take over your body, which is what a CTLA-4 blocking,

622
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,120
well, transgenic experiment will produce is lympho-proliferative overdrive that kills the mouse.

623
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,640
So the idea that these breaks exist for a reason I think is intuitive if you think about the fact

624
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,480
that basically we live in a complex system. We're exposed to pathogens. We were talking about viruses,

625
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,480
but we're being exposed to microbial pathogens that are trying to infiltrate all the time.

626
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,680
You wipe out someone's immune system with chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant and

627
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:12,280
those bacteria that are living in the gut and- Seemingly harmless and symbiosis.

628
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,360
Exactly. They will then infiltrate. They're right at the margin to begin with. They'll infiltrate,

629
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,360
they'll take over. This is a really active border zone that's being policed all the time. You give

630
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:28,200
a CTLA-4 antibody and where does the most life-threatening chaos erupt? It's at the gut. You've

631
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:35,240
unleashed this preexisting force that's at work all day, every day in this very immunologically

632
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,280
active environment and it starts attacking normal colonic tissue and can perforate the colon from

633
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,480
which a patient then dies. It's a leading cause of death from that therapy is rare as those events

634
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,400
are, but it's a very powerful sign of how this sort of gas pedal and brake component is at play.

635
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,160
Play back the conversation to talking about chemotherapy and this notion of therapeutic

636
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,120
index. Well, here's the issue with unleashing the immune system systemically with these types

637
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,400
of therapies. Yeah. The early days of this in the 80s when Steve Rosenberg and his colleagues were

638
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:11,560
using mega doses of interleukin-2, you saw that flip side, right? Which was the systemic

639
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,840
inflammatory response syndrome was as life-threatening as the cancer. You were teetering

640
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,480
between the patient dies of what looks like sepsis versus the patient dies of cancer and you have to

641
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,960
thread that needle. Right. Sepsis in a bottle. You start dripping in interleukin-2 and the only

642
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,640
other time a human being sees that cytokine at levels like that is when the immune system says,

643
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,680
screw it, we've got to go all guns. We're going all nuclear. All guns blazing or else the host is

644
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,440
going down here. And there's a 50% chance we're going to kill ourselves in the process, but so

645
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,320
be it. But this is our last shot and with interleukin-2, thank God you can turn it off and within

646
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,640
certainly hours, but even minutes in some cases, like that whole storm settles down. But the

647
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,640
cytokine era, that was the first wave. So coming to your point about how do we get-

648
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, there's a great proof of concept.

649
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Yeah, but narrow therapeutic index as in the asymptote was reached awfully early.

650
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,880
What were the cancers that responded? Melanoma-

651
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,400
RCC and renal. Yeah, melanoma.

652
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,480
Melanoma that has the highest mutation burden that didn't cover kidney cancer. Kidney cancer,

653
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,360
for reasons that we're still trying to unpack, is very immunogenic. It is highly visible in the immune

654
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,800
system. When you diagnose a kidney cancer at the time of surgery, the amount of infiltrating immune

655
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,160
cells, active immune cells, so-called cytolytic T cells that are churning out the enzymes that

656
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,440
will kill their neighboring cancer cells, that actually scores at the top.

657
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,560
I understand why we see it in melanoma. Why in RCC?

658
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,360
Mm-hmm. Not known because it's not mutation burden driven. If you look at mutation burden

659
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,720
in relation to this immune recognition, there's a very strong correlation across all of cancer

660
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,680
with a couple of outliers and RCC is the renal cell carcinoma. It's an outlier on that curve.

661
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah, it's immunogenic without a high mutational burden.

662
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,440
Precisely. How much of this is epigenetic then, as opposed to genetic? That's the piece that

663
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,040
investigators are currently trying to uncover. Admittedly, renal cell carcinoma, because of its

664
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,480
relative rarity, doesn't draw that much attention, whereas so much more of this work is being done

665
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,680
in the more common cancers. But there's a story here across cancer that there's this whole issue

666
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,160
of what determines visibility in immune system versus invisibility. These are successful cancers

667
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,280
have to find cloaking mechanisms. They will not succeed otherwise. One cloaking mechanism is

668
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:21,800
just stop presenting antigens. Don't make MHC complexes that present these mutated antigens.

669
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,280
If you go high enough up the mutation scale. We'll go so far into this that I want people to

670
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:33,240
be comfortable with the lingo. What's MHC class one to, what is antigen presentation? Maybe do

671
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,800
pretend this is a group of first year college kids and you've got a few minutes to explain

672
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,200
how T cells work basically. The major histocompatibility complex, MHC,

673
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,040
is this machinery that exists. These are cell surface proteins, what they become cell surface

674
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,400
proteins. When they're first expressed in the plasma reticulum as all proteins when they're

675
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,120
initially translated into proteins, they have the opportunity to sample internal contents,

676
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,880
protein fragments basically. They're sampling all the time the protein fragment repertoire.

677
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:11,320
MHC class one and class two, and we each have a portfolio of them. We inherit the diversity of

678
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,120
these ultimately from our parents, but we have a massive diversity of them that we're born with.

679
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,760
Class one and class two can hold different size protein fragments. They're fundamental

680
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,040
difference and there's a flexibility or a nimbleness in terms of class two which can hold longer

681
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:32,440
peptides. It can see potentially bigger repertoire than class one. The analogy is your job is making

682
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,360
sure a house is okay because there's a house party. The internal house. Yeah, the internal house is

683
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,240
okay. You're the guy that got hired to help make sure the house party doesn't get out of control.

684
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,840
You're roaming around the house looking to try to figure out, do I need to take any of these guys

685
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,040
outside to show the police? That's right. The immune cells that are not only activated, not only T

686
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:58,520
cells, other immune cells are interviewing normal cells constantly and effectively all organs.

687
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,320
This surveillance process is happening. We think viral pathogens are what created the evolutionary

688
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,200
pressure to evolve this system. Cancer couldn't have been the excuse. If cancer is distributed

689
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:14,040
across ages 40, 60 to 80, it's not relevant because you've reproduced and you've served your

690
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,720
purpose. We benefit from having this system that evolution handed to us from viral selected

691
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,520
pressures. But in any case, the system was tuned for that, for picking up viral pathogens inside

692
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,080
of cells, being able to present them on the cell surface. We'll use an example, sorry, just that

693
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,680
everyone will get. When you get a virus that gives you a sore throat, for example, the pain you're

694
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:41,160
feeling, the soreness of your throat is the actual endothelial cells within your throat that

695
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:46,920
are hurting because a virus has got in there. The virus has hijacked your DNA replication system.

696
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,080
It's doing its nonsense because that's what it does. It wants to survive. It can't make its own

697
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:57,720
DNA. In the process, new proteins are showing up inside a cell and these little antigen presenters

698
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,320
are saying, I don't recognize this. I don't think this belongs in here. I'm going to take it to the

699
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,880
surface and let these guys that come by who are ... We think the interviewing happens even with

700
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,800
normal proteins. Normal proteins will be shown as well as abnormal proteins, not only ... That's

701
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,880
right. Then it's the cop who's coming by who has the ability to go, that one's okay, that one's

702
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,480
okay, that one's okay. Whoa, that one, we actually need to go in the house and rip it up. Exactly

703
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,520
right. It turns out that when MHC complexes are presenting antigen, it turns out that differences

704
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,640
even in a peptide fragment or protein fragment, the position of the abnormality matters. If it's

705
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,720
in the middle, that's able to be seen more efficiently. Some of these principles now have

706
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:37,480
been reasonably well elucidated. It's really nuanced interview technology. It's a ton of normal

707
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,600
self that's being seen and excused. Then there's the chance then that some of the abnormal proteins,

708
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,320
viral pathogens, and then mutated proteins as well can be presented and seen as non-self.

709
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,800
But I do want to just jump quickly to mention a point, which is that, well, if cancer is developing

710
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:59,000
on these mutations and, quote unquote, trying to become a cancer, what might be a trick that you

711
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,800
could use to try to evade the immune system? How about if you disable this machinery? How about if

712
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:09,320
you just don't allow MHC complexes to be made? Right. So a cancer cell is instead of a cell that

713
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,080
gets infected with a virus, although I'm not withstanding that's how some cancers start.

714
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:19,240
If now the cancer cell takes over the entire DNA replication system, the smartest thing to do

715
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,560
is say, of course, I'm going to make proteins that are foreign. I'm just not going to get them

716
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,840
presented on the MHC molecules outside. I'm not going to let anybody outside of me know what's

717
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,960
going on inside. Right. So you might think a virus would have figured this out a long time ago to

718
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,760
suit their purposes. Maybe they would figure out how to wipe out MHC complex presentation. It turns

719
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,560
out natural killer cells don't like that very much. This is very primordial branch of the immune system

720
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,280
that we think about innate immunity, adaptive immunity as being primordial versus more modern,

721
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,360
quote unquote, higher organisms having them. Any case, these natural killer cells, which are part

722
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:58,360
of the more primordial immune surveillance machinery, if they see a cell not showing MHC

723
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:05,320
complexes, that targets that cell for destruction. So it's not okay in a fully civilized ecosystem

724
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:11,080
of all cells playing their role and being willing to be interviewed. It's not okay not to make MHC

725
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,720
complexes. So it's thought to be intolerable, if you will, at least in the face of natural killer

726
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,600
cells to do that. Otherwise, all cancers would like they'd have figured that trick out long ago.

727
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,400
There's this really fascinating story that's emerged in trying to understand the features

728
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,960
of cells that will survive the onslaught of an activated immune system after checkpoint therapy,

729
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,760
PD1 or C3 therapy. Some patients will clear their tumor and they're cured. They're those who don't

730
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,400
clear the tumor and they're not cured and under selective pressure of meaning they undergo a

731
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,000
complete response, but then they relapse or they only undergo a PR and never CR. Yeah.

732
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,080
Amazingly, if you look at the data with the PD1 antibodies, which are, again, that's the thing

733
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:53,560
that's really helped humanity in terms of large numbers, I usually summarize that to say that

734
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:58,280
there's 10% of cancer patients currently are getting a heroic benefit from that therapy.

735
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,800
There's a higher percentage who gets some benefit, like actually double the number,

736
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,680
20%, who do respond. Enough tumor cells are killed by the activated immune system that

737
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,560
the tumors will shrink under that selective pressure of now heightened immunity. Remember,

738
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:17,240
there was already baseline immunity to a degree, variably yes, across all cancer types, but still

739
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:23,800
now this activated immune system has just been raging. Those that survive, what do they do?

740
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:29,080
Well, it turns out they start to dial down their MHC complex expression through genetic

741
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,680
and epigenetic means. Just enough to satisfy the NK cell, but no more. Precisely. Exactly. So,

742
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,000
they find this new homeostatic set point, and this is true in metabolism and other programs

743
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,880
in cancer that they find new set points under selective pressure of the onslaught, in this case,

744
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,840
of activated immune systems, but it could be other oncogene targeted therapy does a similar thing.

745
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,240
Actually, more and more convergence as opposed to divergence has been emerging in the cancer therapy

746
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,920
resistance world, where even melanoma, for example, where we have effective oncogene targeted therapy

747
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,080
and we have effective immunotherapy, there's more and more evidence that actually what survives

748
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:09,720
both is the same phenotype, if you will. Cancer is adopting similar programs to be able to try

749
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,120
to survive the onslaught, even from those two very different modalities. Do you think it's safe to say

750
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:19,400
that the lethality of cancer is directly proportional to that evasion? For example,

751
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,800
why is it that when you take the ratio of people diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma to people

752
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:32,040
who die of it, contrasting that with something like prostate cancer? Now, prostate is a tricky one

753
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,560
because it's sort of immune protected, but maybe we can pick an example that's less.

754
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,840
Glioblastoma is right there with pancreas. Although for a totally different reason,

755
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,280
it doesn't really metastasize. I mean, it's causing most of its local destruction.

756
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,240
And it's in a bad spot. Yeah, it's in a space restricted.

757
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,320
You're right, but it is fair to say though that both pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma

758
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,440
are really not immunogenic on the spectrum. Prostate, as you say, is out also in that end

759
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,280
of the spectrum. So if you just look at this baseline at the time of diagnosis, how much

760
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,000
immune recognition is there? How much does that relate to how long someone lives and how likely

761
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,080
they are actually to respond even to conventional chemotherapy? You can splay cancer out all cancer

762
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:13,960
types and there's heterogeneity within cancer types as well. So not all lung cancers are the same.

763
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,600
And you can come up with some of these that are, as you say, they are aggressive tumors. They're

764
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,960
not being seen adequately. So not being slowed or being nibbled at by an immune system in their

765
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,360
evolution and then at the time that we diagnose them to the time of death, basically almost

766
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,480
nothing happening there either. Do you teleologically have a rationale for it? I mean,

767
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:37,240
we didn't come up with a good explanation on why RCC, renal cell carcinoma would be so immunogenic

768
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:43,160
despite the relative positive mutations. At the other end of that spectrum, what is it about

769
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:52,040
a pancreatic endocrine cell that would allow it or have it be so protected? Yeah. This is a black

770
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:58,360
box at the moment. What you're asking is the fundamental comparative biology question in cancer.

771
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:04,440
That's this decade. Yeah. I leapfrogged us past 2010. We are now wrestling with this opportunity

772
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,800
to do comparative biology, not just experiments, but analyses. I mean, what are the building blocks,

773
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:15,240
genetic, epigenetic, the metabolic features? How did each of these tumors assemble themselves to

774
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:20,520
be able to accomplish the various behaviors of cancer that make them lethal? I would say this

775
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:26,600
is where we have more black boxes in diseases like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma anyway.

776
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,080
Though hormonally driven cancers are a unique entity, right? So prostate cancer is almost all

777
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,880
hormonally driven, at least at its outset. It can evolve away from hormonal drive slash dependence

778
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,840
during its subsequent evolution and then a significant portion of breast cancer, but not

779
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,200
all is hormonally driven. Those cancers need to be considered a little bit separately because

780
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:52,840
they're still using this lineage dependent tissue of origin dependent program of using the

781
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:58,360
feeder, the hormone to help achieve its purpose, if you will, always going back to anthropomorphic

782
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,000
concepts in cancer is just how I've always thought. Cancer and immunology are so geared towards that

783
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,680
way of thinking. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It's immune cells exactly. You readily put yourself

784
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,360
in the driver's seat, if you will, in terms of various immune cell types. Everybody likes to be

785
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:15,240
a CD8 positive T cell, I think, but I'd rather be CT4. He's a helper. A CD4, yeah. I'm more of a

786
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,560
helper cell. Right. Any case, now to answer your question, if we had better insights into this,

787
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:25,320
we would have more hypotheses moving towards therapeutics in these cancer types. But the

788
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:30,680
have and have not spectrum in cancer is only getting wider. The advances that have been made

789
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,680
in certain areas where we very clearly fingerprinted the top of the pyramid vulnerability,

790
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,240
it's not just about mutations. I mean, really is about other cancer programs that are at the

791
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:47,080
forefront of that cancer slash cancer type. The AZT equivalent has been worked out to dismantle

792
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:52,600
that one program. It doesn't cure everybody, but it helps patients directly, perturbs the hell out

793
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:58,600
of that cell. And I still maintain the hope and I guess belief even if I'm allowed to use that word

794
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,160
in a scientific discussion, that secondary vulnerabilities are going to come from being

795
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,760
able to have enough AZT-like primary interventions or points of vulnerability. But you said something

796
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,600
earlier that I want to repeat because you've alluded to it twice, I believe. It's a bit of a

797
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:20,280
scary concept, right? Which is some of these mutations may have no obvious, immediate,

798
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:29,320
targetable quality, but they enable epigenetic change that itself is the problem and much more

799
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,000
difficult to target. Is that a fair assessment? That's right. I dropped that thread from before.

800
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,560
I meant to finish a thought previously that the Cancer Genome Atlas project, like whole genome

801
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:42,920
sequencing of large numbers of cancers, what did it teach us? Well, it retaught us what we already

802
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,800
knew in terms of the common tumor suppressor genes and activated oncogenes. The big discovery

803
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:55,000
was how commonly you will find across cancer driver genetic events. So the causative genetic

804
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,760
of alterations in genes whose protein product regulates chromosomal well-being. So epigenetic

805
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,680
regulators as they're oftentimes thought of. So chromosomes are complicated. They're dynamic in

806
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:13,160
normal cells and they're definitely dynamic in cancer cells. Think of it as a folding and

807
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,560
unfolding of the blueprints. Basically certain cells in the body only need to read one segment

808
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,280
of the blueprint to be able to do their job. Cancers generally speaking like to open up the

809
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,320
blueprints. That's a fair generalization. And you can reflect that even at this, the entire chromosome

810
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:33,720
level, literally chromatin is open and being read more actively. It's the only way that a lung cell

811
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,160
can figure out how to travel like a white blood cell ultimately is you have to open up the

812
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:42,440
blueprint and see that part of it. It's these epigenetic regulators that are being, that now

813
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:47,000
were really discovered by the Cancer Genome Atlas project. So going back now, I guess 10 years ago

814
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,680
is when it really kind of these insights first began about five years ago. That era taught us

815
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:59,240
how widespread these types of genetic alterations were. That was not known before that campaign was

816
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:04,440
launched. So yes, you have these activated events, these tumor suppressor genes that are eliminated.

817
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,320
Many of them have to do with DNA repair mechanisms and talk about other common tumor suppressor genes.

818
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:15,400
But anyway, in the middle are these epigenetic regulators that themselves are activated or

819
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,120
inhibited through genetic alteration. That was just a big aha moment in the field because it

820
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,680
showed how essential, well, a, how cancers do it, that they create this so-called plasticity,

821
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,320
this ability to basically go from being a differentiated lung cell into a less differentiated

822
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,120
lung cell that's not now able to do things that it's normal lung cells.

823
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:36,280
It gives up some of its lung superpowers in exchange for greater pliability.

824
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,520
It's like a reality TV show you couldn't make up.

825
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:47,960
Yeah, it's diabolical, but it's using the whole playbook. I use that blueprint analogy, but

826
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:54,520
it really is, every cell in the body has the entire chromosomal content in it. It just doesn't

827
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:58,680
use it. Like that discussion in neuroscience about how much your brain do you use at any given time.

828
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:04,280
Well, a normal cell isn't using so much of the blueprint to do its job. If it's going to become

829
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:10,280
a cancer, which is a cell doing many jobs all at once, and to the detriment of the host, ultimately,

830
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,640
it really has to open up and maintain this open blueprint, not just wildly open, but very

831
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:21,480
strategically and purposely. That happens, again, relatively recent insight. We are just at the

832
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:26,760
beginning of actually developing tools as in chemical tools to actually alter the function

833
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,520
of these proteins to see what would then what would happen. Can you actually restrict the

834
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:36,680
blueprint reading? Go back to melanoma one more time. Melanocytes derive from the so-called neural

835
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:42,360
crest. The brain tissue and these pigment producing cells, like super weird developmental fact,

836
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,840
come from the same tissue type. So, animal anocytes, as people probably well know,

837
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,720
distribute generally just throughout the sun-exposed skin, although there's a few stragglers here and

838
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,360
there, which can form melanomas. In any case, these guys are sparsely distributed in the skin,

839
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,560
creating a little bit of a shield of sorts, but not a very effective one.

840
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,000
In any case, they derive from the neural crest. That's where they come from.

841
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:09,000
So, what happens when you blast the hell out of a melanoma with BRAF targeted therapy and a PD-1

842
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,720
antibody and you're shrinking tumors down, but not eradicating the cells and things come back out.

843
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,240
What do they start to look like? They look like neural crest cells. So, they take a step back in

844
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:26,280
the evolutionary developmental path and in doing so, find hardiness mechanisms that allow them to

845
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:32,200
survive an activated T-cell repertoire, allow them to have their dominant driver activated oncogene

846
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:38,040
largely disabled and be able to manage, not only survive, but ultimately then begin again

847
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,600
growing and becoming life-threatening. This is a theme across cancers. I mean, this has been seen

848
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,000
now lung cancer and breast cancer and other tumor types where there's been substantial advance in

849
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,360
terms of therapies and real outcomes being achieved for patients. So, these leapfrog moments that have

850
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,480
been happening, common, common principle is this so-called epigenetic state change thing.

851
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,640
And the genetic determinants of it, as I said, are really, it's within this past 10 years that we've

852
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,440
gotten any insights into it. When we talk about targeted therapy, it's a bit of a buzzword now.

853
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:12,760
And I think for someone like you, it's worth maybe clarifying, how do you define targeted therapy?

854
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,320
And what do you think is really our first great example of it?

855
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:22,520
Just to get right through the jargon and be able to keep chemo to one side and targeted therapy

856
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,640
to the other. What I've always said is targeted therapy is simply that we knew what we were doing

857
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:33,480
from the beginning. So, we knew what we wanted. We knew what the specs were.

858
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,920
It's Babe Ruth actually pointing at the wall. Everybody can hit a home run.

859
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,640
Not just closing your eyes.

860
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,480
That's right. But if you can actually point to where the ball's going to go before you hit it.

861
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:48,760
So, it's basically none of the conventional chemotherapy drugs were known to be DNA binding

862
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,760
and designed and engineered to be them. But the target product profile, if you will,

863
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,240
was specced out for everything that we call targeted therapy. Now, some people might take

864
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,880
exception with that, including the first monumental success. So, we actually had

865
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,840
two versions of targeted therapy at work in the 90s, somewhat quietly. Epidermal growth factor

866
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,640
receptor and HER2, which is related in the same family, close knit family actually, of

867
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,600
epidermal growth factor receptors, plural. These two surface growth factor receptors

868
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,040
had been kind of discovered and cataloged in terms of their biologic function in many cancers

869
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,760
in the 80s. And then antibody that could reach the cell surface component of these receptors

870
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,720
were engineered and were being investigated in clinical trials.

871
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,600
They weren't causing heroic effects, as had been hoped, but those were definitely targeted

872
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,400
therapies. They did end up moving the needle and largely in combination with conventional

873
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,640
chemotherapy, notably in the case of HER2 targeted therapies in breast cancer and

874
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:48,520
EGFR antibodies, at least in colorectal cancer. Before we leave HER2-NU, what's the success rate?

875
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,680
So, if a woman, HER2-NU is used pretty commonly as an adjuvant now, right?

876
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:58,360
Yeah. But the naked antibodies produced a 10 to 20% response rate. So, tumor shrinkage by the

877
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,480
criteria that we use in clinical trials. So, more than a 50% reduction.

878
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,920
So, notable benefit in a pretty small fraction of patients when given as monotherapy.

879
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,800
And given in patients who still had disease. That's right. Initially,

880
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,560
patients with overt metastatic disease, overt versus covert metastatic disease.

881
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:19,720
That's right. So, is that really an AZT-like moment to see that type of tumor shrinkage

882
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:25,080
depth slash reliability or unreliability of tumor shrinkage in that low range?

883
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:30,760
So, to be debated with conventional chemotherapy, which itself had a 30, 40% likelihood of causing

884
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,320
the same amount of regression. And then you are now in business because you're producing 60 plus

885
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,360
percent response rates. Now, these are mostly PRs, not CRs.

886
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,240
Correct. PR is partial response, CR complete response.

887
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:45,320
And in every cancer type, it's true in leukemias or humanological tendencies,

888
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:50,040
as is true in solid tumors. The more you can beat down the tumor, the more likely that's going to

889
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,120
last for a while. So, putting people quote unquote into remission, which is a leukemia term,

890
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,920
actually has its solid tumor equivalent. So, complete responses are the most durable.

891
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:04,040
Surprise, surprise. And amazingly, even our kind of stupid CAT scan technology, as much as we

892
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,600
think, oh, I can only pick up a smaller than billion, but many, many millions of cells needed

893
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,200
to be visible on a CAT scan. Turns out that actually that threshold, the clearing below

894
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,920
that threshold, the so-called complete response actually does mean something very powerful in

895
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:21,640
terms of patients' longish term outcome, maybe not cure, but still longest term outcome, even with

896
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,200
certain monotherapies. So, HER2 was an example where, yeah, it moved the needle to a degree in

897
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:31,720
a subpopulation with conventional stupid chemotherapy. It seemed to actually collaborate

898
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:37,320
reasonably well and improve survival in big face retriales when HER2 antibody was given with

899
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:43,080
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. That was a slow motion, aha moment. What was the fast motion

900
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:50,440
one was the, to me, kind of validating moment, which was in BCR-able, translocated,

901
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:55,000
chronic myelogenous leukemia. And then the same drug amazingly worked in gastrointestinal

902
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,920
stromal tumor. But any case, that came a couple of years later. So, explain what's the tyrosine

903
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,840
kinase, what is that whole thing that you just said, and why does that matter? Right. So,

904
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:07,480
the chronic myelogenous leukemia. So, there's four leukemias, broadly speaking. Right. Acute and

905
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:12,600
chronic, myeloid and lymphoid leukemia. The kids are more typically getting the acute ones,

906
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:18,360
both lymphocytic and myeloblastic, correct? Yeah. Turn that around. Pediatric cancers are rare,

907
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:22,200
generally speaking, but it turns out that- Sorry, when a kid gets one, it's more like-

908
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,840
Yeah, right. Bomerov drive cancers are a common problem for kids. We think that actually relates

909
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,240
to the number of hits, by the way. Like if you're a kid, you can't accumulate that many hits. And so,

910
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:36,360
cancers that can form with few hits are the ones reflected in the pediatric population. So, exactly

911
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,840
as you say, those things, they're built on few hits. They're rapidly, acute leukemias, rapidly

912
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,560
dividing cells, and you can cure them. Kids, greater than 90%, with multi-agent chemotherapy

913
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,000
cocktails. Yes, that make them sick, but you can cure them. And then there can be long-term

914
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,880
consequences. So, I'm not trivializing the room for improvement there. But anyway, chemo, definitely,

915
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,880
in pediatric acute leukemias, big deal. Chronic leukemias happen very uncommonly in kids, but

916
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:05,560
can happen. Adults more commonly get chronic leukemias, but can also get acute leukemias that

917
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,720
are more genetically complex than the kids' versions, notably, and therefore harder to cure

918
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,160
with the same exact chemotherapy regimens. So, one form of chronic leukemia, so-called chronic

919
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,920
myelodious leukemia, so in the quadrants, as you were depicting them, this is one.

920
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,600
People could live with it for five to seven years. If you replace their bone marrow, so-called bone

921
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,720
marrow transplanting, you could cure a minority population. On a good day, maybe 40% of CML

922
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:32,440
patients can be cured with bone marrow transplant. But a molecular insight came in the 1970s,

923
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,760
that basically, there was a very common, kind of macroscopic, if you will, chromosomal

924
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:42,760
change, where one part of a chromosome would vary stereotypically, 95% likelihood,

925
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,240
that a CML patient would have the repositioning of one portion of a chromosome to another.

926
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,800
Which is kind of hard to imagine when you think of how big that is.

927
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,760
Yeah. Right?

928
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:52,920
Like-

929
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,800
It's a big migration.

930
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,920
Everything we've been talking about is this base pair. Like, maybe it's worth it. I think

931
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,920
most listeners know this, but it never hurts to be reminded. Can you walk from the scale of base pair

932
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,280
to gene to chromosome? Like, just give people a sense of- you're on a little spaceship,

933
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:15,960
you get shrunk down, you are entering the nucleus of a cell. What do you start to see

934
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:16,920
as the plane's landing?

935
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,800
Right. So, we talk about 23 pairs of chromosomes, and that really is a biologic reality. Decades and

936
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,280
decades ago, the practice of being able to kind of spread out the chromosomes and fix them in a way

937
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:31,480
that you could stare at them outside of an intact cell is the picture that people have been shown

938
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:37,000
in elementary school. In cells, they really are, they do exist as coherent, separated entities,

939
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,240
but much more nebulous than how they're displayed out as 23 pairs. 23 chromosome pairs, we get one

940
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,200
of each from each of our parents, and they range in size.

941
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:50,840
So, you got one to 22 looks sort of the way they do, and then XX or XY, right? Round out the-

942
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:55,800
Exactly. And so, their size difference relates then to the amount of genetic content in each

943
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,560
of them. It's an important point. I usually go straight to genes, but we can come back to base

944
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,400
pairs. So, there's 30,000 genes. That's the current number that people-

945
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,880
I've got to update my estimate. I've been saying 2025.

946
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,760
Yeah. So, this is-

947
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,040
Coding versus non-coding.

948
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,320
Coding versus non-coding. So, and that's still, even if you include non-coding true genes,

949
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:18,280
you still have a lot of in-between material. A ton, a ton, the vast majority of base pairs are

950
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,960
function not determined, essentially. Are they important scaffolds? Probably, at a minimum.

951
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:27,480
They're at least scaffolds. This whole notion about opening the blueprint, closing the blueprint,

952
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,480
they probably play an important role. Much of the genome probably plays some role in that

953
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,520
opening, closing process, normal and pathophysiological.

954
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,040
Any case, so you think about the number of total genes that exist and the size of them and the

955
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,200
amount of genetic code that's in them versus the dark, quote unquote, dark matter, at least

956
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:50,360
scaffold, maybe smarter scaffold than we give it credit for. There's relatively small portions of

957
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,440
it that we actually understand. Really, coding genes are what we at best understand.

958
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:59,560
Which is why when somebody does a 23andMe sequence where for a hundred bucks, I mean,

959
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,920
you can pretty much, I mean, you're not going to get a complete sequence, but you can get a

960
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,720
complete sequence anywhere on the street today. Right. Usually, those tests will hone in on the

961
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:12,600
component of the genetic sequence that we know something about. You can at least present

962
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:18,760
fingerprint to someone in terms of their ancestry and then maybe something about disease, but not

963
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:24,200
a lot of insight there. Genes, of course, very individual genes amongst the tens of thousands,

964
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:29,480
very enormously in their size and therefore the amount of genetic code in them. The mutation

965
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:33,320
opportunity, of course, we think is to a degree equal opportunity. I mean, you can develop a

966
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:37,240
mutation either because of a replication error or because of an insult.

967
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,800
So the larger the gene in theory, the greater the probability it can acquire a mutation.

968
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,080
Sure. And P53, the most famous tumors of resurgine in the mall.

969
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,200
How many base pairs?

970
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,040
P53, I don't know off the top of my head. I should Google that someday.

971
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,880
We'll do it for you. It'll be in the show notes.

972
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:57,960
Yeah, right. So let's go with ballpark it at a couple hundred thousand base pairs,

973
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,680
big gene, multiple exons that are separated by introns that are stitched together when the

974
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,400
gene is transcribed into RNA and then-

975
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:10,440
And extrons and introns for folks is coding. I mean, it's part that actually gets turned into

976
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,960
RNA versus that that doesn't.

977
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,880
Exactly, but they still play an important regulating role and again, at least scaffolding

978
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,920
kind of stitching together.

979
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,080
And that's something that, again, 20 years ago, people thought those introns don't matter.

980
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,840
Yeah, they're dead, right, exactly. But that's where all the-

981
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,640
Junk DNA.

982
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:27,560
That's where all the regulating elements really largely reside. So it's a huge,

983
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,080
in the past 20 years, it's been a parallel track, big area of innovation.

984
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:37,960
So in any case, so then you have a big gene like P53. So 50% of cancers have genetic aberration

985
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,920
P53. Well, partly it's just a really large gene, but so you can pick up mutations in it

986
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,960
seemingly relatively easily, but it's a master regulator.

987
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,240
What percentage of cancers do not have a P53 mutation?

988
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,840
50% and the other 50 do.

989
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,880
Oh, so it's 50-50.

990
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,840
I would have guessed that fewer people with cancer do not have a P53 mutation.

992
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,240
Do not.

993
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,520
Yeah, I would have thought it was almost essential.

994
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:05,000
Okay, so P53 is such a complex central node in a very complex network. So there's tons of

995
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,920
translated proteins that interact with the protein product P53 and then P53 has a lot of outputs,

996
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,960
literally networks of outputs. It's in cancer, in any case, I would say it is the most magnificent

997
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,600
and thus far well mapped out of these networks. What is the function of P53? Very simply put,

998
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:25,800
it's basically a sensing apparatus. It's trying to understand how bad things are in a cell. And

999
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,440
usually people would say, well, first, if there was a singular function, it's how poorly is the

1000
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:36,840
genetic code doing, which is to say the chromosomal architecture, how intact versus not intact. Is it

1001
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,440
how many mistakes mutations or mistakes? So insults versus mistakes, how many of those exist

1002
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:47,160
and are being repaired at any one time? Like so that machinery is at work, the DNA repair machinery

1003
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:52,600
that feeds then into P53, which basically is just sensing overall, how well are we doing in terms

1004
01:22:52,600 --> 01:23:00,600
of kind of and P53 possesses the power to command apoptosis? Yeah, so it senses damage in a normal

1005
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,760
cell that's its function in a cell that's becoming abnormal continues to keep its finger on that

1006
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,880
pulse. And if there's catastrophic damage, then it's P53 that says, let's not try to repair this

1007
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:15,240
anymore. Let's fold up shop and undergo a civilized cell death and let our neighboring, let's say,

1008
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:20,680
liver cell just take over and do our job if we're a liver cell. So P53 is the master regulator in

1009
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:24,680
all cells in the body. I love doing these podcasts because I still even it's on a topic like this

1010
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,480
where I know a little bit like I'm amazed at how much I keep learning. So 50% of people who get

1011
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:34,920
cancer have a perfectly intact P53. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. But the point about describing the

1012
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:39,720
network is the likelihood that they will have a genetic aberration in one of the inputs or one of

1013
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:45,560
the outputs of P53 is enormously high. Got it. So we say the gene P53 only 50% of the time is

1014
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:50,600
mutated, but the pathway is virtually always hosed. So retinoblastoma gene, you've made it with that

1015
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,960
one. That's another very famous long ago described tumor suppressor gene. What was not known decades

1016
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:00,680
ago, but is known now is that they actually relate to each other and you will find cancers that if

1017
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,560
they don't have a P53 mutation, they will have an RB retinoblastoma gene mutation. It's another big

1018
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:12,360
tumor suppressor gene that actually is downstream or regulated by P53 and its alteration will do

1019
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:17,240
much of what a P53 mutation will do. So there's these kinds of functional substitutes in that

1020
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:23,480
axis. On the activated side, that's where I spent most of my career. So KRAS. Exactly. Talk to me

1021
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,920
about KRAS. What is this clown doing? So I was just going to say that growth factor receptors,

1022
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,080
which I touched on before because Epidomeal Growth Factor Receptor and HER2 were these kind of early

1023
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:37,400
discovery slash therapeutic translation exercises. Well, that was the beginning of a theme that to

1024
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:43,240
this day we think is kind of the biggest unit in terms of where the activating events happen

1025
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:51,080
where we have drugs now is in the growth factor receptor RAS and RAS pathway system. So growth

1026
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:56,040
factor receptors, literally their normal functions are received growth factors. So in a cancer cell,

1027
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:00,520
if you can figure out how to grow in a growth factor independent way, then you've accomplished

1028
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,280
a good trick because now you'll be able to survive very harsh environments. You'll be able to

1029
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:09,000
replicate kind of an autonomous, not governed by not just environment in terms of nutrient

1030
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,120
availability, but even like what your neighbors are telling you, you should and shouldn't do.

1031
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:17,480
You can ignore that. One of the explanations for why we see more aggressive prostate cancers in

1032
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,960
men with lower testosterone levels than higher testosterone levels. If your prostate cancer

1033
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,120
can grow without testosterone, beware. It's a bad problem. And then same with breast cancer with

1034
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,520
hormone receptor, positive breast cancer, quote unquote, versus negative the prognosis and

1035
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:35,320
treatment responses wildly different, much more different disease basically. So that's exactly

1036
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:41,960
right. So cancers fundamentally need to accomplish this task. So growth factor receptor genetic

1037
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:47,000
alterations, HER2 is genetically amplified, then massively increasing the number of surface

1038
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,040
receptors and allowing them to actually complex together and signal in the absence of needing the

1039
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:56,040
growth factor itself. That was the seminal discovery going back even into the eighties,

1040
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,120
but certainly picked up a lot of steam in the nineties and then was a validated target.

1041
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:04,280
Ultimately, as I said, in a relatively slow motion way compared to BCR-Able, which we're

1042
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:10,840
going to come back to. So anyway, these growth factor receptors feed RAS, R-A-S, and that comes

1043
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:18,200
in three forms, K-RAS, H-RAS, and N-RAS, and 25% of all cancers have a RAS mutation. Right downstream

1044
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,200
of these growth factor receptors is where RAS sits just on the inside of the cell surface. We

1045
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,360
can't drug it directly, certainly with an antibody. Small molecule inhibitors have been hard. That's

1046
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,360
its own discussion in terms of what's assailable and what's not assailable in terms of cancer drug

1047
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:36,120
targets, but let's park that one and say that RAS is a big deal. And then RAS has its so-called

1048
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,800
effector pathways and the numbers to a degree, I think, how many people agree on the number of

1049
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,120
cancer relevant RAS effector pathways? I can't find a lot of consensus there, but six is a

1050
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:51,400
reasonable number of described cancer related RAS effector pathways. So downstream of RAS,

1051
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:56,440
RAS will activate other cascades. The two most famous are the MAP kinase pathway, where I've

1052
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,920
focused my career, PI3 kinase pathway. Arguably there's more mutations that activate the PI3

1053
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,600
kinase pathway than the MAP kinase pathway, but-

1054
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,240
Lou and I have been trying to sit down for, we cohabitate parts of New York that are 10 feet

1055
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,600
away from each other. So at some point, Lou and I are going to sit down and have a lengthy

1056
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,880
discussion on PI3K.

1057
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,440
Yeah. This is where I wanted to take a little deep dive into Lou and Craig Thompson's-

1058
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,000
By all means.

1059
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,200
... travels in the PI3 kinase pathway. Here's a pathway in this growth factor receptor signaling

1060
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:28,840
apparatus. Metabolic regulation comes, we think, largely, but not completely through the PI3 kinase

1061
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:34,120
pathway. If you link up all of the discoveries of Lou and others regarding the importance of PI3

1062
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:39,880
kinase in cancer, the fact that 20% of cancers have PI3 kinase intrinsic mutations in one of

1063
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:45,480
the isoforms of PI3 kinase, most commonly alpha. It's a nasty little trick. I mean, it's co-opting

1064
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:51,000
this metabolic regulation pathway. It largely explains growth factor independence of cancers

1065
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,480
that have those mutations, but these are metabolic pathways that are fundamental to normal cells as

1066
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,560
well. And so where's the therapeutic index in terms of leveraging that observation? This has

1067
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:05,000
been a major challenge and not yet really adequately tackled, but one positive result,

1068
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,480
at least in PI3 kinase mutant breast cancer that finally came across in slow motion, face

1069
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,880
re-result. When it takes a face re-clinical trial to be the aha moment, that's a slow motion result

1070
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:18,440
versus 20 patients get treated and you know you're in different territory, which was the BRAF example

1071
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:24,040
in melanoma and then other cancers thereafter. So the MAP kinase pathway is this proliferative

1072
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,960
pathway as it's canonically described, but it does other things, at least in cancer when it's

1073
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:33,160
co-opted by mutation. Common theme, by the way, when you activate an oncogene in cancer,

1074
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:40,200
very commonly you will see that the downstream wiring diagram changes and that pathway is now

1075
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,480
able to do more things than we would have given it credit for or said that it had those same

1076
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:50,120
abilities in a normal cell. It's what we mean by oncogene addiction. If you turn it around in terms

1077
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:56,840
of building blocks, oncogene addiction means that cancer really needs that activated oncogene to be

1078
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:02,280
able to do not just one thing like dry proliferation, but actually to alter other essential programs for

1079
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:07,880
cancer. The flip side is that normal cells in the body, they have other ways. They can break up the

1080
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:12,360
work between proliferation and metabolism, between, for example, the MAP kinase pathway, the PI3 kinase

1081
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:17,880
pathway. But in melanoma, for example, where we see we call it kind of this paradigmatic MAP kinase

1082
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:23,240
pathway activated tumor, yeah, it cares about the PI3 kinase pathway, but in quite a secondary way.

1083
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:29,160
Breast cancer, flip that around. So this idea that we could actually come up with an understanding of

1084
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:34,120
these normal cell processes that are co-opted by cancer, drug them, and do more harm to the cancer

1085
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:39,400
cell than the normal cell, it wasn't intuitive to people. I mean, this goes back to this watershed

1086
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:45,720
era of the early 2000s when the concept of targeted therapy finally kind of had its aha moment. It

1087
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:51,960
really relied on this concept and the term oncogene addiction, when did I first hear that? I suppose it

1088
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:58,760
was in the early 2000s. This idea that by cancer co-opting this one molecule, it's actually now

1089
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:05,000
essentially using it to drive more components of cancer biology than you would have thought in

1090
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,640
terms of the normal physiologic role of that molecule and where there's compensatory mechanisms

1091
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:13,800
and parallel processing that can happen in normal cells that make it not so dependent on that

1092
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:18,200
the function of that one molecule. So anyway, Ras, 25% of cancers have a Ras mutation,

1093
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:23,160
20% of cancers have a PI3 kinase mutation, there's a little bit of overlap there. 8% of cancers have

1094
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:27,960
a BRAF mutation, which is intrinsic in the MAP kinase pathway, it's the most popular point of

1095
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,200
mutation in that pathway. What percentage of melanomas have a BRAF mutation? About 50%.

1096
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:39,480
And it was that simple alignment of facts. It was finishing my fellowship in 2002, June of 2002,

1097
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:46,760
becoming faculty at Penn in July of 2002. And June of 2002 in nature, was described the research

1098
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:53,080
project that the Sanger Center in the UK, one of the sequencing powerhouses then and now,

1099
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,720
they had launched this campaign specifically to sequence the RAF genes, not Ras, RAS,

1100
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:02,520
the one that's undrugable, unfortunately, still to this day, but rather the RAF genes. Why did

1101
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,360
they do this? Because the MAP kinase pathway had been implicated as being relevant in cancer for

1102
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:11,880
a couple of decades. And no one knew other than Ras mutations that can activate it. Outside of

1103
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:17,320
that, no one understood how and why the pathway could be co-opted by cancer cells. So a logical

1104
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:22,120
thing to do would be just go one bucket down in the bucket brigade from Ras to the molecule that

1105
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:28,520
Ras regulates, which is RAF, three isoforms of RAF, C-RAF, B-RAF, and A-RAF, understood lesser

1106
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:33,400
and lesser degree across that sequence. So C-RAF was the first discovered called RAF1 at the time,

1107
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:39,320
then it was renamed C-RAF later. People had studied C-RAF to a large degree, B-RAF not so much.

1108
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,560
There were only really a couple slash few B-RAF mavens in the world and still to this day, not

1109
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,320
very many A-RAF mavens. The hypothesis was that these RAF genes are probably going to have some

1110
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,880
mutations and C-RAF would be the one most likely because it'd been the best studied up to that

1111
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:59,720
date. So the big headline from that nature paper was rarely ever do you see a C-RAF.

1112
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:05,720
B-RAF was the big discovery. 8% of all cancer was the estimate when they sequence 484 tumors.

1113
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:12,040
A-RAF rarely if ever mutated. So B-RAF was the one. The why of that is its own fascinating little bit

1114
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:16,120
of kind of molecular evolutionary history, B-RAF and C-RAF are different molecules.

1115
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:21,720
Does RAS actually play a causal role in the mutation or is it more a function of

1116
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:28,360
the things that bug RAS, bug B-RAF? Yeah, that's true. They're related. They talk to each other,

1117
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:35,400
but the answer this way, in a cancer that has a RAS mutation, you will not find a B-RAF mutation

1118
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:40,200
and vice versa. They are mutually exclusive. So you don't need to skin that cat twice. You do it

1119
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:46,280
one way. RAS is sufficient or B-RAF is sufficient to get activation of the pathway. Melanomas,

1120
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:50,920
for example, 50% of them have B-RAF. Very similar to the P53 problem. Yeah, that's right. These

1121
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:56,520
tumors anyway need it and many cancers need this pathway on. How they accomplish it varies.

1122
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:02,760
We don't understand all the determinants of why certain cell types are more prone to picking up

1123
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,400
certain mutations as their, if you will, their means of activating certain pathways, but there's

1124
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:13,400
certainly a sort of teleology argument there. In any case, RAS discovered an 8% of all cancers.

1125
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:18,520
I had decided melanoma was a cancer of terrible unmet need, interesting biochemistry insights

1126
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:23,320
coming from the previous couple of decades, very strong lab-based science in melanoma at Penn,

1127
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:30,360
where I was choosing to put myself on the clinical research frontier. This aha moment in this paper

1128
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:35,080
was that 8% of cancers have RAS mutations, but the cancer type that most commonly had them

1129
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:39,320
in that paper, later paper described that there's one rare cancer that more commonly has

1130
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:46,840
B-RAF mutations was melanoma at 50%. The vast, vast majority of those mutations affected a single

1131
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:52,200
point in the gene. Let me pause now to go back to the question so that people understand scale.

1132
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:57,240
A point in a gene, so you have 23 chromosomes, call it 30,000 genes. Let's make the math easy.

1133
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:01,880
You got about 1,000 genes wrapping around each chromosome, order of magnitude.

1134
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:06,200
Okay, so one chromosome's got about 1,000 genes wrapped around it. You got 23 pairs of those.

1135
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:14,680
And now each gene could be anywhere from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand base pairs.

1136
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:20,920
And what you're talking about is one of those could be mutated. You could get one letter wrong

1137
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,200
out of a hundred thousand and you change the function of a gene.

1138
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,920
Exactly. You asked before about kinases and this is going to...

1139
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,920
All of this is in service of CML.

1140
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,880
Right, exactly. We're going to link those two concepts. So basically, we have, I use that

1141
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:39,400
phrase bucket brigades, we have these pathways where one molecule alters another, alters another.

1142
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:44,280
We too commonly think of these as linear, one augmenting another followed by another and not

1143
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,840
as systems where there's side inputs into these pathways, which has been well described,

1144
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:54,840
including the map kinase pathway. In any case, follow me here that basically RAS activates RAF.

1145
01:34:54,840 --> 01:35:00,520
When RAS itself is activated, it pushes RAF into a pair of molecules, so-called dimers,

1146
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:06,600
and will facilitate their phosphorylation or molecular feature change that allows them to be

1147
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:14,920
active. So kinases are a form of enzyme whose job is to add a phosphate group, a single fairly small

1148
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:21,320
molecular entity to specific amino acid residues on its target. And usually it's more than one

1149
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:25,640
target, but the point is that there is a fidelity in terms of that relationship where you've got a

1150
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:31,400
kinase and its substrates, plural. So RAS will activate RAF, RAF will activate MEC, MEC will

1151
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:35,960
activate ERK all through phosphorylation events. So they glom onto each other and find the right

1152
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,720
domain and stick a phosphate group on there. People are used to hearing me say that I get

1153
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:46,520
phosphorylated and I think they understand exactly what you're... My five-year-old can get me more

1154
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:52,760
phosphorylated than any tyrosine kinase in the history of our known universe. So phosphate

1155
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:58,680
residue additions are, they're not the most important, but they're a key facet of how the

1156
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:03,800
molecular machinery works inside of cells in terms of how to activate or inactivate these networks.

1157
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:09,000
And here we're talking about growth factor receptor related networks. So right in the middle of the

1158
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,440
so-called kinase domain, the part of BRAF that actually is basically responsible for latching

1159
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,840
a phosphate residue on MEC, its downstream substrate, right in the middle of that domain.

1160
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,920
I mean, literally right in the middle is where these mutations happen in the vast majority of

1161
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:28,120
cases. That discovery alone was just shocking, right? Because by chance alone, you're not going

1162
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:33,560
to find stumble upon these mutations piling up in 8% of cancer and there's one point right in the

1163
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,960
middle of the kinase domain. That wasn't also in the same paper, was it? No, that point was.

1164
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:42,840
It was. Oh yeah. The distribution, if you will, of them being V600 position mutations,

1165
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,240
the valine at the 600 position in the amino acid sequence, right in the heart of exon 15,

1166
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:51,560
which is in the middle of the kinase domain, that was in the paper. The additional killer experiment

1167
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:56,360
that they did was to basically transfect that into a fibroblast, so a normal cell, and show that that

1168
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:01,240
could transform them and make them proliferate to a degree. And that was it, kind of end of paper.

1169
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:06,760
So the phenomenology that these mutations exist, this wild distribution, or if you will, non-distribution,

1170
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:12,360
this like piling up at this one position, it was just this huge aha moment. And when you link that

1171
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:17,480
in melanoma with this couple decades worth of insights that the map kinase pathway really seemed

1172
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:20,760
to be important in this tumor, and now you find these mutations sitting here right in the middle

1173
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:26,440
of the pathway, that was just the most drop dead, obviously important thing in my view, and a couple

1174
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:31,000
other people's view, but shockingly few other people at the time decided to take a complete

1175
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,080
left or right turn and focus on it. But that was the dawn of my career, so this is a problem with

1176
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:40,360
biomedical research is that every time a discovery is made. It impacts the people who are in search

1177
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:44,360
of substrate. Precisely. Who said I want to get to the frontier of known and not known, I want to

1178
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:48,840
investigate. Everybody else is busy, they're already doing their thing, and if they're grant funded then

1179
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,160
forget about it, like they're already mining away. I think of the lab I was in in 02-03-04,

1180
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:59,480
it was all immunotherapy, like we never talked about, I mean maybe that paper came up at Journal

1181
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:06,760
Club, as like one of 50 papers discussed that year is interesting, but I mean it was anti-CTLA-4,

1182
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:11,480
it was till, it was because everybody there was super seasoned, super senior, and they were already

1183
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:17,400
on this path, that's a great point. I never really thought of that bias that can exist temporarily

1184
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,800
through a person's career. And melanoma for all the reasons we discussed before had been dominated by

1185
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:26,120
cancer immunologists because they recognized that there was this robust evidence of tumor immune

1186
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:30,840
interaction. You had this huge opportunity. Yeah, and so the idea that you could just make one more

1187
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:35,720
maneuver, be it a cell therapy or a checkpoint in a body or a recidicine, and tip the balance and

1188
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:40,120
clear the tumor, the field was very focused on that. And if you were interested in the general

1189
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:44,600
notion of cancer immunity, well melanoma seemed like a very natural home for that work, and that

1190
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:49,800
really was the subtext. I came walking in with this very different idea. Last thing you wanted to

1191
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,200
do is do what everybody else was already doing. Exactly. I'll just finish this point by saying

1192
01:38:54,200 --> 01:39:00,840
that this is the whole coaching point to the petrified or even paralyzed young trainee,

1193
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,840
who's thinking, well, how am I going to find my entry point? Where am I going to find something

1194
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,760
to work on? What I say is, okay, you're not waiting for something top secret that someone

1195
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,160
comes and whispers in your ear. What you're waiting for is the NECT Nature Science and Cell Paper to

1196
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:17,080
be published that describes something that's very important in an area that you've said you've just,

1197
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:21,480
for some intuitive reason, that you have an interest in. And trust me, the field is not going

1198
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:25,240
to drop everything that they're doing to go pursue that. But if you're at the dawn of your career,

1199
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:30,120
you're in the perfect moment to now actually build the knowledge base, meet the people who are the

1200
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:34,200
relevant players, assemble the knowledge, pull together the tools to actually start testing

1201
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,960
this hypothesis, whether it's your wet lab investigator or clinical investigator, the same.

1202
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:42,680
And I've never witnessed a case where someone's been basically crowded out, or hasn't been able

1203
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:47,080
to make a career in investigation by using that approach. I'm trying to come back to the watershed

1204
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:51,480
moment of BCRA, but I'm going to do it this way. So, BRAF mutations were discovered in 2002.

1205
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:57,400
People ignored it, not only because they thought tumor immune interactions were a cooler thing in

1206
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:03,480
melanoma, but remember melanoma is jacked up with mutations. It's got an inordinate number of them.

1207
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:10,840
So you find this one, so what? If there's a cancer on earth where we're poking that beast

1208
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:16,200
with a single drug approach, just antagonizing BRAF is going to do nothing. This is the example.

1209
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:21,960
That was the headwind argument. Absolutely. In fact, I would say that that should be the null

1210
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:27,880
second and third, fourth alternative hypothesis. That is a capital so what?

1211
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,840
Yeah, exactly. Maybe we'll circle back later.

1212
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,080
That's why it wasn't even mentioned in journal club.

1213
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:38,840
When the first putative BRAF inhibitor didn't work, this was the other big hot, we told you so,

1214
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:44,200
moment, which we, let's table that for a moment. So chronic myelodysleukemia is fundamentally

1215
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,720
different. I mean, this was known even in the 70s that if you look at the splay of chromosomes and

1216
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:50,360
you see this one migration of one segment, chromosome-

1217
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:54,680
The listener now understands why I got phosphorylated when you said that so they could understand it.

1218
01:40:54,680 --> 01:41:02,040
These chromosomes are huge. One piece of one of them could literally, it's like picking up a

1219
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:07,560
building in a cell and moving it and attaching it to a condo somewhere else.

1220
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:13,560
This was observed by Peter Knoll decades ago and as a characteristic event in CML that you would

1221
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:17,960
see this in at least 95% of cases, this massive chromosome shift, but not others. In other words,

1222
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:23,000
it wasn't like the DNA was shredded at the chromosomal level. It was this one migratory

1223
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,920
move and it was like characteristic pathognomonic of the disease. That was striking, right? Just that

1224
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,600
fact. It's striking. It's also important for the listener to understand. You could see it

1225
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:38,360
under a microscope. Yeah, exactly. There's nothing genetically, all this stuff you and I are talking

1226
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:42,200
about right now, you don't look at your microscope and see that. You got to sequence individual

1227
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:47,560
base pairs and large numbers of them. This might be the only genetic mutation in cancer that is

1228
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:52,040
visible under a microscope. Well, we'll come back to that. There's another example? Well, fusions in

1229
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:55,560
general. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's a fair point. The term translocation was the term that

1230
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:00,520
was used then. Now we use the term fusion. Yeah, my point being anything outside of a piece of a

1231
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:06,280
chromosome moving. So fusions is a theme in cancer, their own kind of substrate of discovery,

1232
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:10,760
but this was the first one. So basically you had what appeared to be at the chromosomal level,

1233
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:16,520
genetically simple cancer, where nearly always one big fragment migrated to join another big fragment.

1234
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:22,600
What was at that juncture? Why were those two coming together? So fascinating. So this is a

1235
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:26,920
white blood cell cancer, right? The myeloid cells are white blood cells, a branch of them anyway.

1236
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:31,640
And so to get chronic myelogenous leukemia, you needed this genetic migration thing to happen.

1237
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:40,200
On one side of it is the BCR gene. And that gene is basically responsible for immunoglobulin kind

1238
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:46,040
of reshuffling in white blood cells. It's a very dynamic, very active gene in white blood cells,

1239
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:50,440
if they're going to be able to do their immunologic job and create the relevant kind of repertoire

1240
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:56,280
of foreign recognition, then the BCR gene needs to be active to facilitate that program. Let me

1241
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:04,040
put it that way. So any case, the BCR gene is on one end of this migration event. It's not a doer

1242
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:10,440
in and of itself. It's just a very active gene locus that's just on, on, on in white blood cells.

1243
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:17,720
On the other end is the able kinase. So able kinase is a signaling molecule that's inside of cells.

1244
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:22,840
It's not important in all cell types. It's important to a degree in white blood cells.

1245
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,080
That's I think a fair summary statement now looking back 20 years in retrospect with a lot

1246
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:31,240
more information. But this is a signaling molecule that does a lot of work inside of cell. It's a

1247
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:37,560
kinase, so it phosphorylates substrates. And when BCR-ABL, this very active regulating domain,

1248
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:41,080
is stitched onto the able kinase. BCR is stitched to ABL.

1249
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:44,760
Yes, correct. So this creates the BCR-ABL translocation or fusion. So you now have a

1250
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:48,680
new gene product of these two genetic components being stitched together that otherwise wouldn't

1251
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:52,760
have been. They're quite far apart from each other in chromosome 9 and 22. So in any case,

1252
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:58,120
when they come together, you crank up the expression of able kinase. So able kinase is normal.

1253
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,840
Able kinase, it's not mutated. Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, instead of firing

1254
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,800
once every minute, it fires 40 times a minute. It's jacked up. It's an expression to preposterous

1255
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,400
degrees. You have an enormous amount of able kinase being made in these white blood cells because the

1256
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:17,000
BCR-R locus is just being driven all the time in normal white blood cells. So now you've got

1257
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,280
ABL on the other end of that. Which is really aptly named. Abelson is the discoverer of it.

1258
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:26,280
But in this context, it's aptly named. It's very ABL. It's an ABL kinase that has become

1259
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:30,840
much more ABL. Right. But unlike BRAF, which has this activating mutation sitting right in the

1260
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:35,160
middle of it, nucleotide substitution resulting in an amino acid substitution that alters its kinase

1261
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:39,720
function, this is just normal ABL. Yeah, it's just more on. Yeah. And HER2 amplification and

1262
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:44,840
breast cancer also, just there's more of it. And then they complex together and signal more.

1263
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,360
So when we talk about mutation and genetic alteration, just understand that there are

1264
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:51,720
these, there's amplification, there's point mutation, and there's translocation or fusion.

1265
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:56,920
These are the three canonical ways that you can have it. And do most of the fusions have this

1266
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:01,960
phenotype? So this is other fusion cancers outside. Meaning do they have this phenotype of

1267
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:08,680
normal protein just doing more? Precisely. Yeah. And kinases are the ones that have been discovered,

1268
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:15,480
described, and now drugged multiple times. So what's fascinating about, now this is a 2019-ish

1269
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:19,800
insight, or at least the past few years, is these fusion or translocation,

1270
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:24,120
quote unquote, driven cancers, they tend to be genetically simple. Not all of them.

1271
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:31,080
Point mutations happen in the sea of genetic complexity, melanoma being an example, but all

1272
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:35,480
BRAF mutations distribute across cancer types that are actually quite genetically complex.

1273
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:39,320
There's a lot of other genetic aberrations turning on and turning off other things.

1274
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:45,800
These fusion-driven cancers, they seem to get a lot of juice out of that one genetic alteration.

1275
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:50,280
So BCR-ABL was the initial example. But remember, it's chronic myelodis leukemia. It would kill

1276
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:55,000
patients over five to seven years. And it was super genetically simple, at least at the level

1277
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:59,960
that one could make such comments in the 90s, which is when therapeutically, attention started

1278
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:06,200
to be turned to this Abel kinase phenomenon. So it turned out that C. bagayi ultimately subsumed

1279
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:12,360
into Novartis over serial acquisitions had a kinase inhibitor program broadly for cardiovascular

1280
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:17,880
disease. I knew C. bagayi for my father's academic cardiology pursuits. So they had these kinase

1281
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,520
inhibitors. They were pretty crude instruments. But in the mix, my understanding initially was all

1282
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:28,440
endothelial palliative cardiovascular disease was the kind of phenotypic screening, if you will,

1283
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,840
that was being done with this kinase inhibitor library at the time. This predates the cancer

1284
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:37,960
investigations. So they created this library, not massive, of kinase inhibitors. It's a small

1285
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:43,080
molecule, tool compounds. So there's this guy, Brian Druker, at Dana-Farber in Boston at the time,

1286
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:49,640
who uncovers that now Novartis has this kinase inhibitor library. And in it is a apparent

1287
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:55,240
Abel kinase inhibitor, not perfectly selective for Abel kinase. Kinases exist in the hundreds.

1288
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:00,760
So about 600 or so kinases have been described in the family tree. They're highly related,

1289
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:05,800
but then there's some that are more distant cousins than others. And if you try to inhibit

1290
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:11,160
a kinase, it's pretty easy to pick up inhibitory activity against another kinase because of their

1291
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:15,640
relatedness, their structural relatedness. So it turns out a matinib, the first Abel kinase

1292
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:20,840
inhibitor was not just an Abel kinase inhibitor. Fortuitously, it was also a C. kit inhibitor,

1293
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:24,280
which we'll come back to because that's the gastrointestinal stromal tumor dual purpose

1294
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,440
of that molecule. But in any case, he wanted an Abel kinase inhibitor. The more perfect he

1295
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:33,960
could have had, the better, more selective and only targeting Abel. But back in these days,

1296
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:40,680
certainly in the 90s, it was a difficult sport to actually profile how promiscuous or selective a

1297
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:45,720
kinase inhibitor was. So it wasn't really known what its full selectivity spectrum was, but Abel

1298
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:51,000
kinase is what it was labeled as an inhibitor of. So it's been cataloged in many papers,

1299
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:57,160
but just briefly put that basically Brian started this campaign to try to get Novartis to liberate

1300
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:03,880
this molecule that had been to a degree investigated in cardiovascular disease models,

1301
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:09,800
but to get it out of the company and have it actually made available experimentally initially

1302
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:15,400
in model systems, not even in humans yet. In any case, fast forward now. So the drug enters

1303
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:20,680
phase one clinical trials in cancer patients with knowledge that there's this cancer out there.

1304
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,600
And this is like mid 90s?

1305
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:28,840
No, no, no. This is now late 90s. And I'm about to show up in fellowship in July of 2000. And it's

1306
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:35,240
2000, 2001 that the ongoing phase one trial cleared the first few dose levels were somewhat

1307
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,560
homeopathic doses were given didn't didn't have to go on for very long as a phase one study,

1308
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:43,480
recruiting these patients, these patients who were didn't need to be molecular tested,

1309
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:47,480
because you just knew by their diagnosis that they were at least 95% likely to have this

1310
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:52,280
alteration in those cells. And so it was in the midst of my first year of fellowship.

1311
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,760
Yeah, this is the phase one trial where there's efficacy.

1312
01:48:54,760 --> 01:49:00,520
Yeah, first time ever that basically consecutive patients were responding to therapy in a phase

1313
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:05,720
one trial as the dose was still being escalated. So talk about aha moment. I mean, you needed

1314
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:10,520
three patients, six patients, not a big phase three trial to know that there was a transformational

1315
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:16,040
event happening. So that happened in the first year of my fellowship. And my naive talking points,

1316
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:20,440
I was saying, you know, this is the future of cancer. This is what we're gonna do. This is it.

1317
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:26,200
This is our first AZT moment. Drugs working extremely reliably, killing lots of cancer

1318
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:31,000
cells, admittedly, not eradicating all of them in most patients, but still, there were cures even

1319
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,200
in the early days for at least durable, complete responses. So anyway, the point being that this

1320
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:41,000
was the big moment, the objection to that big moment relates to the comment I made a little

1321
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,760
while ago, which is this is chronic myelodosilukemia. This is a genetically simple thing.

1322
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,240
This is barely cancer compared to pancreatic cancer. This is barely cancer compared to

1323
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:56,600
non small cell lung cancer. Okay, fine. It worked here. But why on earth would you think this is

1324
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,600
going to work in real cancers? And again, let's make sure people understand why you're saying

1325
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:08,520
CML is barely cancer. You have a translocation fusion that does not even mutate the kinase

1326
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:16,040
involved. So is it safe to say that someone with CML doesn't actually contain true genetic

1327
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:22,520
mutation? That's fair stable phase CML, as it's called, which is this long period of time where

1328
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:27,320
people will have large numbers of these abnormal white blood cells circulating, but not impairing

1329
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:32,280
their health in any significant way. Stable phase CML is this genetically simple thing.

1330
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,640
Given enough time to evolve, just like we talked about with the small solid tumor,

1331
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:42,440
give it enough time to evolve, it will pick up more alterations and the rate at which alterations

1332
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:48,120
are picked up accelerates also. So evolution begins to happen in a more substantial way leading

1333
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:53,560
to accelerated phase and then blast crisis and patients die of an acute leukemia like death.

1334
01:50:54,120 --> 01:51:01,400
So CML isn't quote unquote, real cancer in this objection rendering frame here for a good long

1335
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:06,040
time, but it certainly becomes real cancer ultimately. So New England Journal of Medicine

1336
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:11,720
publishes the back to back papers in 2001 now of the phase one clinical trial describing these

1337
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:17,480
heroic and quite reliably observed responses to single agent able kinase inhibition with a non

1338
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:22,680
perfect able kinase inhibitor in the form of imatinib. So this felt certainly like a big deal.

1339
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:29,080
The next paper in this back to back same authors were reporting on the activity of imatinib, the

1340
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:34,280
anti tumor effects of imatinib in patients with accelerated phase and blast crisis CML. So same

1341
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:38,680
disease now allowed to genetically evolve and become more complex and certainly to pick up

1342
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:43,720
additional mutations beyond this foundational translocation event. What happened in those

1343
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:49,960
patients is like wasn't even discussed people for years were celebrating this CML stable phase CML

1344
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:55,400
result. And never would you see a talk describing well what happened with the same drug now in a

1345
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:00,520
more genetically complex environment where the same truncal as an original alteration existed,

1346
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,960
but now surrounded by these other partners that were clearly important because now you

1347
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:08,840
transforming into a truly aggressive life threatening disease. You got responses.

1348
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,560
They weren't durable.

1349
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:14,520
They were transient. They lasted for months at best weeks in some cases. So yeah, you could

1350
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,080
poke it with a stick, but it would just laugh its way right around within a very short time in

1351
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:24,280
patients with stills come to their disease. So this is where the debate was. Okay, so you have

1352
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:29,880
CML in its stable phase where you get these kind of heroic, deep and durable responses. Okay, map

1353
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:34,120
that out for me and the rest of cancer. Right. So you realize that CML is the exception. It's not

1354
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:38,760
the rule. Well, this is the argument, right? This was the argument that never again are we going to

1355
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:42,440
find such genetically simple cancers where you can get deep and durable responses from a single

1356
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:46,840
agent targeted therapy. Now again, I didn't feel so defeated by that argument in the sense that

1357
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:51,800
my talking point even before we had the cancer equivalent of AZT was, well, this isn't going to

1358
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:57,080
be about one drug. This is cocktails. Look, it took cocktails to wrestle HIV down and that's a

1359
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:03,720
laughably simple organism compared to a human cell that's now been co-opted by the blueprint being

1360
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:08,120
widely opened. So of course it's going to take combinations. How high order a combination do we

1361
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:13,000
need? Well, that goes back to the building block argument. We still don't know. Any case, but we

1362
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,920
still needed to find our individual AZT moments and hope that they would actually do something for

1363
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:22,520
an individual patient and not just serve as a biologic building block. So this was the subtext.

1364
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:27,400
Fast forward and just connect one dot, which is that, well, one thing that we have learned

1365
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:33,160
is that even in so-called solid tumors, so leaving aside the leukemias like chronic myelitis leukemia,

1366
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:40,200
even in solid tumors, you will find subsets of them that are driven by these translocation fusion

1367
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:46,120
events and they tend to be genetically simple. And now time and time again, that has proven to be

1368
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:51,800
a population sparsely distributed, if you will, across cancer types where you get deep and durable

1369
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:57,880
responses. That was the next big aha moment. So time matters, meaning evolution. Well, yes,

1370
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:04,440
but also like if you catch CML and treat it early enough, in theory, you're going to have a better

1371
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:10,760
response than waiting until the tail starts coming out of the dragon. That's right. So the compensation

1372
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:16,920
that a cancer cell will be able to leverage by having now these built-in accelerants or more

1373
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,800
disabled tumor suppressors, like the ability to adapt and work their way around with de novo

1374
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:27,400
resistance or rapidly acquired resistance is absolutely a huge risk the longer you wait.

1375
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:32,920
That CML example, well, we've begun to map it out in quote unquote common solid tumors.

1376
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:39,480
So in breast cancer, if you look at HER2, I was beating up HER2 for its not aha moment efficacy.

1377
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:43,800
This is trastuzumab, the first naked antibody, but modified forms of HER2 targeted therapies

1378
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:48,840
have come along since these more armed antibodies, if you will, that definitely have greater effect.

1379
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:54,520
But even just take trastuzumab, the naked antibody, its ability to help a metastatic

1380
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:59,000
breast cancer patient live longer for a period of time, well cataloged, but measured in months,

1381
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:05,960
several months, let's say. Now you take that into the so-called adjuvant setting. So this is covert

1382
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:10,680
metastatic disease. So for those who have heard enough jargon and had family members deal with

1383
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:16,040
cancer, they know of two situations where the surgeon says they got it all. But the medical

1384
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:20,040
oncologist is telling them we're still worried there's still some cancer cells around we're too

1385
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:24,840
stupid to know if they're there or not. CAT scans can't tell us because they're too low resolution.

1386
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,360
We're not there yet in terms of actually measuring circulating tumor cells or circulating tumor

1387
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:34,200
DNA and diagnostic and high resolution way. But we're just worried because we know that looking

1388
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:39,960
back a decade, if we had 1000 cancer patients like you, we know that half of them are going

1389
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:45,880
to show up with overt metastatic disease over the first few to several years of follow up.

1390
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:51,080
So you know, a time that someone had microscopic metastatic disease after their surgery with

1391
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:55,960
curative intent. So what I'm getting at is now that's the adjuvant setting. So the possibility,

1392
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:01,080
but not certainty that microscopic metastatic disease exists, you give therapy in that situation,

1393
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:05,400
systemic therapy to seek and destroy microscopic deposits, that's so-called adjuvant therapy.

1394
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:10,920
So with that jargon stated, adjuvant use of HER2 antibody, this was the first example of this is

1395
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:16,280
why I'm giving it its due credit, cures patients, cures patients, you don't cure patients in the

1396
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:21,080
overt metastatic setting with HER2 antibody therapy like that's unheard of. So that was the first

1397
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,760
parallel and a common cancer that kills lots of women that this CML evolution concept.

1398
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,920
And I remember what the numbers were, because I sort of take it for granted today, you take two

1399
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:37,080
groups of women that have HER2 new positive tumors that are NED, meaning surgically

1400
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:41,480
resected down to having no evidence of disease as you described, half of them get a placebo,

1401
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:46,760
half of them get the antibody in 10 years, what percentage are alive in each group?

1402
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:50,040
Usually the way we think about it is like how many patients are saved, if you will,

1403
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:54,040
because it all depends on the level of risk of recurrence to start with.

1404
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,560
Yeah, so what's the AR and RR?

1405
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah, right, right. So whatever you start with, so it's depending on the trial,

1406
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:05,160
a third to a half of the recurrences that would have occurred don't happen by the addition.

1407
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:08,680
You're right to mention placebo, but by historical fact in this case, everybody got chemo.

1408
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:09,560
Everybody gets the same.

1409
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,240
Yeah, chemo plus minus, if you will. So the addition of the HER2 antibody or not.

1410
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:17,320
And this is how many subsequent studies and other cancer types have been done to try to show

1411
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:21,800
the same kind of benefit of treating only microscopic residual disease as opposed to

1412
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:27,240
overt metastatic disease. So a third to a half reduction in risk of relapse over long periods

1413
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:30,120
of time now and stably so in the case of HER2, we have lots of data.

1414
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:33,960
Do women take anti-HER2 new for life now in adjuvant or how many? It's five years?

1415
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:38,280
No, no, no. Hormonal therapy is the long duration therapy in the adjuvant setting.

1416
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:43,080
So hormonally driven breast cancers, you're now complicating this by attempt to make adjuvant

1417
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:48,200
therapy disease eradication sound simple. Hormonally driven cancers like breast cancer

1418
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:55,080
and prostate cancer in the so-called adjuvant setting, it is clear that the original data was

1419
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:58,360
a year of therapy, then three years of therapy, five years of therapy. It's clear even that 10

1420
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:03,560
years of therapy is better than five years of therapy in a population. And hormonal therapy

1421
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:08,280
prevents relapse at least to a third to half standard analogous to HER2.

1422
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:15,000
But when you see an effect like that in series of clinical trials where longer durations of therapy

1423
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,720
to treat covert metastatic disease, longer is better than shorter. It tells you you're not

1424
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:25,000
eradicating and everybody, you're suppressing in some people. And that's the story over and over

1425
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,160
again. And gastrointestinal stromal tumor, which was the first solid tumor, big targeted therapy

1426
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,720
success where imatinib was being repurposed for the fact that it's a C-kit inhibitor and C-kit is

1427
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:38,040
mutated in two thirds of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. That drug first showed benefit in

1428
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:42,920
metastatic patients, overt metastatic patients. Then in a series of adjuvant trials, one year,

1429
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:49,160
three years now ongoing therapy beyond that, incrementally better. Is there a reason to

1430
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:52,840
believe that some patients are being cured? Absolutely. But there's some patients where

1431
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,640
disease is just being suppressed and maintained in a micro metastatic state from which they will

1432
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:03,080
not die, at least in the foreseeable future. But this just goes to my point about, okay,

1433
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:09,320
is single agent targeted therapy, a tumor clearing treatment for very many cancer patients, even when

1434
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:15,640
we use optimal next generation early detection methodology, that is going to be realized in a

1435
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:20,520
real fraction of cancer patients. But we're still going to need combination regimens to dismantle

1436
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:25,800
tumors in their fully complex way. The BRAF example has already now played out. So melanoma,

1437
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:32,440
BRAF inhibitor monotherapy improved survival to the tune of a nine month improvement in overall

1438
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:36,040
survival, which in melanoma, which is median survival used to be six to nine months, or on

1439
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,720
average, six to nine months. So like getting a bump like that. You're basically doubling the

1440
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:43,880
survival of patients with metastatic melanoma, but not curing. Right. That was a big deal.

1441
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:48,840
Interestingly, BRAF inhibitor monotherapy was tried in an adjuvant trial, didn't meet its

1442
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:54,120
endpoint. So it apparently numerically reduced risk of recurrence, but marginally so and not

1443
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:59,160
enough to achieve statistical significance. So that trial was called negative. In parallel,

1444
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:04,840
I and others had been pushing hard in the metastatic setting to go from AZT to double it,

1445
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:09,720
what was the first doublet HIV regimen I'm blanking now, but in any case, a proteasome inhibitor.

1446
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:13,720
And so any case, in melanoma, we were treating with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy,

1447
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:17,880
we're seeing responses as a response that would last on average, six months as an aggressive

1448
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:22,120
disease. Again, patients would typically die within six months in the untreated state.

1449
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:27,800
So patients would respond and there's response would be maintained for a huge range of times,

1450
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:32,280
but the average was six months. We saw that basically the tumors were working their way

1451
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:37,320
right around the drug in the map kinase pathway. They were bypassing BRAF through CRF. Most

1452
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:42,200
commonly, that was the easiest trick for them to use. They didn't need to develop mutations that

1453
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:48,360
resisted the drug itself, which is a theme in PCR able CML and other oncogene driven tumors

1454
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:52,360
that are treated effectively with targeted therapy, infusion driven cancers in particular,

1455
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:57,480
remember those genetically simple tumors, a very, very common theme is they need to mutate

1456
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:01,160
the actual gene that's being targeted because they need that thing back on. They don't have

1457
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:06,120
very many tools in the toolkit, they need that guy back on. And the only way they can evolve

1458
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:11,080
resistance is to basically repel the drug in the first place, those are so called gatekeeper

1459
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:16,760
mutations. So in BRAF, mutant cancer, BRAF, mutant melanoma, you don't see those mutations

1460
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:22,440
emerge because it's too easy for these cells to rewire their way past BRAF through CRF.

1461
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:28,120
So we saw this happening in humans. So yes, in parallel and laboratory systems, but more

1462
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:32,920
importantly, we're seeing it in humans within the same year that we first documented responses in

1463
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:37,800
those patients, because we were biopsying them serially for research purposes, which was then

1464
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:43,800
thought to be a crazy concept. But now it's not so crazy. In any case, we saw this bypass happening,

1465
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:49,400
we knew that there were available inhibitors of downstream MEK, MEK, the guy that BRAF turns on,

1466
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:55,000
those drugs already existed, they weren't shown to be useful on their own yet. Anywhere in cancer,

1467
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:00,520
there were signs of life here and there in clinical trials. But MEK is right below BRAF and

1468
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:05,240
CRF. And we said, let's just put these two together, try to intercept this bypass that worked,

1469
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:09,880
like we went very quickly from BRAF and a bit of monotherapy to BRAF, MEK combination therapy,

1470
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:14,520
including overall survival improvements that were as big as the overall survival improvement,

1471
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:17,960
BRAF and a bit of monotherapy. I'm fast forwarding through my entire career here.

1472
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:23,320
Any case, BRAF, MEK combination in the adjuvant setting prevents relapse by 50% and patients

1473
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:30,200
receive a urotherapy stop treatment. And there's a persistent gap there in terms of cured patients.

1474
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,480
This is melanoma we're talking about melanoma that will work its way around BRAF and a bit of

1475
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:39,080
monotherapy. And on average, six months, you can wipe it out in the covert metastatic state,

1476
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:43,960
microscopic residual disease, aka adjuvant therapy with that same regimen. So the point is,

1477
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:50,440
there is some real kind of early detection, early treatment theme that is absolutely yet to be fully

1478
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:54,680
leveraged and realized because we're still working on the early detection technology,

1479
02:02:54,680 --> 02:03:01,240
blood based mostly, but it's coming. And then adjacent to that, even in some cases,

1480
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:05,240
when we find cancers very early, they are already genetically complex. We have to have

1481
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:11,480
a toolkit that allows us to dismantle at more than one point. And that's its own long conversation,

1482
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:17,080
but the issue of adjacent to AZT, what does that armamentarium look like in terms of the next

1483
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:23,480
agents? Right, because with HIV, we think of it by class of drug, you basically have a toolkit

1484
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:28,920
of drug classes. And it seems to me that you've done a very eloquent job explaining this.

1485
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:36,840
There are basically some fundamental pillars in growth and some fundamental pillars in protection.

1486
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:42,760
And when the day comes that we have a toolkit that knows, I've got these three things that can hit

1487
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:46,680
this pillar, three things that can hit that pillar, four things that hit this pillar,

1488
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:50,280
six things that hit this pillar, nothing that hits this pillar, and two things that hits it.

1489
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:54,760
I mean, you're in the golden zone when you can start stacking because that's what heart,

1490
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:59,080
highly active antiretroviral therapy did. It basically put whatever three or four pillars

1491
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:05,080
together. And at that point, HIV was not cured, but it was chronic. You didn't have to die. You

1492
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:09,880
didn't have to get AIDS. We can't keep hitting the same pillar and expect that we're going to

1493
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:15,160
cure cancer. So we got away with it in melanoma because we kept hitting the same pathway,

1494
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:19,160
got away with it by hitting it twice and improving outcomes and actually improving side effects,

1495
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:24,600
which is its own weird story, but really cool story. Biochemically, the bigger point just

1496
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:28,920
hitting some of the talking points that we touched on before is we need the activators of

1497
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:33,880
the immune system. We need the inhibitors of the activated oncogenes. We need the drugs that target

1498
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:39,880
these epigenetic regulators. We need the metabolic switch regulators, which are emerging, I would say

1499
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:45,080
just as we speak very early days. Epigenics and metabolism generally are the, what I point to to

1500
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:52,520
say that these are the pillars where the tools are coming, but it's early. And I generally make the

1501
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:58,920
point that if we just flush out those toolboxes and we're lacking still, some famous gaps would

1502
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:06,120
be understanding how to wrestle down telomerase. This is a clock that exists in cells that allows

1503
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:11,080
them to basically measure their age. Did you see the science paper last week? It was the science

1504
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:17,000
paper about the astronaut Kelly's time in space, the year in space. I read a lay article summary

1505
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,040
of it, but yeah, go ahead. It's interesting. So twin brother, right? I only bring this up because

1506
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:27,400
you mentioned telomerase. So the, I could be having this backwards. I think the telomeres of

1507
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:33,160
the astronaut that was in space elongated significantly during his year in space, but

1508
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:37,000
within three days back on earth, completely reverted to normal, which of course just made

1509
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:41,640
me question the importance of telomere length. It's an interesting point. So your pillars then,

1510
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,960
because I want to share with you my framework, which is purely a clinical framework. It's not

1511
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:51,160
a research framework. It's a, you're on the front lines. You're a primary care doctor. You're a

1512
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:57,240
patient. How do you think about cancer? Because while I think most patients, when you talk about

1513
02:05:57,240 --> 02:06:02,200
the big diseases, most people are afraid of Alzheimer's disease above all else because of

1514
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:07,880
the phenotype. But when you think about probabilistically, most people are afraid of cancer

1515
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:12,040
because the likelihood of getting it is somewhere between a third and a half, depending on your

1516
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:17,400
gender. So you said epigenetics, metabolism, immune, would those be your three fundamental

1517
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,600
pillars of cancer? Yeah. I mean, growth factor receptors, which again,

1518
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:24,360
within them. That was the original pillar because those are the first discoveries made,

1519
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:30,680
frankly, in cancer biology and cell signaling. But these others are clearly the other major

1520
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:34,760
pillars of normal cell programs that have to be co-opted by cancer for cancer. Yeah. So the

1521
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:40,520
epigenetic modulation, the immune stuff, the metabolic stuff, and of course the growth factors.

1522
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:47,160
So I usually tell patients, I think cancer is really hard. Like atherosclerosis is inevitable,

1523
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:51,960
but we also know so much about it, not everything, but we know enough about it and we have enough

1524
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:57,160
tools that, look, if you really want to be aggressive, you can delay it so that you're

1525
02:06:57,160 --> 02:07:01,160
not going to have your first heart attack till you're 100. That's doable. That's totally doable

1526
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:07,080
if you start early enough. I'll save my Cilla liquid on Alzheimer's disease, but I say, look,

1527
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:13,720
cancer is the hardest one. And it's the one that I think most about in the sense of it's the one

1528
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:18,920
that I am least confident at our ability to reduce risk in. So I say, look, here's my take on it.

1529
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:23,960
Step one, try not to get cancer. Sounds like a dumb thing to say, but we know a handful of things

1530
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:28,520
that are increasing our risk for cancer. So let's keep those to a minimum. Luckily, most people have

1531
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:33,480
figured on that smoking is not a good idea, but right behind it is insulin resistance and obesity.

1532
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:38,760
And so there's something about that probably down. So if smoking was probably acting more on the mass

1533
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:43,960
genetic level, something about insulin resistance was acting on this growth sort of pathway. Okay,

1534
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:49,800
so we could talk about all the things we can do to not get cancer. Step two, which again, creates a

1535
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:55,160
lot of enemies, especially depending on which side of the Twitter sphere you live on is let's look

1536
02:07:55,160 --> 02:08:01,720
for cancer early. If burden of disease matters, you can take the approach of women should never

1537
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:07,000
have a mammogram. Just if a lump shows up in your breast, go see your doctor, but otherwise don't do

1538
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,840
anything as one end of the spectrum. And then you've got coconuts like me on the other end of

1539
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:15,880
the spectrum that say, no, I understand why you might come to that conclusion if you're trying

1540
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:21,240
to do it at a cost basis. And if you're only limiting yourself to mammography, which has such

1541
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:26,360
horrible sensitivity and specificity, but if at least theoretically you could say, well, in a world

1542
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:33,240
where costs become less ridiculous, i.e. not in the United States, if you took it out of the equation

1543
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:38,040
and you were willing to layer mammography, which will always be important to catch a calcified

1544
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:44,520
lesion with diffusion-weighted imaging, MRI, as an even superior technology to ultrasound,

1545
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:51,480
coupled with molecular screening, well, you can make the case that no woman should ever present

1546
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:59,480
with breast cancer. And in that situation, can we do better? And then you talk about looking at

1547
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:05,240
therapies that would go after multiple pillars simultaneously, not in serial, not waiting for

1548
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:10,360
one to fail. And the other one, so that's my sort of Neanderthal approach to cancer. How would you

1549
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:16,040
make that more robust? Okay, so what we're missing is still components of the toolbox to be able to

1550
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:21,160
actually knock out pillars. So that's, I often say we still need to diversify our toolbox. Then it's

1551
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:27,080
the issue of marrying diagnostics with therapeutics. So understanding the assembly process of cancer

1552
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:33,240
in a patient-specific way and being able to deploy those therapies. That is an emerging hard task.

1553
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:39,720
I spend a lot of my academic time railing against the impediments that keep us from pushing drugs

1554
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:45,000
together in supervised settings, both experimentally and clinically in clinical trials. So this idea

1555
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,520
of getting to following the HIV example, we are chronically facing headwind in terms of getting

1556
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:56,040
there. Is that because HIV killed patients so much quicker and there was more desperation

1557
02:09:56,040 --> 02:10:03,000
that clinicians, IRBs were more willing to move quickly to stacked therapies? Yeah, we have all

1558
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,720
the same regulations. The HIV advocates created... It was the advocacy. Yeah, they've created

1559
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:12,680
regulations to cover life-threatening disease and cancer is captured right in that. We have an

1560
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:17,560
amazing forward-thinking regulatory environment in the United States and increasingly in Europe.

1561
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:22,920
Because of the lead blocking that was done by the HIV advocacy community, we have the same benefit.

1562
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:27,960
The heavy lifting on that front was done in the 80s and early 90s. Absolutely. I've spent tons of

1563
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:33,400
time exploring whether there are remaining impediments there, talking with FDA leadership

1564
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:38,840
in particular. I usually quickly sum up to say they are on our side. They are our friends. They

1565
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:43,640
have self-organized in a way that actually will be the accelerator, not decelerator progress.

1566
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:49,320
The problem, if I were to put a finger on it, is the way in which companies that decided they could

1567
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:53,560
see a business model in HIV and basically decided they were going to pursue it, could create the

1568
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:58,680
toolbox within their one company. Had it not been for that, we would not have seen doublet and

1569
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:04,120
triplet therapy. Is that purely a simplicity of therapy and therefore an economic issue?

1570
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:07,080
Precisely. It's simplicity of the organism that you're talking about. That's what I mean, yes.

1571
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:11,000
It's simplicity of the opponent. That's right. The number of enzymes that the thing has in its genome,

1572
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:16,040
you could then postulate as potential targets massively smaller. Within one umbrella of one

1573
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:21,960
company, you could see combination therapies. Even though Merck or Pfizer could have a program

1574
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:26,680
under each pillar, that's typically not the way it goes, is it? Here's how I generally draw up the

1575
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:33,720
math. 60% of drugs coming in the cancer pipeline now come from small biotech companies. It used to

1576
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:39,400
be that Big Pharma was the driver. The phrase I often use is that Big Pharma outsourced its R&D

1577
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:44,920
to risk taking venture backed, highly specialized small biotech companies, not just in cancer,

1578
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:49,400
but here I'm sticking with cancer. You've got this distribution of where drugs are coming from.

1579
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:55,080
That is a huge swath of different firms, many of which have a single asset in the small biotech

1580
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:59,720
space. Most they get to have two or three. What's the sweet spot for Big Pharma? Is between phase

1581
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:04,360
two and phase three or between phase one and phase two? If you exclude the big aha moments.

1582
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:08,200
If it's an aha moment, then it's phase two. That's the acquisition moment. If it's not,

1583
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:13,000
then it's randomized phase two slash phase three. Optimal moment, as you said, where's enough risk

1584
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
been taken off the table and where now you've got a commercialization opportunity, which is what

1585
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:22,760
Big Pharma is for us in oncology at least. Yes, there's still innovation incubation new therapies

1586
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:27,800
coming out of Big Pharma, but as I said, it's shrunk down to a small component. The basic science,

1587
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:33,880
as you well know, across all of public private domain is in the public sector, the basic science,

1588
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:37,720
the stuff where you can't guarantee any kind of return in terms of when you're going to get an

1589
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:42,360
insight that you could turn into a potential therapy. You've got this fantastic chaos of

1590
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:46,200
publicly funded biomedical research, the world's greatest bio. I was just about to say by scale,

1591
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:51,720
when you look at the public domain, everything from most of it, of course, being NIH, but also

1592
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:58,920
Howard Hughes and others, what percentage of the world's pure exploratory science is funded in the

1593
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:04,680
United States? 90%. It's that much of an advantage. Yeah, it's narrowing in Europe a bit with now

1594
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:09,000
central investment in cancer research in Europe. That number is dropping percent by percent.

1595
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,800
Truthfully, if you said 50, I would have still thought that was impressive.

1596
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,720
No, no, no. If half the world's basic exploratory research was happening.

1597
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:19,320
It's where the money is, the public investment in research and then add the private.

1598
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,400
Well, I'm adding the philanthropic in top of that, but yes.

1599
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:25,480
Yeah. Well, we live in a philanthropic environment that's not known in much of the world, so that is

1600
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:32,040
a meaningful additional layer. No, a huge, huge, huge engine here is the public domain. Those

1601
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:37,560
discoveries then are out licensed to small firms over large firms by a huge margin. Of course,

1602
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:44,280
I here live in one of the, well, not one of, the world's biggest biomedical research engine vis-a-vis

1603
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:49,880
taking those discoveries into small firms and the Bay Area for sure and New York and San Diego are

1604
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:54,200
the kind of other major pillars of that. But so you have these hubs of activity of taking new

1605
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:57,800
discoveries, some of which come from outside the United States even, but then are incubated into

1606
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:03,800
companies. What I'm describing here is this very dynamic, very exciting, very purpose-driven,

1607
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:10,040
expertise-heavy biotech sector, which is great for so many reasons, but I'm bringing it up

1608
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:15,560
as a complaint, even though I personally have benefited from the ability to step into

1609
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:19,400
entrepreneurial roles and co-found companies and so on and so forth. That's been enormously

1610
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:24,920
gratifying for so many reasons. I registered as a complaint because it's distributed our toolbox

1611
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:31,960
so widely and we live in a world right now where 0.37 of rational combinations of two cancer

1612
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:35,480
therapeutics that are still in investigational territory are finding each other in clinical

1613
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:41,000
trials. I published a paper on this topic a year and a half ago. It is a terrible sampling,

1614
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,720
mingling rate, terrible. So we make new discoveries all the time in the academic domain that would

1615
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:50,040
suggest a new combination. You've got patients dying every day of that addressable cancer

1616
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:55,480
by molecular subtype or whatever. The likelihood that you're going to be able to launch a clinical

1617
02:14:55,480 --> 02:15:00,840
trial to marry those two drugs when they exist in two firms is that small. That is a terrible

1618
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:06,040
problem. HIV didn't have that problem, but because of the complexity of human cells and therefore

1619
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:12,280
human cancer cells, the toolbox is being chaotically distributed. We need a way to change that and we

1620
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:17,240
need a way for drugs to be able to be married in life-threatening cancer in a rapid, rapid fashion.

1621
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:21,960
So it's not an inertia problem in the culture. It's not doctors. It's not patients. It's not

1622
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:26,280
academic medical centers. It's not the regulatory environment. It's not. It's a shame because some

1623
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:30,600
of those are a heck of a lot easier to solve. You'd think this is the least rocket science thing

1624
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:35,160
that I've put my shoulder into the past number of years now, novel, novel cancer therapeutic

1625
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:40,840
investigation, but it's the hardest to change. To me, there's an obviousness in terms of focusing on

1626
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:47,640
this problem, but the obviousness in the entire ecosystem in terms of actually getting alignment

1627
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:54,280
and incentives aligned to allow this dabbling to happen is a major, major impediment. I've been

1628
02:15:54,280 --> 02:16:00,040
making the point that I think we need quadruplet therapy to dismantle most complex cancers,

1629
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:04,520
if early detection is only going to get us so far. And ideally across four pillars. Yes,

1630
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:08,040
exactly. And different ones, right? So going back to the PPE-3- You have a huge,

1631
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:12,280
competent, right. You might want to always be targeting tumor suppressors, but that's not one

1632
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:16,040
drug. That's right. That's up and down the chain. Right. And unique to certain patients' tumor

1633
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:21,720
infections. Now on the two suppressor side, does CRISPR offer any role? Because if you fix a tumor

1634
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:28,200
suppressor gene, that seems more beneficial than just fixing oncogene. This is gene therapy. You

1635
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,640
need to be able to deliver that to every last cancer cell. And how in the world do we do that?

1636
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:36,680
Is there a virus that can do this? No, no, not currently. And in the beginning of my career,

1637
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:41,080
because if I've communicated nothing in talking with you, I am an optimist, the beginning of my

1638
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:45,960
career, I absolutely thought like this is on one hand, we have these things that we need to inhibit.

1639
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:50,200
And on the other hand, thank God we're going to have gene therapy. 20 years later, we still don't

1640
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,560
have gene therapy. We have gene therapy that can correct. If you need only a little- Where you

1641
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:59,640
look at Penn when Jesse- I got there right after. So I was still at the Brigham at the time when I

1642
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:04,120
was postulating the gene therapy was going to help us on the tumor suppressor side. And yet, friends

1643
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:09,880
of mine who were in the lab doing work on genetic delivery methods were saying, no, no, we're not

1644
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:14,360
there. These adenoviruses are getting wiped out. You can't get persistent expression. Hemophilia

1645
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:18,440
then to a degree now was kind of paradigm case where people were saying, well, we just need to

1646
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:22,760
get these clotting factors expressed to a little degree in a small fraction of cells and we'll be

1647
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:26,920
okay. As people were trying to just climb that hill, I was like, well, that's not the cancer

1648
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:31,400
hill. The cancer hill is every single cell widely distributed. And some of these cells are dormant.

1649
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:36,280
These micromets, they've lodged in distant sites and they are truly quiescent dormant cells. How

1650
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:41,240
are you going to get integration into that cell? So it's a major, major problem. So I don't see that

1651
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:47,240
trick coming in the foreseeable future. So I don't focus on it. I do think we can understand the

1652
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:53,320
pillars up and down, as you said, and knock them out in ways that potentially at least turn off

1653
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:56,840
what's turned on as a consequence. I mean, this is a thing about tumors of breast or genes that are

1654
02:17:56,840 --> 02:18:01,800
eliminated is that you can always find a downstream thing that's turned on as a consequence. So the

1655
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:06,920
issue is, can you find that point of drugability intervention to counter that? So that's at least

1656
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:10,920
until I retire. I think that's going to be the relevant approach. You've alluded to it already,

1657
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:15,640
but are you pretty bullish on liquid biopsies? For sure. There's several reasons why the early

1658
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:19,320
detection piece, I think we've touched a little bit on. Let's tell folks what they are. I use the

1659
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:25,960
term from time to time. Right. So tumor cells, a primary tumor, let's go with the notion that we

1660
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:30,040
could have knowledge that there is no microscopic metastatic disease. It's just a primary tumor.

1661
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:35,880
You have a tumor in your colon. You have an adenocarcinoma in your colon and we know that

1662
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:43,000
it's nowhere else. And that thing will shed its genetic contents. DNA and RNA, which mutated genes

1663
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:48,280
will have their mutated RNA versions. You have mutated DNA and RNA detection opportunities,

1664
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:54,520
if you will. So DNA is shed, we think, from lots of cell types, but definitely cancer cells seem

1665
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:59,240
to disproportionately shed their DNA, which has chewed up a bit as it circulates in the blood,

1666
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:04,200
but you can find it. And with higher and higher resolution technologies, if you find a single

1667
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:09,480
copy even and can amplify that up and detect it as a signal, since we know what the genetic map

1668
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:15,160
is of all cancer, we can have those probes reasonably well in hand. And a lot of acceleration

1669
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:19,960
has happened in this space the past just few years now. I'll come back to my complaint on the

1670
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:23,640
impediment side when it comes to reimbursement of diagnostic tests, because that's the problem I

1671
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:27,720
think we face there in reality. But from a public good perspective and from a science perspective.

1672
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:32,920
I mean, I'm just curious right now from a purely, like I'm thinking about this through the lens of

1673
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:37,480
cancer screening at the population level. And again, I'm always trying to make the problem

1674
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:41,800
simpler by taking away one constraint, which is cost. Because in the short term, I think you have

1675
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:47,640
to start, if you try to solve this problem at a quality adjusted life year perspective, one,

1676
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:51,720
you're inserting your morality into the discussion, and two, I don't know what the number is, and it's

1677
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:56,680
too hard. So let's make the problem simpler. All we're doing is trying to reduce the risk of physical

1678
02:19:56,680 --> 02:20:02,840
harm to a patient and psychological harm through false positives. If you could layer liquid biopsy

1679
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:08,760
on top of diffusion weighted imaging MRI, the best colonoscopy, the best mammography,

1680
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:13,560
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, I mean, you can theoretically construct a point where you can catch

1681
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:19,400
every cancer prior to its clinical presentation. Yeah, let's just go with breast colon, prostate,

1682
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:24,360
and lungs, since that's 80% of solid tumor cancer deaths. So that would be a good goal just to go

1683
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:30,760
after those. So the challenges are, so again, the DNA is shed. Do we have a sense of how big a tumor

1684
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:34,840
needs to be to even start shedding? It has not been well mapped out, but certainly less than a

1685
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:39,400
centimeter. And this, you mentioned centimeter before, is radiographically findable and so on,

1686
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:45,240
nodule. So if you go map out cure rates with surgery alone across common cancers, breast,

1687
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:51,240
colon, prostate, and lung, at centimeter. Right, at centimeter below, the exceptions are few. I mean,

1688
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:56,120
pancreatic would still be one of the few where even sub centimeter, your odds of survival are less

1689
02:20:56,120 --> 02:21:00,040
than 50-50. No, no, it happens to be measured in literally one millimeter increments. So huge

1690
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:04,360
metastatic potential, but in any case, we have other strategies for that superficial tumor to

1691
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:08,760
find it early. But in any case, so coming back to your point. I see your point, which is if you

1692
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:14,760
could decide no one ever shows up with a tumor bigger than one centimeter, potentially doubled

1693
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:20,120
cancer survival, right? So those guys are definitely shedding. So it should be detectable. If we need

1694
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:26,200
to use microvascular exosomes, which have RNA and some DNA in them as a way of being able to find

1695
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:31,720
scarce entities, these mutated gene products that are now in this case, in the case of exosomes,

1696
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:35,960
why they're being transmitted around the body, we don't know, but it happens. Not just tumors,

1697
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:41,400
of course, normal cells do this too. So circulating tumor DNA, exosome or microvescal packages of

1698
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:46,840
nucleotides, these opportunities for detection as well as circulating tumor cells, but circulating

1699
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:50,920
tumor cells are based on available technologies. They're the hardest defined in a patient who has

1700
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:56,200
a one centimeter tumor nodule using that as a threshold. So already it's in sight that we're

1701
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:01,480
going to have a high resolution methods for shed DNA and probably the same for exosomes

1702
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:06,440
and circulating tumor cells, I think could get there. The issue to come back to your framing here

1703
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:13,080
of like false positives and anxiety provoking and so on. Remember, p53 mutations, 50% of cancer,

1704
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:18,200
finding a p52 mutation in blood, what does that tell you? A, you might have cancer, you may not

1705
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:22,840
have cancer, and where is it? What part of the body is it coming from? Well, 53, 50% of cancer,

1706
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:27,320
it could be virtually anywhere. Yeah, so how much of the effort in the liquid biopsy is going to be

1707
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:31,720
histology specific? Exactly. This is where circulating tumor cells would be the favored

1708
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:35,960
approach. The DNA will not offer tissue specificity. You can get the whole fingerprint out of a

1709
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:40,440
circulating tumor cell and know exactly what the entity is that you're hunting for now in terms of

1710
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:45,640
organ type. And so you just survey that one organ with every imaging methodology yet to come. So

1711
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:51,880
there's reason to be hopeful there going from CTCs forward. What's really cool in the circulating

1712
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:58,520
tumor DNA and exosomal RNA field is lineage mapping. So it turns out basically that the

1713
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:05,320
genetic group plan when it's folded up in a colorectal villus cell of the colon, the epigenetic

1714
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:10,040
alterations that occur in that cell are characteristic. So you can fingerprint

1715
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:15,080
cell of origin by looking at epigenetic marks. This is a realization that's now being ported

1716
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:22,280
into the blood detection world, so that you can actually map where did that fragment of DNA or

1717
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:26,760
RNA come from. So this is work in progress as we speak, there's an ongoing collaboration between

1718
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,720
our group and the Broden student MIT on this topic, but I know of other groups are in this space.

1719
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:36,760
So there's a convergence of sort of cell of origin fingerprinting with genetic detection

1720
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:41,640
methodology that you could you could readily see how we could get there in the foreseeable future,

1721
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:46,120
this idea of being able to say, okay, our imaging it still isn't picking it up, but we know that

1722
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:51,000
you've got a breast cancer brewing and now and in some cancers, for example, if you took a woman

1723
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:56,280
that was high risk to begin with, and now you had DNA proof that she had cancer, I suspect there

1724
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:00,040
are some women who would actually just say without additional imaging, I might be willing to just

1725
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:03,960
undergo a mastectomy or a guy would say, look, I'm willing to undergo a prostatectomy or whatever.

1726
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:09,320
Now it gets harder with lung cancer. You can't have just bilateral lobectomies all day long,

1727
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:12,840
or pancreatic even, but that's a step in the right direction. Because as you said,

1728
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:16,840
maybe at that point, we could justify even at the societal level, because certainly at the

1729
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:20,200
individual level, you'll do anything. But at the societal level, we'd say, look,

1730
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:25,400
once you have that DNA test that points to that tissue, we're going all out on scrutinizing tissue.

1731
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:29,960
And your first instinct is to think down a potential upcoming surgical path. If not,

1732
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:33,480
if you can't see it now, you don't know where to cut, but eventually you will. But I'm actually,

1733
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:38,120
as a medical oncologist leaping to the systemic therapy concept, can we motivate an immune

1734
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:42,360
response against that thing when we know enough about its genetic fingerprint or an oncogene

1735
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:47,320
targeted therapy and monitor the response using the same method? So when you were talking about

1736
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:52,120
blood biopsy, a huge near term opportunity is to use it as a therapeutic monitoring tool to

1737
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:56,760
understand can you actually get people down to a minimal residual disease, no detectable

1738
02:24:57,400 --> 02:25:02,280
evidence anymore by this blood method? So yes, it's an early detection tool, but it's also

1739
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:06,360
a therapeutic monitoring tool. So you can take a patient, you don't know where their breast cancer

1740
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:10,440
is, but you don't wait for it to emerge. You attack it when it's still genetically simple

1741
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:14,920
and monitor that effect in blood. So you know when to stop treatment or you know when treatment's

1742
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:19,400
not proving effective and switch gears to something else because you've got a toolbox with

1743
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:24,040
different regimens in it. I want to switch gears for a minute. There's so many just sort of cancer

1744
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:30,440
questions that I get asked all the time that I don't know the answer to. So I have at least

1745
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:37,320
two patients who I guess somewhat against my recommendation are adamant that stem cells,

1746
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:43,160
intravenous stem cell therapy has played an enormous role in the improvement of their health.

1747
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:47,880
One patient in particular, there's no denying that his symptoms improved dramatically with IV

1748
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:52,520
stem cell therapy and I don't want to represent that I have the hubris to suggest that it's not

1749
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:58,840
working. I just don't know. My bigger concern because putting the cost aside and the immediate

1750
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:05,640
risk like infections and sort of risks of the therapy which are non-trivial, of course the risk

1751
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:09,640
on the other side which is it's too successful in a sense and those stem cells acquire a life of

1752
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:13,320
their own. So is this something you spend much time thinking about? I've thought about it. I just

1753
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:19,000
think that if they're wild type stem cells, I think they'll follow the rules. So this whole

1754
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,680
discussion has been about cells that basically not through anthropomorphic spiritual means but by

1755
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:31,800
random genetic alteration basically are able to not follow the rules. I mean this is this revolution

1756
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:35,960
that happens inside of our bodies that is cancer. It's actually I usually use the term evolution.

1757
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:43,160
This is individual cells following the preservation and success, organismal success instincts that

1758
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:47,560
allowed us to crawl out of the swamp in the first place and become the complex organisms that we are

1759
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:54,040
this drive to continue evolving for selfish purpose. So using that mindset to come back to

1760
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:59,800
your question, I think a truly wild type stem cell will find its home and find its niche and its

1761
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:05,800
proper influences and behave accordingly is my assumption. Unless it were to become non-wild type

1762
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:10,360
through external manipulation outside the body when it's potentially fragile and capable of

1763
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:17,400
picking up aberrations that aren't corrected. But stem cells are notably hardy cells that can survive

1764
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:24,040
insults remarkably well and correct. So a cell that survives a genetic insult, a stem cell is

1765
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:29,400
particularly capable of detecting the damage, repairing the damage, taking its sweet time and

1766
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:34,920
doing so and not spawning daughter cells until it's got its house back in order. So it's p53

1767
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:40,760
detection program and DNA repair machinery is particularly robust. So this is why when people

1768
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:45,720
talk about cancer stem cells notably, which no one would want those cancer stem cells are thought to

1769
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:51,000
be kind of the worst of the worst. They're these primordial cells in the cancer cell population

1770
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:57,000
within a given tumor that have found their way back in development towards a stem cell. And in

1771
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:03,560
doing so have adopted these really hardy skills survival skills. No, they can't proliferate and

1772
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:08,360
divide very quickly. So they don't have that, but they can survive almost anything. Whereas the

1773
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:13,640
avant-garde highly proliferative, very dynamic population that will multiply and actually be the

1774
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:17,960
life threatening leading edge of a cancer, those things are more vulnerable. So actually, if you

1775
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:23,800
look at what chemotherapy has done for us, it's fairly conventional chemotherapy. It's fairly

1776
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:29,640
clear that actually what it can do is it can prune this highly proliferative avant-garde population

1777
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:34,440
leaving behind this more quote unquote stem cell like pool. And there's a whole field. It's a

1778
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:40,120
contentious field to a degree in cancer biology slash therapeutics of how much true stem cell

1779
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:43,960
biology really exists there. But you brought it up more from the perspective of whether

1780
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:49,160
stem cells themselves could go rogue. And I would say unless they're perturbed in some significant

1781
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:53,080
and ultimately genetic way, I don't see how. Now let's talk about another fundamental cancer

1782
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:57,640
question that serves no real purpose other than unless there's some clinical application of

1783
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:05,800
prevention, I suppose. It's impossible to deny the age related association between age and cancer.

1784
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:11,800
Certainly kids can get cancer, but for the most part, cancer rates rise monotonically until the

1785
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:15,080
ninth decade or so. I mean, there's a bimodal distribution because you've got the childhood

1786
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:21,960
cancers. If you're 50 versus 60 versus 70, you leapfrog up in risk, right? Almost exponentially,

1787
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:27,720
or at least quadratically. It's not just linear. Consider two hypotheses. One is as we get older,

1788
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:35,400
our genome is more susceptible to injury. Consider three. Two, as we get older and we've accumulated

1789
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:42,280
more of these, the probability that they can start to layer and stack and you get the phenotype

1790
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:51,160
that's not advantaged. Three, the immune system loses some of its steam and therefore the radar

1791
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:58,040
window in which you can detect cancer narrows basically, or the ability to detect all of the

1792
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:03,240
above, one of the above. All of the above. You've just described very nicely what I call the

1793
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:09,480
inevitability of cancer. We've got too many stochastic events accumulating and surveillance

1794
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:14,760
systems that are breaking down. DNA damage repair and immunologic. Those are the two fundamental,

1795
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:22,920
most important components. If you're allowed to go one log shift in mutation burden per cell

1796
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:27,160
and the immune system not see it and not clear it, that's it. I mean, there's no human that-

1797
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:28,600
There's no immune system that's going to-

1798
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:33,160
That's going to overcome that. When I say inevitability, you connect the dots in terms

1799
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:39,160
of the per decade acceleration and appearance of cancers across the population. I oftentimes say,

1800
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:43,880
if we all live to 130, we all have a cancer, quote unquote, real cancer. Let's not get hung up on

1801
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:49,080
benign growths that aren't cancerous. The definition of cancer for a totally lay person

1802
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:53,480
who doesn't think about cancer much is ability to travel and actually wreak havoc and kill.

1803
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:59,240
Yes, glioblastoma kills in its local site, but benign tumors, which are almost cancers. Yes,

1804
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:02,520
those happen broadly across the population. There's autopsy studies that show at least

1805
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:08,840
50% of people die with at least a benign tumor. Almost getting there, sure, that happens already,

1806
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:14,680
but I'm talking about fully getting there, a full blown and will be eventually life-threatening

1807
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:19,720
cancer will. It's interesting. Actuarially, by your 10th decade, your risk of cancer starts

1808
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:25,240
to go down. Although, and I discuss this with my patients a lot, my explanation for that is that

1809
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:31,160
atherosclerosis ratchets up faster than cancer. It's not that cancer is going down, it's that heart

1810
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:36,680
disease is dominating. I say the same thing to patients that you do, which is whenever I get

1811
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:42,280
asked these questions that frankly annoy me, which is like, aren't we just going to figure out a way

1812
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:48,520
to all live to be 200 one day? I'm like, no, what are you talking about? You have to figure out a

1813
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:54,680
way to prevent age-related disease. And yes, there's lots of cool ideas and oh, what if you

1814
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:59,640
could just maintain telomere length is like one I love hearing. And it's like, that's totally

1815
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:05,720
irrelevant because even if there were some benefit that came from that, you have to thwart

1816
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:10,520
atherosclerosis and cancer. Yeah. You don't want a proto cancer cell to be getting more telomere.

1817
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:15,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not even with your stem cell comment. That's not a fix all by any stretch.

1818
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:20,120
No, you're right. These are intersecting risk issues. So you're right that this competing risk

1819
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:24,520
issue makes it look as though if you make it long enough and you don't have cancer,

1820
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:29,320
then you're just not cancer prone. It's a bad problem to have when your risk of atherosclerosis

1821
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:34,280
is so dominant over your cancer risk. Now, one last thing I want to talk about is melanoma. And

1822
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:38,600
again, I don't actually know, I haven't written anything you've read on the topic we're about to

1823
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:41,640
discuss. So feel free to just dismiss it out of hand and say, I don't pay attention to that

1824
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:47,160
literature at all. But have you been following any of the vitamin D melanoma sun exposure

1825
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:53,960
discussion lately? Yeah, sure. Okay, so I'll do my best to give a relatively brief synopsis and

1826
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:58,440
then feel free to just correct it because I'm pretty sure I'm bastardizing it. There's not a

1827
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:04,840
huge body of dissent to the notion that sun exposure increases the risk of melanoma. We know that.

1828
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:09,240
Not linear, but there's no question that there's an association there. Okay, so we won't call it,

1829
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:13,960
it's not an axiomatic statement, but it's the evidence that sun exposure and melanoma are

1830
02:33:13,960 --> 02:33:21,160
associated in a causal way from sun to melanoma is strong. Okay. We also know that sun exposure

1831
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:28,760
increases the de novo synthesis of vitamin D in the human body. We know that from an association

1832
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:35,080
perspective, higher levels of vitamin D port with good things happening and low levels of vitamin D

1833
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:40,040
port with bad things happening. This has led people to suggest that we should be supplementing

1834
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:45,880
with vitamin D because yes, you can get it by being out in the sun, but the risk of melanoma

1835
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:51,240
is going up, but we can just take it. It's a fat soluble vitamin. It's easy to administer. You can

1836
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:56,600
clearly achieve levels in the plasma that mirror that of the sun. That should solve the problems.

1837
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:02,440
So many doctors, myself included, have historically normalized patients vitamin D levels. Now, again,

1838
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:05,560
there's a whole spectrum in there. There's a bunch of weirdos that think you have to have

1839
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:09,880
super normal levels, but most of us walk around thinking, God, if somebody shows up in the vitamin

1840
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:15,880
D level is 20, we want it to be 40 or 50 or 60. The problem is these clinical trials, these pesky

1841
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:21,080
little things keep showing up demonstrating that supplemental vitamin D doesn't really seem to help

1842
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:27,000
that much. And I've scrutinized many of these trials and I can poke holes in all of them, but

1843
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:33,320
the body of evidence is becoming hard to ignore. So any one of these trials, I can say, look,

1844
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:39,400
they didn't use enough vitamin D or they didn't look long enough or they didn't have the right

1845
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:44,680
patient population or, but when you have, I don't know what X is, but when you have X studies that

1846
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:47,880
are basically all saying the same thing, which is give everybody vitamin D, it doesn't seem to matter.

1847
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:52,680
Now there's exceptions. You know, JAMA had a paper a week ago about supplemental vitamin D in patients

1848
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:55,960
with colon cancer and it actually seemed to be a legitimate benefit. I'd love to hear your thoughts

1849
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:59,880
on that. Where did this leave us all? This left us all, I don't know, for many of us, about six

1850
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:06,360
months ago, there was a huge blitzkrieg of just nonstop information being put out about this that

1851
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:11,880
came to the suggestion as follows. The vitamin D that you take supplementally ain't fixing the

1852
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:17,080
problem. The vitamin D that's getting fixed in the sun is a proxy for things that are happening good

1853
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:25,160
in the sun. So it's sort of like saying gray hair is a proxy of aging, dying your hair black or blonde,

1854
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:33,320
isn't fixing your aging. So get out in the sun and oh by the way, yes your risk of melanoma will

1855
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:39,080
go up slightly. We're not denying that, but it goes up at one eighth, I believe is the number,

1856
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:46,280
your rate of decline of all of these other cardio metabolic diseases. So should we or should we not

1857
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:51,320
take vitamin D? Question one or more importantly, I think for you question two, given that you're

1858
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:56,280
one of the world's experts on melanoma, would you advocate we spend more time in the sun as a way

1859
02:35:56,280 --> 02:36:02,200
to get our vitamin D? No, I don't go that far. Recognizing all of the cross currents in data,

1860
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:08,200
I thought where you were going to finish up, which is what you just said to say exercise, exercise,

1861
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:14,840
and yet again exercise. Okay, are there people currently who exercise a ton, get a lot of

1862
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:20,280
cardiovascular benefit from that and do all that indoors? Yeah, that exists. So shouldn't we be

1863
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:24,120
able to pick that up in the data? No, I don't think this is a classic example of a confounder.

1864
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:28,840
I don't think that's extricated from the data. What I'm hearing you say is you think that the

1865
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:33,400
huge confounder is all these people outside are exercising. That's what's been giving them the

1866
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:37,880
benefit. It's not the sun per se or the vitamin D per se. I'm going with the vitamin D being

1867
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:43,560
beneficial. I'm going to come back to a reinforcing element of that argument, at least as I see it in

1868
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:47,800
scientific evidence. What I'm getting at is that the most powerful benefit, you said good things

1869
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:51,480
are happening in the sun, or I think I'm paraphrasing what you said. And what I'm saying is

1870
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:55,960
that good thing that's happening is exercise. I face this with my patients, melanoma survivors

1871
02:36:55,960 --> 02:37:01,960
all the time. I love to ride my bike. Yeah, I'm a swimmer. I'm a runner. Like this is what I love

1872
02:37:01,960 --> 02:37:07,160
to do. Is that okay? I've had a melanoma diagnosis. I have a 10% lifelong risk of developing a new

1873
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:13,240
primary melanoma. So you Dr. Flority have told me, I want to minimize that. But this is how I get my

1874
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:19,320
exercise. This is the conversation we have. I say I get it. If I can talk you into a more sun safe

1875
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:24,760
version of exercise as an early morning slash evening running swimming tennis, I'm going to

1876
02:37:24,760 --> 02:37:28,840
try to talk you into that stay out of the sun in the middle of the day when when now you're pursuing

1877
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:33,080
the cardiovascular benefit of exercise, you're taking on more vitamin D that you need. And you're

1878
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:36,760
taking on an inordinate risk in terms of skin cancer risk. Obviously, other skin cancers are

1879
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:40,120
more common than melanoma, but not as life threatening. So we usually frame this discussion

1880
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:44,520
around global skin cancer risk, where it's more linear with squamous cell and basal cell

1881
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:49,080
the relationship between sun exposure and ln it's not as linear, but it's clearly causally related.

1882
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:54,200
So I synthesize all of the available evidence to say there's confounders in in the behaviors that

1883
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:59,880
relate to sun exposure. Vitamin D is still I think there's enough strength to say vitamin D,

1884
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:02,920
there's obviously strong associations, which is where you were starting with. I mean,

1885
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:07,480
the epidemiology regarding vitamin D levels and risk, colorectal cancer was one of the first to

1886
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:13,400
come, but then other cancers undeniably related to low vitamin D levels. So I think there is a

1887
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:17,320
causal relationship, I think you want to surf higher up on the vitamin D curve. The issue is

1888
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:22,920
how you get there. My synthesis is you exercise. And if your exercise means that you get a low

1889
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:28,360
enough UV exposure that you need supplementation, then supplement and that it's those until proven

1890
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:34,040
otherwise, it's those two factors that are why pure vitamin D supplementation alone is never

1891
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:39,160
going to do it in a population that where you're not controlling for their exercise.

1892
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:43,160
Now you're dealing with a highly motivated population, I think in general, so where they're

1893
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:47,560
inclined to be doing positive health behaviors. So they're probably already tackling the exercise

1894
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:51,960
piece. When you look at these studies, you're looking at a different population of people in

1895
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:56,920
my view. So let me just throw one little bit of science at you. It's a nature paper published by

1896
02:38:56,920 --> 02:39:01,080
my very close colleague at Mass General David Fisher, who's one of the preeminent melanoma

1897
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:08,280
biologists in the field. So he came across this link in terms of the addiction potential of sun

1898
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:13,160
exposure. And it comes from the fact that melanocortin, which is the, if you will, the

1899
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:18,120
growth factor from melanocytes in terms of their daily function as well as their development,

1900
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:25,000
comes from propion melanocortin produced in the anti-retuatory. And that basically a component

1901
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:30,200
of that gene product over this hormone is it's the pro hormone is cleaved into its hormones

1902
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:35,640
is endorphin. Endorphin is produced and released in addition to melanocortin, equal stoichiometric

1903
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:41,000
quantities. So it was that simple bit of endocrinology that led him to wonder, is there

1904
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:47,720
something about sun seeking behavior that's wired into us to try to get us to go out and get vitamin

1905
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:51,960
D exposure? You have to go back to evolutionary pressure times. Was there a reason why human

1906
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:57,400
beings would rather have not gone out and expose themselves to the sun because predatory risk,

1907
02:39:57,400 --> 02:40:04,200
presumably. So that's a cute argument, but the wiring is very clear. You can show that mice will

1908
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:09,800
basically prefer sun exposure, will go through narcotic like withdrawal when you deprive them

1909
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:15,720
of their sun exposure. So it's meeting the criteria of addiction, the way we would see it

1910
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:21,240
with cocaine, for example, in a mouse. Exactly. So it's of lower grade to a degree, but it's anyway,

1911
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:25,640
this fascinating initial paper in nature and couple follow on papers since then that kind

1912
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:30,920
of reinforces this kind of circuit. This idea that basically this is even in a lower species,

1913
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:36,280
like mice, you can even detect this sun seeking behavior that humans presumably have as well

1914
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,600
toward the end of getting vitamin D. So here's an argument to say, well, we're engineered to

1915
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:45,640
get out in the sun and there must be benefits from it. In the issue, I think that you posed is,

1916
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:50,120
how much of the benefit is vitamin D? Then the shakiness of that argument is that, well,

1917
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:53,800
you supplement vitamin D, you don't seem to get all of the benefit one would think.

1918
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:57,400
Anyway, what I'm getting at is that, no, no, I think it's this is a behavior

1919
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:03,400
that is maladapted for those who are going to live to be 60, 70, 80, 100 years old,

1920
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:08,680
not maladaptive for people who are going to live to be 30 and die from predatory death or whatever

1921
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:14,520
the issue back in evolution. Evolution would have placed absolutely zero pressure on preventing you

1922
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:20,040
from getting melanoma. That's right. So from a thought experiment perspective, if you could

1923
02:41:20,040 --> 02:41:26,600
exercise indoors, never see the sunlight except through your window and supplement vitamin D,

1924
02:41:26,600 --> 02:41:33,480
do you think you are doing as well health wise as someone who does not supplement vitamin D

1925
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:39,080
exercises outdoors and attains the same vitamin D level? That's my hypothesis. Those are the same.

1926
02:41:39,080 --> 02:41:43,720
Yeah. I look at all available evidence and each study as it comes out and I take that, I have that

1927
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:49,480
you put that filter on and I say, does this study contradict that hypothesis? So the idea that

1928
02:41:49,480 --> 02:41:55,400
there's some other magical component of UV exposure, presumably UV being that basically that

1929
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:59,640
there's some other magical property, I'd say we lack the evidence to support that.

1930
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:03,800
So I guess last thing I want to ask you about, because in many ways this interview, Keith,

1931
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:08,760
has been great because I think there are tons of scientists, scientists in training that I know

1932
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:12,760
enjoy this podcast. And I think you've offered incredible advice to people across different

1933
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:17,800
levels of that spectrum. In particular, those people reaching out who are in MD, PhD programs

1934
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:23,960
and they're trying to straddle, how do I balance research and clinical work? And though you are an

1935
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:29,080
MD, not an MD, PhD, from a functional standpoint, you are an MD, PhD. You are a clinician who

1936
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:34,520
predominantly does research. I want to ask you another question along that thread is you also do

1937
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:38,520
something that a lot of people haven't figured out how to do. And I'm curious as to what you've

1938
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:46,680
learned along the way, which is you have a very rigorous academic, completely stand alone,

1939
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:51,880
credentialed existence. And at the same time, you really understand industry. You've been a

1940
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:58,280
huge part of industry and you seem to run these two parallel tracks that virtually, I don't want

1941
02:42:58,280 --> 02:43:04,600
to say nobody, but most people really struggle to live on both sides of that. They usually tend to

1942
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:10,760
be very good at one and kind of mediocre at the other. I would add to that. I think people are

1943
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:17,320
cautious to believe that it would be a good idea to do it, that there'd be synergy in trying to live

1944
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:22,520
on both sides. That's been the lesson I've learned over the past, let's say six years anyway in

1945
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:27,960
earnest, which is that dates back to when I co-founded my first company of a series now of five

1946
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:33,480
and this year working on a couple more. Is that because of what you said at the outset, which is

1947
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:38,200
you were immediately focused on translational stuff. And if you were focused on basic science,

1948
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:42,120
for example, that synergy is a lot harder. I think that's because of where the intersection

1949
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:46,680
you set. I should back up and say that you can't do the work that I do and not interact with

1950
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:51,720
industry. So my entire career, the drugs come from industry. We do not live in a world yet

1951
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:56,600
where academic entities or the National Institutes of Health produce investigational agents, take

1952
02:43:56,600 --> 02:44:01,240
them through their measures and then make them widely available. That could happen. Actually,

1953
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:05,240
there's a part of me that has pushed and advocated for that day to come because I think it would help

1954
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:09,240
bend the cost curve in a major way. But park that one for a moment. That hasn't been the world I've

1955
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:15,560
operated in. I depend on pharma, which means big companies and biotechs to be aligned partners,

1956
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:20,840
at least for much of the time that we work together. The misalignment totally comes. And when it comes,

1957
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:28,040
we shake hands and part company. But my world has revolved around the fact that therapies come from

1958
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:34,040
companies, proto therapies, and then true therapies. Diagnostics kind of come from us and diagnostics

1959
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:39,000
are 50% of the equation. They're woefully undervalued. Yet a lot of our research and NIH

1960
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:43,560
funded research is about, quote unquote, biomarkers that are in their best form going to become

1961
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:48,760
diagnostics. I mean, this is the world's worst industry. I get that. But you can't direct a

1962
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:52,760
patient to therapy and use the phrase precision medicine without pairing it with the best

1963
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:57,240
diagnostics. So this isn't about diagnosing colon cancer. This is about diagnosing the molecular

1964
02:44:57,240 --> 02:45:01,720
type and what its therapeutic vulnerabilities are going to be. And that could be ex vivo functional

1965
02:45:01,720 --> 02:45:05,720
diagnostics, not just static. Shouldn't that just be absorbed into the therapeutic world?

1966
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:10,600
Right. Not just a cost borne by the therapeutic world, but also the development and deployment

1967
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:15,000
as well. And that's where it works. Companion diagnostics, quote unquote, are the success

1968
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:20,200
examples. It will still be the case that that therapy developing company marketed diagnostic

1969
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:24,040
and therapeutic world will make 10 cents off the diagnostic, a billion dollars off the therapeutic.

1970
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:29,320
But if that's what it took to get there, then they will do it. They will also give the test away

1971
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:33,720
rather than bothering with the 10 cents. They will say, well, we readily recognize that we can't

1972
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:38,360
protect this diagnostic space. Yes, we have IP in this very specific diagnostic method,

1973
02:45:38,360 --> 02:45:42,680
but we're going to get undercut by 10 to 100 others who are just going to come in and compete

1974
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:47,800
us. That's fine because we still own the therapy and especially in a regulated environment. If

1975
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:52,840
certain companion diagnostics only linked to that therapy, then the therapy developer still benefits.

1976
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:57,960
The problem that I faced in my career, this is now taking a little bit of a detour from your first

1977
02:45:57,960 --> 02:46:02,200
question. I'm going to come back to it. The problem that I face as an academic is the issue

1978
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:08,120
of alignment slash misalignment around diagnostic therapy pairs. If you get to market in a broad

1979
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:12,280
population that is not biomarker selected and you can get there, you know, you're treating some

1980
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:16,040
patients who aren't getting benefit from therapy. You've seen it in phase one slash two, you're

1981
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:20,440
still seeing it in phase three, but you're having enough of an effect and enough of a subpopulation

1982
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:26,040
that you're able to drive a result in an unselected population. If you can do that, that remains in the

1983
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:30,760
current environment, the best version of success there is. It decreases the degree of difficulty

1984
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:34,360
in terms of having two moving parts in your development plan, both a diagnostic and a

1985
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:38,520
therapeutic, and you get the broadest population. Admittedly, patients who aren't getting benefit

1986
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:41,880
from therapy aren't going to make a lot of money for you because in a cancer context,

1987
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:46,920
they're going to get two months of treatment and stop. But still broad population, broad use,

1988
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:50,280
a clinician doesn't have to think about doing more testing than they've already done.

1989
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:55,400
They just give this colon cancer patient the EGF or antibody go back to the mid 2000s.

1990
02:46:55,400 --> 02:47:00,760
When that was the reality, a light bulb went off over hundreds of people's heads saying

1991
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:05,800
downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor is Ras and colorectal cancer.

1992
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:12,520
Ras is mutated in a substantial fraction of patients. I bet that if you have a Ras mutation

1993
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:17,160
downstream of the receptor, that tumor is not going to care about having the receptor blocked

1994
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:22,920
with the antibody. Brief run through the lab confirmed that hypothesis, an attempt then to

1995
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:27,160
carve out the Ras mutant population from an approved epidermal growth factor receptor

1996
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:32,840
antibody was a ground war that took years and years. The number of constituents, first,

1997
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:38,440
the drug developer themselves and regulators joining them who stood in the way of the most

1998
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:43,400
obvious scientific hypothesis I've ever seen in my academic career. It was terrible. So this is what

1999
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:48,440
I'm getting in the misalignment is that basically if you do this too late and you're now carving

2000
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:53,000
out populations from an approved therapy disaster, because then you're relying on the

2001
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:59,640
diagnostic to be the tool, the business incentive generating tool to carve that population out and

2002
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:04,840
it doesn't exist. Now, if we had single payer healthcare and we had one ecosystem constituents

2003
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:09,320
talking about this, we could talk about the savings and not having patients get ineffective

2004
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:13,640
therapy and we could align on who takes ownership and responsibility, but that's not the world we

2005
02:48:13,640 --> 02:48:18,840
live in. So in the meantime, it's a mad panic as an academic to try to translate the science

2006
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:24,040
of medicine with a diagnostic and therapeutic pair prospectively. So you get there at the finish

2007
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:27,960
line with a heroically effective therapy that's benefiting 80 plus percent of patients. You're

2008
02:48:27,960 --> 02:48:33,800
always going to be wrong in some fraction, let's say, but you're almost nailing it in terms of

2009
02:48:33,800 --> 02:48:38,440
assigning patient and true precision medicine way. If you can do it prospectively, which is a mad

2010
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:43,320
panic because cancer drug development has moved more quickly in recent years, you've got to now

2011
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:48,280
develop that diagnostic, show that your biomarker positive biomarker negative population do and

2012
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:54,440
don't benefit to the satisfaction of FDA in time to then have that diagnostic lockdown ready to

2013
02:48:54,440 --> 02:49:00,280
roll with its approval supporting dataset. So this is a long winded way of saying that I've

2014
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:07,160
traveled this path enough times as a collaborator with industry and seen it go well and go poorly.

2015
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:12,440
I've also seen lots of decisions made in drug development in terms of compromises in chemistry,

2016
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:17,720
shortcuts that are driven by just artificial deadlines. Like, look, this program's got to

2017
02:49:17,720 --> 02:49:21,640
advance or we're going to kill it either in a young company with venture capital backing or in

2018
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:26,280
a big pharma company that says, we've got a huge pipeline. We've got teams competing against each

2019
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:30,040
other. We've got to win in this pipeline down to best candidates. So we're going to make some

2020
02:49:30,040 --> 02:49:35,880
decisions next quarter. So you show me what you've got in terms of chemistry advances towards your

2021
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:39,800
development candidate. And we're just going to make a decision. I don't care if you think you've

2022
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:43,800
in another quarter, you could do better. We're just drawing a line and making a deadline as the

2023
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:49,480
big company version, the venture investors draw different timelines in the small company context.

2024
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:55,640
I watched these things happen as an external collaborator for enough times and different

2025
02:49:55,640 --> 02:50:00,200
compromises in what I thought bad decisions being made to say, I think there's an opportunity here

2026
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:07,080
to do what I say the best of academic medical work can be, which is a lead by example, go into

2027
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:12,840
companies as a founder, meaning with an idea and try to do it the way that I think as the greatest

2028
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:16,600
integrity to the hypothesis that you're trying to test, not everything's going to work. That's not

2029
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:21,960
the point. It's just don't make decisions for the wrong reasons. Make them for the right reasons

2030
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:27,480
that the hypothesis is basically not held up and needs to be abandoned. You need to spend more time

2031
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:33,320
and optimization on the chemistry side. Your regulatory path needs to be innovative because

2032
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:37,640
turns out that next generation sequencing is or isn't being adopted in the way that you thought

2033
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:44,040
it would be. I'm touching on some real examples here. Being in the boardroom, being around the

2034
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:51,080
table, the smallest table where these decisions are made, I had no idea how satisfying that would be.

2035
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:56,600
Do I suggest it for everybody? Well, but I would suggest for everybody who cares about therapeutics

2036
02:50:56,600 --> 02:51:01,560
related research. Lab investigators, but particularly clinical investigators is

2037
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:07,720
you need to understand to the best of your ability how people's worlds turn. You really

2038
02:51:07,720 --> 02:51:13,320
need to develop that understanding. Otherwise, you cannot be an effective constituent. You can't be

2039
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:17,640
an advocate within your field for your current patients, for the future patients, next generation

2040
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:23,000
patients, patients worldwide who you're trying to advocate for. You can't do that if you don't

2041
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:29,240
understand what's constraining on the other side. That has been the lesson that I've learned.

2042
02:51:29,240 --> 02:51:34,520
The fact that I was approached and offered serially to take light bulb moments and park

2043
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:38,360
them into companies, I couldn't have seen that coming eight years ago. Clinical investigators

2044
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:42,680
didn't have those opportunities. Should they have those opportunities? Well, you can imagine from

2045
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:48,920
what I've just said, absolutely. This is to me, I've got mentees in my own group and mentees

2046
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:54,440
elsewhere in the country who I look at and say, oh, this field needs more people like you around

2047
02:51:54,440 --> 02:51:58,680
a board table. The thing that I've learned, and I hope that all of my co-board members,

2048
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:04,120
if they heard this, would understand how much I'm saying this with a lot of respect and even

2049
02:52:04,120 --> 02:52:09,480
affection. These are super bright people who have accomplished in multiple dimensions,

2050
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:15,400
but if they are not an MD or MD, PhD, or even straight PhD in biomedical research, let's say,

2051
02:52:15,400 --> 02:52:21,720
in cancer, there's a component that they don't see where if you're able to provide that as a

2052
02:52:21,720 --> 02:52:27,640
single person around a board of eight, that contribution can be disproportionate, not on

2053
02:52:27,640 --> 02:52:33,080
the financing side, not on domains that I'm not very clever about and certainly not very

2054
02:52:33,080 --> 02:52:37,880
experienced about. Learn to appreciate those things. This is a seat that is currently not

2055
02:52:37,880 --> 02:52:43,080
filled. I can only speak to cancer biomedical research in the private sector. This is a seat

2056
02:52:43,080 --> 02:52:48,920
that's not filled. It's empty. There have been board seats held for basic investigators

2057
02:52:48,920 --> 02:52:55,720
historically, but not the translational clinical investigator. To me, I think this is, I'm not

2058
02:52:55,800 --> 02:53:02,200
looking for more work, so this isn't at all about me, but I've seen that as cancer science has

2059
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:09,000
become so much more translational, the opportunity unfolded for me, and I think it would be a major

2060
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:15,480
benefit to the field for the private sector basically to engage more voices at the table

2061
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:21,160
of those who are involved in the truly applied science down to the patient level.

2062
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:26,200
You've got stakeholder representation in those discussions that includes the people who actually,

2063
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:32,440
in the case of cancer, hold the hand of a dying cancer patient, understand what the ramifications

2064
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:37,880
are of clinical trial decisions that are the most expedient path to approval versus the,

2065
02:53:37,880 --> 02:53:43,320
let's make this really stick and matter for patients. Doing this through scientific advisory

2066
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:48,680
boards, advisory boards, ad hoc consulting, which is the whole rest of my travels before I got into

2067
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:54,680
the entrepreneurial mode of actually launching companies, been there, done that. Those meetings

2068
02:53:54,680 --> 02:54:00,200
are held. They conclude, and life goes on. You don't have a fiduciary responsibility.

2069
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:05,080
That's exactly it. All of these companies, every single one of them, I mean, every company I've

2070
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:10,120
interacted with in biotech slash pharma, it will all say that they're trying to move the needle

2071
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:16,440
for patients, right? This is their stated goal, and I believe them. How do you do that if you

2072
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:22,040
don't have in the room exactly as you say, invested, responsible leaders of the company,

2073
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:27,640
in the case of the board, who actually have career long skin in that game? In retrospect,

2074
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:31,880
I don't get it, even though it wasn't there 10 years ago when I wouldn't have imagined that

2075
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:35,800
these doors would begin to open. Well, that's a great way to close this discussion, Keith.

2076
02:54:35,800 --> 02:54:41,000
I hadn't actually thought of it through the lens of the gap, the translational gap per se. Well,

2077
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:45,000
I want to thank you very much. You've been incredibly gracious with your time and even

2078
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,160
more gracious with your insights. This is an episode where I learned a lot along the way,

2079
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:52,280
which always makes it fun for me as well. Thank you very much.

2080
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:56,040
Well, I appreciate the opportunity. I wouldn't be able to talk this long

2081
02:54:56,040 --> 02:55:01,560
were it not for the fact that you're pulling out of me all the talking points that I've used in

2082
02:55:01,560 --> 02:55:06,440
different venues at different times, but in one conversation. I think this is an incredibly

2083
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:12,600
exciting time in terms of understanding the molecular underpinnings of health and disease.

2084
02:55:12,600 --> 02:55:17,560
Cancer is incredibly anxiety provoking. It's actually why I got into the field, to be honest,

2085
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:24,280
is the translating science of medicine and the most disproportionately havoc wreaking entity.

2086
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:30,040
And so I really appreciate opportunities, this being a really unique one, to try to help people

2087
02:55:30,040 --> 02:55:36,360
understand this seemingly impossible to understand entity that is this kind of revolution within our

2088
02:55:36,360 --> 02:55:42,360
bodies or betrayal within our bodies. But we'll get there. The pace is quickening of progress.

2089
02:55:42,360 --> 02:55:47,400
So I hope I've communicated that, but I hope you circle back to revisit this topic with others

2090
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:52,760
in the field because you will see year over year that the pace of progress will continue to advance.

2091
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:55,880
That'd be great. Or maybe I'll just come back to Boston once a year and

2092
02:55:55,880 --> 02:55:57,560
I'll always time it in the nice time of year.

2093
02:55:57,560 --> 02:55:58,120
Sounds great.

2094
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:58,680
All right. Thanks.
