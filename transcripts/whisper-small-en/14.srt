00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,920
at PeterAttiaMD.com.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,600
In this episode, I'll be speaking with my friend, Dr. Rob Lustig, who I suspect a good

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,080
number of you will have already heard of and certainly have been familiar with through

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,720
his pretty impressive presence on YouTube and his talk called Sugar, the Bitter Truth

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,240
that went viral, I believe in 2011.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
And that's about the time when I met Rob.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
Now this podcast kind of grew out of a really interesting discussion that I think I get

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
into in the podcast a little bit.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,480
But I think it was in 2016 when Rob and I were both invited to Hong Kong to speak at

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,560
the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference.

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,000
And we were on a panel together and it just so happened that we were in the same flight

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
back to San Francisco, which was not just a long flight, but more importantly, a flight

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
where you weren't going to be sleeping much.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,360
And Rob and I ended up huddling together over a laptop, going over some really interesting

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,440
data on NAFLD, which we'll get into in this podcast.

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,840
And I remember thinking like that just kind of left an impression in my mind, which was

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,840
God, this is the kind of discussion I really enjoy having with people like Rob because

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,480
it gets into the nuance and away from the headlines.

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,640
And obviously many years later, forward, fast forward to where we are now.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm starting the podcast.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,720
One of the first people I wanted to reach out to was Rob to have this discussion.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,320
Rob has very recently stepped down from his clinical responsibilities as a pediatric endocrinologist

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
at UCSF.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,720
However, he still has a very active presence in his research department.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,000
Rob holds a bachelor's degree from MIT.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
He got his MD from Cornell.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,160
And he also has a master's of studies in law from UC Hastings, something that he did probably

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,600
about four years ago as he began to realize that only one half of the equation in educating

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,240
people about sugar was going to come from the scientific standpoint.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,400
The other half was going to have to be policy related.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
In this episode, we talk about a lot of things, but among them we talk about why Rob believes

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,720
the food business has really pushed towards having more and more sugar in it and why these

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
have led to the epidemics of addiction, depression, et cetera.

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
He talks also about how you can combat that.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,360
And I think something that people miss in Rob's headlines is that he is not just talking

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
about avoiding sugar.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,600
He's also talking about the importance of fiber.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,720
And we actually get into a very nice discussion about the differences between soluble and

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,320
insoluble fiber and how it's actually not uncommon for people to load up too much through

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,960
processed foods on the soluble fibers, but they're not getting the full benefit without

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,240
having the insoluble, which is really stuff that's hard to get without looking towards

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,360
real foods, particularly vegetables.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,520
This was really a fun podcast.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,720
And I think that comes across in how often we unfortunately probably talk over each other.

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
So I apologize for that in advance.

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,160
This is also one of the first podcasts I record.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,080
But was still sort of and I'm still sort of learning the ropes of how to do this.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,480
Unfortunately, Rob had to go to I believe to a deposition that morning.

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,000
And so we had a really hard stop that didn't give us nearly as much time as I think we

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,280
would have spent on this topic.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,860
But I do suspect that Rob and I will talk again.

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,520
We also get into some of the really, I think, kind of practical stuff around what is it

63
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,480
like to be a parent when you're trying to balance the desire to let your kids be kind

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,440
of normal and deal with the convenience of not making every meal something that requires

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,240
a day of planning.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,000
But how do you prevent them at the other end of the extreme from sort of mainlining those

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
nasty caprisons and wheat thins and things like that?

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,760
So I think some practical advice there is helpful.

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,520
We do go really deep on fructose and there is some biochemistry in there.

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,200
It does get a little nerdy.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Rob can talk kind of fast and he really knows his stuff on this topic.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200
So he does not pull back from any of that terminology.

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,280
We're going to do our best to link in the show notes to some of the definitions and

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
some of the things in there that we get into that will give you a little bit of background.

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,320
We also get into liver function testing, something that I think many people take for granted when

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,260
they go to their doctor, but it becomes really important when you're trying to screen out

77
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,920
people who might have NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NASH, it's more progressed

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,080
sibling.

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,560
We talk about uric acid, we talk about metabolic syndrome, we just talk about a whole bunch

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,840
of things including we talk about heart rate variability near the end.

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,160
At the time Rob asked me a question I didn't know the answer to, we have since learned

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
the answer to that question because I was really intrigued by the discussion.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
For anybody who's interested in that little nuance on heart rate variability, we're going

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
to link to that as well.

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,000
You'll be able to find a lot more information about this, including information about Rob

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,560
himself and what he's doing and also just the stuff that we talk about at PeterAttiaMD.com

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
forward slash podcast.

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
Without further delay, here is my really interesting and intense discussion with Dr. Rob Lustig.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,280
All right, Rob.

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,520
Thank you so much for making time today to have this discussion.

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Oh, Peter, it is my pleasure.

92
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,440
We've known each other for I think about six or seven years now.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,640
What made me think about talking to you at this point in the podcast, which is to say

94
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,480
very early on, as I was thinking back to two years ago when we went to Hong Kong together,

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,840
and by sort of luck we ended up on the same flight back to San Francisco.

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
We were probably the two geekiest guys on the airplane because the lab-

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,720
You're the only ones not sleeping.

98
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Right, right.

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,400
Then the laptop came out and then it was all data, all flight.

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
It was awesome.

101
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,280
It's experiences like that that have made me think like a podcast can be a fun way to

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,320
reproduce some of those discussions that I often find myself having and then thinking,

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,800
God, I wish everybody could have heard that because I learned a lot during that time.

104
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,400
It's vice versa, by the way, and people wish they were flies on the wall.

105
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm happy to do this.

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
This is great.

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Awesome.

108
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, you've spoken so much and so eloquently about sugar and fructose, and certainly we're

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,080
going to talk about a lot of that stuff today, but I also want to talk about some things

110
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,640
that I think are a little less understood, for example, the impact of fructose on inflammation

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,960
and things like that.

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
Well, what data we have.

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
By the way, let me qualify.

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,040
While I do know a whole lot about sugar, fructose, metabolic disease, really my issue is processed

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,360
food.

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,400
Processed food has several things wrong with it.

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,440
Sugar being one of them, but lack of fiber being another.

118
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,880
I think that that is equally important, and I'm very willing to talk about that issue

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
as well.

120
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Perfect.

121
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's start with a very brief set of the semantics that I think it's important for people to

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
understand when they do confuse fructose and glucose.

123
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
They're both carbohydrates.

124
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
What's the difference?

125
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,680
Well, they're both monosaccharides.

126
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,120
Glucose is the energy of life.

127
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,000
Every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,320
Glucose is so important to functioning in all eukaryotic organisms.

129
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,880
Single cell versus multi-cell.

130
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,600
It doesn't matter.

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,220
It's so important that if you don't consume it, your body makes it.

132
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,120
It can make it from amino acids.

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,840
It can make it from fatty acids called gluconeogenesis.

134
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
Those amino acids or fatty acids will go to the liver.

135
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,920
The liver will metabolize those and produce glucose.

136
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,800
You can consume zero glucose, but you will still have a blood glucose level.

137
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,560
The Inuit.

138
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,260
They didn't have any carbohydrate.

139
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,920
They didn't have any place to grow a carbohydrate.

140
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
They had ice.

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,000
They had whale blubber.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,320
They still had a serum glucose level.

143
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,000
We knew that as early as 1928.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Glucose is super important, and I don't argue that.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,560
It's so important that your body has a fail-safe mechanism.

146
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,040
Glucose, however, is completely vestigial to all animal life.

147
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,320
It is a storage form of energy in plants.

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,680
Plants can utilize fructose for energy.

149
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,560
We have the capacity to metabolize a limited amount of fructose for energy.

150
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,220
Really, when you're consuming fructose, your gut bacteria are more adept, since they're

151
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,780
plants at being able to metabolize that fructose than you are.

152
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:07,020
When you're consuming fructose, yes, you'll absorb some, but for the most part, it's actually

153
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,700
more plant food than it is animal food.

154
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,140
In addition, there are some very specific biochemical differences between the two molecules.

155
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,580
Glucose is a six-membered ring.

156
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,700
Fructose is a five-membered ring.

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,580
That becomes important because both glucose and fructose and every monosaccharide exists

158
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,700
in two forms.

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,260
One's called the ring form, and the other one's called the linear form.

160
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,700
The linear form has the capacity to bind to proteins.

161
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,540
Called the Maillard reaction, it's what makes hemoglobin A1c in diabetics, also known as

162
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,740
the amadori rearrangement.

163
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,140
This is a biochemical process that occurs normally.

164
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,740
It is the Browning reaction.

165
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,580
It causes bananas to brown.

166
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,260
It causes humans to brown.

167
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:08,020
In fact, we're all Browning right now because our mitochondria in our cells are engaged

168
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,220
in the amadori rearrangement.

169
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,500
It is what makes people age.

170
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,340
It is the aging reaction.

171
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,500
I show a slide which shows newborn rib cartilage nice and white and 88-year-old rib cartilage

172
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
nice and brown.

173
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,900
We're all Browning.

174
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:31,860
You can roast your meat in an oven for 375 degrees for an hour, or you can roast your

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,180
meat at 98.6 degrees for 75 years.

176
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Ultimately, the answer is the same.

177
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
You brown.

178
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,140
Why do I bring this up?

179
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,740
Because glucose causes that Browning reaction at a relatively low rate.

180
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,420
Proctose makes that reaction occur at seven times faster rate.

181
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,020
This starts with this shift reaction, correct?

182
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,220
It forms a shift base.

183
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,160
It starts with, and it's non-enzymatic.

184
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,500
It happens just in a test tube with no enzymes needed.

185
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,740
You just put it in the sunlight.

186
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,240
It will happen.

187
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,040
What happens is that the aldehyde moiety of the glucose in the linear form will bind

188
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,520
to an epsilon amino group of lysine, which is at position one in hemoglobin, and form

189
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,160
a shift base, which then spontaneously decomposes to form a covalent linkage, which won't come

190
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,040
off and basically will stay there until that hemoglobin molecule is recycled by the spleen.

191
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,280
This is why you can measure glucose levels through hemoglobin A1c is because the higher

192
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,240
the glucose level in the blood, the more this reaction occurs.

193
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,640
Therefore, the higher the hemoglobin A1c.

194
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,800
Turns out fructose does it seven times faster.

195
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,640
Not only that, every time it happens, it's causing those proteins to become less flexible,

196
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,360
so less functional.

197
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,000
Every time it happens, it throws off a reactive oxygen species, an oxygen radical, a hydrogen

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,680
peroxide, which then can do damage unless it's quenched by an antioxidant.

199
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,200
In the face of antioxidant deficiency, which is called processed food, it can actually

200
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:23,840
cause inflammation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and many other problems related to the inflammatory

201
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,040
response.

202
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,960
Fructose does that seven times faster than glucose.

203
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,320
A third thing that is different is that when you put glucose in the stomach, your hunger

204
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
hormone called ghrelin goes down.

205
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
When you put fructose in the stomach, it doesn't change.

206
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
When you consume a lot of fructose, your brain doesn't know you've eaten, and so you end

207
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,880
up consuming more.

208
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,040
Lastly, glucose is metabolized in the brain.

209
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,780
The areas that basically metabolize glucose and give you a functional MRI signal are areas

210
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,580
that have to do with the sensory motor cortex for the most part and for the basal ganglia.

211
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:12,420
Fructose specifically lights up the reward center and has now been shown to induce the

212
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:19,740
same physiology in the brain that cocaine, heroin, nicotine, alcohol, any hedonic substance

213
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,580
also generates.

214
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,020
It is the reward signal.

215
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,140
In fact, we treat it as a reward signal.

216
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,820
It's called dessert.

217
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,420
Proctose and glucose are not the same.

218
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,340
The food industry would have you believe a calorie is a calorie, a sugar is a sugar,

219
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,720
you need sugar to live.

220
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,940
Those are all food industry mantras.

221
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,260
They're all out in the cybersphere and in the blogosphere.

222
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,660
It is absolute garbage.

223
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,180
They are quite different and it does matter.

224
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,420
I want to go back to just something very minor that you mentioned.

225
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,420
I get asked this question all the time and I've never had a compelling answer, but we

226
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,300
use hemoglobin A1C as sort of a surrogate proxy for average glucose levels.

227
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,860
Now, for reasons we won't get into today just for time, I'm not particularly convinced hemoglobin

228
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,460
A1C in an absolute sense provides great insight.

229
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,460
Oh, I agree.

230
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,180
On a relative basis, it can be somewhat helpful, but at least directionally it's helpful.

231
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,900
In any given patient, a lowering of hemoglobin A1C from point A to point B would be a good

232
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
thing.

233
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
I won't argue that.

234
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,020
The question becomes, do we have comparable biomarkers that can give us some indication

235
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,220
of average exposure to fructose over a given period of time?

236
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,180
Awfully good question.

237
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,860
Fructose also binds to hemoglobin, but it does not bind to position one, therefore you don't

238
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,140
measure it in hemoglobin A1C.

239
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,860
It binds at positions 66 and 110.

240
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,540
Now the hemoglobin A1C assay is not set up to look at 66 and 110.

241
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,020
This requires a major research lab.

242
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,320
It requires tandem mass spec.

243
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
It's a huge undertaking.

244
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,140
It's only done as a research tool and the only lab I know that does it is in Japan.

245
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,220
So that's not a rational thing to expect right now.

246
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,700
People are looking for long-term biomarkers of fructose consumption.

247
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,940
There have been several papers that have come out that are pointing to individual options,

248
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,380
but none have been put into clinical practice.

249
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,940
None have been shown to really validate consumption in a meaningful way.

250
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,260
So at this point in time, we don't have that for consumption.

251
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:43,020
What we do have are some indirect measures of fructose, shall we say, biotoxicity.

252
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,900
Yeah, like uric acid or ALT would be two examples.

253
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,820
Those are the ones I was going to bring up, exactly, uric acid and ALT.

254
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,720
So we know that the more sugar you consume, the higher your serum uric acid goes and the

255
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,340
more risk you have for gout.

256
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,380
Benjamin Franklin knew that and wrote about it.

257
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,620
The reason that happens is because since fructose can only be metabolized in the liver

258
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,700
because the liver has the Glut5 transporter, every time a fructose molecule enters a liver

259
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,820
cell, it has to be phosphorylated.

260
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,700
So it goes from fructose to fructose 1 phosphate and the enzyme that does that is called fructose

261
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
kinase.

262
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,640
Well, the phosphate has to be donated and ATP is the donor.

263
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,960
So ATP becomes ADP, adenosine triphosphate becomes adenosine diphosphate.

264
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:45,660
Now there is a scavenger enzyme in the liver called adenosine deaminase 1.

265
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,520
And what it does is it then takes ADP down to AMP, monophosphate, then to IMP, inositol

266
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,640
monophosphate, and finally to uric acid.

267
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,600
So the uric acid concentration in the blood is a proxy for total fructose consumption.

268
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,800
Now there are other things that make uric acid go up too, like protein.

269
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,720
But all things being equal, they do correlate with each other.

270
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,520
And we've shown that serum uric acid in children and adolescents correlate with sugar beverage

271
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
consumption, for instance.

272
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,240
And other people have shown that that uric acid matters because uric acid is the inhibitor

273
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,120
of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

274
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,760
That's an enzyme that exists in your vascular tree that vasodilates the blood vessels.

275
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,880
And that keeps your blood pressure down.

276
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:42,660
And we have shown that every increase by 10% in fructose consumption increases your blood

277
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,660
pressure by 2 millimeters of mercury consistently.

278
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,520
And that increases your risk of stroke by 10%.

279
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,380
We have data, and it's also been shown by Dan Feig at UT San Antonio, that if you give

280
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,720
an inhibitor of uric acid synthesis, allopurinol, which is what we give to gout patients, you

281
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,760
can actually lower adolescents' blood pressures when they have essential hypertension.

282
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,000
So this is a mechanistically valid problem.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,580
And it is a surrogate proxy biomarker sort of for sugar consumption.

284
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,820
ALT is also a surrogate marker in a similar way.

285
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,500
ALT goes up when your liver stores fat.

286
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
What's the difference between...

287
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,460
I mean, patients are sort of familiar with the difference between ALT and AST, but they

288
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,500
both show up as liver function tests.

289
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,220
But guys like you and I tend to spend a little more time looking at ALT.

290
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,320
So AST, which is aspartate aminotransferase, is a biomarker for mitochondrial function.

291
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,880
And ALT is alanine aminotransferase, and it is a biomarker for degree of liver fat.

292
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,040
So they're both important, but in different ways.

293
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
AST is much more minute to minute.

294
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,600
Like what did you eat at your last meal?

295
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,560
ALT is a little bit more, shall we say, stable over time.

296
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,100
So we tend to use ALT.

297
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,980
However, we've shown that when you cut sugar back AST changes, suggesting mitochondria

298
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,740
are actually getting better.

299
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,820
And the ranges on these things keep drifting upward for what people deem acceptable.

300
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,700
I tell my patients, I want their ALT below 20, and they say, but Peter, the range says

301
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,100
up to 42.

302
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Indeed.

303
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,860
This is huge, and I'm glad you brought it up.

304
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,340
So I entered medical school in 1976.

305
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,000
And at that time, the upper limit for normal for ALT was 25.

306
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,800
Now when we talk about upper limits for normal, where do those calculations come from?

307
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:57,000
Basically you take a bunch of, quote, normal people, and you figure out the mean, and you

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,560
look at two standard deviations around the mean, and that's how you decide what is normal.

309
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,500
So in 1976, 25 was two standard deviations above the mean.

310
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,900
Today, 40 years later, 40 is two standard deviations above the mean.

311
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,820
Does something happen to the assay?

312
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,380
No, something happened to us.

313
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,060
Because now everyone has fatty liver disease.

314
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:30,860
In fact, the Dallas Heart Study showed that 40% of normal people have hepatic steatosis,

315
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
liver fat.

316
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,560
Well, that makes your ALT go up.

317
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,040
So what I say is 25 was the upper limit of normal.

318
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,680
25 should still be the upper limit of normal, despite what it says on the lab slip.

319
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,660
Because that's just looking at two standard deviations above the mean.

320
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,640
So we use that very specifically in clinic to show parents and kids what is happening

321
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,520
to them and why sugar is the bad guy.

322
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,440
Because when we get them off sugar, the ALT drops within a month.

323
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah.

324
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,840
And going back to the uric acid thing, I was very influenced by the work of Rick Johnson,

325
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,400
and Rick has been always incredibly generous with his time and insights.

326
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Indeed.

327
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Great guy.

328
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,360
One of the things I started doing probably about three years ago was just basically saying

329
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
it's non-negotiable.

330
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,400
All my patients need a uric acid below five, even though the assay says we will consider

331
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,960
normal up to 7.0.

332
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Exactly.

333
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
Same issue.

334
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,000
So in clinic, we basically said 5.5 is sort of the break point.

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,320
So we're pretty close.

336
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Yeah.

337
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,200
ALT at 25, uric acid of 5.5.

338
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
We can argue about the...

339
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,800
We're within an order of magnitude of each other.

340
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Right.

341
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
And that point is the same.

342
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,400
And I think it's interesting because when we think about cardiovascular disease, one

343
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,840
of the things that...

344
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,560
The endothelial story gets overlooked a little bit.

345
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,520
The inflammation story is now getting its day based on these two very recent trials.

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,240
One recent trial and one that was halted likely because of a significant improvement in the

347
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,120
outcome of using methotrexate.

348
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,840
But when you look at the impact of uric acid on nitric oxide synthase, when you look at

349
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,840
the impact of homocysteine on asymmetric dimethylarginine, which also then in turn inhibits nitric oxide

350
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,520
synthase, these things start to make a bit more sense, which is we always kind of knew

351
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,440
having high uric acid was bad and we always kind of knew having high homocysteine was

352
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
bad.

353
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,760
But now we're seeing these mechanistic reasons why all of a sudden, oh wow, that's a bad

354
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,440
thing to have vasoconstriction in your coronary arteries.

355
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,880
I couldn't agree more.

356
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,680
The fact of the matter is we didn't have the empiric data.

357
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,600
We always had the plausibility argument, but we didn't know how important it was.

358
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,480
Now we have the empiric data and we have interventional data to say that this phenomenon is quite

359
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,280
important and it's not its own phenomenon.

360
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:05,200
It is another manifestation of this global phenomenon we call metabolic syndrome.

361
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,680
And when you look at it that way and say, well, if it's doing this, what else is it

362
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
doing?

363
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,600
All of a sudden things start piecing together.

364
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,240
It's like the puzzle and you sort of needed the piece in the middle to fit all the other

365
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,280
things together to be able to tell what's really going on.

366
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,600
And uric acid is part of that puzzle.

367
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Now, Rob, is there any situation under which fructose consumed in its natural state, which

368
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,920
is to say with water, with fiber, i.e. in fruit, poses an advantage over glucose?

369
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,640
Because clearly glucose has many advantages in terms of how metabolically flexible, like

370
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,560
every organ can basically consume it.

371
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,100
You don't have a lot of these other negative reactions.

372
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,480
Is there something that fructose does better than glucose?

373
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,760
Yes, one thing.

374
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,480
So if your liver is glycogen depleted, for instance, if you're a football player, three

375
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,000
hours on the gridiron and you have depleted your glycogen stores from your liver and you

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,060
consume a, say, energy drink or sports drink, you will replete your glycogen faster.

377
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,440
It will do that.

378
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
I won't argue that.

379
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
The reason being...

380
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
But this to be clear is only liver glycogen, not muscle glycogen.

381
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Absolutely.

382
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,440
So glycogen is a much bigger store.

383
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Absolutely.

384
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,360
You will replete your liver glycogen faster.

385
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,400
There is a back door where you can turn fructose back into glucose, which can then restore

386
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
your liver glycogen.

387
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,560
Now, the sports drink industry makes a huge deal about this.

388
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,280
I think this is truly a tempest in a teapot.

389
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,120
I think this is really irrelevant.

390
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,040
And the reason is because after you've spent three hours on the gridiron, you're not going

391
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,320
to spend another three hours on the gridiron.

392
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,680
And you will, by tomorrow, have repleted those glycogen stores anyway just from eating real

393
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,760
food.

394
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,640
So the idea that somehow you have to replete your glycogen rapidly, just to me does not

395
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
hold water.

396
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,560
Yeah, it's fine to expend your glycogen stores in your liver and real food will get you back

397
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,800
to the same place by tomorrow.

398
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,160
It also doesn't even make sense physiologically because the limit to performance is not liver

399
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,960
glycogen, it's muscle glycogen.

400
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,920
Well, not even sure that's true.

401
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Well, that's right.

402
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,240
When you hit people with glucagon who claim that they've sort of bonked and hit the wall

403
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,400
and there is no more glucose left, you'll still see a transient glucose spike.

404
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Absolutely.

405
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,560
Plus, we have all these people who are now on high-fat diets, ketogenic diets.

406
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,440
And how about the Ethiopians?

407
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,040
They're not eating carbohydrates.

408
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,360
The fact is, you actually have better sports performance using fatty acids and ketones

409
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,880
than you do with carbohydrate.

410
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,840
And the reason is insulin.

411
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,600
So I don't buy that for a minute as being important.

412
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,040
Yes, it is true you will replete your liver glycogen faster.

413
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,840
And that's true true and unrelated.

414
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,480
It's like so what?

415
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Yeah.

416
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,040
You very recently retired.

417
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,200
Clinically, yeah, you're nowhere near retiring.

418
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,640
No, no, I've got a lot to do.

419
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,920
But you spent a lot of time, you're a pediatric endocrinologist, you spent a lot of time in

420
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,760
clinic with children who had diabetes, have been overweight, have been obese, have had

421
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,280
naphyl D, NASH, et cetera.

422
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
You bet.

423
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:37,800
Do you have a concern that children who undergo such metabolic transformation suffer an epigenetic

424
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,280
hit that makes it harder for them later in life?

425
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,200
What I know about epigenetics suggests that that is possible.

426
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
I would even go so far as to say likely.

427
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I know.

428
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,680
And it's frightening if it's, I mean, it's one of those things you hope is so untrue.

429
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Right.

430
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,040
But I don't know that.

431
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,520
Here's what I do know.

432
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,280
And it's related, but not exactly the same.

433
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,680
We know from animal work from both children's of Philadelphia and also from the Liggins

434
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,480
Institute in New Zealand that maternal hyperglycemia causes epigenetic changes.

435
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,560
This is in utero.

436
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:25,520
In utero causes changes in H19, the different epigenetic markers that we have on chromosomes

437
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,400
that then portend metabolic dysfunction later on.

438
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,360
So if that's true in humans and no one's proven that that's true in humans, it could explain

439
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,680
a lot of the things that we do see.

440
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,880
We know from a biochemical standpoint, animals that are stressed or animals that consume

441
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,040
large amounts of sugar during pregnancy end up with offspring that will manifest various

442
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,760
aspects of the metabolic syndrome later.

443
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,920
Do we know that that's true epigenetics?

444
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Not yet.

445
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,560
But if the rodent studies are similar to, you know, what happens in primates and humans,

446
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,920
it's not too far field and it's not too much of a jump.

447
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,760
Yes, I'm very concerned about it because as you know, epigenetics is the gift that keeps

448
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
on giving.

449
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Yeah.

450
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,440
You can change the F1 generation and still find that epigenetic change and therefore

451
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,920
the metabolic alterations in the F4 generation.

452
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:35,960
So it might explain why things keep getting worse year after year is because we're adding

453
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,800
on all the time and more people are entering this epigenetic disaster.

454
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
But I don't know that.

455
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
That's a guess.

456
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,600
I mean, it's sort of one of those things where we have to sort of take a little bit of the

457
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,320
precautionary principle, right?

458
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,920
So you say, well, if there is an epigenetic reprogramming that occurs, then as parents,

459
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,200
we need to be thinking a little bit more about the food environment our kids are in because

460
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,320
this is one of those things, you know, we're pretty familiar with the notion that if you

461
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,040
don't discipline your kid, you're really not doing them a favor 20 years down the line.

462
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,440
And this would be another variant of that.

463
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,160
And of course you would say, well, what if this turns out to be untrue?

464
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,680
What if there is no epigenetic signature?

465
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,240
It's like, okay, well, what was the downside of trying to get your kids to eat well?

466
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,320
No argument.

467
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,280
There's one downside and it's...

468
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,320
It's the effort that's required.

469
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Exactly.

470
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
That's the downside.

471
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,280
So we have these data.

472
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,280
How many times do you have to introduce a savory food to an infant before they will

473
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
accept it?

474
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
Oh, I don't know.

475
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Three, four?

476
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Median 13.

477
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Wow.

478
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,760
How many times do you have to introduce a sweet food to an infant before they will accept

479
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
it?

480
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Let me tell a funny story for that.

481
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,960
When my daughter, who is now 10, turned six months old, and I have this on video, we took

482
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,840
her down to Delmar for a walk on the beach and got an ice cream cone.

483
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,520
We were like, all right, she's had nothing but breast milk and some formula for the

484
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,960
last six months.

485
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,280
What will she do with some soft vanilla ice cream?

486
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,160
And our thought was the cold would turn her off.

487
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,620
There was a foreign substance, whatever.

488
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,760
And it's one of the funniest videos I've ever seen because she puts her face into this vanilla

489
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,440
ice cream and I've never seen her eyes open so much.

490
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,680
And I joked about it.

491
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,560
I was like, holy shit, look at the dope.

492
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,240
You can almost see the dopamine firing.

493
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,280
You needed to put her in the functional MRI right then and there.

494
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,080
Michael Palm describes this in the omnivore's dilemma, the first time he introduced birthday

495
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,160
cake to his son.

496
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,900
And he looked at him like, you've been holding out on me.

497
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,460
This exists in the world.

498
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,240
And this is the first time I'm getting it.

499
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,160
I'm going to devote my entire life to sequestering all this stuff just to spite you.

500
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
It's incredible.

501
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,440
Actually, my youngest son turns one on Wednesday of this week.

502
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Congratulations.

503
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Thank you.

504
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,680
So he's going to get a cupcake.

505
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,960
That'll be his first junk food.

506
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,000
You sure you want to do that?

507
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Just because I love watching this reaction.

508
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,920
Going back to this thing, I'll tell you something.

509
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Get the MRI.

510
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

511
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,560
When my daughter was growing up, so before she got to school, all she drank was milk

512
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,360
and water.

513
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,380
And when she was about five years old, she was at a birthday party and they had these

514
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,240
things called Capri Sun, which are like, I don't even know how these things are legal

515
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,220
because they're basically syrup in a tinfoil bag.

516
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
They're really gross.

517
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,300
I mean, they take it to a new level.

518
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,300
They do.

519
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,420
She took one sip of one and pitched it.

520
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,760
And I was like, oh, Olivia, why didn't you drink that?

521
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,260
She's like, it's really gross.

522
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
It is gross.

523
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,980
Well, fast forward five years later, she drinks that stuff anytime she's at a kid's house.

524
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
Right.

525
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,180
Like even something that seemed so physiologically nauseating at one point in time, she's acclimated

526
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
to.

527
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Right.

528
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,260
And there's data on desensitization of taste buds.

529
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,540
And one of the reasons why you keep wanting more and more sweet is because the taste buds

530
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,360
get down regulated and there's data now that actually supports that in humans.

531
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,420
So there's this desensitization issue.

532
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,700
There's also the desensitization of dopamine receptors because dopamine receptors go down

533
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,580
in response to constant bombardment by dopamine.

534
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,380
It's the phenomenon of tolerance.

535
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,860
This would be very...

536
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,500
Is this a controversial point?

537
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
No.

538
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,420
Because this is the sinquana of what makes cocaine so dangerous.

539
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,540
I mean, I have a number of patients who recreationally use cocaine and I don't want to be like the

540
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,200
alarmist who just says, don't do drugs because drugs are bad.

541
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,140
I want to make the point that says, look, not all drugs are necessarily bad, but cocaine

542
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,940
has two problems, at least as far as I can see.

543
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,000
The first is you have a nonlinear asymmetric risk of something really bad happening as

544
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,460
far as cardiac dysrhythmia.

545
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,960
So why would you take that risk?

546
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,160
But the second issue is this downregulation of dopamine receptors that develops this tolerance

547
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
and therefore makes it actually harder for you to experience joy subsequently.

548
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,320
Indeed.

549
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,520
So here's the deal.

550
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,360
Neurotransmitters are either excitatory or inhibitory.

551
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,860
Now neurons like to be excited.

552
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,400
That's why they have receptors in the first place.

553
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,560
But neurons like to be tickled, not bludgeoned.

554
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,280
They like to receive the neurotransmitter, fire, and then come back to baseline.

555
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Chronic overstimulation of any neuron leads to neuronal cell death.

556
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Period.

557
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,440
And we know this because we take care of all these kids with chronic seizure disorders

558
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,520
in the ICU and we're doing our best to try to stop those seizures, not because of the

559
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,240
seizure, but because of the brain damage that occurs from continued overstimulation.

560
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:54,240
So any neuron that is an excitatory that's downstream of an excitatory stimulus, it wants

561
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
to protect itself.

562
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,840
It has a plan B. It has a fail safe.

563
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,360
What it does is it downregulates the receptor.

564
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,720
That means that there's less likelihood that any given molecule will find a receptor to

565
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,360
bind to, thereby reducing the risk for cell death.

566
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,480
So what does this mean in human terms?

567
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,480
You get a hit, you get a rush, receptors go down.

568
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,200
Next time you need a bigger hit to get the same rush and the receptors go down and then

569
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,480
a bigger hit and a bigger hit and a bigger hit until finally you get a huge hit to get

570
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,720
nothing.

571
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,520
That's called tolerance.

572
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,880
And then when the neurons actually do start to die because chronic stimulation causes

573
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,820
neuronal cell death, that's called addiction.

574
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,480
And those neurons don't come back.

575
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,680
Once they're dead, they're dead.

576
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,840
And that actually limits your ability even after rehab of being able to experience that

577
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,960
same level of reward because now you don't even have the dopamine to be able to do it

578
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,080
because those neurons are dead.

579
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,240
So not every drug is stimulatory.

580
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,520
There are drugs that are inhibitory.

581
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,480
If you're inhibiting the next neuron, do you have to downregulate the receptor?

582
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
No.

583
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,560
So like a benzodiazepine, for example.

584
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,200
Benzodiazepines are inhibitory.

585
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,120
Turns out psychedelics are inhibitory.

586
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,820
So serotonin, 2A and 1A are inhibitory.

587
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:24,240
So when the DEA clamped down in 1970 with the Controlled Substances Act that made marijuana

588
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,200
and psychedelics and everything, Schedule I and unavailable, there were a whole bunch

589
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,980
of people using psychedelics.

590
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,480
They didn't end up in the emergency room.

591
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,180
They didn't end up with withdrawal.

592
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,940
And the reason was because they didn't have downregulation of their receptors because

593
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,900
those were inhibitory.

594
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,980
So not every drug fries neurons.

595
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,540
So a cocaine does.

596
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
Yeah.

597
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,460
Help me understand how alcohol fits into this because alcohol is of course a gab, ethanol

598
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,380
per se, is a GABA agonist.

599
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,040
So it should be at least depressing in that sense.

600
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,740
But yet ethanol has some of these negative properties in the brain that you've just alluded

601
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
to.

602
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:07,500
The problem is ethanol in the brain also because it's polar and it dissolves lipids.

603
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,100
It also creates acid aldehyde.

604
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:15,500
So that's the first step in terms of metabolism of ethanol, which then can cause that myer

605
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,300
reaction because you've made an aldehyde, which then generates reactive oxygen species.

606
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:26,460
So you can kill neurons, not necessarily from excitation, but from the biochemistry of the

607
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,460
molecule.

608
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,980
We talk a lot and we might not even get into it today because you've spoken so eloquently

609
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,940
about it elsewhere about the similarities between ethanol and fructose in the liver.

610
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,340
In the liver, yes.

611
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,220
How are they similar in the brain, if at all?

612
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,500
So they both stimulate the reward center.

613
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,100
Though it seems through different mechanisms.

614
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Yes, likely through different mechanisms.

615
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,820
There are a lot of different dopamine stimulators.

616
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,260
There are substances and they're all different.

617
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,860
Cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, sugar, heroin.

618
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:01,540
They have different mechanisms, but they all ultimately impact on dopamine the same

619
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
way.

620
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,500
We also have behaviors that are addictive.

621
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,300
Gambling, shopping, internet, social media, pornography.

622
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,420
There's an aholic next to every one of those too.

623
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,300
Chocoholic, sexaholic, whatever.

624
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,260
Because they're stimulating dopamine also, but they're not chemicals.

625
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,420
They're behaviors.

626
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,740
But they still generate that same dopamine response and therefore they still induce the

627
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
same phenomenon of tolerance.

628
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,500
Now, they don't have withdrawal.

629
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Withdrawal is the effects of these substances on the peripheral body, not the brain, but

630
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,860
the peripheral body because cocaine has effects at every adrenergic synapse.

631
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,540
Morphine has effects on other places other than the brain, etcetera, etcetera.

632
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,540
Caffeine too.

633
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,820
It's interesting how withdrawal can sometimes be physiologically deadly.

634
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,020
For example, ethanol with ... We know this stuff.

635
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,300
We used to ... When we'd operate on patients who were alcoholics, we would actually just

636
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,700
continue giving them ethanol throughout surgery.

637
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,180
You could keep them on alcohol the whole time they're in the hospital.

638
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,860
You can kill a patient if you take alcohol away from them too abruptly.

639
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,420
Whereas opiates, the withdrawal is unbearable, but you won't kill the patient by removing

640
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
it.

641
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,780
I find the physiology of withdrawal to be quite interesting.

642
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
It's true.

643
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,460
In fact, the way to deal with opiate withdrawal is get rid of the opiates or give naloxone

644
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,340
to counteract the opiates, which is now going on everywhere.

645
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:36,260
Now, the police carry Narcan and when they find opiate overdoses in the field, and they're

646
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,580
even having schools, which is really bizarre and horrible.

647
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,580
Yes, they are different.

648
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,140
Speak to your earlier point, right?

649
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,220
Which is, and Gabor Maté, who has written about this quite eloquently, stated that we're

650
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
all addicts.

651
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,340
And so you just get to choose your substance of abuse or your behavior of abuse.

652
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,340
That's right.

653
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,260
And as you said, it's not, and it can be work.

654
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,460
The point is sometimes it can be things that are not socially punished.

655
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
Right.

656
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Those are the hardest.

657
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Right.

658
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,140
I mean, I'm going to admit to you right now, I'm a caffeine addict.

659
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,060
I've already had four cups of coffee this morning.

660
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,980
And as soon as we're done with this, I'm going to have my next.

661
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,360
And you know, if you take my Starbucks away from me, I will kill you.

662
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,840
On the other hand, caffeine is not dangerous unless you mix it with alcohol, in which case

663
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,800
then you have four loco and you end up with arrhythmias and other things.

664
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,520
So, and it's still socially acceptable.

665
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,600
Nicotine is now not socially acceptable, but it took a long time.

666
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:43,280
It took an entire generation of teaching kids why cigarettes were bad before it became not

667
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,940
socially acceptable.

668
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,900
So we have a long way to go with sugar because it's still socially acceptable.

669
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,540
I want to get into some more geeky biochemistry stuff, but I also know that there's probably

670
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,140
at least one person listening to this who's a parent who's thinking, oh man, do I have

671
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,740
to simmer down how much sugar my kids are eating?

672
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,760
So when you saw kids in the clinic, obviously you're seeing their parents.

673
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,460
That's one of the advantages of pediatrics.

674
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
It's also one of the disadvantages.

675
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
That's right.

676
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
That's right.

677
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
You have two patients.

678
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Two patients.

679
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,460
And I don't get paid for both.

680
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,260
But the beauty of it is you have a patient who you need to take care of, which is this

681
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,380
child, but then you also have another caregiver who for the most part wants what's best for

682
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,380
that child.

683
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Mostly.

684
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,900
And how would you counsel a parent who would say, look, Dr. Lustig, there's no way my kid's

685
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,060
going to have no sugar in their life.

686
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,980
Can you give me a way to create a sustainable environment and set of rules that's going

687
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,900
to prevent my kid from having the metabolic derangement that hoses them for the rest of

688
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,300
their life, but allows them to still be a kid?

689
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Yes.

690
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,380
And that's what we did in clinic every single day.

691
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,460
Here's the problem.

692
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,740
It's not the added sugar you know.

693
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,740
It's the added sugar you don't know.

694
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,220
It's almost like a Rumsfeld tone to that, right?

695
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
Well, yeah.

696
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,220
I mean, there's the known knowns and then there's the unknown knowns.

697
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:05,380
And the fact is when you look at the amount of sugar that is in sodas, it's bad.

698
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:11,860
When you look at the amount of sugar that's in candy, cake, ice cream, it's about half

699
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,040
as much.

700
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,000
That adds up to 50% of the added sugar consumed by children.

701
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,140
And what is that number, by the way, in grams per day approximately?

702
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,820
It runs the gamut, but the median is 18 teaspoons.

703
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,580
So that's about 90 grams of sugar per day.

704
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Yeah.

705
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,580
It used to be 120.

706
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
It's actually come down because the obesity epidemic.

707
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,620
90 to 94 grams of added sugar per day.

708
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,140
Half of the sugar is in foods you didn't know had it.

709
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,300
Bread, pasta sauce.

710
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Pretzels.

711
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Why pretzels have sugar?

712
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Bread.

713
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Right.

714
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Why do they put sugar in bread?

715
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,300
Any idea?

716
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I guess.

717
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,780
It probably helps with preserving it, doesn't it?

718
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
Exactly.

719
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,420
So if you buy a loaf of bread at the bakery, how soon before it stales?

720
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,580
Two days typically.

721
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,660
Two days.

722
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,340
If you buy a loaf of bread at the grocery store, how long before it stales?

723
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Ten days.

724
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Three weeks.

725
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
Okay.

726
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Why?

727
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,740
They're both bread, right?

728
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:15,260
Well, what they did in the grocery store bread was they added sugar very specifically because

729
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,020
the sugar doesn't boil off when you put it in the oven.

730
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,740
Water does.

731
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,460
So it acts as a humectant.

732
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,460
It keeps-

733
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,580
That's why it's so much moisture when you have store-bought bread.

734
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Exactly.

735
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:36,220
That's why if you threw a loaf of bread at my head, it would just bounce off because

736
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,580
it's kind of spongy, right?

737
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,380
But there are also breads like German fitness bread, which don't have that.

738
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
They're real bread.

739
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,980
They use whole grains.

740
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,280
They're lumpy bumpy.

741
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,180
And they're small, the loaves.

742
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,180
They're the size of a brick.

743
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,180
They're weapons.

744
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
And they're weapons, right?

745
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,620
You could kill somebody if you threw a German fitness bread at their head.

746
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,180
It is dense.

747
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,480
They're both bread, but the store-bought bread had sugar added very specifically to

748
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,420
hold onto water because sugar is polar.

749
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:13,340
And so the water stays in and therefore the bread doesn't stale as quickly.

750
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:20,280
Therefore you can put a cell on by date way later, decreased depreciation, increased profit.

751
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,940
So if a kid came in and the kids got an AFLD and you've surmised that this child's eating

752
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,940
about 100 grams of sugar a day.

753
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,780
Do you say to the parent, our target is what, 20 grams per day?

754
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,260
What we say is we don't worry about target numbers.

755
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,620
What we say is processed food is the problem because processed food is high sugar, low

756
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
fiber.

757
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,140
What you want is a low sugar, high fiber diet.

758
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,020
That's called real food.

759
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:54,460
Every diet out there that works, and there are a whole bunch of diets that work, certain

760
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,580
vegan diets work.

761
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,540
Remember, Coke is vegan, so it's not like every vegan diet's okay.

762
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,180
The college vegan diet doesn't necessarily work.

763
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,020
Yes, the college vegan diet does not work exactly right.

764
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:11,380
The traditional Japanese diet, the Atkins diet, ketogenic diet, paleo diet, Mediterranean

765
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,900
diet, all of these diets.

766
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
Plant-based diets.

767
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,900
Sure.

768
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,760
They all work because they're all real food.

769
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,740
Every diet that works is real food and every diet that doesn't is because it's processed

770
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,740
food.

771
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,940
The problem is parents don't know the difference.

772
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,260
They don't understand that grocery store bread is processed food.

773
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,660
They think it's food.

774
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,100
They think if it's sold in the supermarket, it's food.

775
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,180
No, there's real food and you know what that is, but the parents don't.

776
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:48,620
What we teach them in clinic is if there's a label on the food, that's a warning label

777
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,740
because that means it's been processed because real food doesn't need a label.

778
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,300
Is there a nutrition facts label on broccoli?

779
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,900
Is there a nutrition facts label on carrots?

780
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,500
No.

781
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,820
Is there a nutrition facts label on the meat in the meat case?

782
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,820
No.

783
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,980
The reason is because it's all real food.

784
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,840
Now, when we get to meat, there's ways of making meat a problem too.

785
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,740
It's called corn fed.

786
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,380
But the bottom line is at least they're real food because that means-

787
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,460
You don't necessarily fixate on targets.

788
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,460
You say, look, we're going to-

789
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
We don't talk about-

790
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,380
We're going to make a conceptual change.

791
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,000
We don't ask them to do math.

792
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,460
We ask them to purchase and consume real food.

793
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,060
Now, we have to teach them what that is.

794
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,060
So what we do, we bring all of the new patients in on the same day.

795
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,860
We see all the new patients on one day.

796
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,740
It's like chaos.

797
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,140
And they all meet with a dietician.

798
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:52,840
They come in fasting and we draw their blood and we evaluate them.

799
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:59,900
And then they all sit down at a communal table and we do an hour long teaching breakfast.

800
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:06,840
And the dietician narrates why those foods are available for breakfast.

801
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:14,320
So whole grain bread, natural peanut butter, not Skippy Jif Peter Pan, but the real stuff,

802
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,120
plain yogurt, et cetera.

803
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:23,120
And we explain why these foods were chosen and how they meet the criteria of real food

804
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,080
as opposed to what they're currently buying.

805
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,320
Most parents get it.

806
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,800
Now there are some who don't.

807
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,480
There are some who say, I'm sorry, that takes too long.

808
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,440
I can't spend the time preparing real food.

809
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
And then-

810
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,000
Is there an economic consideration also?

811
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, absolutely.

812
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,840
Do you have a sense of what it costs all things equal?

813
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Yeah, double.

814
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,080
So a parent's going to basically have to double their food budget if they want to start

815
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
eating real food.

816
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,080
That's right.

817
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,120
They're going to have to double their food budget and they're also going to have to double

818
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,720
their food time in terms of preparation.

819
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
That's a big ask.

820
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,720
It is.

821
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,240
Or, I mean, when the CDC last looked at this, the estimates of NAFLD, which we'll get into

822
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,160
in a moment so we can let you explain that in some detail.

823
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,720
But when you look in particular along ethnic lines, at the time I last looked at this,

824
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,280
50% of Hispanic boys who were obese had NAFLD.

825
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,720
My guess is that's a gross underestimation.

826
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,720
Likely.

827
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,240
The fact is that Latinos are more risk of developing.

828
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,240
Right.

829
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,080
There's a genetic predisposition.

830
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:34,360
They have a specific polymorphism of a specific gene called PNPLA3, a patatin-like phosphoprotein

831
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,560
domain A3.

832
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:43,960
And it's been shown that if you have the homozygous form, the GG mutation, polymorphism of this

833
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,520
gene, a little sugar in your diet makes a lot of liver fat.

834
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,120
And 19% of Latinos have it.

835
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,000
So this is particularly worrisome for the Latino population.

836
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,760
And yes, they have fatty liver like nobody else.

837
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,320
So there are people at more risk.

838
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,040
And so it becomes even more important to get the sugar out of their diet.

839
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,540
We explain all of this to them.

840
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,760
We explain why this is.

841
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,320
And we show them the lab data.

842
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,680
We show them the acanthosis nigricans on the back of the kid's neck to explain how the

843
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,840
environment changes the biochemistry.

844
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,180
We also then explain how the biochemistry changes the behavior.

845
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:32,880
We know from our study where we actually substituted starch for sugar, that kids actually couldn't

846
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,280
even eat as much food as we had to supply.

847
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,760
They all of a sudden got to tie you back.

848
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,000
Let's talk for a moment about that.

849
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,960
This is the isocaloric substitution of fructose for fructose.

850
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,120
So let's take a step back and explain what NAFLD is.

851
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,120
Let me start with one anecdote before we get, which you'll appreciate.

852
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:55,520
When I was in my residency, so we're talking about 18, 20 years ago, one of the questions

853
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,840
if you're a young surgical resident, you're always asking the patient during pre-op is

854
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,820
how much alcohol do you consume?

855
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,560
And the reason is going back to the DT thing, we don't want to ever get into a situation

856
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,960
where two days post-op a patient's having DTs.

857
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,560
So I remember on at least three occasions, but probably more, where a patient claimed

858
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,600
they did not consume alcohol or that they, you know, they consume like a beer twice a

859
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,320
week and then we'd get in there to do the case and they'd have fatty liver.

860
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,680
And we would look at each other and go, God damn it, this guy lied to me.

861
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,680
I can't believe this.

862
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,160
You know, I wasn't there to judge him.

863
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,720
I just needed to know he clearly is drinking like his life depends on it.

864
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
And he was in denial.

865
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,920
Well, it never registered to me what was going on until 10 years later when I learned about

866
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
NAFLD.

867
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,560
And I said, wait a minute, those patients weren't lying to me.

868
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,800
They had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

869
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,080
And you can't tell the difference under the microscope.

870
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,080
They look the same.

871
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:57,880
So my first NAFLD patient was in 1996.

872
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:06,280
I had just moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and I had a patient who had ALTs in the 300s and

873
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,400
the liver was enormous.

874
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,040
They were just sure this, it was a kid, you know, so it wasn't an alcohol thing, you know,

875
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,760
but they were sure this kid had hepatitis or something else.

876
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,520
It turned out, you know, they went and did a liver biopsy and it was, you know, fatty

877
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
liver disease.

878
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,800
And I said, what the hell is this?

879
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,960
And soon all my patients had it.

880
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,520
Same thing with type 2 diabetes.

881
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:35,000
I saw my first pediatric type 2 diabetic back in 1992.

882
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And now one third of all new diabetes diagnoses in kids is type 2.

883
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
What's going on?

884
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,680
You know, we were at the beginning.

885
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:50,920
We, both of us, were seeing this at the beginning of this epidemic and now everyone's got it.

886
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,620
You know, this can't be genetic.

887
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,640
This is an environmental insult.

888
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,680
And the good news is we figured out what the insult is.

889
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,480
The bad news is there are dark forces on the other side keeping it that way.

890
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,080
Let's talk for a moment about that.

891
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:12,160
About four or five years ago, there was certainly a controversy around the etiology of NAFLD.

892
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,680
There were camps that said, look, it's got to be the fructose for reasons that you'll

893
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,680
articulate.

894
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,800
There were other camps that said, actually, it's fatty acids.

895
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,480
It's kids that are consuming too much fat.

896
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,800
Others said, actually, it's just a proxy for obesity.

897
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,880
In other words, quote unquote, caloric excess leads to adiposity, which leads to NAFLD.

898
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:39,120
I'd like to hear your thoughts on, in the most unbiased way we could, how do you make

899
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:45,600
the case that it's fructose that is disproportionately driving this versus some of these other factors?

900
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:51,600
It's very easy to imagine how you get liver fat.

901
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,440
There's production and then there's clearance.

902
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Okay.

903
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:02,360
And the amount of liver fat is the equilibrium between those two phenomena.

904
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,260
There are two methods for production.

905
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,640
One is through diet.

906
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:15,840
So dietary fat can contribute to hepatic fat, but there's also de novo lipogenesis, which

907
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,280
is new fat making.

908
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,160
It's the process of turning sugar into fat.

909
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,200
Now that had been discounted for years because of a one study.

910
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,680
This is Hellerstein study that basically looked at-

911
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
Right.

912
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,400
Hellerstein study from Journal of Clinical Investigation, 1998.

913
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,040
Where they said, oh, this is a minor pathway.

914
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,600
The fractional DNL was only 3%.

915
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,360
Well, the reason it was only 3% was because number one, these were healthy people.

916
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,200
Number two, they were fasting, which means they were glycogen depleted.

917
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,600
And so the fructose went into repleting the glycogen like we talked about.

918
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,760
And there were also people who hadn't been large fructose consumers in advance.

919
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,800
And we now know that fructose absorption at the level of the gut is inducible.

920
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,760
We learn this every Halloween because the kid eats a lot of sugar and then ends up having

921
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,880
diarrhea like crazy because basically they've got-

922
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
Malabsorption.

923
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,060
They've got malabsorption because their enzyme hadn't been induced yet.

924
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,520
But if you continue to supply it, the process increases.

925
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,720
And we now know the reason for that is a protein in the intestinal epithelial cell

926
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,980
called thioredoxin inhibitory protein or TXNIP.

927
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,880
This is work from Richard Lee at Harvard.

928
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:44,080
There were a whole bunch of reasons why people thought that de novo lipogenesis was a minor

929
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,440
pathway.

930
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,720
It's not a minor pathway.

931
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,120
It is a major pathway.

932
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:58,380
And Donnelly showed in 2005 that de novo lipogenesis was worth about 25% of the fat in the liver.

933
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,380
Wow.

934
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,320
And then, I mean, you're going to get to this, but how much of that is getting exported in

935
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
VLDL?

936
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
That's the clearance side.

937
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,000
There are two ways to clear.

938
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
There's oxidation, fatty acid oxidation.

939
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,120
This is why diseases that cause mitochondrial dysfunction like Reye's syndrome end up with

940
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,240
fatty liver.

941
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,600
And then there's export.

942
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,800
And the export can be through VLDL or can be through phosphatidylcholine, but it's basically

943
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,080
export out of the liver.

944
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,440
So there's oxidation is clearance and export is clearance.

945
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,360
So you have two ways coming in.

946
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Two inputs, two outputs.

947
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,960
Two inputs, two outputs.

948
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,040
And so the question is, what's changed?

949
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,540
And the answer is our dietary fat's gone down.

950
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,040
So that ain't it.

951
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,060
But our de novo lipogenesis has gone up.

952
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:49,020
And when you look at the exports, we now have fatty liver, which actually makes things

953
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,800
worse because it causes inflammation, which ends up making mitochondria less functional,

954
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,980
which causes less fatty acid oxidation.

955
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,940
And we have data on that.

956
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,220
And we have high triglycerides in patients who consume fructose.

957
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:10,840
So if that pathway out is going up, then you know that if you've got fatty liver, it's

958
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,900
because more is coming in.

959
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:18,900
Bottom line, so the driver so we could say because triglycerides typically go up with

960
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,380
naphyl D that says it's not a problem of exporting.

961
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,220
It's not ineffective exporting patients who have a beta lipoproteinemia.

962
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,300
They can't export.

963
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,300
They can't make the VLDL.

964
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,340
You know how many patients that is?

965
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,060
OK, that's like one in 10,000.

966
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,260
We have a 40 percent naphaled rate in this country.

967
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,880
It ain't one in 10,000.

968
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,940
It's not because of the fatty acid oxidation defects.

969
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,340
It's not because of the export problem.

970
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,260
It's not because of the increased saturated fat.

971
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,800
It's because of the de novo lipogenesis by process of exclusion.

972
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,380
That's the only pathway that's gone up.

973
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:01,040
Do you believe that insulin resistance is the result of naphyl D or is naphyl D the

974
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,140
result of insulin resistance?

975
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,140
Yes.

976
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,400
The two feet off each other.

977
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,380
Let's talk about metabolic syndrome because the one aspect of metabolic syndrome that

978
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:17,060
everyone agrees on is this phenomenon called insulin resistance.

979
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,540
The question is, where's the insulin resistance come from?

980
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,980
Everyone assumes, well, you get fat.

981
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,260
Therefore your fat cells make cytokines like TNF alpha and IL-6.

982
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,300
Those then go via the portal system to the liver and cause the liver to be dysfunctional

983
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,720
and therefore you increase hepatic glucose output.

984
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,060
That then causes your beta cells to have to overproduce insulin and then that drives the

985
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,660
insulin resistance.

986
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,400
That's what you learn in medical school.

987
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,480
Undoubtedly there are some patients where that is the pathway.

988
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,480
I actually think that's actually a rare way that this happens, maybe 10 percent.

989
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,600
I don't think that's the majority, but that is one way.

990
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:08,700
We'll call it the adipogenic hypothesis of metabolic syndrome.

991
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:13,300
Because clearly that patient is not insulin resistant at the adipocyte as evidenced by

992
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,900
the fact that they can increase the size of their adipocyte.

993
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Exactly right.

994
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,420
They have liver insulin resistance, but their adipocytes are insulin sensitive because they

995
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,580
keep storing.

996
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:29,180
In that model, you haven't necessarily specified what's happening at the level of the muscle,

997
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,460
which some would argue is the harbinger of bad things.

998
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,400
In other words, once the muscle stops disposing of glucose, taking it in.

999
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,680
In fact, muscles don't need insulin to import glucose.

1000
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,800
If they did, then every diabetic would be paralyzed.

1001
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,960
The reason insulin works at the muscle is for import of amino acids.

1002
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,000
For muscle growth, but not for muscle metabolism.

1003
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,120
The transporter on muscle is which glute?

1004
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
Glute two?

1005
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,120
It is glute.

1006
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Or four.

1007
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,280
It's not four.

1008
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,800
It's in adipocytes.

1009
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,980
Glute two is in liver.

1010
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,560
I'm pretty sure it's three.

1011
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
One is in the brain.

1012
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,900
I'm pretty sure it's three.

1013
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,220
I got to look at that again, but I'm just trying to remember.

1014
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,340
But it's not glute four.

1015
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,220
That's one pathway of metabolic syndrome starting at the fat cell.

1016
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,060
I think that's rare.

1017
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,960
There's a second metabolic syndrome.

1018
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,180
We see it in clinical depression.

1019
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,340
Clinical depression causes weight loss.

1020
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,720
You'd think that that would actually obviate metabolic syndrome.

1021
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,160
In fact, clinical depression increases metabolic syndrome.

1022
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,440
It decreases obesity, but it increases metabolic syndrome.

1023
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,760
When you do CT scans or MRIs across the abdomen of people with clinical depression, they have

1024
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,880
increased visceral fat.

1025
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,760
Why do they have increased visceral fat?

1026
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,120
Cortisol drives visceral fat accumulation.

1027
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,400
We know that from the Cushing syndrome patients.

1028
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,720
Glucocorticoids drive that.

1029
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:04,960
The question is, why are stressed people accumulating visceral fat, irrespective of their sub-Q

1030
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,960
fat?

1031
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:12,020
The answer is because the sympathetic nervous system normally, which is lipolytic, at least

1032
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:15,820
acutely, becomes lipogenic chronically.

1033
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:22,380
The reason is because of the co-factor that's released with the norepinephrine called neuropeptide

1034
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,380
Y.

1035
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:31,520
Neuropeptide Y actually changes what would be a lipolytic stimulus to a lipogenic stimulus.

1036
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,520
Chronic overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to visceral fat accumulation.

1037
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,200
Of course, chronic stress increases cortisol.

1038
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,760
The two together increase visceral fat.

1039
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,480
That visceral fat will make this out of time.

1040
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,120
Independent of subcutaneous fat.

1041
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:51,640
But also the cortisol and the sympathetic piece, the norepi piece, you're saying are

1042
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,220
both basically conspiring to be both pro-lipogenic?

1043
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,220
Yes, exactly.

1044
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,620
It's funny, I knew about the cortisol connection, didn't realize the norepi connection.

1045
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:07,220
So acutely, norepi will cause lipolysis through the beta-3 adrenergic receptor at the level

1046
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,700
of the adipocyte, but it causes lipogenesis when neuropeptide Y is available.

1047
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,060
Can neuropeptide Y be measured or is it too short-lived?

1048
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,900
Can you measure urinary metabolites of it?

1049
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,900
Not to my knowledge.

1050
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,920
I wear a continuous glucose monitor and everybody says to me, why the hell do you wear that

1051
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
thing?

1052
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
You're not diabetic.

1053
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,280
But I will tell you the insights I glean from this are remarkable.

1054
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,360
And now that I wear this thing called Borra Ring, so this thing's measuring heart rate

1055
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,360
variability.

1056
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,760
So every morning when I wake up, to me the most interesting thing I can look at is what

1057
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,320
was my glucose over the last eight hours and what was my heart rate and heart rate variability.

1058
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:46,000
And the interesting correlation I've noticed, which now maybe you've provided an explanation

1059
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,660
for, is when heart rate variability is lowest, we know that we are under-

1060
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,940
Which heart rate variability?

1061
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,220
Low frequency or high frequency?

1062
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:58,660
I'm looking at the RMSSD of the total signal.

1063
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:04,420
So the way that it's quantified here is, I don't know that it's specifying.

1064
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,420
It matters.

1065
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,420
Interesting.

1066
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,420
Well, let me tell you what I've noticed.

1067
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,140
Because high frequency heart variability is vagal.

1068
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:14,940
And low frequency is a bunch of things thrown on top of each other, barrel receptor, respiratory

1069
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,760
and sympathetic.

1070
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,440
So it's the low to high ratio that gives you the sympathovagal balance because you cancel

1071
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,920
out the other things.

1072
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,920
So taking your HRV and binning them into low and high frequency matters if the-

1073
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,080
Do you know what the frequency cutoff is?

1074
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,080
Point three.

1075
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,080
Okay.

1076
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,240
I'll look into this.

1077
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,240
This is interesting.

1078
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,240
Point three.

1079
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,200
Just looking at it at the level that it's reported, the lower the HRV, obviously the

1080
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,980
imputed or inferred higher sympathetic tone.

1081
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,340
Well, generally the higher the glucose level.

1082
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,340
I believe that.

1083
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,940
And I've always assumed it was just cortisol coming along for the ride.

1084
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,940
I never actually thought that-

1085
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,620
Well, cortisol does go up 5, 6, 7, 8 a.m.

1086
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,380
It's the diurnal variation.

1087
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,780
So maybe that's adding to-

1088
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,940
Well, my peak glucose was at 2 a.m. yesterday.

1089
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,900
My peak for 24 hours was at 2 a.m.

1090
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,980
Now I was sleeping in a hotel, having a shitty sleep.

1091
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,340
Who knows what I was stressed out about?

1092
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,160
I remember I had the weirdest dreams imaginable.

1093
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,280
But it's really interesting how much cortisol plays a role in this.

1094
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
I agree.

1095
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,740
Cortisol plays a major role in it.

1096
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:25,640
We know this from all the data from the Whitehall study in terms of stress that workers are

1097
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,920
under, et cetera.

1098
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,160
And shift workers really have problems with cortisol.

1099
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,760
So anyway, the point is you can have visceral fat, which releases cytokines and goes to

1100
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,760
the liver.

1101
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,760
So it can come from the sub-q fat.

1102
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,840
That would be obesity.

1103
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,580
And come from the visceral fat, that would be stress.

1104
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,600
And then there's a third way.

1105
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:49,920
And that is making the liver sick straight away, mainlining the toxin.

1106
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,520
That's called sugar.

1107
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,520
And what is the-

1108
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,720
And that's the one I think is the biggest problem.

1109
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,840
It's probably the one that's increasing the most for sure.

1110
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,320
What is the actual mechanism by which all of those things, which lead to things we know

1111
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
are bad, right?

1112
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:08,760
The homocysteine going up, the uric acid going up, the ALT going up, fat actually accumulating

1113
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,840
grossly.

1114
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:15,180
How does that translate to a peripheral problem that actually becomes the runway to diabetes?

1115
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:21,100
If you have liver dysfunction, which occurs due to those cytokines from either the sub-q

1116
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:29,740
fat or the visceral fat, or because you have primary hepatic dysfunction, as in NAFLD,

1117
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,880
what's going to happen is you're going to have increased hepatic glucose output because

1118
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,780
now you're insulin resistant at the level of the liver.

1119
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:42,320
So your liver can't inhibit the enzymes that cause gluconeogenesis.

1120
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:51,640
So the process of hepatic glucose output is because the insulin phosphorylates FOXO1,

1121
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:59,400
which is a forked protein that normally goes into the nucleus of the liver cell and transcribes

1122
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,440
the enzymes that are involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

1123
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,360
That's how you raise your serum glucose when insulin is unavailable.

1124
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,320
Insulin is supposed to suppress that by phosphorylating the FOXO1.

1125
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:20,640
If you're insulin resistant because there's liver fat or because of the cytokines coming

1126
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:26,040
in, now you can't phosphorylate FOXO1, you can't transduce that insulin signal, so now

1127
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:32,640
your hepatic glucose output goes up, which then increases your serum glucose, which then

1128
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,940
goes to your beta cell and causes- But then there's no off switch.

1129
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,280
There's no off switch, correct.

1130
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,080
And your beta cell then has to make extra insulin and it's making it fasting.

1131
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,560
It's not just making it in response to a meal, it's making it all the time.

1132
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,320
And insulin is both good and bad.

1133
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,380
It's good when it lowers your blood sugar.

1134
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,000
It's bad when it does everything else.

1135
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,640
Insulin's job is to store energy.

1136
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:05,140
It is not to keep your glucose normal, it is to store energy.

1137
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,640
It keeps your glucose normal as a function of storing energy.

1138
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,160
If you're storing energy, you're going to gain weight.

1139
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:19,560
In addition, insulin stimulates a different pathway in cells, that is the proliferation

1140
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,720
pathway.

1141
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,420
It's called mapkinase and ERK.

1142
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:29,520
This pathway is responsible for vascular smooth muscle proliferation, coronary artery vascular

1143
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:36,600
smooth muscle proliferation, thereby making your coronaries tighter and less likely to

1144
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:42,240
be able to vasodilate when they need to, thus increasing risk for heart attack.

1145
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,560
It also causes cell division because insulin is a mitogen.

1146
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,320
It causes cells to divide.

1147
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:54,060
Well, if it causes your breast cell to divide, you might end up with breast cancer.

1148
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:59,080
And so hyperinsulinemia is associated with all of the chronic metabolic diseases we know

1149
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:06,160
about because of this second phenomenon that insulin does, not just lowering glucose, which

1150
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,200
it does as a sidelight of storing energy, but in fact, because it causes both inflammation

1151
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,200
and cell division.

1152
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,160
My hope is that as time goes on, more and more physicians will realize that hyperinsulinemia

1153
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,120
per se, independent of what's happening at the level of glucose.

1154
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,640
In other words, you have a patient with a quote unquote normal hemoglobin A1C, but they're

1155
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,920
hyperinsulinemia, that that is taken as seriously as we would take diabetes.

1156
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Absolutely.

1157
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,520
And this is one of the reasons why if you look at all of the diabetes studies that are

1158
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:45,120
out there in terms of diabetes control, they all improve hemoglobin A1C and the patient

1159
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,120
dies anyway.

1160
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:56,800
The UKPDS, the Accord study, and several others all show that you can lower blood glucose,

1161
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:06,840
you can reduce microvascular complications, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy,

1162
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,580
all small vessel complications by lowering the glucose.

1163
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:15,780
But what you do is you exacerbate the large vessel complications like coronary heart

1164
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:20,940
disease or cancer, and you end up dying just the same.

1165
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:26,220
So getting your blood glucose down is only half the job in diabetes.

1166
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:30,300
Getting your blood insulin down is the other half.

1167
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,300
And taking drugs that increase your insulin ain't the way.

1168
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,460
Yeah, it's a backwards way to go about that.

1169
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,060
The object is to increase your insulin sensitivity.

1170
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:48,000
And the only way to do that is by diet, not even by exercise alone.

1171
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,180
You can't outrun a bad diet.

1172
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:55,500
You have to fix the insulin problem and exercise won't fix the insulin problem by itself.

1173
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,060
It seems to me that a large part of this now becomes a policy issue, which I know you went

1174
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,100
back to graduate school.

1175
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,100
Law school.

1176
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,900
Yeah, about what, six years ago?

1177
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
Five years ago, yeah.

1178
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,940
And I know that even though you've quote unquote retired from your clinical practice, that's

1179
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,500
simply given you more time to focus on these other issues.

1180
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,500
Yeah.

1181
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,860
In fact, it's one of the reasons I retired.

1182
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:20,740
I realized, oh, about seven, eight years ago that I could actually take care of a million

1183
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,800
kids easier than I could take care of one.

1184
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,860
And so I'm devoting my time now to research.

1185
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:34,260
We have a study now that is ultimately, if all goes well, and so far it is, we'll put

1186
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:40,660
the final nail in the coffin on a calorie is not a calorie and we'll basically prevent

1187
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,420
the food industry from ever saying it again.

1188
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,420
That's my goal.

1189
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:48,580
And currently the food industry says, I mean, I haven't really paid much attention to this

1190
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,100
to be honest with you in the last few years, but is the food industry basically still saying

1191
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:57,980
that while a can of Coke is not ever deemed even by Coca-Cola to be as nutritious as a

1192
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:04,740
carrot in the end, are they basically saying that all calories contribute equally to adiposity

1193
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,900
and insulin resistance?

1194
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Yes.

1195
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,500
They are all saying it's about obesity and therefore it's about energy balance.

1196
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,340
Therefore it's about calories.

1197
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,540
Therefore all calories are the same.

1198
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,540
That's what they say.

1199
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,100
It is absolutely not true.

1200
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,440
And we have all the reasons in the world to show why it's not true.

1201
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:27,140
We have empiric data, we have mechanistic data, we have plausibility data, we have hard

1202
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,500
data that show that is just not the case.

1203
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,460
And if you want, I'll give you examples of it.

1204
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,580
All right, let's start.

1205
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,580
Let's talk about fiber.

1206
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,820
You eat 160 calories in almonds.

1207
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:40,820
How many do you absorb?

1208
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,820
Two thirds.

1209
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,820
130.

1210
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,820
Yeah, I mean 75%.

1211
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,820
Okay.

1212
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,180
Well, what happened to the other 30?

1213
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,180
Presumably it's going to drag some stuff out in your colon.

1214
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:55,820
Well no, what happens is the soluble and insoluble fiber in the almonds forms a gel on the inside

1215
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,820
of the intestine.

1216
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,540
You can actually see it on an electron microscopy, a whitish gel.

1217
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:05,780
That's going to act as a secondary barrier preventing absorption of some of those almond

1218
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:06,980
calories early on.

1219
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:10,980
Well, if they don't get absorbed in the duodenum, where do they go next?

1220
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:11,980
Gejunum.

1221
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:12,980
Gejunum.

1222
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,060
Well, what's in the gejunum that's not in the duodenum?

1223
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,060
The microbiome.

1224
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,060
Yeah.

1225
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,820
The duodenum is essentially sterile.

1226
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,260
It's got a pH of one.

1227
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,940
Only H. pylori can live there.

1228
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,980
You have to get the bicarbonate.

1229
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,940
You're saying that that lining is formed in the duodenum?

1230
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,540
Duodenum, yeah.

1231
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,540
Exactly.

1232
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:36,420
To prevent your liver from getting the whole dose because anything that's absorbed in the

1233
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,820
duodenum goes straight to the liver.

1234
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,740
So how much fiber is in an apple?

1235
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,740
A lot.

1236
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,980
I mean, I can't give you a bunch.

1237
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,340
But I'm just directionally, I'm making this number up.

1238
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,820
But let's say there's how many grams of fructose in an apple?

1239
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,820
20?

1240
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:53,260
There's 30 calories in a standard apple, half of which would be fructose of 15.

1241
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,260
That seems low.

1242
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,260
An apple?

1243
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,260
Like a small apple?

1244
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,100
Well, I mean, not a big mother apple, but like an apple apple.

1245
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,380
So based on that, you're saying only half the fructose that you would eat in a piece

1246
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,340
of fruit might actually get to the liver?

1247
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,620
Yeah, or less.

1248
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,740
Most of it's going to end up in the duodenum.

1249
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:12,420
And once it goes to the duodenum, it's a free for all.

1250
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,460
Do you absorb it or do the bacteria digest it and metabolize it for their own use?

1251
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,980
Remember, you have 10 trillion cells in your body, but you have 100 trillion bacteria in

1252
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,220
your intestine.

1253
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,980
Every one of us is just a big bag of bacteria with legs.

1254
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,440
Those bacteria have to survive.

1255
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,980
If the fructose gets absorbed at the level of the duodenum, in other words, if the gut

1256
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,700
outcompetes the bacteria, can it still get back to the liver?

1257
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,700
Oh, yeah.

1258
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,700
Yeah.

1259
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:40,660
But the area under the curve will be wider, which means the insulin response will be lower,

1260
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,800
which is what you want because it took longer.

1261
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,180
But a lot of it won't get absorbed.

1262
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,180
It'll be digested.

1263
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,580
It doesn't come out in the stool.

1264
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,460
It gets digested by the gut bacteria who use it for their own purposes.

1265
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:57,980
Now, here's the thing that I only learned about a month and a half ago, which is absolutely

1266
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,380
essential.

1267
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:05,820
If you don't consume fiber, that means that your gut bacteria are not getting the food

1268
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,300
they need because you're absorbing it all early.

1269
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,460
Well, they still have to survive.

1270
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,300
So what do they do?

1271
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,140
They proteolyse and lipolyse the mucin layer.

1272
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,140
So auto digest.

1273
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:23,060
They auto digest the mucin layer that sits on the surface of your intestinal epithelial

1274
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,740
cells, protecting them.

1275
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:31,380
And you can actually see on electron microscopy an increased opposition of the bacteria with

1276
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:40,580
the intestinal epithelial cell, which likely causes damage, possibly leaky gut and possibly

1277
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:45,300
GI disease like colitis and even maybe Crohn's.

1278
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:52,060
So the idea is to feed your bacteria or your bacteria will digest you.

1279
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:56,460
And what sources of fiber do you think, I mean, people talk about using psyllium husk

1280
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,340
and all these other things to sort of augment fiber.

1281
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,100
Do you think that's necessary or do you think you can get enough of it just from?

1282
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,820
Well, so psyllium is soluble fiber.

1283
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,500
It's not insoluble fiber.

1284
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,380
You need both.

1285
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:14,840
Fiber has soluble, insoluble like pectin, like what holds jelly together.

1286
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,360
Insoluble fiber like cellulose, you know, string stuff in celery.

1287
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,440
You need both to make that gel.

1288
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,240
So the insoluble fiber forms the lattice work like the net.

1289
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,960
Let's say you put a layer of petroleum jelly on a strainer.

1290
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,240
You would have an impenetrable water barrier, right?

1291
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,240
Yeah.

1292
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,480
So the insoluble is like the strainer and the soluble becomes the thing that fills in

1293
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,480
the lattice.

1294
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,480
That's right.

1295
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,480
Exactly.

1296
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,480
So when you have both, it works.

1297
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:44,360
And there's data that shows that if you have either one or the other, doesn't work.

1298
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,360
You need both.

1299
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,880
Well, you get both in real food.

1300
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,480
And this is why the food industry keeps adding soluble fiber like psyllium husk to food like

1301
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,840
fiber one bars doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

1302
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:02,120
They have insoluble fiber in things like certain breakfast cereals.

1303
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,640
But if you don't have the soluble fiber, also doesn't work.

1304
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,920
You need both.

1305
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,880
Real food has both.

1306
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,660
The point is to the fiber fortified stuff is the easy way to do it is to add soluble

1307
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,660
fiber.

1308
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,660
That doesn't work.

1309
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,380
That's what the food industry keeps doing and keeps telling us that it's good because

1310
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,100
it's got extra fiber.

1311
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,100
Wrong.

1312
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,140
It doesn't have functional fiber.

1313
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,500
Doesn't have the fiber that does what you want it to do.

1314
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,860
That's the reason a calorie is not a calorie all by itself.

1315
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,620
I know that you've got to go soon.

1316
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,100
Otherwise we could do this for another two hours.

1317
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:33,580
But I do want to ask you one sort of final question or final thought on something, which

1318
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:38,060
is I looked into this a few years ago and maybe the numbers have changed, but directionally

1319
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,060
I think this is still correct.

1320
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:45,360
There were something like nine companies that controlled basically all of CPG, consumer

1321
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,360
packaged goods.

1322
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
Ten.

1323
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,360
There's ten.

1324
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,360
Ten.

1325
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Okay.

1326
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,360
Ten control 90% of the food.

1327
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,360
Yeah.

1328
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,820
That's basically my calculation was ten of them controlled 85% of the calories that people

1329
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:54,820
consume.

1330
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,820
Yep.

1331
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:56,820
You face a very uphill battle.

1332
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:57,820
Indeed.

1333
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:02,660
Because you're trying to get them to change the way they do business, but they answer

1334
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,620
to shareholders, not to you.

1335
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:09,420
And the way they're doing things right now is working out reasonably for their shareholders.

1336
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,420
Not great.

1337
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:15,660
These aren't the most high performing companies in the world, but how in the world when such

1338
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:21,020
a small group of companies control so much and going back to what you said earlier, you're

1339
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:26,140
asking parents to double their food budget, to feed their kids correctly and spend twice

1340
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,140
the time doing it.

1341
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,140
Right.

1342
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,140
What does this look like in ten years?

1343
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,140
How does this story end?

1344
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,140
Well, I don't know how it ends.

1345
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,300
This is a battle royal like tobacco was.

1346
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,640
And it took a long time to win that.

1347
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,000
And there are people who say we haven't even won that one yet.

1348
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,880
You know, e-cigarettes now come, but we're having another proposition here in San Francisco

1349
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,040
tomorrow about tobacco to kids.

1350
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,040
Here's the deal.

1351
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,080
The food system needs to change.

1352
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:55,840
They're not going to change it from the inside because right now sugar is their business

1353
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,120
model.

1354
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,040
It's the thing that increases their sales.

1355
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:07,280
When high fructose corn syrup and the dietary guidelines of 1977 were first available,

1356
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:13,040
the profit margin of the food industry went from 1% per year to 5% per year.

1357
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,040
This is their juggernaut.

1358
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,840
This is their gravy train.

1359
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,040
They add more sugar, they sell more food and they know it.

1360
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,200
And that's why there's sugar in all the food because when they add it, you buy more for

1361
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,780
all the reasons we've discussed.

1362
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:31,300
They have to change the food, which means they have to change the business model.

1363
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,260
So how do you change the business model?

1364
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,040
Well there are four potential ways to change the business model.

1365
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:43,940
One is educate the public so that they don't want that food, in which case then they won't

1366
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:44,940
sell it.

1367
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,940
We're trying to do that.

1368
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:51,020
That's one reason I am the chief science officer of a nonprofit trying to do just that.

1369
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,020
Okay.

1370
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,580
Called Eat Real.

1371
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:57,340
Real is an acronym, Responsible Epicurean and Agricultural Leadership.

1372
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:02,620
We are trying to change the food system by praising the good and hoping that that will

1373
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:09,340
induce competition amongst restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals, schools to procure, market and

1374
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:13,020
sell real food.

1375
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:23,180
Or you can have executive branch efforts like the FDA or the USDA, but not in this administration,

1376
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,860
if anything they've rolled back opportunities for that like the nutrition facts label.

1377
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:33,420
Or you can have Congress legislate specific changes.

1378
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,260
They're not doing that because they're all paid off from the American Legislative Exchange

1379
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:43,560
Council and other concerns like the Koch brothers, what have you.

1380
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,580
Or you can have judicial impact.

1381
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:51,660
And so there are lawsuits against the food industry going on as we speak in an attempt

1382
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:57,700
to try to, shall we say, regulate from the bench, which no one thinks is optimal, but

1383
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,580
seems to be the only thing that's available at the moment, aside from education.

1384
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:06,380
So those are the four ways to do this.

1385
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:11,220
My goal would be to get rid of food subsidies.

1386
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:16,300
Are the food subsidies what enable the junk food to be basically half the price of real

1387
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,800
food or is it that the real food is twice as much to make?

1388
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,100
Not independent of the subsidy.

1389
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,740
It's about the subsidy making junk food cheap.

1390
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:28,700
If you got rid of the subsidies, then the market would work.

1391
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:33,660
Right now, any subsidy distorts the market and there's no reason for food subsidies.

1392
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:37,260
In fact, there's no economist worth their salt today that believe in food subsidies

1393
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,260
because they distort the market.

1394
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:45,020
So the question is, would food get more expensive if we got rid of all food subsidies?

1395
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:51,060
The Giniini Foundation at UC Berkeley engaged in this exercise several years ago and they

1396
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,500
computed what would happen to the price of food.

1397
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,260
And it turned out that the price of food wouldn't change except for two items.

1398
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:00,020
Corn and sugar would go up.

1399
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:05,220
But how would that not impact the cost of all other foods, given how ubiquitous they are?

1400
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:11,020
It's a complex modeling and I'm not an expert in how they arrived at this.

1401
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:16,740
But empirically, this is what fell out of it, is that the price of wheat wouldn't change,

1402
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,980
the price of soy wouldn't change.

1403
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,060
Only corn and sugar.

1404
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:25,820
And that is where the dietary sugar in our food comes from.

1405
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:30,820
So I think that that would be a really smart way to start.

1406
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:36,380
The Farm Bill is re-apportioned every five years.

1407
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,220
And right now, there's actually tension around that Farm Bill.

1408
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,620
It has to do with other things.

1409
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:48,860
But I would like to see the issue of the metabolic cost of food built into the Farm

1410
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,860
Bill.

1411
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:57,020
Because right now, our government has not linked or yoked the productivity and economic

1412
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:01,820
costs of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security with food.

1413
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:06,100
I would like to see that link strengthened because we have the data.

1414
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,500
Is there anything right now that you consider a victory?

1415
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,140
Because when you look at the smoking story, you had Surgeon General's report first, you

1416
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:18,900
had changes in advertising next, you had excise taxes and then ultimately environmental changes.

1417
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,940
We have excise taxes for soda.

1418
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,820
Do you have any advertising rule changes yet?

1419
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:31,180
Well, here in San Francisco, we have a warning label on billboards that is right now, there's

1420
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,020
a temporary injunction about because the food industry-

1421
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,580
But the smoking one was interesting.

1422
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:40,380
I didn't know this until a few years ago, but basically a law came out that said anytime

1423
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:46,060
a tobacco commercial was on TV, it had to be followed by an anti-tobacco commercial.

1424
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,060
It turned out-

1425
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,060
The fairness doctrine.

1426
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,500
Yeah, it turned out the anti-tobacco commercials were so popular and so effective that tobacco

1427
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,380
voluntarily withdrew from television.

1428
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,860
Is there anything around creating that type of awareness?

1429
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:00,860
No.

1430
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,900
What there is, is the question of marketing to children.

1431
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:11,580
The thing is that many of the conglomerates have said they voluntarily will not market

1432
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:18,100
to children, at least during certain times of the day when kids are more likely to watch.

1433
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:24,220
But in fact, watchdogs have been looking at this and they say that it's lip service, that

1434
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,340
they're not actually doing it.

1435
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:30,660
You cannot expect the food industry to police itself.

1436
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:31,820
I hate to end on this note.

1437
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,900
I know you have to go.

1438
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,580
I want to respect your time.

1439
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,340
I hope we can come back and do this again and talk in more detail.

1440
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:44,780
Peter, there are a few people that I don't just make myself available for, but that I

1441
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,380
