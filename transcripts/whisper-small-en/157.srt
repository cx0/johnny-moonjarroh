00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,980
Are you ready for another AMA? I am. I see the agenda and I'm going to share my concern

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:27,040
up front, which is I think it's a little ambitious. We're going to attempt to cover two topics,

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,920
typically each of which I think is their own AMA. So if by the time we get through

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,160
this, it's so big that it is two AMAs, the person listening will say, what were they

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,880
talking about? They just covered one topic. So as it stands at this moment, we're going

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,060
to attempt to get through both everything that has to do with fat oxidation and fat

8
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,680
flux and all these things you're going to explain in a second. And we're even going

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,160
to try to tackle the entire topic of nicotine. So let's see if we can do it.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,760
I feel like ambitious is the right word, but yeah, let's give it a shot. So the first topic

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,740
is fat flux. And I think a lot of questions come in about this and there's a few variations

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,800
on a theme. So I'll just I'll summarize a few of these questions for you. The first

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,280
question is why does an oxidation of fat necessarily mean you're losing total body

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,680
fat? If I eat a low carb diet and become a quote fat burning machine, end quote, why

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,920
don't I always lose fat on this diet? Another way of saying this too is the question is

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,880
if I'm in ketosis, doesn't it mean I'm burning fat? And just for the record, this is this

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:51,160
question came in from ketogenic man inside joke. So look, we get this question in one

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,320
form or another constantly. So I think that's why we decided to just dedicate an entire

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,160
segment to this because it's super important and it is it's confusing. Right. So just to

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,600
be clear, let's just get the punchline out of the way first. You can absolutely be in

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:19,040
ketosis and gain weight. You can absolutely be quote unquote fat burning machine and still

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,040
accumulate fat. Let's go one step further and accept the fact that we're going to use

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,440
a bit of shorthand here, which is gaining weight and gaining fat. We're going to talk

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,040
about interchangeably. Is that fair? Because I mean, when people say I want to lose weight,

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,560
what they really mean is I want to lose fat. I mean, when people say I want to gain weight,

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,600
they usually mean I want to gain muscle. So if we can simplify this a little bit and say that

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:56,120
people rarely want to lose muscle and gain fat, I think it helps to think about this kind of like

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:04,440
an engineering problem, which is always dangerous in biology because engineering is frankly cleaner

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,920
and neater than biology. But I do think that we can simplify this problem without rendering

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,640
our simplification unhelpful and in doing so really start to understand the ins and outs of this. So

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,480
if we take the example you gave Bob, which is a person who says, hey, you know, I want to lose

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,960
excess body fat and the approach I'm taking is a ketogenic diet or some form of low carbohydrate

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,800
diet, does it guarantee that I'm going to lose weight? Well, again, let's break it down. We already

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,160
said the first thing is losing weight means losing fat. And now let's break that down one step

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,840
further. How do you lose fat? So broadly speaking, there would be two approaches to this. One would

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,840
be to reduce the total number of fat cells. Another way would be to shrink the fat cells. Now,

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,360
the former is most typically something that is done with liposuction. So that's really the way

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,520
we lose fat cells is you cut a whole bunch of them out. By the way, there were some interesting

39
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,880
studies that were done a little over a decade ago, one published in the New England Journal of

40
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,080
Medicine that demonstrated that there was a totally different metabolic effect of those two

41
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,440
approaches. So I don't remember the details of it. But basically, one group lost a significant amount

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:32,520
of total body fat having the fat cut out. The other group lost it by, you know, a dietary

43
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,240
intervention that took the same amount of fat off. So at the end, they both had the same body

44
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,720
composition directionally, but one had done it through reducing the number of fat cells, one had

45
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,600
done it by shrinking the fat cells. Can you guess if there was a difference between them, Bob?

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,680
I think there might be, although I'm tipped off because I think it was a New England Journal of

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,880
Medicine paper. It was. Yeah, it was one of the authors. That's right. And yeah, there's a profound

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,360
difference. So we should never confuse the metabolic benefits that come from reducing the

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,760
size of adipose tissue with reducing the amount of it. The former, in the case of liposuction,

50
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,680
is really a cosmetic procedure, whereas the latter, of course, is has cosmetic benefits,

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,080
but much more importantly, is a metabolic improvement. Okay. So if you accept everything

52
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I just said, then we can simplify this problem into how do you shrink a fat cell? Is that fair?

53
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:34,280
I think so. All right. So now let's understand the fat cell. And again, let's go back to how an

54
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,640
engineer would think about this. An engineer would think about this by drawing a boundary

55
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,720
around this and looking at the boundary conditions and effectively understanding what goes in and

56
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,760
what comes out. Mass cannot be created from nothing and mass cannot disintegrate into nothing.

57
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,160
So if a fat cell gets larger, there is a net accumulation of fat in that cell relative to how

58
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,720
much goes out of it. And the converse is true. So again, silly example, but if you have a room

59
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,320
and the room has a hundred people in it and there were people traveling in and out of the room

60
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,600
constantly, if you want to understand if that room is increasing or decreasing in the number of people

61
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,080
in it, you need to understand at every point for which there's an entry or exit, what is happening.

62
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:31,000
And by doing that, you can understand what is the net increase or decrease. And I like to refer to

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,200
that as flux. And I won't get into why that's not a technical, technically that's not a perfect

64
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,560
definition of flux, but it's sort of the way my brain works is to sort of borrow that term from

65
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,600
physics and basically say, look, we're going to talk about this through the lens of fat flux. What

66
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,800
is the flux of fatty acid substrate into and out of a fat cell? And can we infer the behavior of that

67
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,160
fat cell in response to that? So I guess before I go on, Bob, I just want to make sure, does that

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,120
seem like anything you want to add to that or does that seem like a reasonable way to go after this?

69
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,640
I think that makes sense. A couple of things. So you alluded to it that when we talk about weight

70
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,560
loss or weight gain or fat loss or fat gain, a lot of times we'll hear about calories in, calories

71
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,320
out, right? They amount of basically if more energy is entering the system than leaving it,

72
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,720
the system is getting bigger and vice versa. If more energy is leaving the system than entering

73
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,760
it, it's more or less getting smaller. And what you're talking about is at the level of the adipose

74
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,160
tissue. So we're talking about how much fat is going into the adipose tissue and how much is

75
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,680
being released and also how much is being trapped we'll get to. I think that's important. And the

76
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,760
second thing too is I'm glad that you use the word flux because you have an amazing, I don't know if

77
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,960
you mentioned it, but you have an amazing blog post on this topic, which is the lessons of fat

78
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:02,080
flux. And when we move your blog posts over to peteratiamd.com and I was privileged to adding

79
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,200
the header images to the blog posts. And in this case, I took the liberty of since you used the

80
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,800
word flux, I have a picture of the flux capacitor in the DeLorean, which I'm sure you know that it's

81
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,640
what makes time travel possible. We could cover that in another episode. It's also an important

82
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,080
concept, but those are a couple of things that I would add.

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,920
If we didn't understand fat flux, there would be no flux capacitor. And I mean, Marty might still

84
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,960
actually be in the future in the past. I don't even recall.

85
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,880
Okay. It depends on which one you're watching.

86
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:41,200
It depends on which version. There you go. Okay. So let's start this discussion with a more

87
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:50,360
technical look at what I'm talking about. And then I'm going to simplify this. So Bob, I think you

88
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:58,000
have a great figure of what's actually called white adipose tissue or WAT. And I'll explain

89
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,760
what that is in a moment. But if you don't mind, can you just pull it up and share your screen so

90
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:12,160
that I can see it and everybody viewing this can also see it. Yes, it is up. Okay. So what going on

91
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,120
in this diagram? First, let's start by why this is called white adipose tissue. So tissue makes

92
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,120
sense adipose fat, but why white? Well, white is to contrast it from brown. So when you're talking

93
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,840
about fat, you always want to differentiate between WAT and BAT. At some point, we will

94
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:37,760
undoubtedly do a lengthy discussion on BAT. BAT is very interesting. It is a form of adipose tissue

95
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,360
that is not as prevalent as WAT, but it has really unique metabolic properties, namely a higher

96
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,520
concentration of mitochondria and therefore a much greater metabolic activity. Bob, you and I

97
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,720
have spent a ton of time doing our own research on BAT as it pertains to cold adaptation and a

98
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,120
whole bunch of other things around that. So let's back burner that, but I think it's worth coming

99
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
back to in another episode. So what we're focusing on is what most people think of when they think

100
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,960
of fat, which is, you know, and again, if anyone's ever watched surgery on TV or something like that,

101
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,680
and, you know, or had a lipoma yanked out of their arm, you can see it's a glistening yellow,

102
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:27,000
relatively acellular structure. And if you look at under a microscope, it looks surprisingly simple.

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So even though, as we now know, white adipose tissue is an endocrine organ, right? It is way

104
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,280
more complicated than it looks under a microscope. Under a light microscope, it looks like a bunch

105
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:48,000
of nothing. So what you see here, if you look closely, is two sides, right? You have an inside,

106
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,120
and I don't mean inside, I mean an inside, like a going into it side, and you have an outside.

107
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,560
And again, I don't mean an outside, I mean a going outside. So on the left hand side of this drawing,

108
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,640
and by the way, if you're listening to this on audio, I would encourage you to, you know,

109
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,640
sort of watch it on video or a minimum, maybe hit pause and now go and look at the show notes

110
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,920
where you'll see this diagram. But on the left hand side of this page, you could largely think

111
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,920
of this as having two doors, okay? So the upper left door and the lower left door are two ways

112
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,600
that the fat cell gets fatter. And on the right hand side of this page, you have the exit door.

113
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,000
This is how the fat cell gets skinnier. So let's talk about each of these doors.

114
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,320
